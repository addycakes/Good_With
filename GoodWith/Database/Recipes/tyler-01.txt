  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  green cabbage -- shredded
     1/2          head  red cabbage -- shredded
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/2           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  chile paste
  3        tablespoons  creamy peanut butter
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
  2                     carrots -- shredded
  1                cup  bean sprouts
  4                     scallions -- julienned on bias
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- for garnish

Toss the cabbage together in a large colander and set in the sink.  Sprinkle the cabbage with salt and let stand for 15 minutes.  The salt draws out some of its moisture so that the slaw remains crunchy.

In a bowl, whisk together the vinegar, soy sauce, oil, chile paste, peanut butter, and ginger.  Toss together with the cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts and scallions; season with salt and pepper.  Garnish with sesame seeds before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  12                    fresh whole sage leaves
  2             slices  prosciutto -- julienned
  1                     shallot -- sliced in rings
  1             bottle  pinot noir - (750 ml)
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12                    red baby beets -- trimmed
  1                     goat cheese log - (4 to 6 oz)
  6             ounces  pistachios -- crushed
  1               head  frisee -- torn bite size
  1              bunch  watercress -- stems discarded
                        Beet greens -- from trimmings
     1/4           cup  olive oil

Coat a small saucepan with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and place over medium heat.  Fry the sage until the leaves crisp up, about 2 minutes.  Gently remove to a paper towel.  Then, fry the prosciutto until crispy and remove with a slotted spoon.

Coat the saucepan with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Add the shallot and saute for 2 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with wine and balsamic vinegar, cook down about 3 minutes.  Add the sugar, salt, and pepper.  Set the beets in the poaching liquid and cook until tender, about 20 minutes.  Set beets aside to cool and reserve the poaching liquid.  When cool enough to handle, rub off the beet skins with paper towel.  Set aside to cool to room temperature.

With a hot knife, cut the goat cheese log into 4 equal wheels.  Lay the crushed pistachios on a flat surface and gently press the cheese into the nuts to coat all sides.

Arrange a handful of frisee, watercress and beet greens on each plate.  Lay the beets and goat cheese slices on top.  Top with fried sage and crispy prosciutto.  Whisk the cooled poaching liquid with olive oil; season with salt and pepper.  Drizzle the vinaigrette over each salad and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Combine the sugar and cornstarch in a 3-quart saucepan and place over medium heat.  Gradually stir in the milk and cook until mixture thickens, about 7 to 8 minutes.  Be careful not to cook for too long.  Cornstarch loses its thickening ability if it is cooked for too long.

Remove pan from heat and whisk in the extract, salt and egg yolks until smooth.  Place the pan back over heat, bring back to a simmer and stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, cook for 1 more minute.  Be sure wooden spoon touches the bottom of the pan when stirring.  Remove from heat; stir in butter.

Slice 2 bananas and line the bottom of the prebaked pie shell with 1/2 the slices.  Spoon 1/2 the filling on top, smooth with a spatula.  Lay down another layer of banana slices, followed by remaining filling. Chill for at least 3 hours.

Top with Chantilly Cream, then decorate with remaining banana, sliced.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     veal shank
  2                     veal knuckle bones
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  5        tablespoons  tomato paste -- divided
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     onion -- cut in half
  1                     garlic bulb -- cut in half
  2                     celery ribs -- cut in chunks
  2                     carrots -- cut in chunks
  1              bunch  fresh thyme
  1             bottle  dry red wine
  1              quart  water
  1              quart  beef broth -- low sodium
  1                     bouquet garni
                        = (thyme, parsley, bay leaves,
                        peppercorns)

Place the veal shank and knucklebones in a roasting pan, season with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil.  Roast in a preheated 350 degree oven for 45 minutes.  When the veal pieces are brown, brush them with 3 tablespoons of tomato paste and season again.  Raise the oven temperature to 450 degrees and return the pan to the oven for 15 more minutes.

Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium heat.  Saute the mirepoix vegetables and thyme in the butter to coat then stir in the remaining tomato paste and continue cooking until the vegetables are caramelized.  Pour in the red wine to deglaze, stir.

Transfer the browned bones to the stockpot.  Whisk in the water and broth.  Add the bouquet garni and bring the sauce to a boil.  Simmer gently for about 3 hours, skimming periodically.  Strain the sauce through cheesecloth or a chinois to remove the bones and vegetable solids.  Continue to cook for 1 hour more, skimming any foam that rises to the top, until the sauce is reduced to 2 cups and nicely thickened.  Taste for strength and seasoning.  May whisk in a pat of softened butter to finish the sauce.

Serve with meats or poultry.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     purple potatoes
  8               ears  corn
  8                     lobster tails
  16                    lobster claws
  2                     kielbasa -- split, and
                        cut in 8 pieces
  8              dozen  hard-shell clams
                        = (such as cherrystone or littleneck)
  2              whole  flounders -- wrapped in aluminum
                        foil with thyme, oil, and lemon slices
  8              dozen  oysters

Dig a shallow pit in the sand and line with large stones.  Gather driftwood from the beach and pile on top of the coals.  Create a bonfire by burning the wood for 1 to 2 hours until the rocks are red hot.  Rake off the ashes.  Set 1 cinder block on each corner of the pit to form the base.  Lay a barbecue grate (or a piece of steel) on top to make a table.  Gather seaweed from the beach and place a thick layer on the metal.

Place the potatoes and corn on the rack, then cover with a thin layer of seaweed.  Mound the lobster tails, claws and kielbasa evenly on top, then cover with another thin layer of seaweed.  Set the clams and flounder on top and cover with another layer of seaweed.  Finally, set the oysters on top, then cover with a thick layer of seaweed.  The juice from the seafood will drip down and flavor the corn and potatoes.  Cover the entire bake with burlap or a tarp soaked in seawater.  The tarp traps in the seaweed steam and bakes the food.  Keep the tarp wet by pouring seawater over the top if needed.  Cook until the clams open and the lobster is bright red, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

This recipe yields 8 to 12 servings.

     1/4           cup  chopped fresh tarragon
  2                     shallots -- minced
     1/4           cup  champagne vinegar

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Favorite waffle mix
                        === BLUEBERRY SYRUP ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1               pint  blueberries
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
  1                cup  heavy cream -- chilled
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  natural vanilla extract

In a large mixing bowl, prepare your favorite waffle mix according to package directions.

Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's guidelines.  Lightly spray the waffle iron with nonstick spray.  Using a 4-ounce ladle or 1/2 cup measure, ladle batter for waffle into the iron, spreading evenly.  Close the waffle iron and cook for 2 minutes or until waffles are golden and the steaming stops.  Repeat with remaining batter.  Serve with Whipped Cream and Blueberry Syrup.

Blueberry Syrup:  In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, blueberries, sugar and lemon.  Stir gently until the berries break down and release their natural juice.  The consistency should remain a bit chunky.  Serve hot over waffles.

Whipped Cream:  Using a hand-held electric beater on high speed, beat the cream in a chilled stainless steel bowl until it begins to thicken.

Add sugar and vanilla.  Continue to beat until the cream forms stiff peaks.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
     3/4           cup  buttermilk

In a mixing bowl, combine dry ingredients together with a fork.  Cut in the shortening using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Make a well in the center and add buttermilk.  Quickly fold dry ingredients into buttermilk with your hands until a sticky dough forms.

Turn dough out onto floured surface.  Gently fold the dough over itself 3 or 4 times to create layers.  Roll dough out to 3/4-inch thick.  Cut with a 3-inch biscuit cutter.  Transfer dough rounds to a sheet pan.  Gather scraps and repeat.  Make a dimple in the center to help the top rise evenly.  Brush with butter.  Bake for 15 minutes in a preheated 400 degree oven until golden brown.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 biscuits.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             gallon  water
  3                     fresh thyme sprigs
  6                     fresh flat-leaf parsley sprigs
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     lemon
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
     1/4           cup  sea salt
  4                     lobsters - (2 lbs ea)
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- softened

To make a court-bouillon:  Pour 1 gallon of water into a 16-quart stock pot over medium heat.  Tie the thyme, parsley and bay leaves together with kitchen string to make a bouquet garni.  Place the herb bundle in the stock pot and secure the end of the string to the pot handle for easy removal.  Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice into the water, then drop in the lemons.  Add wine, peppercorns and sea salt.  Bring to a rolling boil.

Cut off the rubber bands that secure the lobster claws.  Place live lobsters in the freezer for 15 minutes to disable movement.  Plunge lobsters head first into the stock pot, cover, and boil for 15 minutes.  The lobster shells will be red and the tails will curl up when done.  Remove lobsters from boiling liquid with tongs.

In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Bring to a boil until the milk solids have separated and sunk to the bottom of the pan.  Ladle out the clarified butter and place in a warm cup until the lobster is done.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     ripe Bosc pears
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1             bottle  Merlot - (750 ml)
  1                     vanilla bean -- split
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        === SERVING SUGGESTIONS ===
                        Gorgonzola
                        Candied Walnuts

Peel pears, leaving stems intact, and cut a thin slice from bottom of each if necessary to enable pears to stand upright when served.  Set aside.

Put sugar in a 3-quart heavy saucepan and melt over moderate heat until it begins to caramelize.  Continue to cook, keeping a close eye and the sugar constantly circulating.  Cook until the sugar is a deep golden caramel.  Stir in the butter carefully, as the mixture may bubble up.  Simmer and stir until caramel sauce has developed, about 5 minutes.  Pour in wine and scrape in the seeds from the vanilla bean.

Carefully arrange pears in the poaching liquid.  They should be completely covered by the liquid, add water if they are not.  Simmer pears, turning them occasionally, until tender, about 20 minutes.

Test by inserting a knife into the fattest part of the pear, it should come out with no resistance.  Finish off with lemon juice to wake up the flavor.  Gently remove the pears to a serving dish, cut-side down.  Pour the wine syrup over the pears.  Serve with Gorgonzola and candied walnuts.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/4           cup  fumet
  5                     garlic cloves
  1              pinch  saffron
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CROUTONS ===
  18                    baguette slices, abt 3/8" thk ea
     1/2           cup  virgin olive oil

Cut the cleaned fish fillets into medium-sized pieces.  In a large non-reactive bowl, whisk together the marinade ingredients.  Add the pieces of fish and whole shrimp so that all the seafood is coated with the mixture.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.

For the Stock/Fumet:  In a large stockpot over low-medium flame, heat the oil and butter.  Saute the leek, onion, garlic, and fennel for 5 minutes until tender.  Deglaze with Pernod, cooking for 5 minutes to allow the alcohol to evaporate.

Place the bouquet garni in the stockpot tied to the handle for easy removal.  Add the cold water, wine, canned tomatoes and fish parts.  Season with saffron and pepper.  Simmer gently for 10 minutes, stirring to mingle flavors.  Allow the stock to slowly simmer.  Skim and discard the fish foam that rises to the surface.  Do not boil!  If the stock boils, these impurities will be incorporated into the liquid.  Simmer for 15 minutes, turn off heat and let steep for 15 minutes.  Pass the fumet through a strainer lined with cheesecloth.

For the Broth:  Heat the olive oil in a stockpot over medium heat.  Saute the onion, garlic, parsley and orange zest.  Add the clams, mussels, Pernod and wine.  Steam open, about 2 minutes.  Stir in fennel, leek, tomatoes, bay leaf and fumet.  Season with saffron, salt and pepper.  Add the fish pieces to the broth.  Simmer for 3 minutes until the fish is opaque.  Add tomato paste and adjust seasonings.

For the Rouille:  Broil the tomato and bell pepper, turning to blacken all sides.  Place the roasted pepper in a paper bag, close it, and let it "sweat" for 5 minutes so it is easier to peel the skin.  Remove from bag, peel the skin and discard the seeds and stem.  Peel and cut the tomato, squeeze out the seeds.  In a food processor, puree the potato, roasted pepper, tomato, mayonnaise, fumet, garlic, saffron and cayenne.  Season with sea salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For the Croutons:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly brush the baguette slices with olive oil and bake on a cookie sheet until crisp.  Set aside.

Ladle the soup into individual serving bowls.  Spoon the rouille over the croutons and place in bowl.  Garnish with parsley and basil.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                        Nori seaweed
                        Sushi Rice -- (see recipe)
                        Crab meat -- cut in pieces
                        Avocado -- peeled, and

                        Cucumber -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut in fine strips
                        Sesame seeds -- toasted

Cut nori sheet in half and place it on bamboo mat, shiny-side down.  Dampen your fingers in water.  Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the seaweed, do not cover completely. Leave a 1-inch margin at the ends uncovered to seal the roll.  Lay crabmeat, avocado and cucumber lengthwise.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

To roll; slowly fold the end of the mat closest to you over the filling and tuck it in.  Use medium pressure to create a compact tube.  Remove the mat from around the roll, press in the loose ends and place it on a cutting board, seam-side down.  Using a wet, sharp knife, slice the roll in half then into 6 equal pieces.  Serve with wasabi, soy sauce and pickled ginger.

  1                cup  heavy cream -- cold
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar
  1              large  marshmallow

Chill a mixing bowl and wire whisk in the freezer for 10 minutes before beginning.  Beat heavy cream in the chilled bowl until it begins to foam and thicken up.  Add the powdered sugar and continue to beat until the cream barely mounds.  Do not overwhip.

Cut the marshmallow in half and microwave for 10 seconds until soft and almost melted.  Now, whip it into the cream to form soft peaks.  Aside from adding a hint of vanilla flavor, the gelatin in the marshmallow will stabilize the cream.  Refrigerate, covered, until ready to use.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  imported Swiss cheese -- shredded
     1/2         pound  Gruyere cheese -- shredded
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  cherry brandy
                        = (such as kirsch)
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
  1              pinch  nutmeg

In a small bowl, coat the cheeses with cornstarch and set aside.

Rub the inside of the ceramic fondue pot with the garlic, then discard.  Over medium heat, add the wine and lemon juice and bring to a gentle simmer.  Gradually stir the cheese into the simmering liquid.  Melting the cheese gradually encourages a smooth fondue.  Once smooth, stir in cherry brandy, mustard and nutmeg.

Arrange an assortment of bite-sized dipping foods on a lazy Susan around fondue pot.  Serve with chunks of French and pumpernickel breads.  Some other suggestions are Granny Smith apples and blanched vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and asparagus.  Spear with fondue forks or wooden skewers, dip, swirl and enjoy!

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  1                can  stewed tomatoes - (28 oz)
  1                cup  shredded Cheddar and Jack Cheeses
  16                    corn tortillas
  1 1/2           cups  canned enchilada sauce
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped cilantro
                        Chopped scallions
                        Sour cream
                        Chopped tomatoes

Coat large saute pan with oil.  Season chicken with salt and pepper.  Brown chicken over medium heat, allow 7 minutes each side or until no longer pink.  Sprinkle chicken with cumin, garlic powder and Mexican spices before turning.  Remove chicken to a platter, allow to cool.

Saute onion and garlic in chicken drippings until tender.  Add corn and chiles.  Stir well to combine.  Add canned tomatoes, saute 1 minute.

Pull chicken breasts apart by hand into shredded strips.  Add shredded chicken to saute pan, combine with vegetables.  Dust the mixture with flour to help set.

Microwave tortillas on high for 30 seconds.  This softens them and makes them more pliable.  Coat the bottom of 2 (13- by 9-inch) pans with a ladle of enchilada sauce.  Using a large shallow bowl, dip each tortilla in enchilada sauce to lightly coat.  Spoon 1/4 cup chicken mixture in each tortilla.  Fold over filling, place 8 enchiladas in each pan with seam side down.  Top with remaining enchilada sauce and cheese.

Bake for 15 minutes in a preheated 350 degree oven until cheese melts.  Garnish with cilantro, scallion, sour cream and chopped tomatoes before serving.  Serve with Spanish rice and beans.

This recipe yields 16 enchiladas, 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
  2                     bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1              pinch  salt
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed

In a small saucepan, heat the milk and 1 bay leaf to a gentle simmer, stirring so it doesn't scorch the bottom of the pan.  Keep the milk on low heat.

Make a white roux by melting butter over low-medium heat in a thick-bottomed saucepan.  Just as the foam subsides, add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to coat the flour and remove the starchy taste.  Do not allow to brown.  Remove from heat, then gradually add a bit of the warm milk to the roux and whisk vigorously.

Return the saucepan to the heat and bring up to a low simmer, continuing to add more milk and whisk.  Cook for 5 minutes until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Check seasoning; add salt, white pepper, garlic and the remaining bay leaf.

To prevent a skin from forming as the sauce cools, lay a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface.

Serve with fish, shellfish, vegetables or egg dishes.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  champagne vinegar
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  2                     shallots -- finely chopped
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- cubed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives

In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, combine vinegar, wine, shallots, lemon, and bay leaves to make an infusion.  Simmer over medium heat for 5 to 8 minutes until the mixture is reduced to a wet paste, about 2 tablespoons.  Add the cream and continue to simmer until reduced again to about 2 tablespoons.  Cream is added to make the sauce more stable and less likely to separate.

Reduce the heat to low and remove the bay leaves.  Whisk in the chunks of butter in small batches.  The butter should melt without the sauce getting too hot, producing a creamy emulsified sauce.  Do not let the sauce go over 130 degrees, where it will separate.  If the sauce starts to break, remove from heat, add 2 ice cubes and whisk until it cools down and comes back together.  Season with salt and pepper, fold in the chives, and serve immediately.  Keep covered in a warm place for a few hours, if needed.

Serve with fish or vegetables.

This recipe yields 1 cup.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  dry mustard
  1               dash  cayenne
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  water
  2               cups  canola oil

Begin with all ingredients at room temperature, they will emulsify more readily.

In a food processor or blender, process the yolks, salt, mustard, cayenne, lemon juice and water together to form a stable base.  With the motor running, add a few drops of the oil, the mixture will begin to thicken.

Then, begin adding the remaining oil in a thin, steady stream.  Scrape down the sides of the processor/blender.  Check seasoning.  Keep covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

Serve with cold meats, seafood, poultry and salads.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness...  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell"

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  bacon
  2                     chicken breasts
  2                     chicken thighs
  2                     chicken legs
     1/2           cup  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2               cups  pearl onions -- peeled
  2               cups  mushrooms
  2                     carrots -- cut 2" pieces
     1/4           cup  cognac or brandy
  1             bottle  Burgundy wine
  2               cups  chicken broth
  5             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  herbs de Provence
  3                     bay leaves
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

In a large, heavy skillet or Dutch oven, fry the bacon over medium heat until crisp.  Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.  Coat chicken pieces in flour, salt and pepper.  Brown chicken in hot bacon fat on both sides.

Add garlic, onions, mushrooms and carrots.  Saute 2 minutes to soften.  Pour cognac into a small glass.  Remove pan from heat, pour in cognac, put pan back on the flame.  Flambe by lighting a long match and holding it just above the pot and light the fumes.  The brandy will catch fire and the flames will burn out within 1 minute.  When the flames die down, gradually stir in the wine and broth.  When the wine is well blended, add the herbs.  Cover and simmer for 1 hour.  Remove cover and continue to simmer for 15 minutes to allow the sauce to reduce a bit.  You may want to add 1 tablespoon of tomato paste or cornstarch to aid in the thickening process.

To serve, top the chicken and vegetables with reserved crumbled bacon and fresh parsley.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUMB CRUST ===
  2               cups  finely-ground graham crackers -- (abt 30 squares)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  2             blocks  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  3                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                     lemon -- zest finely grated
  1               pint  sour cream
                        === BLUEBERRY TOPPING ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2              pints  blueberries
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1                     lemon -- juiced

To prepare Crumb Crust:  In a mixing bowl, combine the crust ingredients together with a fork until evenly moistened.  Lightly coat the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with non-stick cooking spray.  Firmly press the mixture over the bottom and 1-inch up the sides on the pan, use your fingers or the smooth bottom of a glass.  Refrigerate the crust while preparing the filling.

To prepare Filling:  In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese on low speed for 1 minute just until smooth and free of any lumps.  Gradually add the sugar and beat until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes.  Periodically scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to slowly beat until combined.  Stir in the vanilla and lemon zest.  Blend in the sour cream.  The batter should be well mixed but not overbeaten.  Overbeating incorporates too much air and will cause the cake to puff when baking, then fall and crack when cooling.  Pour filling into the crust-lined pan and smooth the top with a spatula.

To prepare water bath:  Set the pan on a large piece of aluminum foil and fold up the sides.  This will prevent water from seeping into the seams of the springform pan.  Carefully set the cake pan in a larger roasting pan.  Pour boiling water into the roasting pan until the water is about halfway up the sides of the cheesecake pan.

Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for 45 minutes.  The cheesecake should still jiggle, it will firm up after chilling.  Be careful not to overcook!  Do not do a toothpick test in the cake's center, this will make a crack.  Loosen the cheesecake from the sides of the pan by running a thin metal spatula around the inside rim.  Let cool in the pan for 30 minutes.  Chill in the refrigerator, loosely covered, for at least 4 hours to set up.  Demold and transfer to a cake plate.  Slice the cheesecake with a thin, nonserrated knife that has been dipped in hot water and wiped dry after each cut.

To prepare Blueberry Topping:  Combine all ingredients in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat.  Bring up to a slow boil and stir gently until the berries breakdown and release their natural juice.  The consistency should remain a bit chunky.  Cool to room temperature and serve on top of cheesecake.  (Makes 2 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  pearl onions
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1                     garlic clove -- smashed
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh grated nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  goose stock or chicken broth

Blanch the pearl onions by placing them into a large pot of rapidly boiling water.  Cook them for about 1 minute.  Remove the onions from the water with a strainer, then plunge into an ice bath to stop the cooking process.  Drain them, then remove the skins.

Put the onions in a 3-quart saucepan and place over low-medium heat.  Add the cream, bay leaves, parsley, garlic and nutmeg.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover and let simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened.  Then, remove the cover and add stock.  Season again.  Allow to cook down for 5 minutes to tighten up the cream sauce.  Discard the garlic clove and bay leaves before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9                     egg yolks
     3/4           cup  superfine white sugar -- plus
  6        tablespoons  superfine white sugar
  1              quart  heavy cream
  1                     vanilla bean

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  In a large bowl, cream together egg yolks and sugar with a whisk until the mixture is pale yellow and thick.

Pour cream into a medium saucepan over low heat.  Using a paring knife, split the vanilla bean down the middle, scrape out the seeds and add them to saucepan.  Bring cream to a brief simmer, do not boil or it will overflow.  Remove from heat and temper the yolks by gradually whisking the hot vanilla cream into yolk and sugar mixture.  Do not add hot cream too quickly or the eggs will cook.

Divide custard into 6 (6-ounce) ramekins, about 3/4 full.  Place ramekins in a roasting pan and fill pan with enough water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins.  Bake until barely set around the edges, about 40 minutes.  You may want to cover loosely with foil to prevent browning.

Remove from oven and cool to room temperature.  Transfer the ramekins to the refrigerator and chill for 2 hours.

Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar on top of each chilled custard.  Hold a kitchen torch 2 inches above surface to brown the sugar and form a crust.  Garnish with cookies and fresh fruit.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Variation:  Before dividing into ramekins: add 3 ounces of shaved dark chocolate for chocolate creme brulee; add 4 slices of crystallized ginger for ginger creme brulee; add 3 slices of orange peel for orange creme brulee.  Let steep 20 minutes to infuse the flavor.  Strain out the ginger and orange peel before baking.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Peanut or other vegetable oil -- for frying
  2             pounds  baking potatoes -- like russets
                        Salt -- to taste

Pour oil in a deep fryer or heavy saucepan to reach halfway up the sides of the pan.  Heat to 325 degrees, use a deep fry thermometer to determine this.  While the oil is heating, peel the potatoes and push through a French fry cutter to form uniform sticks.  As you go, place the cut potatoes in a bowl of ice water to release some of the starch and to keep them from browning.

Dry the potato strips thoroughly, this will keep the oil from splattering.  Fry the potatoes in batches so the pan isn't crowded and the oil temperature does not plummet.  Cook for 3 minutes until they are soft but not browned.  Remove the potatoes with a long-handled metal strainer and drain on brown paper bags.

Bring oil temperature up to 375 degrees.  Return the par-fried potatoes to the oil in batches and cook a second time for 4 minutes until golden and crispy.  Drain on fresh brown paper bags then place in a serving bowl lined with paper towels.  Salt and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             pounds  beef short ribs -- cut across the bone
  2                     garlic cloves
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  brown mustard
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  1         tablespoon  molasses
  3        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  granulated onion
  1         tablespoon  granulated garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Fill a large stockpot with water and bring to a boil.  Add the ribs, garlic cloves and bay leaf.  Parboil the ribs, covered, for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until fork tender.

In a medium saucepan, combine all ingredients.  Pour 1 cup of the rib water into the mixture.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for approximately 15 minutes until the sauce has thickened and is heated through.  Add the ribs to the pot, turning with tongs to coat well.  Season with salt and pepper.

Transfer the ribs to a hot outdoor grill, meat-side down first, and cook 8 to 10 minutes on each side, taking care not to burn them.  Serve with remaining sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  Canadian bacon
  4                     English muffins -- split
  2          teaspoons  white vinegar
  8                     eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Hollandaise Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Fresh chopped parsley -- for garnish

Brown the bacon in a medium skillet and toast the English muffins, cut-sides up, on a baking sheet under the broiler.

Fill a 10-inch nonstick skillet half full of water.  Add white vinegar to the cooking water.  This will make the egg white cook faster so it does not spread.  Bring to a slow boil.  Gently break 1 of the eggs into the water taking care not to break it.  Repeat with remaining eggs.  Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer.  Cook 3 1/2 minutes until the egg white is set and yolk remains soft.  Remove with a slotted spoon, allowing the egg to drain.

To assemble:  Lay a slice of Canadian bacon on top of each muffin half, followed by a poached egg.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spoon Hollandaise Sauce over the eggs.  Garnish with chopped parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2 1/4         pounds  skirt or flank steak -- trimmed of fat

  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
  1           teaspoon  cumin
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === FAJITAS ===
  1                     green bell pepper -- thinly sliced

                        Salsa Fresca -- (see recipe)
  12                    flour tortillas -- warm

In a small bowl, whisk together marinade ingredients.  Place steak in a shallow container, and pour marinade over it.  Refrigerate, covered, 8 hours or overnight to tenderize meat.

Drain the marinade from the meat.  Grill the steak in a ridged grill pan over medium-high heat for 4 minutes each side.  Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let stand.

In the same pan with the steak juices, add the bell peppers and onions.  Saute the mixture for 3 minutes until the vegetables are limp.

Thinly slice the steak against the grain on a diagonal.

Spread some guacamole on a tortilla, top with a few slices of steak, peppers and onions and salsa fresca.  Roll up the tortilla to enclose the filling.

May also serve with sour cream and shredded cheese.

This recipe yields 6 servings (12 fajitas 2 per person).

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  superfine sugar
     1/3           cup  water
  5                     egg whites -- room temperature
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar

In a small pot over low heat, combine sugar and water.  Swirl the pot over the burner to dissolve the sugar completely.  Do not stir.  Increase the heat and boil to soft-ball stage (235 to 240 degrees).  Use a candy thermometer for accuracy.  Wash down the inside wall of the pot with a wet pastry brush.  This will help prevent sugar crystals from forming around the sides, falling in and causing a chain reaction.  Prepare your meringue.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, whip the eggs whites on low speed until foamy.  Add the cream of tartar, increase the speed to medium, and beat until soft peaks form.

With the mixer running, pour the hot sugar syrup in a thin stream over fluffed egg whites.  Beat until the egg whites are stiff and glossy.  Spread the meringue over a hot cake or pie, and bake as directed.

For Meringue Cloud Cookies:  Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Line baking sheets with parchment paper.  Dollop spoonfuls of meringue onto baking pans, alternatively you may use a pastry bag with a star tip.  Bake for 2 hours until crisp.  Turn off the oven and allow meringues to cool and completely dry out.

In a small pot over low heat, combine sugar and water.  Swirl the pot over the burner to dissolve the sugar completely.  Do not stir.  Increase the heat and boil to soft-ball stage (235 to 240 degrees).  Use a candy thermometer for accuracy.  Wash down the inside wall of the pot with a wet pastry brush.  This will help prevent sugar crystals from forming around the sides, falling in and causing a chain reaction.  Prepare your meringue.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, whip the eggs whites on low speed until foamy.  Add the cream of tartar, increase the speed to medium, and beat until soft peaks form.

<DirT>
With the mixer running, pour the hot sugar syrup in a thin stream over fluffed egg whites.  Beat until the egg whites are stiff and glossy.  Spread the meringue over a hot cake or pie, and bake as directed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Meringue Cloud Cookies:  Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Line baking sheets with parchment paper.  Dollop spoonfuls of meringue onto baking pans, alternatively you may use a pastry bag with a star tip.  Bake for 2 hours until crisp.  Turn off the oven and allow meringues to cool and completely dry out.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried lasagna noodles
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano
  3                     bay leaves
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef
  1              pound  ground Italian sausage
  1                can  tomato paste - (6 oz)
  30            ounces  ricotta cheese -- (2 containers)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  4               cups  prepared tomato sauce
  1              pound  mozzarella cheese -- shredded
                        Grated Parmesan and mozzarella -- for topping

Cook the lasagna noodles in plenty of boiling salted water until pliable and barely tender, about 10 minutes.  Stir with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking.  Drain the noodles thoroughly, coat with olive oil keep them moist and easy to work with.

Coat a large skillet with olive oil.  Saute over medium heat, onion, garlic and herbs.  Cook 5 minutes.  Brown beef and sausage until no longer pink, about 15 minutes.  Drain fat into a small container and discard.  Stir in the tomato paste completely.  Set aside to cool.

In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta, parsley and oregano.  Stir in beaten eggs.  Add Parmesan, season with salt and pepper.

To assemble the lasagna:  Coat the bottom of a 13- by 9-inch pan with a ladle full of tomato sauce.  Arrange 4 noodles lengthwise in a slightly overlapping layer on the sauce.  Then, line each end of the pan with a lasagna noodle.  This forms a collar that holds in the corners.  Spread 1/2 of the meat mixture over the pasta.  Dollop 1/2 of the ricotta mixture over the meat, spread to the edges with a spatula.  Sprinkle 1/2 of the mozzarella on top of the ricotta.  Top with a ladle full of tomato sauce, spread evenly.  Repeat with the next layer of noodles, meat, cheeses and sauce.  Top last layer with noodles, sauce and shredded mozzarella and Parmesan.  Tap the pan to force out air bubbles.

Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 1 hour.  Remove from oven.  Let lasagna rest for 30 minutes so the noodles will settle and cut easily.  Cut into 2-inch squares and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

       Maple-Roasted Turkey With Sage, Smoked Bacon, Cornbread Stuf

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
     1/2         bunch  fresh sage -- leaves finely
                        chopped
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              large  onions -- finely chopped
  1                     loaf cornbread -- cubed (abt 6 cups)
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  3               cups  chicken stock
  1                     fresh turkey - (12 to 14 lbs)
  1                cup  pure maple syrup
     1/4           cup  hot water
  8                     strips smoked bacon
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2                lemon -- juiced

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and remove the top rack.

Combine the butter and sage in a mixing bowl, mash with a fork or spoon until the sage is well incorporated and the butter has flecks of green in it; season with salt and pepper.

In a saute pan, melt 4 tablespoons of the sage butter, add the onions, cook and stir for 15 minutes until soft and golden.  Remove from heat.  Put the cornbread in a large mixing bowl and scrape the sauteed onion mixture on top.  Add the egg, heavy cream, and just enough chicken stock to moisten the stuffing without making it soggy (about 1/2 cup.)  Toss well to combine, season with salt and pepper.

Remove the neck and gizzards from the inside of the turkey and discard.  Rinse the bird thoroughly inside and out with cold water, pat dry.  Sprinkle the cavity and skin liberally with salt and pepper.  Using your fingers, gently lift the skin from the breast and legs, and slip pieces of the sage butter underneath; massaging it in as you go.  Fill the bird with the cornbread stuffing without packing too tightly; cook the remaining stuffing separately in a buttered baking dish.  Truss the turkey; place it on a rack in a large roasting pan, and put into the oven.

Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, whisk together the maple syrup and hot water to thin the glaze out a bit; use this to baste the turkey every 30 minutes.  The turkey should take about 3 hours to cook (i.e. 15 to 20 minutes per pound.)  If the legs or breast brown too quickly, cover with foil.  About 2 hours into cooking, shingle the strips of bacon oven the turkey breast to cover; continue to roast and baste for another hour or so.  The turkey is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the meatiest part of the thigh registers 170 degrees (the thigh juices will also run clear when pricked with a knife.)  Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and let rest for 20 minutes before carving, so the juices can settle back into the meat.

Skim off the excess fat from the pan drippings with a spoon and place the roasting pan over 2 burners set on medium-high heat.  Using a wooden spoon, scrape up brown bits stuck to bottom of pan.  Whisk the flour into the drippings, stirring as it thickens to prevent lumps.  Add the remaining chicken stock and bring to a simmer; season with salt and pepper and hit it with a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten the flavor.  Simmer for 5 minutes and then strain to remove any particles.  Serve the gravy with the maple-roasted turkey and cornbread stuffing.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and remove the top rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the butter and sage in a mixing bowl, mash with a fork or spoon until the sage is well incorporated and the butter has flecks of green in it; season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a saute pan, melt 4 tablespoons of the sage butter, add the onions, cook and stir for 15 minutes until soft and golden.  Remove from heat.  Put the cornbread in a large mixing bowl and scrape the sauteed onion mixture on top.  Add the egg, heavy cream, and just enough chicken stock to moisten the stuffing without making it soggy (about 1/2 cup.)  Toss well to combine, season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the neck and gizzards from the inside of the turkey and discard.  Rinse the bird thoroughly inside and out with cold water, pat dry.  Sprinkle the cavity and skin liberally with salt and pepper.  Using your fingers, gently lift the skin from the breast and legs, and slip pieces of the sage butter underneath; massaging it in as you go.  Fill the bird with the cornbread stuffing without packing too tightly; cook the remaining stuffing separately in a buttered baking dish.  Truss the turkey; place it on a rack in a large roasting pan, and put into the oven.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, whisk together the maple syrup and hot water to thin the glaze out a bit; use this to baste the turkey every 30 minutes.  The turkey should take about 3 hours to cook (i.e. 15 to 20 minutes per pound.)  If the legs or breast brown too quickly, cover with foil.  About 2 hours into cooking, shingle the strips of bacon oven the turkey breast to cover; continue to roast and baste for another hour or so.  The turkey is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the meatiest part of the thigh registers 170 degrees (the thigh juices will also run clear when pricked with a knife.)  Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and let rest for 20 minutes before carving, so the juices can settle back into the meat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Skim off the excess fat from the pan drippings with a spoon and place the roasting pan over 2 burners set on medium-high heat.  Using a wooden spoon, scrape up brown bits stuck to bottom of pan.  Whisk the flour into the drippings, stirring as it thickens to prevent lumps.  Add the remaining chicken stock and bring to a simmer; season with salt and pepper and hit it with a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten the flavor.  Simmer for 5 minutes and then strain to remove any particles.  Serve the gravy with the maple-roasted turkey and cornbread stuffing.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2                     acorn squash -- halved, roasted
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon
  1                cup  lentils -- rinsed, cleaned
  1                cup  brown rice
  1         tablespoon  coriander
  1                     bay leaf
  2        tablespoons  curry powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3 1/2           cups  vegetable stock -- divided
  1                     onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  dried apricots -- chopped
                        Fresh flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish
                        Fresh mint -- for garnish

Split the squash in half and remove the seeds and fibers.  Brush the flesh with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle with cinnamon, salt and pepper.  Roast on a cookie sheet in a 350 degree oven for about 25 minutes, until fork tender.  Cool and set aside.

Combine lentils and rice in a medium saucepan; add coriander, bay leaf, curry powder, salt and pepper.  Pour in 3 1/4 cups of broth to cover by at least 2 inches.  Turn the heat to medium and cook 30 to 45 minutes, stirring frequently.  If you need to add more liquid to keep the mixture wet do so, a little at a time.

Meanwhile, place 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Add onions and cook, stirring until softened, about 5 minutes.  Rehydrate the apricots with remaining 1/4 cup vegetable stock.  Stir in the lentils and rice.  Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.  Bring the components together by spooning the mixture into the roasted acorn squash.  Season with salt and pepper.  Garnish with parsley and mint.

                             Mushroom Risotto

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  low sodium chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1                     onion -- diced, divided
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced, divided
  1              pound  fresh portobello and crimini mushrooms -- sliced
  2                     bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  truffle oil
  1              ounce  dried porcini mushrooms -- wiped of grit
  2               cups  Arborio rice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  grated fresh Parmesan cheese
                        Fresh Italian parsley -- for garnish

Heat the chicken broth in a medium saucepan and keep warm over low heat.

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add 1/2 onion and 1 clove garlic, cook, stirring, until translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the fresh mushrooms, herbs and butter.  Saute for 3 to 5 minutes until lightly browned, season with salt and pepper.  Drizzle in truffle oil then add the dried porcini mushrooms which were reconstituted in 1 cup of warm chicken broth.  Season again with salt and fresh cracked pepper.  Saute 1 minute then remove from heat and set aside.

Coat a saucepan with remaining 2 tablespoons of oil.  Saute the remaining 1/2 onion and garlic clove.  Add the rice and stir quickly until it is well-coated and opaque, 1 minute.  This step cooks the starchy coating and prevents the grains from sticking.  Stir in wine and cook until it is nearly all evaporated.

Now, with a ladle, add 1 cup of the warm broth and cook, stirring, until the rice has absorbed the liquid.  Add the remaining broth, 1 cup at a time.  Continue to cook and stir, allowing the rice to absorb each addition of broth before adding more.  The risotto should be slightly firm and creamy, not mushy.  Transfer the mushrooms to the rice mixture.  Stir in Parmesan cheese, cook briefly until melted.  Top with a drizzle of truffle oil and chopped parsley before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

             Mushroom Soup With Chestnuts And Roasted Fennel

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              small  fennel bulbs -- stalks removed,
                        halved lengthwise
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2         bunch  fresh thyme sprigs -- leaves stripped
                        from the stem
  1              pound  white button mushrooms -- wiped of grit,
                        and coarsely chopped
  1              pound  oyster mushrooms -- wiped of grit,
                        and coarsely chopped
  1              pound  chanterelle mushrooms -- wiped of grit,
                        and coarsely chopped
  1              pound  cooked chestnuts
  3             quarts  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Fresh chopped chives -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Put the fennel halves, cut-side up, in a baking dish and drizzle with enough olive oil to come up half-way; season with a generous amount of salt and pepper.  Roast for 30 minutes or until completely tender -- the roasted fennel is the base of the soup, so it's important the flesh is soft enough to be cut with a spoon.

In a large pot, melt the butter over medium flame; add the onion and garlic, saute for 4 minutes until translucent.  Toss the thyme into the pan, along with the mushrooms; season with salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring, for 10 to 15 minutes, until the mushrooms give off their liquid.  Add the chestnuts and cook for a few more minutes until they have some nice color on them.  Remove about 1 cup of the mixture to save as a garnish for the soup.

Pour the stock into the pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes, stirring now and then.  Remove from the heat and puree the soup until completely smooth, using a handheld or regular blender.  Stir in the cream to make the soup even richer, and simmer gently for 5 minutes.  Taste for salt and pepper.

To serve:  Ladle the soup into soup bowls; garnish each serving with a bit of the reserved mushrooms and chestnuts, the roasted fennel, and a sprinkle of chopped chives.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              dozen  hard-shell clams
                        = (such as quahog)
  1              quart  water
  2                     garlic cloves
  4                     bay leaves -- divided
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
  2               cups  cubed peeled potatoes
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     inches salt pork strip
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme
     1/3           cup  flour
  2             ounces  bottled clam juice
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2               cups  milk
  4             pounds  fish fillets -- cut 1" pieces
                        = (such as flounder)

Cover and steam over medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes until the clams open.  Discard any that do not open.  Remove clams from shells, roughly chop, and set aside.  Strain the broth through cheesecloth as an added precaution to remove any grit.

Make a roux by sprinkling in flour and stirring until dissolved.  Add the reserved clam broth, bring to a boil, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.  Continue to simmer, stirring, for 15 minutes until thickened.

Add the chopped clams, bottled clam juice and sea salt.  Pour in the cream and milk, cover, and cook until heated through.  Add the fish fillets and continue to simmer another 5 minutes until the fish is opaque.  Season with salt and pepper.

Serve with oyster crackers or crusty bread.

This recipe yields 8 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Fish of choice
                        Wasabi
                        Sushi Rice -- (see recipe)
                        Soy sauce -- for serving

Slice the fish of your choice into bite sized pieces.  Put a little wasabi on one side of the fish.  Moisten your hands with water and place a small ball of sushi rice in your palm, about 2 tablespoons.  Press the fish, wasabi-side down, onto the rice.  Gently hand-sculpt and shape it into an oblong.  The rice has to be tight enough to hold a shape, but loose enough to melt in your mouth.

Dip in soy sauce, fish first, not rice.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                 Orange-Grapefruit Marmalade With Ginger

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Jams/Jellies

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     oranges
  1                     grapefruit
  3               cups  sugar
  2             ounces  crystallized ginger -- cut in strips
  1                     box fruit pectin powder - (1 oz)

Cut fruit in half, squeeze out juice and pulp, discard seeds.  The volume of this should be approximately 4 cups.  Remove zest, this should yield approximately 1/2 cup.  Transfer juice, pulp and zest to a large glass bowl.  Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.  This helps the peel to soften.

After soaking, put the citrus in a large stockpot.  Add 6 cups of water, simmer for 1 1/2 hours.  A sample of the peel should feel quite tender if rubbed between fingers.  Add sugar and ginger.  Bring to a boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.  Boil hard for 20 minutes until sugar is dissolved and mixture is thickened.  If the mixture foams up, add a pat of butter and the froth will subside.

Test for jell-point: drop a small amount of hot marmalade on a chilled plate.  Return to the freezer for 1 minute.  If surface forms a skin, it has reached jelling point, if still syrupy, continue cooking and test again in 5 minutes.

Remove from heat, stir in pectin.  Cool for 15 minutes, spoon into half-pint sterilized jars leaving 1/4-inch headspace and seal.

This recipe yields 1 pint.

Comments:  Traditionally the citrus seeds and pith are enclosed in a nylon bag and boiled along with the juice/pulp.  This releases the natural pectin that is stored in that part of the orange.  For time and ease, we eliminated that step and used store-bought fruit pectin.  It worked very well.

To sterilize the canning jars, wash the containers in hot, soapy water and rinse.  Boil them in a large pot for 10 minutes.  Keep the jars in hot water until ready to use to prevent the jars from cracking.  Dry with paper towels before filling with marmalade.  Once filled, put on lids and collar.  Boil again for 10 minutes to seal the jars.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             pieces  veal shank with bone cut 3" thick
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                     onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  chopped carrots
  4                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
  2                     bay leaves
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
  1                cup  dry Marsala
  2               cups  veal or chicken stock
  2                     tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
                        Saffron Risotto -- (see recipe)
                        === GREMOLATA ===
                        Grated rind of 1 lemon
                        Grated rind of 1 orange
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  fresh Italian parsley -- chopped

In a large shallow platter, season flour with salt and pepper.  Dredge the veal shanks in the mixture and tap off any excess.  In a large heavy skillet or Dutch oven, over medium flame, heat the oil and butter.  Sear the shanks on all sides, turn bones on sides to hold in marrow.  Add more oil and butter if needed.  Remove the browned veal shanks and set aside.

Add onion, celery, carrots, garlic, bay leaves and parsley to the pan and cook until softened.  Season with salt and pepper.  Raise the heat to high, add the wine and deglaze the pan.  Return the shanks to the pan, add the stock and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil.  Reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for about 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender.  Baste the meat a few times during cooking.  Remove the cover, continue to simmer for 10 minutes to reduce the sauce a bit.

For Gremolata:  Combine all ingredients together in a small bowl.  Strew the gremolata over the osso buco before serving.  Serve osso buco with Saffron Risotto.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pumpkin - (4 to 5 lbs)
     1/4           cup  melted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     celery ribs -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled and cubed
  1           teaspoon  celery seed
  1           teaspoon  fennel seed
  2                     oranges -- zested
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley -- divided
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh sage -- divided
  2             pounds  ground turkey sausage
  1                cup  Sauvignon Blanc wine
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1            package  cornbread stuffing - (16 oz)
  3               cups  chicken broth
  2                     eggs -- beaten

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cut off the lid of the pumpkin and set it aside.  Pull out the seeds and strings from inside the pumpkin.  Brush the inside flesh with melted butter, season with salt and pepper.  Place pumpkin on a roasting rack set inside a pan; bake for 15 minutes.

In a large skillet, heat oil over moderate heat.  Add onion, celery, garlic, apples, celery seed, and fennel seed.  Sprinkle in orange zest and 2 tablespoons each parsley and sage.  Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the ground sausage, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, and brown until no longer pink, about 10 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with wine, cook down 2 minutes to evaporate the alcohol.  Stir in the cream, check seasoning.

Scrape the sausage mixture into a large bowl and fold in the cornbread.  Gradually blend in the eggs and chicken broth, until the stuffing is evenly moistened.  Add remaining parsley and sage.  Fill the pumpkin with stuffing, return to the oven, and bake 20 minutes until the eggs are cooked and the stuffing has a little lift.  Serve stuffing in the pumpkin bowl topped with lid.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

In a large skillet, heat oil over moderate heat.  Add onion, celery, garlic, apples, celery seed, and fennel seed.  Sprinkle in orange zest and 2 tablespoons each parsley and sage.  Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the ground sausage, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, and brown until no longer pink, about 10 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with wine, cook down 2 minutes to evaporate the alcohol.  Stir in the cream, check seasoning.

Scrape the sausage mixture into a large bowl and fold in the cornbread.  Gradually blend in the eggs and chicken broth, until the stuffing is evenly moistened.  Add remaining parsley and sage.  Fill the pumpkin with stuffing, return to the oven, and bake 20 minutes until the eggs are cooked and the stuffing has a little lift.  Serve stuffing in the pumpkin bowl topped with lid.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  duck foie gras - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- slightly chilled
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             slices  white bread -- cut in rounds
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     fresh black mission figs -- halved
  2                     shallots -- finely chopped
  6                     tarragon leaves -- chopped
     1/2           cup  port wine
  1                     orange -- juiced, divided
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1                     pat butter
  1              pinch  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  orange zest -- grated
  3                     endive heads -- julienned
  1              bunch  arugula
     1/2         bunch  fresh chives -- roughly chopped
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil

Carefully pull apart the 2 lobes of the foie gras with your hands and remove the veins that are lodged between them.  Using a sharp knife dipped in boiling water, cut each lobe into 1-inch medallions, approximately 6 (4-ounce) slices.  Score the top of each medallion in a diamond pattern and season with salt and pepper.  Sear the medallions in a hot, dry pan for 30 seconds per side, seasoned-side down first.  Remove to a warmed platter lined with paper towels to drain.

Lower heat to medium and pour out a bit of the rendered duck fat.  Fry the bread rounds until brown, about 2 minutes each side, set aside.  Wipe out the pan and coat with olive oil.  Brown the figs, cut-side down, then add the shallots and tarragon.  Cook for 2 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with port, juice of 1/2 orange and balsamic vinegar, cook down, about 3 minutes.  Finish off the sauce with butter, a pinch of sugar, orange zest, salt and pepper.

Combine the endive, arugula and chives together in a small bowl.  Toss with remaining orange juice, lemon juice and olive oil, season with salt and pepper.  Arrange a handful of salad on each plate and lay the toast on top.  Carefully place a foie gras medallion on each toast round.  Top with figs, drizzle with port wine sauce.  Garnish with chives and serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In the same skillet, saute apples in a bit more butter and oil, add more parsley and thyme.  Deglaze the pan with brandy.  Pour in brown sauce and cider vinegar to create a pan sauce.  Spoon the apple sauce over the pork chops.  Sprinkle with more chopped herbs and salt and pepper.

Roast in a preheated 325 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes.  A meat thermometer inserted into the pork should read 155 degrees.

                              Ravioli Dough

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     yolk -- for egg wash

In an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine flour and salt.  Add eggs 1 at a time and continue to mix.  Drizzle in oil and continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball.  Sprinkle some flour on work surface, knead the dough until elastic and smooth.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

Cut the ball of dough in half, cover and reserve the dough you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out.  Dust the counter and dough with flour.  Form the dough into a rectangle and roll it through the pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at its widest setting.  Guide the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers.  *Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times.  Continue until the machine is at its narrowest setting.  The dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick.

Dust the counter and dough with flour, lay out the long sheet of pasta.  Brush the top surface of dough with egg wash.  Drop 1 tablespoon of cooled filling about 2-inches apart on half the sheet of pasta.  Fold the unfilled half over the filling.  With an espresso cup or fingers, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling and form a seal.  Use a crimper to cut each pillow into squares.  Check to make sure the crimped edges are well sealed before cooking.  If making ravioli in advance, dust with cornmeal to prevent them from sticking.

Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water for 10 to 15 minutes.  Ravioli will float to the top when cooked so be careful not to overcrowd the pot.  Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon.  Plate the pasta, top with sauce and grated cheese before serving.  Garnish plate with chopped herbs and toasted pine nuts.

This recipe yields 24 ravioli.

* For Herb-Patterned Pasta:  Follow the standard recipe given above and roll it out to a medium-thick sheet.  Next, take well-washed leafy herbs such as, basil, flat-leaf parsley and tarragon, pinch away the stems so only the leaves remain.  Hand press the fresh herbs on the dough's surface at 1-inch intervals.  Fold the dough over itself and run the "sandwich" through the pasta machine at a thin setting.  The leaves will stretch and pattern the pasta.  Continue making ravioli as indicated in the procedure.

<DirS>
<DirT>
In an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine flour and salt.  Add eggs 1 at a time and continue to mix.  Drizzle in oil and continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball.  Sprinkle some flour on work surface, knead the dough until elastic and smooth.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut the ball of dough in half, cover and reserve the dough you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out.  Dust the counter and dough with flour.  Form the dough into a rectangle and roll it through the pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at its widest setting.  Guide the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers.  *Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times.  Continue until the machine is at its narrowest setting.  The dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dust the counter and dough with flour, lay out the long sheet of pasta.  Brush the top surface of dough with egg wash.  Drop 1 tablespoon of cooled filling about 2-inches apart on half the sheet of pasta.  Fold the unfilled half over the filling.  With an espresso cup or fingers, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling and form a seal.  Use a crimper to cut each pillow into squares.  Check to make sure the crimped edges are well sealed before cooking.  If making ravioli in advance, dust with cornmeal to prevent them from sticking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water for 10 to 15 minutes.  Ravioli will float to the top when cooked so be careful not to overcrowd the pot.  Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon.  Plate the pasta, top with sauce and grated cheese before serving.  Garnish plate with chopped herbs and toasted pine nuts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 24 ravioli.
</DirT>
<DirT>
* For Herb-Patterned Pasta:  Follow the standard recipe given above and roll it out to a medium-thick sheet.  Next, take well-washed leafy herbs such as, basil, flat-leaf parsley and tarragon, pinch away the stems so only the leaves remain.  Hand press the fresh herbs on the dough&apos;s surface at 1-inch intervals.  Fold the dough over itself and run the &quot;sandwich&quot; through the pasta machine at a thin setting.  The leaves will stretch and pattern the pasta.  Continue making ravioli as indicated in the procedure.

In a saucepan, bring chicken broth to a simmer.  Keep warm over low heat.

In a large saute pan, melt butter over medium heat.  Add oil and rice and cook for 2 minutes, stirring to coat each grain.  When rice begins to make a crackling sound, add saffron threads.  Add 1 cup of the warm chicken broth and cook, stirring, until the rice has absorbed the liquid.  Add the remaining broth, 1 cup at a time.  Continue to stir, allowing the rice to absorb each addition of broth before adding more.  Test the rice for doneness, it should be al dente but creamy.

Remove risotto from heat, add grated cheese, salt and pepper.  Serve at once.

  3                     celery stalks -- cut in chunks
  8             sprigs  flat-leaf parsley -- divided
  8             sprigs  fresh thyme -- divided
  8                     sage leaves -- divided
  4                     bay leaves -- divided
     1/4           cup  cognac -- plus
  2        tablespoons  cognac
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1              quart  low-sodium chicken broth
  1              pound  smoked and cooked turkey wings
  2               cups  water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Turkey giblets and neck
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  green peppercorns

Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium heat.  Saute the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery with 4 sprigs each parsley and thyme, 4 sage leaves, and 2 bay leaves until fragrant.  Deglaze the pan with 1/4 cup cognac, cook for 2 minutes to evaporate the alcohol.  Sprinkle in flour to tighten up the mixture and stir to dissolve.  Pour in the chicken broth a little at a time to avoid lumping.  Add the smoked turkey wings and water, simmer for 15 minutes while preparing the giblets.

Coat a saute pan with olive oil and place over medium-high heat.  Add the turkey giblets and neck, along with the remaining herbs.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add 2 tablespoons cognac and continue to cook until the giblets are cooked through.  Remove the giblets from the pan and chop them up.

Pass the broth through a strainer to remove the large pieces of turkey and vegetables.  Return the broth to the stove and add the giblets.  Simmer until the gravy is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Stir in peppercorns and serve with turkey.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

       Salad Of Roasted Beets And Arugula With Blue Cheese Dressing

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3            bunches  baby beets -- washed, trimmed,
                        and halved
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     handful fresh thyme sprigs
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5            bunches  arugula -- washed, dried,
                        and hand-torn
                        Celery leaves from 1 bunch celery -- (abt 1/2 cup)
  1                cup  walnut halves and pieces -- toasted
     1/2         pound  blue cheese -- crumbled
  1                cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  1                     lemon -- juiced

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Lay the beets on a large sheet of aluminum foil, drizzle with the oil, toss the thyme on top, and season with salt and pepper.  Fold up the foil tightly to make a sealed pouch and put it on a sheet pan.  Bake until the beets are tender when pierced, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.  (Drop a knife in the center of 1 beet; if it slides out without resistance, they're done.)  Let the beets cool to room temperature and remove skins.  Put beets in a large mixing bowl.  Add the arugula, celery leaves, and walnuts; toss to combine.

To make the blue cheese dressing:  Put the blue cheese and sour cream in a bowl, mashing with a fork to combine.  Add the chives, lemon juice, and a few turns of freshly ground black pepper; mix to incorporate, leaving a few chunks of cheese in the dressing.  Thin out the dressing with a tablespoon of water, if you wish, to smooth out the consistency.

Pour the blue cheese dressing over the salad and toss gently to coat; season with salt and pepper.  Put the salad on a chilled platter and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  assorted root vegetables -- coarsely chopped
                        = (such as carrots, parsnips, turnips,
                        and rutabaga)
  4                     garlic cloves
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1                     handful fresh thyme sprigs
  1                     handful fresh rosemary sprigs
  2                     bay leaves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              bunch  fresh chives -- chopped
                        Extra-virgin olive oil

Place all the vegetables and garlic in a large pot and fill with cool water to cover; season with a teaspoon of salt.  Bring to boil over medium heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, until the vegetables are very tender.

While the vegetables are cooking, combine the heavy cream, butter, and herbs in a pot and heat over low flame to melt the butter and infuse the herb flavor into the cream -- do not allow to boil.  Shut off the heat, cover, and let steep until needed.  When ready to use, remove the herb stems and the bay leaves.

Drain vegetables and put them into a large mixing bowl.  Mash with a potato masher.  Stir in the warm cream mixture and mix until the liquid is absorbed and the vegetables are smooth; season with salt and pepper.  Put the mashed root vegetables in a serving bowl, garnish with chopped chives and drizzle with a healthy dose of olive oil.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Place all the vegetables and garlic in a large pot and fill with cool water to cover; season with a teaspoon of salt.  Bring to boil over medium heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, until the vegetables are very tender.

While the vegetables are cooking, combine the heavy cream, butter, and herbs in a pot and heat over low flame to melt the butter and infuse the herb flavor into the cream -- do not allow to boil.  Shut off the heat, cover, and let steep until needed.  When ready to use, remove the herb stems and the bay leaves.

Drain vegetables and put them into a large mixing bowl.  Mash with a potato masher.  Stir in the warm cream mixture and mix until the liquid is absorbed and the vegetables are smooth; season with salt and pepper.  Put the mashed root vegetables in a serving bowl, garnish with chopped chives and drizzle with a healthy dose of olive oil.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  bone-in whole turkey breast
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     turnips -- halved
  2                     rutabaga -- halved
  2                     parsnips -- halved
  4                     carrots
  2                     onions -- halved
  1                     garlic bulb
  2             sprigs  rosemary
  4                     bay leaves
  8             sprigs  fresh thyme
     1/2           cup  orange blossom honey
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  Chardonnay
  1                cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  flour

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Cut the turkey breast in half and remove the breastplate from the meat.  Place the bone in a large roasting pan, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  The breastbone will act as a natural roasting rack.  Surround it with the vegetables and herbs.  Drizzle with oil and season again.  Bake in the oven for 15 minutes while preparing the turkey breast.

Coat a large skillet with oil.  Over medium heat, sear the turkey breast skin-side down until crispy.  In a small bowl, combine honey, thyme leaves, salt, and pepper.  Remove the turkey from the skillet and brush with the honey paste.

Remove the roasting pan from the oven, then lay the turkey breast on top of the roasted bone.  Pour in the wine and chicken broth.  Cover with aluminum foil and return to the oven for 30 to 40 minutes.  Baste periodically.

Arrange the turkey breast and root vegetables on a serving platter.  Heat the pan juices on the stovetop over medium flame.  Scrape the roasting pan with a wooden spoon to loosen particles from bottom and sides.  Mix the flour with 3 tablespoons water to create a slurry and whisk into the pan sauce.  Reduce heat and simmer until thickened to sauce consistency, about 8 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve gravy alongside the turkey platter.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3           packages  wonton skins - (16 oz ea) -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
                        Salt -- as needed

     1/2         pound  radishes
     1/2         pound  carrots
  3        tablespoons  black sesame seeds
     1/4           cup  mint leaves
  3        tablespoons  grated fresh ginger
                        === MARINADE ===

  2          teaspoons  grated fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  black sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  mint leaves
     1/4           cup  peanut oil

To assemble:  Place a small amount of snow pea slaw on wonton cracker.  Top with 2 shrimp halves, cut-side down.  Garnish with black sesame seeds and mint before serving.

                        Reserved goose bones
                        === STUFFING ===
  2        tablespoons  butter -- plus
                        extra butter for coating geese
  1                     onion -- diced

                        plus
                        extra for coating geese
  2               cups  dry red wine
  2               cups  wild rice -- cooked
  2               cups  rye bread cubes -- dried
  1                cup  roasted chestnuts -- shelled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  caraway seeds
  1                cup  goose stock or chicken broth

To prepare the goose, it is necessary to remove the bones from the bird.  First, turn the bird upside down with the back facing you.  Cut out the backbone with poultry shears, be sure to cut close and not lose the underside of the breast meat attached to the back.  Now, at an angle, carefully slit along both sides of the rib cage with a boning knife to remove the breast plate.  Scrape away the meat as you cut.  Using a towel, grab the thigh bones from inside the goose and pull the leg towards you out of the socket, leaving the meat attached to the body.  Next, sever the wings at the joint as close to the body as possible.  Reserve the wings and bones for the stock.  Repeat the process with the other goose.

The geese are now boneless.  Carefully slice the breast to open them up and make an even thickness.  Smear the surface of each goose with 1 tablespoon of softened butter; season with salt and pepper.  Set aside while preparing the stock and stuffing.

To prepare the goose stock, coat a large stockpot with olive oil and place over medium heat.  Add the vegetables and saute for 2 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients, including all the geese bones, and cook for 1 hour.

To prepare the stuffing, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion, garlic, carrot and herbs.  Saute for 5 minutes then add the wine.  Simmer for about 10 minutes to reduce the wine to a tight paste.  Add the wild rice, rye bread, and chestnuts.  Stir and season with salt and pepper.  Scrape the skillet mixture into a large bowl, blend in the egg, caraway seed and 1 ladle full of goose stock; mix thoroughly until evenly moistened.  Spoon a layer of stuffing evenly to the edges of each goose and roll up like a jellyroll.  Tie securely with butcher's twine.

Rub the outside of the goose roasts with butter, sage and marjoram for added flavor.  Transfer the stuffed geese to a stovetop or conventional smoker and follow manufacture's directions.  Cook in a preheated 350 degree oven for 20 to 40 minutes until juices run clear.  Be careful not to overcook, as the meat would be extremely tough and dry.  Let stand 10 minutes to allow the juices to settle.  Cut off the twine and slice vertically to form pinwheels.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

To prepare the goose, it is necessary to remove the bones from the bird.  First, turn the bird upside down with the back facing you.  Cut out the backbone with poultry shears, be sure to cut close and not lose the underside of the breast meat attached to the back.  Now, at an angle, carefully slit along both sides of the rib cage with a boning knife to remove the breast plate.  Scrape away the meat as you cut.  Using a towel, grab the thigh bones from inside the goose and pull the leg towards you out of the socket, leaving the meat attached to the body.  Next, sever the wings at the joint as close to the body as possible.  Reserve the wings and bones for the stock.  Repeat the process with the other goose.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The geese are now boneless.  Carefully slice the breast to open them up and make an even thickness.  Smear the surface of each goose with 1 tablespoon of softened butter; season with salt and pepper.  Set aside while preparing the stock and stuffing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the goose stock, coat a large stockpot with olive oil and place over medium heat.  Add the vegetables and saute for 2 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients, including all the geese bones, and cook for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the stuffing, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion, garlic, carrot and herbs.  Saute for 5 minutes then add the wine.  Simmer for about 10 minutes to reduce the wine to a tight paste.  Add the wild rice, rye bread, and chestnuts.  Stir and season with salt and pepper.  Scrape the skillet mixture into a large bowl, blend in the egg, caraway seed and 1 ladle full of goose stock; mix thoroughly until evenly moistened.  Spoon a layer of stuffing evenly to the edges of each goose and roll up like a jellyroll.  Tie securely with butcher&apos;s twine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rub the outside of the goose roasts with butter, sage and marjoram for added flavor.  Transfer the stuffed geese to a stovetop or conventional smoker and follow manufacture&apos;s directions.  Cook in a preheated 350 degree oven for 20 to 40 minutes until juices run clear.  Be careful not to overcook, as the meat would be extremely tough and dry.  Let stand 10 minutes to allow the juices to settle.  Cut off the twine and slice vertically to form pinwheels.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  young collard greens - (abt 4 bunches)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- julienned
  2                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  2              large  ham hocks - (abt 2 lbs) -- smoked and cooked
  2                     bay leaves
  2             quarts  low sodium chicken broth
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        Seasoned salt -- to taste

To prepare the greens:  Cut away the tough stalks and stems from the collards, and discard any leaves that are bruised or yellow.  Fill the sink with water and salt (the salt helps to remove any impurities).  Wash the collards thoroughly to remove the grit, 2 or 3 times, until the water runs clear.  Dry thoroughly.  Stack up several leaves and hand shred them into ribbon-like pieces (chiffonade).  Repeat until all the leaves are shredded.

Coat a 6-quart stockpot with olive oil and place over medium heat.  Add the onion and garlic, stir to coat, then add the ham hocks and bay leaves; cook about 8 minutes.  Pack in the greens, pushing them down into the pot.  Add the broth, vinegar, sugar, and red pepper flakes.

Bring up to a hard boil for 10 minutes, until greens start to wilt.  Turn the greens over with a wooden spoon, do not stir.  Lower to a gentle boil, cover the pot, and let cook for 45 minutes.  Taste the "pot liquor" (broth) and check the seasoning, add seasoned salt.  Cover and let cook for 15 more minutes.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  unsalted butter
  2 1/2         ounces  red pepper sauce
     1/2           cup  water
  2                     garlic cloves
  2                     bay leaves
  12            pounds  turkey - (to 13)
  6            gallons  peanut oil*

* Some people have allergies to peanuts, and if serving to guests, please make them aware of the inclusion of this peanut product.

Combine butter, red pepper sauce, water, garlic, and bay leaves in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Boil the sauce for 10 minutes to reduce.  As it cooks, the color will deepen.  Allow the sauce to cool before injecting it into the turkey.  It is best to inject the turkey with the sauce at least 12 hours before frying.

Set up a 40-quart deep fryer with burner base and propane tank according to manufacturer's directions.  As a safety precaution, measure the amount of oil needed to fry by filling the pot first with water and covering the turkey by 1-inch.  You may want to put the turkey in a plastic bag for ease.  Remove the turkey and mark the water level on the side of the pot, this insures no spill over when working with hot oil.  Pour out the water, dry the pot, and turkey thoroughly.

Fill the pot with oil and heat to 350 degrees.  Have a deep fry thermometer attached to the pot.  Put the turkey on the fry stand and attach to the metal hanger that comes with the fry kit.  Slowly ease the turkey into the hot oil, long oven mitts and an apron are essential.

Keep a close eye as the oil bubbles up.  Turkey cooks 4 minutes per pound so check it at 45 minutes.  The internal temperature of the bird should read on a thermometer between 170 and 180 degrees.  Remove the turkey from the oil as carefully as it went in.

Set the turkey stand on a roasting pan to drain the excess oil.  Let the turkey rest for 15 minutes so the juices settle before removing and carving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  milk
     1/2           cup  cream
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                cup  cornmeal
  1                cup  fresh corn kernels -- roasted, and
                        cut from ears
  1              bunch  chives -- snipped
  3                     eggs -- separated

In a medium saucepan, heat milk, cream and butter until just boiling.  Whisk in cornmeal in a slow steady stream, stirring until mixture is smooth.

Remove from heat and stir in corn kernels and chives.  Beat egg yolks and stir into the mixture.  Beat egg whites until stiff and fold into the batter to lighten it.

Pour mixture into a greased 8- by 8-inch casserole pan, spread evenly with a spatula.  Bake 30 minutes in a preheated 350 degree oven until risen like a souffle.

Spoonbread will be puffed and golden brown; a knife inserted into the center should come out clean.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             large  sweet potatoes
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  toasted pecan pieces
  1                cup  miniature marshmallows

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Wash the sweet potatoes, scrubbing them well to remove any dirt.  With a fork, prick the sweet potatoes in a couple of spots and place them on a sheet pan.  Bake for about 45 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center goes in easily.

In a large bowl, mix the butter, brown sugar, and flour together until it's crumbly-looking.  Add the cinnamon, salt, pecans, and marshmallows; fold the streusel topping together to combine.

Slice the sweet potatoes lengthwise down the center and push the ends towards the middle so it opens up.  Stuff the sweet potatoes generously with the streusel topping and return to the oven.  Bake for another 20 minutes, or until the topping is bubbly and brown.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  short-grain white rice
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt

Before cooking the rice, rinse several times in running water until the water runs clear.  Drain in a colander for about 1 hour.  Cook on the stovetop or in an electric rice cooker according to package directions.

In a small saucepan over low heat, combine vinegar, sugar and salt.  Stir gently to dissolve salt and sugar.  Cool to room temperature.

While the rice is still warm, transfer to a large non-reactive bowl.  Gradually drizzle the vinegar mixture over the rice, fanning the rice as you go.  Use a rice paddle to mix gently without mashing the grains.  Keep the rice covered with a damp cloth at room temperature until ready to make sushi.  Do not refrigerate.

  6             pounds  sweet potatoes - (abt 6)
  2                     ripe bananas -- skins on
  2             ounces  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- softened
     1/2           cup  pure maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  ground cinnamon

Add the butter and maple syrup, puree until smooth.  Add the cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and salt; puree to combine.  Transfer to a shallow baking pan and smooth out the surface with a spatula.

In a skillet, cook the pecans in butter over low heat and sprinkle with salt.  Saute until well-coated, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes.  Transfer the pecans to paper towels to drain.  Arrange pecans on top of puree and sprinkle with brown sugar.  Bake at 300 degrees until heated through, about 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TEMPURA BATTER ===
  1                     egg yolk
  1                cup  ice water
  1                cup  rice flour
                        === TEMPURA DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  mirin or sake
     1/2           cup  Tamari soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  grated daikon radish
  1           teaspoon  ginger -- grated
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil -- for flavoring
                        frying oil
  1                cup  flour -- for dusting
                        === TRADITIONAL TEMPURA INGREDIENTS ===
     1/2         pound  large shrimp -- cleaned, tails on
     1/2         pound  scallops
  1                cup  broccoli florets
  1                     sweet potato -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/4" thick
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        sliced diagonally in strips
  4             ounces  Chinese green beans -- ends trimmed
  4             ounces  mushrooms
  5                     asparagus stalks -- ends trimmed
  1                     red bell pepper -- cut in strips
  2                     Japanese eggplants -- halved, and
                        cut into 1/4" slices

Tempura Batter:  In a mixing bowl, lightly beat egg yolk and pour in ice water, slightly mix.  Add the flour all at once, stroke a few times with a fork just until ingredients are loosely combined.  The batter should be somewhat lumpy.

Tempura Dipping Sauce:  In a small saucepan over low-medium heat, combine mirin, soy sauce and sugar.  Cook for 3 to 5 minutes until sugar dissolves.  Transfer to a bowl, add grated radish and ginger just before serving.  (Makes 1 cup)

Assembly:  Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil to 375 degrees in a wok or deep-fryer.  Flavor with sesame oil.  Dry the vegetables well.  Dust shrimp and vegetables in flour to soak up remaining moisture, shake off excess.  Dip the shrimp and vegetables into the batter one by one.  Drop 6 pieces at a time in hot oil.  Do not overcrowd the pan.  Fry until golden brown, turning once, about 3 minutes.  To keep the oil clean, skim the small bits of batter that float in the oil between batches.  Remove the fried pieces from the oil and drain on a paper towel for a few seconds.  Serve with dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  bleached all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  cake flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2             sticks  butter -- chilled and cubed
  3        tablespoons  vegetable shortening
     1/4           cup  sour cream
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten slightly

Combine dry ingredients in a chilled large stainless steel bowl.  Cut in butter with pastry blender or 2 knives and incorporate the fat thoroughly into the flour to resemble a consistency of coarse meal.  Add shortening, sour cream and lemon juice, mix well and refrigerate for at least 1 hour

Grease and flour a 9-inch pie pan.  Remove dough from refrigerator, divide mixture into 2 disks.  Keep 1 disk in the refrigerator until ready for top crust.  Roll dough out on a floured surface between waxed paper.  Carefully transfer the bottom crust to the pie pan and trim the overhanging excess.  Chill for 15 minutes to help set dough in the pan.

Brush bottom with egg yolk to seal.  Fill with your favorite fruit filling.  Roll out remaining disk as you did for the bottom crust.  Cover the pie with remaining dough.  Seal and crimp the edge.  Cut vents in the top crust.

Bake in the bottom half of a preheated 400 degree oven for 30 minutes.  Cool thoroughly before cutting.

This recipe yields 2 (9-inch) crusts.

Variation:  Substitute vegetable oil for shortening for a pat in the pan crust.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  sweet marsala -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sweet marsala
  8             ounces  mascarpone -- softened to
                        room temperature
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  brewed espresso coffee
  1              ounce  dark chocolate
     1/4           cup  rum
  1           teaspoon  natural vanilla extract
  48                    ladyfingers
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder

Cream together egg yolks and sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water.  Add 1/3 cup of the marsala and continue to whisk until mixture is thick and doubled in volume.  This is basically a zabaglione.  Remove from heat.  Stir in the mascarpone until completely blended.

In a chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream to soft peaks.  Fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture, to lighten.

In a small saucepan, combine espresso, chocolate, rum, vanilla, and remaining 2 tablespoons marsala.  Heat gently, and stir to dissolve the chocolate.  Then, chill the mixture to cool it down, about 15 minutes.

Quickly dip each ladyfinger in the chilled coffee mixture and arrange in a single layer on a 9- by 13-inch glass baking pan.  Do not soak the cookies or they will become too moist.  Spread 1/2 the mascarpone cream evenly with a spatula on top of the dipped ladyfingers.  Repeat with a second layer of dipped ladyfingers and remaining mascarpone cream.  Sprinkle top with cocoa powder.  Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ==== CHOCOLATE BUTTERCREAM FROSTING ===
  1                cup  butter
  1                cup  shortening
  3               cups  confectioners' sugar
     1/2           cup  cocoa powder
     2/3           cup  milk
  2          teaspoons  orange extract
  12            ounces  mini semisweet chocolate chips
                        === YELLOW LAYER CAKE ===
  4               cups  cake flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  4                     eggs -- plus
  2                     egg yolks -- well beaten
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  milk
                        === SUGAR GLAZE ===
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  rum

For Chocolate Buttercream Frosting:  In the bowl of an electric mixer, blend butter, shortening and sugar with the paddle attachment until creamy.  Add the cocoa to the butter mixture along with the milk and extract.  Continue to mix until well combined.  Turn off the mixer and gently fold in chocolate chips with a spatula.  Set frosting in the refrigerator to firm up to a spreadable consistency while the cake is prepared.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat 2 (9-inch) round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray, including sides.  Cut a sheet of parchment paper to fit the pan bottoms and lay in place.  Then spray the paper.

Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt, set aside.  In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter until smooth.  Gradually add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy.  Beat in the eggs, a little at a time.  Stir in the vanilla until well blended.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Gradually mix in the dry ingredients in 3 batches, alternating with the milk.  Beat for 1 minute after each addition to incorporate the ingredients and strengthen the cake's structure.  Mix until the batter is smooth.

Pour the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the surface with a spatula, the pans should be 2/3 full.  Place pans on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake springs back when touched.

Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto a wire rack, peel off the paper and let cool for at least 1 hour.  Level the tops of the cakes with a serrated knife if domed in the middle.  To divide each cake in half to give 4 layers: cut a vertical notch on the side of the cakes so you can easily line up the layers when assembling.  Place one hand flat on top and the serrated blade along the side of the cake.  Rotate the cake against the knife as you slice.  Carefully separate the layers and brush away any loose crumbs.

To make Sugar Glaze:  Combine sugar, water and rum in a small saucepan.  Boil for 2 to 3 minutes.  Brush the sugar glaze on the cake layers to moisten and add extra flavor.

Put a cardboard cake round or plate on a lazy Susan; so it easier to turn and frost the cake.  Lay 1 cake layer on the plate.  With a metal spatula, spread about 1/2 cup of chocolate buttercream frosting on top of the base.  Carefully place another cake layer on top.  Do this for the remaining 2 layers.

Frost the top and sides of the cake thoroughly.  Refrigerate for 45 minutes before decorating or cutting.

This recipe yields ?? servings.
