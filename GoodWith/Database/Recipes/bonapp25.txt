  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  red currant jelly
  6        tablespoons  whole-grain Dijon mustard
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground ginger
  9             pounds  fully-cooked bone-in ham

           Beet Carpaccio With Goat Cheese And Mint Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    beets - (abt 2" dia) -- trimmed
  1                cup  crumbled soft fresh goat cheese - -- (abt 5 oz)
  2        tablespoons  minced shallot
     1/3           cup  unseasoned rice vinegar
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh mint
     1/4           cup  walnut oil or olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh chives

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line rimmed baking sheet with foil.  Place beets on sheet (if using both light- and dark-colored beets, place them on separate sheets to prevent discoloration).  Sprinkle beets lightly with water.  Cover tightly with foil.  Bake until beets are tender when pierced with fork, about 40 minutes.  Cool on sheet.  Peel beets.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Place in resealable plastic bag; chill.)

Using cheese slicer or knife, slice beets very thinly.  Slightly overlap slices on 6 plates, dividing equally.  Sprinkle with cheese, then shallot, salt, and pepper.  Whisk vinegar, mint, oil, and sugar in small bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  Drizzle over beets.  Sprinkle with chives.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Thinly sliced beets (not beef) lay the foundation for this vibrant rendition of the Italian appetizer.  Use any assortment of small beets ó red, golden, purple, or candy-striped.  A local farmers' market will have the best selection.  The beets can be roasted and peeled one day before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 2/3           cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  3              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     3/4           cup  buttermilk
  2               cups  frozen blueberries
                        Powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour 10-inch-diameter Bundt pan.

Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl.

Using electric mixer, beat 1 2/3 cups sugar and butter in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Beat in eggs, 1 at a time.  Beat in orange peel and vanilla.  Beat in dry ingredients in 3 additions alternately with buttermilk in 2 additions.  Fold in blueberries.

Pour batter into prepared pan.  Bake until tester inserted near center of cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Cool cake in pan on rack 10 minutes.  Turn cake out onto rack and cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap in plastic and store at room temperature.)  Transfer cake to plate, sift powdered sugar over, and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Using frozen blueberries in the batter will keep the fruit from sinking to the bottom of the pan as the cake bakes.

  2              whole  lemons
  2 1/2         pounds  baby artichokes
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  8                     green onions -- chopped

Drain artichokes and add to skillet.  Add 1 cup water, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, thyme, bay leaf, and lemon peel.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper; bring to simmer.  Cover and simmer until artichokes are tender, adding more water by 1/4 cupfuls if mixture is dry and stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Rewarm, covered, over low heat, adding more water if dry.)  Mix in parsley; season with salt and pepper.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1            package  sliced bresaola - (4 oz)
                        = (available at Italian markets and some
                        specialty foods stores)
  54                    arugula leaves - (about)
  1             medium  fennel bulb -- halved lengthwise,
                        and thinly sliced crosswise
  1              piece  Manchego or Parmesan cheese - (4 oz) -- shaved into strips

Whisk olive oil and lemon juice in small bowl to blend; set dressing aside.

Place 1 bresaola slice on work surface with 1 long side parallel to edge.  Place 3 arugula leaves at 1 short end so that leaves extend past 1 long side.  Top with layer of sliced fennel, then 2 cheese strips.  Sprinkle with pepper.  Drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon dressing.

Starting at filled end, roll up bresaola, enclosing filling.  Arrange, seam-side down, on platter.  Repeat with remaining ingredients to form 18 rolls total.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Cover with plastic wrap; chill.  Before serving, let stand 30 minutes at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 18 rolls.

Comments:  Prosciutto is more familiar in this type of appetizer, but bresaola, beef fillet cured in a similar fashion, gives it a fresh interpretation.  When paired with golden Spanish Manchego, the combination is deliciously bold in flavor.

Comments:  Lemongrass lends a delicate flavor to this simple roast chicken from Market.  Begin marinating the chicken one day ahead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lemon -- halved
  6             medium  artichokes -- stems trimmed
                        to 1/2"
     1/2           cup  olive oil - (about)
  1              pound  onions -- chopped
  8              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  grated lemon peel - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  ground coriander
  2          teaspoons  Hungarian sweet paprika
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  8        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  8        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
  8        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint
  4             pounds  boneless skinless chicken thighs -- trim excess fat
  4               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  3                     fresh fennel bulbs -- trimmed, and
  1                     bulbs quartered vertically
  5              large  carrots - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" lengths

Fill large bowl with water; squeeze in juice from lemon.  Working with 1 artichoke at a time, break off enough outer leaves to expose pale green leaves.  Trim dark green areas off stem and base.  Quarter artichoke lengthwise; trim artichoke quarters to 1 1/2-inch lengths.  Scrape out choke; drop quarters into lemon water.

Heat 1/4 cup oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and sautÈ until translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add next 7 ingredients and 6 tablespoons each parsley, dill, and mint; sautÈ 3 minutes longer.  Scrape contents of skillet into heavy large pot; reserve skillet.

Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 1/3 of chicken and sautÈ until golden, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to pot with onion mixture.  Repeat with remaining chicken in 2 more batches, adding more oil by tablespoonfuls if needed.  Add broth to skillet; bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Transfer broth to pot; add fennel and carrots.  Drain artichokes and add to pot.

Bring tagine to boil.  Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until chicken is almost tender, about 20 minutes.  Uncover and simmer until chicken and all vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes longer.  Using slotted spoon, transfer chicken and vegetables to large bowl.

Boil sauce until reduced enough to coat spoon, about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Return chicken and vegetables to sauce.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.)

Rewarm tagine over medium heat.  Transfer to large bowl.  Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons each of parsley, dill, and mint.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

What to drink:  Abarbanel 2001 Syrah, Vin de Pays de l'Aude, France (kosher) or Clos du Bois 1999 Reserve Shiraz, Alexander Valley.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  2               cups  sifted cake flour
                        = (sifted, then measured)
  1                cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
                        = (preferably Dutch-process)
  1 1/4      teaspoons  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  1 1/2           cups  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature
  3              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  buttermilk -- plus
  2        tablespoons  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  lukewarm water
  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips
                        === FROSTING ===
  24            ounces  imported milk chocolate -- finely chopped
                        = (such as Lindt)
  3             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
  2 1/4           cups  whipping cream

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray three 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides with nonstick spray.  Line bottom of pans with parchment paper.

Whisk flour and next 4 ingredients in medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat brown sugar and butter in large bowl until fluffy, about 2 minutes.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in vanilla.  Beat in dry ingredients in 3 additions alternately with buttermilk in 2 additions.  Beat in 1/2 cup lukewarm water.  Stir in chocolate chips.

Divide batter among prepared pans (about 2 1/3 cups for each).  Smooth tops.  Bake cakes until tester inserted into center of cakes comes out clean, about 22 minutes.  Cool completely in pans on racks.  Invert cakes onto 9-inch-diameter cardboard rounds or tart pan bottoms (cakes are delicate).  Peel off parchment.

For Frosting:  Combine milk chocolate and bittersweet chocolate in large bowl.

Stir sugar and 1/2 cup water in medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 10 minutes.  Carefully and slowly add whipping cream (mixture will bubble vigorously).  Stir over low heat until any hard caramel bits dissolve and mixture is smooth.

Pour caramel over chocolate; let stand 1 minute to allow chocolate to soften, then whisk until chocolate is melted and smooth.  Chill chocolate-caramel frosting until completely cool, about 2 hours.  Let stand 1 hour at room temperature before continuing.

Using electric mixer, beat frosting just until color resembles milk chocolate and frosting is easily spreadable, about 1 minute (do not overbeat or frosting will become stiff and grainy).  If necessary to correct graininess, set bowl with frosting over saucepan of simmering water for 10-second intervals, whisking just until frosting is smooth and spreadable.

Place 1 cake layer on platter, flat-side up.  Spread 1 cup frosting evenly over top.  Top with second cake layer, flat-side up, pressing slightly to adhere.  Spread 1 cup frosting over top.  Top with third cake layer, rounded-side up, pressing slightly.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake, swirling decoratively.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover with cake dome and store at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  A classic chocolate layer cake with a new-fashioned, thick, and rich frosting.  This treat can be made up to two days ahead.

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray three 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides with nonstick spray.  Line bottom of pans with parchment paper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk flour and next 4 ingredients in medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat brown sugar and butter in large bowl until fluffy, about 2 minutes.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in vanilla.  Beat in dry ingredients in 3 additions alternately with buttermilk in 2 additions.  Beat in 1/2 cup lukewarm water.  Stir in chocolate chips.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide batter among prepared pans (about 2 1/3 cups for each).  Smooth tops.  Bake cakes until tester inserted into center of cakes comes out clean, about 22 minutes.  Cool completely in pans on racks.  Invert cakes onto 9-inch-diameter cardboard rounds or tart pan bottoms (cakes are delicate).  Peel off parchment.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Frosting:  Combine milk chocolate and bittersweet chocolate in large bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir sugar and 1/2 cup water in medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 10 minutes.  Carefully and slowly add whipping cream (mixture will bubble vigorously).  Stir over low heat until any hard caramel bits dissolve and mixture is smooth.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour caramel over chocolate; let stand 1 minute to allow chocolate to soften, then whisk until chocolate is melted and smooth.  Chill chocolate-caramel frosting until completely cool, about 2 hours.  Let stand 1 hour at room temperature before continuing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using electric mixer, beat frosting just until color resembles milk chocolate and frosting is easily spreadable, about 1 minute (do not overbeat or frosting will become stiff and grainy).  If necessary to correct graininess, set bowl with frosting over saucepan of simmering water for 10-second intervals, whisking just until frosting is smooth and spreadable.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1 cake layer on platter, flat-side up.  Spread 1 cup frosting evenly over top.  Top with second cake layer, flat-side up, pressing slightly to adhere.  Spread 1 cup frosting over top.  Top with third cake layer, rounded-side up, pressing slightly.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake, swirling decoratively.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover with cake dome and store at room temperature.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 12 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  A classic chocolate layer cake with a new-fashioned, thick, and rich frosting.  This treat can be made up to two days ahead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5              large  egg whites
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
  4               cups  long-shred unsweetened coconut -- lightly toasted
                        = (can be found at natural foods stores)
     3/4           cup  slivered almonds -- toasted, cooled,
                        and ground
  12            ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)

Preheat oven to 275 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.

Place egg whites in large bowl; scrape in seeds from vanilla bean.  Using electric mixer, beat egg whites until soft peaks form.  Gradually add sugar, beating until meringue is very thick (similar to marshmallow creme), about 5 minutes.  Fold in coconut, then almonds.  Drop batter by rounded tablespoonfuls onto prepared sheets, spacing mounds 1 1/2 inches apart.

Bake macaroons until pale beige outside and dry-looking (insides will still be soft), about 25 minutes.  Transfer baking sheets to racks; cool macaroons completely.  Transfer macaroons to work surface; re-line pans with clean parchment.

Place chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water.  Stir chocolate until smooth; remove from over water.  Dip bottom of 1 macaroon into melted chocolate to depth of 1/4 inch.  Place on prepared sheet, chocolate-side down.  Repeat dipping with remaining macaroons.  Chill until chocolate is firm, about 1 hour.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and keep refrigerated.  Let macaroons stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.)

This recipe yields 5 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        === ICING ===
  6             ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt or Baker's)
  3        tablespoons  whipping cream
     3/4      teaspoon  peppermint extract
                        === GLAZE ===
  6        tablespoons  whipping cream
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
                        White chocolate curls -- (optional)
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- (optional)
                        Halved strawberries -- (optional)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour 8-inch square metal cake pan.  Line bottom of pan with parchment paper.  Butter and flour parchment paper.

Stir chopped chocolate in top of double boiler set over simmering water until chocolate is melted and smooth.  Remove from over water.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in medium bowl until smooth.  Gradually add sugar and beat until well blended.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time, blending well after each addition.  Beat in melted chocolate and vanilla.  Add flour and cinnamon; beat just until blended.  Spoon cake batter into prepared pan; smooth top.

Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 25 minutes.  Cool cake in pan on rack 20 minutes.  Run small knife between edge of cake and pan to loosen.  Turn cake out onto rack; remove parchment paper.  Cool completely.

For Icing:  Stir white chocolate and whipping cream in top of double boiler set over simmering water until melted and smooth.  Remove from over water.  Stir in peppermint extract.  Spread icing evenly over top of cake.  Place cake in freezer until icing is firm, about 30 minutes, or refrigerate cake 1 hour.

For Glaze:  Bring cream to simmer in heavy small saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate; whisk until melted and smooth.  Cool chocolate until lukewarm but still pourable, about 5 minutes.

Place cake on rack set over baking sheet.  Pour half of glaze over top of cake.  Spread glaze evenly over top and sides of cake.  Freeze until glaze is set, about 10 minutes.  If necessary, rewarm remaining glaze just until pourable.  Pour remaining glaze over cake; spread glaze smoothly over top and sides of cake.  Refrigerate cake until glaze is firm, about 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep chilled.)  Let cake stand at room temperature at least 3 hours before serving.

Transfer brownie cake to platter.  Top cake with chocolate curls and garnish platter with mint sprigs and strawberries, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A layer of white chocolate-peppermint icing is sandwiched between the chewy brownie cake and a thick chocolate ganache glaze.  To make this treat, you'll need an eight-inch square metal cake pan and parchment paper, sold at cookware stores and well-stocked supermarkets.  For convenience, prepare the dessert a day ahead.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9             ounces  soft fresh goat cheese
     1/2           cup  chopped watercress
  1           teaspoon  truffle oil
  12                    thin slices white bread
  1              bunch  radishes -- very thinly sliced
     1/2                English hothouse cucumber -- peeled, sliced thin

Blend goat cheese, watercress, and truffle oil in processor until just combined.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place bread slices on work surface.  Spread each with goat cheese mixture, dividing equally.  Set aside 24 radish slices for garnish.  Top 6 bread slices with cucumber slices, then remaining radish slices.  Sprinkle with pepper.  Top with remaining bread slices, cheese-side down.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Wrap individually in paper towels; chill.)

Trim sandwich crusts.  Cut each sandwich into 4 squares.  Transfer to platter.  Top each with 1 radish slice and serve.

This recipe yields 24 pieces.

Comments:  Truffle oil lends an earthy flavor; it can be found at specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.  If you can't find the oil, these sandwiches will still be delicious without it.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  slender asparagus spears -- trimmed to 7"
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
  6          teaspoons  olive oil
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon peel
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6                     cod fillets - (6 oz ea) -- pinbones removed
  6             ounces  paper-thin prosciutto slices -- halved lengthwise

Cook asparagus in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain.  Transfer to bowl of ice water to cool.  Drain well.

Mash garlic and 1 teaspoon salt to paste in small bowl.  Melt butter with 1 tablespoon oil in small nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add garlic paste; stir until pale golden, about 1 minute.  Stir in lemon juice, peel, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.  Remove from heat.

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Cut out six 12-inch squares of parchment paper.  Place 1 parchment square on work surface.  Drizzle 1 teaspoon oil over parchment.  Place 1 cod fillet in center of parchment.  Spoon 1/6 of garlic-lemon mixture over fish.  Cover with 1/6 of asparagus spears.  Arrange 1/6 of prosciutto slices over.  Fold 2 opposite sides of parchment in over fish and vegetables, then fold in remaining 2 sides, enclosing completely.  Fasten parchment edges together with paper clips to seal packet.  Place on large rimmed baking sheet.  Repeat procedure with remaining parchment, oil, fish, garlic-lemon mixture, asparagus, and prosciutto.  (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Refrigerate.)

Bake fish until just opaque in center (parchment will turn golden brown), about 12 minutes.  Transfer 1 parchment packet to each of 6 plates.  Open parchment packets and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Each serving is baked en papillote, or wrapped individually in parchment paper to lock in steam for a more succulent result.

Test-kitchen tip:  Use tweezers or needle-nose pliers to remove any pinbones that protrude from the cod fillets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  fresh fava beans -- shelled
                        = (or 5 cups frozen double-peeled fava
                        beans [from two 16-oz packages], thawed)
  2        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1              piece  beef tenderloin - (1 1/2 lbs) -- halved lengthwise,
                        then crosswise into 1/2"-thick slices
  2              large  onions -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2              large  egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint

Cook fresh fava beans in large pot of boiling salted water 2 minutes.  Drain favas.  Place in large bowl of ice water.  Drain.  Slip outer skin off each bean and discard skin; place beans in large bowl.  (If using frozen beans, do not blanch.)

Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Working in batches, add beef and sautÈ just until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes.  Transfer beef to medium bowl.

Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet over medium heat.  Add onions; sautÈ until tender and golden, about 15 minutes.  Add fava beans; sautÈ 5 minutes.  Remove from heat; cool 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, whisk whipping cream, lemon juice, egg yolks, salt, and pepper in small bowl to blend.  Stir cream mixture into fava bean mixture.  Cook over medium-low heat just until sauce thickens slightly and mixture is heated through, about 6 minutes (do not boil).  Add beef and stir until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Transfer fricassee to rimmed platter.  Sprinkle with mint.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A fusion of flavors and technique from two cuisines makes this main course taste new.  The cooking method is based on an Italian fricassea made with egg yolks and cream; the combination of favas and mint is Middle Eastern.  The resulting dish is absolutely delicious.  Serve with plenty of crusty bread to mop up the sauce.

Market tip:  Fresh fava beans are available at Middle Eastern markets, some farmers' markets, and some supermarkets.  Frozen double-peeled fava beans are sold at Middle Eastern markets; they don't require blanching before using in this recipe.  If available, fresh lima beans can also be substituted.

Transfer fried cheese to plates.  Spoon warm sauce over cheese.

This recipe yields 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  Alexis Walker of Corvallis, Oregon, writes: "After many attempts to get a reservation, we finally succeeded in dining at Genoa restaurant in Portland.  It was definitely worth the wait.  The fried mozzarella was a revelation.  Would you ask the chef for the recipe?"

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  4             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  2        tablespoons  water
  3              large  eggs -- separated
     1/4           cup  sugar
                        === FILLING ===
  5              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  Kahl˙a
                        = (or other coffee liqueur)
  1                cup  chilled heavy whipping cream
  2 1/2      teaspoons  instant espresso powder
  3              large  egg whites
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped bittersweet or
                        semisweet chocolate
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  Kahl˙a
                        = (or other coffee liqueur)
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  2        tablespoons  whole coffee beans

For Cake:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Lightly butter two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line bottom of pans with parchment paper.

Combine chocolate and 2 tablespoons water in top of double boiler set over simmering water.  Stir until chocolate is smooth.  Remove from over water.  Transfer chocolate to large bowl; cool 5 minutes.  Whisk egg yolks into chocolate.

Beat whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Add sugar 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff and glossy.  Fold 1/4 of whites into chocolate to lighten.  Gently fold in remaining whites in 2 additions just until combined and being careful not to deflate batter.

Divide batter between prepared pans (layers will be very thin).  Bake until cakes begin to pull away from sides of pans and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 10 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on rack 1 hour.  Carefully invert cakes onto 9-inch-diameter cardboard rounds or tart pan bottoms.  Cool cakes completely.  Peel off parchment paper.

For Filling:  Line 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 1 1/2-inch-high sides with plastic wrap, leaving 5-inch overhang.

Whisk egg yolks, 1/4 cup sugar, and Kahl˙a in medium metal bowl to blend.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water).  Using electric mixer, beat until yolk mixture is thick and instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers 140 degrees for 3 minutes, about 9 minutes total.  Remove bowl from over water.  Continue to beat mixture until cool to touch, about 3 minutes.

Beat whipping cream and espresso powder in another medium bowl until firm peaks form.  Fold cream mixture into yolk mixture in 2 additions.  Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff and glossy.  Gently fold whites into yolk mixture in 2 additions.  Fold in chopped chocolate.

Carefully place 1 cake layer in prepared pan (cake layer is very delicate).  Spread filling evenly over cake (filling layer will be thick).  Top with second cake layer; press gently to adhere.  Fold plastic overhang over cake, then cover with foil.  Freeze cake overnight.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)

For Glaze:  Bring first 3 ingredients to simmer in small saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate; whisk until smooth.  Transfer 1/2 cup glaze to small bowl; chill until cool and very slightly thickened but easily spreadable (if too thick, glaze will not spread smoothly on frozen cake), about 10 minutes.

Remove foil and plastic wrap from top of cake.  Invert cake onto 9-inch-diameter cardboard round or tart pan bottom; place on rack set over rimmed baking sheet.  Working quickly, spread thin layer of chilled glaze over top and sides of cake.  Freeze until glaze is set, about 1 hour.

Rewarm remaining glaze over low heat until just warm and pourable.  Transfer to 1-cup measuring cup.  Pour half of glaze over top of cake.  Working quickly and using offset spatula, spread glaze over top, allowing excess to run down sides of cake; spread quickly over sides (glaze will harden quickly on frozen cake).  Pour remaining glaze over top of cake; spread quickly and smoothly over top and sides.  Sprinkle coffee beans around top edge of cake.  Freeze until firm and glaze is set, at least 4 hours.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover; keep frozen.)

To serve, dip long thin sharp knife into hot water, then wipe dry and cut cake into wedges, pulling knife out at bottom of cake to avoid tearing glaze and repeating for each slice.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Thin, delicate layers of flourless chocolate cake are filled with silky chocolate-espresso mousse.  Begin making this dessert at least one day ahead, and serve it straight from the freezer; the frozen mousse filling has the texture of soft ice cream.

Comments:  Mark Taylor of West Hartford, Connecticut, writes: "I started cooking out of necessity when I first graduated from college, since I couldn't afford to eat out.  Having grown up watching my mother cook for our large family, I used her recipes.  She was always trying new dishes whenever we had guests and sharing her adventurous attitude toward eating.  These days, even though my wife and I both work, we still cook several times a week.  Now I tend to rely on recipes I've picked up from restaurants and friends.  I enjoy experimenting with different ingredients and figuring out new ways to improve a recipe, as I've done with the one here."

Serve the fish and sauce over couscous.

Comments:  Mark Taylor of West Hartford, Connecticut, writes: "I started cooking out of necessity when I first graduated from college, since I couldn't afford to eat out.  Having grown up watching my mother cook for our large family, I used her recipes.  She was always trying new dishes whenever we had guests and sharing her adventurous attitude toward eating.  These days, even though my wife and I both work, we still cook several times a week.  Now I tend to rely on recipes I've picked up from restaurants and friends.  I enjoy experimenting with different ingredients and figuring out new ways to improve a recipe, as I've done with the one here."

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     sheets frozen puff pastry - (17.3-oz pkg) -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  4                     leeks, white and pale green parts only -- sliced
     1/4           cup  water
     2/3           cup  whipping cream
  4             ounces  Camembert cheese -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1              large  egg
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  1              pinch  ground nutmeg

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Roll out each pastry sheet on lightly floured surface to 12-inch square.  Stack squares and roll to 15-inch square.  Using 14-inch pizza pan as guide, cut stacked dough into 14-inch round.  Crimp edge of dough to form 1/4-inch rim.  Transfer to pizza pan or baking sheet.  Freeze 10 minutes.

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add leeks and 1/4 cup water; cook until leeks are tender, about 15 minutes.  Season leeks with salt; set aside to cool.  Bring cream to simmer in medium saucepan over medium heat.  Reduce heat to low; add Camembert and stir until melted.  Remove from heat and cool 5 minutes.  Whisk in egg, cayenne, and nutmeg.  Set custard aside.

Sprinkle Parmesan over crust.  Spread leeks over.  Drizzle custard over.  Bake until bottom is golden, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to rack; cool 10 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  This beautiful appetizer boasts a delicate balance of leek and cheese flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  4          teaspoons  chilled whipping cream -- or more
  1                     egg white -- beaten to blend
                        === FILLING ===
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
  4              large  egg yolks
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated lemon peel - (packed)
                        Lemon slices -- (optional)

For Crust:  Combine flour, sugar, and salt in processor; blend 5 seconds.  Using on/off turns, blend in butter until coarse meal forms.  Add 4 teaspoons cream.  Using on/off turns, blend until moist clumps form, adding more cream by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap and chill at least 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Roll out dough on floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Fold overhang in, pressing to form double-thick sides.  Bake crust until golden, pressing with back of fork if crust bubbles, about 18 minutes (small cracks may appear).  Brush inside of hot crust twice with egg white.  Maintain oven temperature.

For Filling:  Whisk 3/4 cup sugar, cream, yolks, and eggs in bowl to blend well.  Mix in lemon juice and lemon peel.  Pour filling into warm crust.  Bake until filling is slightly puffed at edges and set in center, about 30 minutes.  Cool completely, about 1 hour.

Preheat broiler.  Place tart on baking sheet.  Cover edge of crust with foil to prevent burning.  Sprinkle tart with 2 tablespoons sugar.  Broil tart until sugar melts and caramelizes, turning sheet for even browning, about 2 minutes.  Transfer tart to rack.  Cool until topping is crisp, about 1 hour.

Push tart pan bottom up, releasing tart.  Place on platter, garnish with lemon slices, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LEMON CURD ===
  1                cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  3              large  eggs
  3              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        === CAKE ===
  6              large  eggs -- separated
  14       tablespoons  sugar
  1 3/4           cups  sifted cake flour
                        = (sifted, then measured)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === SYRUP ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  boiling water
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
                        === FILLING AND FROSTING ===
  2               cups  chilled heavy whipping cream
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3                     containers chilled mascarpone cheese - (8 
                        = (Italian cream cheese available at
                        Italian markets and many supermarkets)

For Lemon Curd:  Whisk first 4 ingredients in medium metal bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water).  Whisk constantly until thickened and instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160 degrees, about 10 minutes.  Remove bowl from over water.  Add butter; whisk until melted.

Transfer 1 cup curd to small bowl for spreading on cake layers.  Reserve remaining curd for filling.  Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of both curds.  Chill overnight.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)

For Cake:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Line bottom of two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides with parchment paper (do not grease pans or parchment).

Using electric mixer, beat egg yolks and 7 tablespoons sugar in large bowl until mixture is very thick and slowly dissolving ribbons form when beaters are lifted, about 4 minutes.

Using clean dry beaters, beat whites in another large bowl until soft peaks form.  Add remaining 7 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff and glossy.

Fold half of whites into yolk mixture, then sift half of flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt over and gently fold in until incorporated.  Fold in remaining whites, then sift remaining flour over and fold in just until combined, being careful not to deflate batter.

Divide batter between pans; smooth tops.  Bake until tester inserted into center of cakes comes out clean, about 15 minutes.  Cool in pans on racks.

Run knife around edge of pans to loosen cakes.  Invert cakes onto 9-inch-diameter cardboard rounds, tapping on work surface if necessary to release cakes.  Cut each cake horizontally in half (layers will be thin).  Peel off parchment.

For Syrup:  Place sugar in small metal bowl.  Add 1/2 cup boiling water; stir to dissolve sugar.  Stir in lemon juice.

For Filling And Frosting:  Beat whipping cream and sugar in large bowl until peaks form.  Add mascarpone to lemon curd in medium bowl; whisk until blended.  Fold whipped cream into lemon-mascarpone mixture.

Place 1 cake layer, flat-side up, on platter.  Brush with 1/4 of syrup.  Spread 1/4 cup lemon curd over, then 1 cup lemon-mascarpone filling.  Top with second cake layer; brush with 1/4 of syrup and spread with 1/4 cup lemon curd and 1 cup lemon-mascarpone filling.  Repeat with third cake layer, syrup, lemon curd, and filling.  Top with fourth cake layer.  Brush with remaining syrup, then spread remaining lemon curd over.

Spoon 2 cups lemon-mascarpone filling into pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch star tip (to be used for rosettes).  Spread remaining lemon-mascarpone filling as a frosting over sides of cake.  Pipe small rosettes of frosting over top of cake, covering completely.  Cover cake with cake dome; refrigerate at least 6 hours and up to 1 day.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  You'll need a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch star tip to create the decorative rosettes.  Begin making this cake two days before you plan to serve it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PANNA COTTA ===
                        Vegetable oil
  1                cup  whole milk
  1                cup  whipping cream
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  5        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  unflavored gelatin
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                cup  crËme fraÓche*
  2        tablespoons  grated lemon peel
                        === SAUCE ===
  3               cups  frozen blackberries - (abt 12 oz) -- thawed, drained,
                        and juices reserved
  3        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  3        tablespoons  crËme de cassis - (optional)
                        = (black-currant-flavored liqueur)

* Note:  Available at some supermarkets.  If unavailable, heat 1 cup whipping cream to lukewarm (85 degrees).  Remove from heat; mix in 2 tablespoons buttermilk.  Cover; let stand in warm draft-free area until slightly thickened, 24 to 48 hours, depending on temperature of room.  Chill until ready to use.

For Panna Cotta:  Lightly oil six 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups.  Mix milk and cream in heavy medium saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Bring to simmer.  Remove from heat.  Cover; let steep 30 minutes.  Remove vanilla bean.

Pour lemon juice into small bowl; sprinkle gelatin over.  Let stand until gelatin softens, about 10 minutes.  Stir sugar and gelatin mixture into milk mixture.  Stir over low heat just until sugar and gelatin dissolve, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in crËme fraÓche and lemon peel.  Divide among ramekins.  Cover; chill until set, at least 6 hours or overnight.

For Sauce:  Puree 2/3 of blackberries and all reserved juices, brown sugar, and crËme de cassis, if desired, in blender.  Strain mixture into medium bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible.  Discard solids in strainer.  Stir remaining blackberries into sauce.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Run small knife around each panna cotta.  Place bottoms of ramekins, 1 at a time, in bowl of hot water 45 seconds.  Place plate atop ramekin.  Hold plate and ramekin together; invert, shaking gently, to turn out panna cotta.  Serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  For convenience, chill these individual eggless custards overnight before serving.  The sauce can also be made a day ahead.

                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  sweetened flaked coconut -- toasted, cooled
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        === FILLING ===
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated lemon peel - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  1              pinch  salt
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line 8- by 8- by 2-inch metal baking pan with foil, leaving overhang.  Butter foil.

Combine flour, sugar, and salt in processor; blend 5 seconds.  Add coconut and butter; process until mixture resembles fine meal and begins to clump together.  Gather dough into ball.  Press dough evenly over bottom of prepared pan.  Bake crust until golden at edges, about 25 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare Filling:  Combine 3/4 cup sugar, eggs, lemon juice, lemon peel, flour, baking powder, and salt in processor.  Blend filling until smooth.

Remove crust from oven.  Pour filling evenly over hot crust.  Return to oven and bake until filling begins to brown at edges and is just set and springy to touch in center, about 30 minutes.  Transfer pan to rack; cool lemon bars completely.

Using foil as aid, transfer lemon bars to work surface.  Flatten foil edges.  Cut into 16 bars.  Sift powdered sugar over.  (Can be made 5 days ahead.  Store airtight in single layer in refrigerator.)

This recipe yields 16 bars.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MERINGUES ===
  4              large  egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1                cup  sugar
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
  8                     fresh mint sprigs - (4" long)
  5              large  egg yolks
  6        tablespoons  sugar
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
                        Additional fresh mint sprigs

For Meringues:  Preheat oven to 225 degrees.  Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.

Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat until stiff and glossy, about 8 minutes.

Using generous 1/3 cup meringue for each, scoop 8 dollops of meringue onto prepared baking sheet, spacing apart.  Using back of spoon, make 2 1/2-inch-wide indentation in center of each meringue, spreading meringues to form 3 1/2-inch-diameter nests.

Bake meringues until crisp, about 1 1/2 hours.  Cool.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

For Filling:  Bring 1/2 cup cream to simmer in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add 8 mint sprigs; remove from heat.  Cover; let steep 30 minutes.  Strain mixture into bowl; discard mint.

Combine egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon peel in heavy medium saucepan.  Whisk constantly over medium-low heat until mixture thickens and instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160 degrees, about 5 minutes.  Transfer custard to glass bowl; whisk in mint-infused cream.  Refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour.

Using electric mixer, beat remaining 1/2 cup cream in medium bowl until peaks form.  Fold into lemon mixture.  (Filling can be made 6 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Spoon filling into meringue shells.  Garnish with additional mint sprigs.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The "tart shells" are crisp meringues; they're filled with a soft, mint-infused lemon cream.  The meringue shells can be baked one day before serving the dessert.

For Pistachio Crunch:  Place large sheet of foil on work surface; butter foil.  Combine sugar, butter, and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves and butter melts, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush.  Increase heat to medium-high and boil until syrup is medium amber color, stirring constantly, about 12 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Immediately add baking soda (mixture will foam up), then nuts and stir to blend well.  Spread nut mixture onto prepared foil, separating nuts.  Cool completely.  Chop crunch into 1/4- to 1/3-inch pieces.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

For Frosting:  Bring 3/4 cup cream to simmer in heavy medium saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and salt; stir until smooth.  Transfer frosting base to bowl.  Cover; chill overnight.

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour three 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Gradually add 1 3/4 cups sugar, beating until well blended.  Beat in vanilla and lemon peel.  Beat in flour mixture alternately with milk in 3 additions each.

Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in another large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating until stiff but not dry.  Fold whites into batter in 3 additions.  Divide batter among prepared pans.

Bake cakes until golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on racks 15 minutes.  Cut around pan sides and turn cakes out onto racks.  Turn cakes right side up and cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap in foil and store at room temperature.)

Using serrated knife, cut off mounded tops of cake layers to level.  Place 1 cake layer on platter, trimmed-side up.  Spread with half of lemon curd.  Top with second cake layer, trimmed-side up.  Spread with remaining lemon curd.  Top with third cake layer, trimmed-side down.

Whisk remaining 1 3/4 cups chilled cream into frosting base to loosen.  Using electric mixer, beat until frosting holds stiff peaks.  Spread frosting over top and sides of cake.  Chill until frosting is firm, at least 3 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome; keep chilled.)

Press crunch lightly into frosting on sides and top edge of cake.  (Can be prepared 1 hour ahead and refrigerated.)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Lemon curd separates the layers of this fine-crumbed, very-special-occasion cake.  Get started at least one day ahead: The frosting base and lemon curd must chill overnight before using.  For the frosting, high-quality white chocolate (such as Lindt or Perugina) works best.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2              large  egg yolks
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-grated lemon peel - (packed)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  chilled whipping cream
  1              quart  vanilla ice cream
     3/4           cup  raspberry sorbet
  2               cups  fresh raspberries
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- (optional)
                        Lemon peel

Whisk sugar, lemon juice, yolks, peel, and salt to blend in top of double boiler.  Place over simmering water (do not allow bottom of pan to touch water).  Whisk until mixture thickens and thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160 degrees, about 6 minutes.  Transfer mixture to medium bowl.  Chill until cold, about 45 minutes.

Beat cream in another medium bowl until cream holds peaks.  Fold into lemon mixture in 3 additions.  Cover and chill at least 6 hours and up to 1 day.

Line six 3/4-cup custard cups with foil, leaving generous overhang.  Slightly soften quart of ice cream in microwave at low setting in 10-second intervals.  Measure 1/2 cup ice cream and place in 1 prepared custard cup.  Using back of teaspoon and dipping spoon in glass of warm water as needed, press ice cream in even layer over bottom and up sides of cup, creating hollow in center.  Place cup in freezer.  Repeat with remaining 5 prepared cups.  Return remaining ice cream in quart to freezer.  Freeze ice cream in cups 1 hour.

Spoon 2 tablespoons sorbet into hollow in center of each cup and pack firmly.  Return cups to freezer for 1 hour.

Divide lemon cream among cups, smoothing tops.  Freeze 1 hour.

Slightly resoften remaining ice cream in quart container in microwave at low setting in 10-second intervals.  Spread 2 tablespoons ice cream over lemon cream in each cup, covering completely.  Fold foil overhang over bombes to cover; freeze at least 3 hours and up to 2 days.

Open foil on bombes; turn bombes out onto dishes.  Peel off foil.  Spoon fresh berries alongside.  Garnish with mint sprigs, if desired, and lemon peel.

This recipe yields 6 bombes.

Comments:  Vanilla ice cream surrounds a soft lemon-cream and raspberry-sorbet center.

Comments:  Mark Taylor of West Hartford, Connecticut, writes: "I started cooking out of necessity when I first graduated from college, since I couldn't afford to eat out.  Having grown up watching my mother cook for our large family, I used her recipes.  She was always trying new dishes whenever we had guests and sharing her adventurous attitude toward eating.  These days, even though my wife and I both work, we still cook several times a week.  Now I tend to rely on recipes I've picked up from restaurants and friends.  I enjoy experimenting with different ingredients and figuring out new ways to improve a recipe, as I've done with the one here."

Remove bowl from over water.  Quickly add chilled butter cubes to curd; whisk until butter is melted.  Press sheet of plastic wrap directly onto surface of lime-ginger curd; refrigerate curd overnight.  (Lime-ginger curd can be made 3 days ahead.  Keep covered and refrigerated.)

For Cake:  Simmer mango nectar in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 20 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Cool mango syrup to room temperature.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Line bottom of two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides with parchment paper (do not grease cake pans or parchment paper).

Sift flour, 6 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt into medium bowl.  Whisk egg yolks, canola oil, lime peel, and 6 tablespoons mango syrup in large bowl to blend (reserve remaining mango syrup for glaze).  Add dry ingredients; whisk to blend.

Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in another large bowl until soft peaks form.  Add remaining 6 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff and glossy.  Fold 1/3 of egg whites into yolk mixture, then fold in remaining whites in 2 additions.

Divide batter between prepared pans.  Bake cakes until golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 22 minutes.  Cool cakes completely in pans on rack.  Run small knife around edge of pans to loosen cakes.  Carefully invert cakes onto 9-inch-diameter cardboard rounds or tart pan bottoms; tap sharply on work surface if necessary to release cakes from pans.  Peel off parchment paper.

For Glaze And Topping:  Boil sugar, lime juice, and remaining 6 tablespoons mango syrup in heavy small saucepan until liquid is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 3 minutes.  Chill glaze until cold, about 15 minutes.

Place 1 cake layer, flat-side up, on platter.  Spread 2 cups lime-ginger curd over top of cake (reserve remaining curd for another use).  Chill cake until curd firms up slightly, about 2 hours.  Top with second cake layer, flat-side down, pressing gently to adhere.

Beat whipping cream and 2 tablespoons glaze in bowl until firm peaks form.  Spread cream over top (not sides) of cake.  Slightly overlap mango slices in concentric circles atop cream.  Rewarm remaining glaze just to soften.  Brush glaze over mango slices.  Chill cake at least 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome and keep chilled.)

Cut cake into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Begin making the lime-ginger curd one day before baking the cake.  The assembled dessert can be chilled overnight before serving.

  1                     chicken - (abt 4 lbs) -- quartered
  3             quarts  water
  12                    green onions -- coarsely chopped

  1                cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        Matzo Balls -- (see recipe)

Cook onion and ginger in medium skillet over high heat until charred, turning occasionally with tongs, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to work surface.  Cut ginger into thin rounds.  Cut 2 inches from bottom of each lemongrass stalk and quarter lengthwise (discard remainder of stalks).

Place chicken in large pot.  Add 3 quarts water; bring to boil.  Skim foam from surface.  Add green onions, peppercorns, and 1 teaspoon salt to pot.  Add charred onion, ginger, and lemongrass.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Partially cover pot; simmer 1 hour.

Cool uncovered broth slightly.  Strain and return to same pot (reserve chicken for another use).  Spoon fat from surface of broth and reserve for matzo balls, if desired.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Chill soup and reserved fat until cold, then cover and keep chilled.)

Rewarm broth.  Add cilantro and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Place 2 warm matzo balls in each of 8 bowls.  Ladle broth over.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

What to drink:  The menu's sweet-tart flavors call for a floral Riesling or spicy Syrah.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  old-fashioned oats
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  12       tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut into pieces
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
     1/3           cup  dried currants
  1              large  egg yolk -- beaten to blend
                        Additional sugar

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Flour large baking sheet.

Blend first 6 ingredients in processor until oats are coarsely ground.  Add butter; cut in using on/off turns until coarse meal forms.  Transfer to bowl.  Add beaten whole egg and buttermilk.  Using fork, stir to incorporate.  Mix in currants (dough will be sticky).  Turn dough out onto floured surface.

Using floured hands, shape dough into 8-inch round.  Using floured 1 3/4-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out scones.  Gather scraps, reshape, and cut out more scones.  Transfer to sheet.  Brush tops with yolk.  Sprinkle with additional sugar.

Bake scones until golden, about 18 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 30 scones.

Comments:  A modern recipe from a modern woman:  This is based on a recipe from my friend Joanne Rosen, a high-powered attorney who balances her torts and tarts, her husband and her children, with great finesse.  Accompany the scones with English clotted cream (or crËme fraÓche) and honey.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  small boiling potatoes
  6              large  eggs
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh chives -- plus
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chives
  1           teaspoon  salt

  4                     bacon slices -- coarsely chopped
                        Butter -- (optional)

Cook potatoes in pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 30 minutes.  Drain.  Cool slightly.  Peel, halve, and thinly slice potatoes.

Whisk eggs, 1/3 cup chives, salt, and pepper in bowl.  Cook bacon in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels.  Reserve 1 tablespoon drippings in skillet; pour remainder into cup.

Comments:  Donna Knowlton of Atlanta, Georgia, writes:  "As the oldest of five children growing up in rural West Virginia, I was always helping in the kitchen.  Today I mostly cook pasta and seafood dishes because they're so easy.  My husband is a doctor and works long hours, but we still like sharing a meal at the end of the day.  I don't want to be in the kitchen late at night making something complicated, so I rely on dishes that can be ready in minutes."

            Pink Grapefruit, Strawberry, And Champagne Granita

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  sugar -- divided
     3/4           cup  water
  1                cup  small strawberries - (abt 6 oz) -- hulled
     3/4           cup  fresh pink or ruby grapefruit juice
  2 1/4           cups  chilled brut Champagne
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  9          teaspoons  mascarpone cheese
                        = (available at Italian markets and some
                        supermarkets)
  18             whole  small strawberries

Stir 3/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup water in large saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Cool.

Puree 1 cup strawberries in processor.  Whisk 1/2 cup puree into sugar syrup.  Mix in grapefruit juice, then Champagne.  Pour mixture into 8-inch square metal baking pan.  Freeze mixture until firm, stirring every 2 hours, about 6 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover; keep frozen.)

Mix remaining 1/2 cup sugar and lemon peel in pie plate.  Spread 1/2 teaspoon mascarpone around pointed tip half of each whole strawberry.  Dip in lemon sugar to coat mascarpone.

Moisten rims of 6 Martini glasses with water; dip rims into remaining lemon sugar.  Scrape fork across surface of granita to form ice shavings.  Mound granita in glasses.  Garnish with sugared berries and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Use a Microplane grater or the smallest holes on a box grater to remove the lemon peel in thin, fine pieces.  Any delicate buttery cookies ó such as pirouettes, small shortbreads, or tender madeleines ó would be delicious with the granita.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  To coat Martini glass rims with sugar, barely moisten fingertips and run around edge of each glass, then dip rims into sugar mixture.  Keep the coated glasses in the freezer for up to two days before serving the granita.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The olives can marinate before starting the stew, which cooks in just over 30 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
  6              large  artichokes
  1                cup  walnuts -- plus
  2        tablespoons  walnuts -- toasted
  1                     container whole-milk ricotta cheese - (16 
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
     3/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  dry white wine

Fill large bowl with cold water; add lemon juice.  Cut off stem and top 2 inches from 1 artichoke.  Using scissors, cut off pointy ends of outer artichoke leaves.  Using melon baller, scoop out fuzzy choke from center of artichoke, forming opening.  Place artichoke in lemon water.  Repeat with remaining artichokes.

Bring large pot of salted water to boil.  Add artichokes and cook until artichoke hearts are tender when pierced with metal skewer, about 15 minutes.  Drain.  Cool to room temperature.

Coarsely chop walnuts in processor.  Transfer 2 tablespoons chopped walnuts to small bowl and reserve.  Add ricotta cheese, 1/4 cup olive oil, garlic, salt, white pepper, and nutmeg to walnuts in processor; process until well blended.  Transfer ricotta mixture to bowl.  Stir in parsley.  Season to taste with additional salt and white pepper.

Using teaspoon and fingertips as aids, spoon ricotta mixture into center of each artichoke, then spoon some mixture between artichoke leaves.  Pour remaining 1/4 cup olive oil into 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass or ceramic baking dish.  Arrange stuffed artichokes in dish.  (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Pour 3/4 cup water and wine into bottom of dish with artichokes.  Cover dish with foil and bake until artichokes are very tender and stuffing is slightly firm, about 40 minutes.  Uncover and sprinkle reserved 2 tablespoons chopped walnuts over artichokes.  Bake uncovered 10 minutes longer.  Let stand 10 minutes and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This dish is inspired by the marriage of ricotta and walnuts that makes Ligurian pansotti (triangular "pot-bellied" ravioli) with walnut sauce a timeless favorite.  Serve the artichokes as a plated first course or quarter them and offer as part of an antipasto platter along with prosciutto, roasted red peppers, and marinated olives and mushrooms.

Market tip:  Be sure to choose large, deep green artichokes that are heavy for their size and with firm leaves that are fairly tighly closed.  Avoid artichokes with split or ragged leaves.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  carrot -- peeled
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  8             ounces  slender asparagus spears -- trimmed, and
                        cut on diagonal into 1" pieces
  1             medium  zucchini -- trimmed, quartered
                        lengthwise, seeded, diagonally cut 1" pcs
  1             medium  yellow crookneck squash -- trimmed, quartered
                        lengthwise, seeded, diagonally cut 1" pcs
  4 1/2           cups  low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
  1              large  white onion -- finely chopped
  1 3/4           cups  arborio rice - (11 1/2 oz)
                        = (or medium-grain white rice)
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
  8                     baby carrots -- peeled, and
                        tops trimmed to 1/2"
  1 1/3           cups  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - (4 oz)
  1                cup  frozen peas -- thawed
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut 1" pieces
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil leaves
     1/4           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
                        Additional freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Cut 1/4-inch slice off 1 long side of carrot to stabilize.  Cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick slices.  Stack half of slices and cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick strips.  Cut strips crosswise into 1/8-inch cubes.  Repeat with remaining slices.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add asparagus, zucchini, and crookneck squash; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  SautÈ until vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes.  Set vegetables aside.

Bring broth to simmer in medium saucepan over low heat.  Cover and keep warm.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cubed carrot.  SautÈ until onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes.  Add rice; stir until rice is translucent at edges but still opaque in center, about 3 minutes.  Add wine and simmer until absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.

Add 1 cup warm broth and baby carrots.  Simmer until broth is almost absorbed, stirring often, about 4 minutes.  Add 2 cups more broth, 1 cup at a time, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding next and stirring frequently, about 10 minutes.  Mix in sautÈed vegetables and 1 cup broth.  Simmer until broth is just absorbed, stirring often, about 5 minutes.

Add 1 1/3 cups cheese, peas, butter, and 1/2 cup broth.  Simmer until butter melts, rice and vegetables are just tender, and risotto is creamy, stirring often and adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if risotto is dry, about 3 minutes longer.  Mix in basil; season with salt and pepper.

Transfer risotto to large shallow bowl.  Sprinkle with pine nuts. Serve, passing additional cheese separately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 first-course servings.

                   Roast Leg Of Lamb With Fennel Butter

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SEASONED BUTTER ===
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick) -- room temperature
  3        tablespoons  fennel seeds -- crushed in plastic
                        bag with mallet
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried crushed rosemary
                        === LAMB ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     bone-in leg of lamb - (6 to 6 1/2 lbs) -- well trimmed
  2               cups  dry red wine
  1 1/3           cups  low-salt chicken broth
                        Fresh rosemary sprigs (optional)

For Seasoned Butter:  Mix all ingredients with fork in medium bowl.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

For Lamb:  Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Pour 2 tablespoons oil into large roasting pan.  Place pan directly atop 2 burners over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper.  Add lamb to pan and brown on all sides, about 8 minutes total.  Remove pan from heat.  Brush lamb with half of seasoned butter.

Roast lamb 30 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350 degrees; continue roasting until thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat registers 130 degrees for medium-rare, about 40 minutes longer.  Transfer to platter; tent with foil.  Let stand 20 minutes.

Skim off fat from drippings in roasting pan.  Place pan atop 2 burners over high heat.  Add wine and broth.  Boil until mixture is reduced to 2 cups, about 13 minutes.  Whisk in remaining seasoned butter (sauce will be thin).  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Garnish lamb with rosemary sprigs, if desired.  Serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

What to drink:  A red Bordeaux is the classic accompaniment to roast lamb.  Other full-bodied reds, such as Burgundy or an aged Rioja, would also complement this menu.

Comments:  If you don't have a heavy roasting pan, you can brown and roast the lamb in a large ovenproof skillet with two-inch-high sides.  The seasoned butter can be prepared one day before using.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LAMB ===
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1 3/4         pounds  unpeeled new red potatoes -- scrubbed, quartered
                        = (abt 22 at 1 1/2" diameter)
  2                     lamb racks - (abt 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lbs ea) -- trimmed, frenched
                        === PESTO ===
  2               cups  fresh mint leaves - (packed)
     3/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  4                     garlic cloves
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
                        Fresh mint sprigs

For Lamb:  Whisk 1/2 cup oil, garlic, and mustard in small bowl to blend.  Transfer 1/3 cup mustard mixture to large bowl; add potatoes and toss to coat.  Brush remaining mustard mixture over lamb.  Transfer to large rimmed baking sheet.

For Pesto:  Puree all ingredients except mint sprigs in processor.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 1 lamb rack, rounded-side down, and cook until brown, about 3 minutes.  Return to baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining lamb rack.  Let stand until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.   Arrange racks facing each other, bone ends up and brown side out, about 2 inches apart on same baking sheet; tip toward each other, intertwining bones loosely.  Scatter potatoes around lamb.

Roast lamb and potatoes until thermometer inserted into center of lamb registers 130 degrees for medium-rare, about 20 minutes.  Transfer lamb to platter and tent with foil.  Continue roasting potatoes until cooked through and crisp, stirring once, about 15 minutes longer.  Surround lamb with potatoes, garnish with mint sprigs, and serve with pesto.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serve with:  California Cabernet ï asparagus sprinkled with chives and toasted pine nuts ï crusty baguette ï blueberry crumble with cream

Comments:  Ask the butcher to "french" the racks of lamb, which involves cutting away the meat from the ends of the rack to expose the bones.

       Roasted Beef Tenderloin With Sherry Vinaigrette, Watercress

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1                     beef tenderloin - (2 1/4 lbs)
                        = (preferably from thick end)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarse kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  coarsely-ground mixed peppercorns
     1/4           cup  Sherry wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  coarse Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  chopped shallots
  1                     large bunch watercress

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Rub 1 tablespoon olive oil into beef, then rub in kosher salt and ground mixed peppercorns.  Place beef on small rimmed baking sheet.  Roast 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 450 degrees and roast until thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat registers 125 degrees for medium-rare, about 15 minutes longer.  Let meat stand 5 minutes (internal temperature of meat will increase 5 to 10 degrees).

Meanwhile, whisk remaining 5 tablespoons olive oil, vinegar, and mustard in small bowl to blend.  Stir in shallots and season vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper.

Arrange watercress on small platter.  Cut meat into 1/2-inch-thick slices; arrange overlapping slices atop watercress.  Drizzle any accumulated juices over meat.  Spoon half of vinaigrette down center of meat and over watercress.  Serve, passing remaining vinaigrette separately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serve with:  Oven-roasted new potatoes, thin green beans, and a crusty baguette.

Comments:  Coarse kosher salt ó or any other coarse salt ó will add texture and enhance the flavor of the meat.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  The tail end of the beef fillet, which is often less expensive, can also be used.  Tuck the tail under for a roast with an even thickness.

               Roasted Prawns With Morels And Morel Butter

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  fresh morel mushrooms
                        = (or 2 oz dried morel mushrooms)*
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- divided, and
                        at room temperature
     3/4           cup  chopped shallots -- divided
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  6                     uncooked giant prawns - (4 1/2 to 5 oz ea)
                        = (or 24 large prawns)

* Note:  If using dried morels: Bring 3 cups water to boil in medium saucepan.  Add dried morels.  Remove from heat.  Cover; let steep 1 hour.  Using slotted spoon, transfer morels to bowl.  Reserve soaking liquid.

Finely chop enough fresh morels or reconstituted morels to measure 1/2 cup (packed); reserve remaining morels.  Melt 1 tablespoon butter in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add 1/4 cup shallots and garlic; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add chopped morels and thyme; sautÈ 2 minutes.  If using dried morels, add reserved soaking liquid to skillet, leaving any sediment behind.  Increase heat; boil until almost all liquid evaporates, about 8 minutes.

Transfer morel mixture to small bowl; cool.  Mix remaining 7 tablespoons butter into morel mixture.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.  (Morel butter can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Using scissors, cut along back shell of each prawn all the way up to tail, exposing vein; pull out vein.  Turn prawns over.  Using small sharp knife and starting just below tail end, butterfly each prawn by cutting 1/4-inch-deep slit to opposite end.  Place prawns, shell-side down, on rimmed baking sheet.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Melt 2 tablespoons morel butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add remaining 1/2 cup shallots; sautÈ until golden, about 3 minutes.  Add remaining whole fresh morels or reconstituted morels and sautÈ until tender, about 4 minutes.

Meanwhile, spread 1 teaspoon morel butter over each giant prawn (or 1/4 teaspoon over each of 24 large prawns).  Roast just until prawns are opaque in center, about 7 minutes for giant prawns or 4 minutes for large prawns.  Top prawns with remaining morel butter, dividing equally.  Return to oven just long enough to melt butter slightly, about 10 seconds.

Transfer prawns to plates.  Serve sautÈed morels alongside.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Test-kitchen tip:  Morel mushrooms, with their honeycomb design, require thorough soaking in water.  Submerge morels in large bowl of water and agitate gently to release dirt, then lift out, leaving grit behind.  Pat morels dry and use immediately.

Comments:  This recipe calls for giant 4 1/2- to 5-ounce prawns, which can be ordered from some specialty fish markets.  If unavailable, substitute 24 large prawns.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
     1/3           cup  fresh orange juice
  2 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  1                     salmon fillet - (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
  3              large  navel oranges
     1/2           cup  matchstick-size strips red pepper
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced red onion
  2 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  2          teaspoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel
  1           teaspoon  oriental sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt

  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds -- toasted

Whisk first 3 ingredients in small bowl to blend; transfer to 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Place salmon, skin-side up, in orange juice mixture; cover with plastic and chill at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours.  Bring to room temperature 30 minutes before cooking.

Using small sharp knife, cut peel and white pith from oranges.  Working over bowl, cut between membranes to release segments into bowl.

Mix red pepper and next 7 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Fold in reserved orange segments and any accumulated juices.  (Can be prepared 1 hour ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Line rimmed baking sheet with foil; generously brush with vegetable oil.  Place fish, skin-side down, on prepared baking sheet.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Bake until fish is just opaque in center, about 20 minutes.

Using large spatula, gently loosen salmon from foil.  Using foil as aid, carefully lift salmon from sheet and allow salmon to slide from foil onto platter.  Mound orange relish down center of fish, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serve with:  Alsatian Riesling ï sautÈed sugar snap peas ï rice pilaf with watercress and green onions ï white chocolate crËme br˚lÈe

Comments:  Look for wild salmon fillets.  You can ask the fishmonger to remove the pinbones, or remove them at home with tweezers.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  1              pound  baby zucchini -- halved lengthwise,
                        and each half cut lengthwise into 3 wedges

  18                    zucchini squash blossoms
                        = (available at farmers' markets and some
                        specialty foods stores)

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add zucchini; sautÈ until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Stir in basil.  Season with fleur de sel.  Transfer to plate.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced shallots
  12            ounces  sugar snap peas -- trimmed, and
                        strings removed
  2               cups  thinly-sliced radishes - (abt 1 lg bunch)
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  1           teaspoon  dill seeds
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill

To remove strings from fresh peas, just snap off the stem end and pull string lengthwise down each pod.

Melt butter with oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add shallots and sautÈ until golden, about 5 minutes.  Add sugar snap peas and radishes; sautÈ until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.

  1                     small bunch watercress -- trimmed
  4                     watermelon radishes -- very thinly sliced
                        = (or other large radishes)
                        Edible flowers or daikon radish sprouts -- (optional)
                        = (available at farmers' markets -- specialty foods
                        stores, and some supermarkets)

Spread some butter over bread slices.  Sprinkle with fleur de sel.  Top each bread slice with 2 watercress sprigs.

Spread 1 side of each radish slice with butter.  Place 2 radish slices atop watercress, buttered-side down, overlapping slightly if necessary to fit.  Top with flowers or sprouts, if desired.  (Can be made 1 hour ahead.  Cover; let stand at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 18 pieces.

What to drink:  Brut Champagne (or sparkling wine) sets a festive tone and can be poured throughout the meal.

Comments:  Ficelle, a slender demi-baguette available mostly from artisanal bakeries, makes elegant slices, but any narrow French baguette will work.  For added indulgence, use a European-style butter such as Plugr· or Insigny St.-MËre.

Market tip:  Watermelon radishes have white skins but are magenta inside; look for them at farmers' markets.  Easter egg radishes (which have a purple, red, or pink skin) or regular radishes can be used.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lemon -- halved
  8                     baby artichokes
  2 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  minced red onion
  8             ounces  baby carrots -- peeled, 1/4" of
                        stem left intact
  12            ounces  slender asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" lengths
  8             ounces  sugar snap peas -- trimmed, and
                        halved crosswise
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh chervil

Fill medium bowl with cold water.  Squeeze juice from lemon into bowl; add lemon.

Cut off stem and top quarter from each artichoke.  Bend back dark green outer leaves and snap off at artichoke base until only pale green and yellow leaves remain.  Quarter each artichoke.  Using small spoon, scoop out choke and any purple-tipped leaves.  Transfer to lemon water.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion; sautÈ until soft, about 5 minutes.  Drain artichokes; add to skillet along with carrots.  Cover; cook until vegetables are crisp-tender, stirring often, about 8 minutes.

Add asparagus and sugar snap peas.  Cover; cook until vegetables are tender, stirring and adding water by tablespoonfuls if vegetables begin to brown, about 8 minutes.  Stir in chervil.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 6 side-dish servings.

Comments:  Chervil's delicate anise flavor enhances the season's baby vegetables.  If you don't have chervil, substitute fresh dill.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1                cup  shelled natural unsalted pistachios - -- (abt 4 3/4 oz)
     1/2           cup  sifted cake flour
                        = (sifted, then measured)
  4              large  eggs -- separated
     2/3           cup  sugar
                        === CANDIED ORANGE PEEL AND SYRUP ===
     1/3           cup  water
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  orange peel in 1" b 1/8" strips
                        = (orange part only)
  3        tablespoons  orange juice
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
                        = (or other orange liqueur)
                        === FROSTING AND FILLING ===
  1                     container whole-milk ricotta cheese - (15 
     3/4           cup  powdered sugar
  1                cup  chilled heavy whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped bittersweet or
                        semisweet chocolate
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
     2/3           cup  shelled natural unsalted pistachios -- lightly toasted,
                        and chopped
  2              pints  strawberries -- hulled, sliced
     1/4           cup  seedless raspberry jam

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line bottom of two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides with parchment paper.

Using on/off turns, finely chop 1 cup pistachios with flour in processor.  Using electric mixer, beat egg yolks with 1/3 cup sugar in large bowl until thick, about 4 minutes.  Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in another large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually beat in remaining 1/3 cup sugar, continuing to beat until whites are stiff and glossy.  Fold half of whites into yolk mixture, then gently fold in half of pistachio mixture.  Fold in remaining pistachio mixture, then remaining whites.

Divide batter between prepared pans.  Bake until tester inserted into center of cakes comes out clean, about 15 minutes.  Cool cakes completely in pans on rack.

Run knife around edge of each pan to loosen cakes.  Invert cakes onto 9-inch-diameter cardboard rounds.  Tap sharply on work surface, if necessary, to release cakes from pans.  Peel off parchment.

For Candied Orange Peel And Syrup:  Stir 1/3 cup water and sugar in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Add orange peel; simmer until translucent, about 12 minutes.  Cool.  Strain syrup into bowl; add orange juice and Grand Marnier and reserve.  Finely chop orange peel.

For Frosting And Filling:  Blend ricotta cheese and powdered sugar in processor until very smooth, about 1 minute.  Transfer to large bowl.  Beat whipping cream and vanilla in medium bowl until firm peaks form.  Fold cream mixture into ricotta mixture in 2 additions.  Transfer 2 cups ricotta mixture to small bowl and reserve for frosting.  Stir chopped chocolate and chopped orange peel into remaining ricotta mixture for filling.  If necessary, chill frosting and filling until firm enough to spread.

Place 1 cake layer on platter; brush with half of reserved orange syrup.  Spread chocolate-ricotta filling evenly over.  Top with second cake layer.  Brush remaining orange syrup over.  Spread ricotta frosting over top and sides of cake.  Chill until frosting firms slightly, about 2 hours.  Gently press toasted pistachios onto frosting around sides of cake.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome; keep chilled.)

Overlap strawberry slices in concentric circles atop cake.  Stir jam in small saucepan over medium-low heat until melted.  Brush melted jam over strawberries.  (Can be made 1 hour ahead.  Chill.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Begin making this cake one day in advance.

         Tagliatelle With Shredded Beets, Sour Cream, And Parsley

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3               cups  coarsely-grated peeled uncooked beets - -- (abt 3 large)
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  12            ounces  tagliatelle or fettuccine
  1                     container sour cream - (8 oz)
  6        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley -- divided

Melt butter with oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add garlic; stir until pale golden, about 1 minute.  Add beets and cayenne; reduce heat to medium-low and sautÈ just until beets are tender, about 12 minutes.  Stir in lemon juice.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.

Drain pasta and return to pot.  Stir in sour cream and 4 tablespoons parsley, then beet mixture.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer pasta to bowl.  Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 6 first-course or 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  Sour cream and beets are inseparable in Eastern European cooking.  Here's a fresh new way to enjoy them together.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  Surgical gloves (sold at drugstores) are ideal for protecting hands from staining when working with beets.  Regular kitchen gloves work well, too, but they are a little more cumbersome.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2 1/3           cups  sifted all-purpose flour
                        = (sifted, then measured)
  1                cup  sweetened flaked coconut
  1                cup  dry-roasted macadamia nuts
     3/4           cup  chopped crystallized ginger
  3 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  2               cups  sugar
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  4              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2               cups  finely-grated peeled carrots
  2               cans  crushed pineapple in juice - (8 oz ea) -- well drained
                        === FROSTING ===
  3           packages  Philadelphia cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2               cups  powdered sugar
     3/4           cup  canned sweetened cream of coconut
                        = (such as Coco LÛpez)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  coconut extract - (scant)
  14             whole  dry-roasted macadamia nuts
     1/4           cup  chopped crystallized ginger

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter three 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line bottom of pans with parchment paper.

Combine 1/3 cup flour and next 3 ingredients in processor.  Process until nuts are finely chopped.  Whisk remaining 2 cups flour, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in medium bowl to blend.

Using electric mixer, beat sugar and oil in large bowl to blend.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in vanilla.  Beat in flour-spice mixture.  Stir in coconut-macadamia mixture, then carrots and crushed pineapple.

Divide batter among pans.  Bake until tester inserted into center of cakes comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool in pans on racks 1 hour.  Run knife around edge of pans to loosen cakes.  Turn cakes out onto racks; cool completely.

For Frosting:  Beat cream cheese and butter in large bowl until smooth.  Beat in powdered sugar, then cream of coconut and both extracts.  Chill until firm enough to spread, about 30 minutes.

Place 1 cake layer, flat-side up, on platter.  Spread 3/4 cup frosting over top of cake.  Top with second cake layer, flat-side up.  Spread 3/4 cup frosting over.  Top with third cake layer, rounded-side up, pressing slightly to adhere.  Spread thin layer of frosting over top and sides of cake.  Chill cake and remaining frosting 30 minutes.

Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake.  Arrange whole nuts and ginger around top edge of cake.  Chill 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome and chill.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This cake can be prepared one day ahead.  Sweetened cream of coconut is available in the liquor section of most supermarkets.

  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder

  4 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter -- divided, and
                        at room temperature,
                        divided
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              pound  baby carrots with 1/2" of tops attached -- peeled
  1              pound  shallots -- peeled, and
                        halved lengthwise - (abt 22)
  2               cups  dry white wine -- divided
  3               cups  low-salt chicken broth -- divided
  1                     fully-cooked butt-end ham - -- (abt 7 1/2 lbs)
  6              large  fresh Italian parsley sprigs
  6              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  3                     bay leaves
     1/4           cup  apricot jam
  4          teaspoons  Dijon mustard -- divided
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme

Position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter with vegetable oil in heavy large roasting pan set over 2 burners over medium heat.  Add carrots and shallots.  SautÈ until vegetables begin to brown, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  Sprinkle vegetables with salt and pepper.  Add 1 cup white wine and 1 cup chicken broth.  Increase heat to high and boil 3 minutes.  Push vegetables to sides of pan; place ham in center.  Add parsley sprigs, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves to pan.  Tent pan with aluminum foil, sealing edges (do not allow foil to touch ham).

Roast ham until thermometer inserted into center (do not touch bone) registers 140 degrees, basting every 20 minutes with pan juices, about 2 hours.  Remove ham; increase oven temperature to 450 degrees.

Whisk apricot jam and 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard in small bowl.  Brush over ham.  Return ham to oven and roast, uncovered, until glaze turns dark brown, about 15 minutes.

Transfer ham to cutting board.  Discard parsley sprigs, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves from pan.  Using slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to bowl.  Tent ham and vegetables loosely with foil.

Whisk remaining 3 tablespoons butter and flour in small bowl to smooth paste.  Place roasting pan over 2 burners over medium-high heat.  Add heavy cream, chopped thyme, and remaining 1 cup white wine, 2 cups chicken broth, and 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard.  Bring to simmer.  Add flour-butter mixture 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking to incorporate.  Simmer until sauce thickens and is reduced to 3 cups, about 10 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Slice ham and arrange on platter.  Arrange vegetables around ham.  Drizzle some sauce over ham and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serve with:  Bandol RosÈ ï haricots verts with sea salt ï mashed potatoes with fresh tarragon ï pound cake with rhubarb compote

Comments:  This recipe makes the Easter favorite new again with a creamy Dijon-white wine sauce.
