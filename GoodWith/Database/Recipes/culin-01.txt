         Ahi Tuna Cube With Toasted Black And White Sesame Seeds

Recipe By     :Rick Tramonto
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  mixed black and white sesame seeds
  3             ounces  Ahi or Bluefin tuna
                        = (or other sushi-quality tuna steak)
  2        tablespoons  organic soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  sesame oil

Put the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan and toast over medium heat for about 30 seconds or until fragrant and the white seeds start to turn golden.  Transfer to a small, shallow bowl and allow to cool completely.

Cut the tuna into six 1/2-inch cubes.

To serve, coat one side of each cube with the sesame seeds and place on a small plate with the coated side facing-up.  Drizzle soy sauce and sesame oil over the cubes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  As successful as this is as an amuse, it is an equally amazing hors d'oeuvre.  I came up with this recipe one day when we were fooling around with cubed Cheddar cheese and trying to imagine what other foods would cut neatly into cubes.  One of my cooks, Jason Wheeler, suggested tuna and all of a sudden our fun morphed into an outstanding amuse.

The cubes of raw tuna look contemporary on the plate and the toasted sesame seeds enhance their flavor.  Like cheese cubes, you could serve a whole tray of these at your next party, lined up geometrically and pierced with fancy toothpicks or cool-looking olive swords.

                    Apple-Pear Butter On Cheese Toasts

Recipe By     :Laura Werlin
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BUTTER ===
  4             medium  Gala or Braeburn apples - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1" chunks
  2             medium  pears, such as Bosc - (abt 3/4 lb) -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1" chunks
  1                cup  apple cider
     1/4           cup  plus
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
                        === CHEESE TOAST ===
  9             slices  white bread -- crusts removed
  8             ounces  cheddar cheese -- thinly sliced

Make the Butter:  In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, combine the apples, pears, cider, sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon and turn the heat to high.  Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low.  Cook, stirring occasionally until there is no liquid left, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

Stir fairly vigorously to smooth out the mixture and then let it cool to room temperature.  (The butter will keep, tightly covered, for 2 weeks in the refrigerator.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

Make the Cheese Toast:  Preheat the broiler.

Place the bread slices on a baking sheet and toast on one side until light brown, about 2 minutes.  Turn the bread and top each slice with some cheese slices.

Broil until the cheese is golden-brown and bubbly about 2 minutes.  Cut each slice into quarters.

To serve:  Spoon some apple-pear butter into the center of each of 6 plates.  Surround with 6 pieces of cheese toast and serve.  (You will have extra butter.)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Few foods are more comforting than cheese toasts.  The buttery smell that wafts through the kitchen while they're cooking and the visual and flavor transformation of the cheese from solid to melted is heavenly.  Apple-Pear Butter is another type of comfort food, and with the cheese toasts, creates a truly memorable cheese plate.  The butter can be made up to two weeks in advance and refrigerated.

            Artichoke Crowns Stuffed With Saffron-Scented Crab

Recipe By     :Tina Salter
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  artichokes -- trimmed (see note)
                        === TOPPING ===
  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/3           cup  clam juice
  1              pinch  saffron
     1/2         pound  fresh lump crabmeat -- picked over to
                        remove any cartilage or shell bits

Make the Artichokes:  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.  Add the artichokes and cook until a thin-bladed knife can be easily inserted into the bottom of the artichoke, 15 to 25 minutes.  Drain and place the artichokes upside down on a clean kitchen towel; let cool.

Carefully remove the remaining leaves from the cooled artichokes.  Using a melon baller or small, sharp-edged spoon, scrape away the fuzzy chokes.  With a sharp knife, trim the outside of the artichoke crowns to a smooth shape.  Transfer the crowns to the prepared gratin dish and set aside.

Preheat the broiler.  Lightly butter a 9- by 13-inch (3-quart) gratin dish.

Make the Topping:  In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs and butter; toss until the bread crumbs have absorbed all of the butter.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute.  Whisk in the cream, clam juice, and saffron.  Whisking constantly, bring to a boil and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and add the crab; mix gently with a fork so that the crab is coated with sauce but remains in small chunks.

Spoon the crab mixture into the artichoke crowns, dividing it evenly.  Sprinkle the topping over the crab.  Place the gratin dish on a sturdy baking sheet.

Set under the broiler, about 4 inches from the heat source, and broil until deep, golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  These artichokes topped with creamy, golden, saffron-scented crabmeat make an elegant special-occasion starter.  Choose large artichokes, because you'll be trimming away all of the leaves and choke and using only the meaty base, or "crown."  Saffron is the world's most expensive spice because it takes more than 4,300 crocus blossoms to produce enough (handpicked) stigmas to make a single ounce.  It's worth the expense, though; it only takes a pinch to add a beautiful golden hue and subtle but distinctive flavor to foods.

Note:  To trim artichokes, working with one artichoke at a time, cut off the stalk flush with the base of the artichoke, then remove the outermost leaves to reveal the sides of the pale, cream-colored heart.  Cut off the top about an inch above the base.  As each artichoke is trimmed, rub the cut surfaces with lemon to prevent discoloring, or drop them into a bowl of cold water with the juice of 1 lemon.

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute.  Whisk in the cream, clam juice, and saffron.  Whisking constantly, bring to a boil and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and add the crab; mix gently with a fork so that the crab is coated with sauce but remains in small chunks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon the crab mixture into the artichoke crowns, dividing it evenly.  Sprinkle the topping over the crab.  Place the gratin dish on a sturdy baking sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set under the broiler, about 4 inches from the heat source, and broil until deep, golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  These artichokes topped with creamy, golden, saffron-scented crabmeat make an elegant special-occasion starter.  Choose large artichokes, because you&apos;ll be trimming away all of the leaves and choke and using only the meaty base, or &quot;crown.&quot;  Saffron is the world&apos;s most expensive spice because it takes more than 4,300 crocus blossoms to produce enough (handpicked) stigmas to make a single ounce.  It&apos;s worth the expense, though; it only takes a pinch to add a beautiful golden hue and subtle but distinctive flavor to foods.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  To trim artichokes, working with one artichoke at a time, cut off the stalk flush with the base of the artichoke, then remove the outermost leaves to reveal the sides of the pale, cream-colored heart.  Cut off the top about an inch above the base.  As each artichoke is trimmed, rub the cut surfaces with lemon to prevent discoloring, or drop them into a bowl of cold water with the juice of 1 lemon.

          Azorean Double-Marinated Quail - {Codornizes Guisados}

Recipe By     :Paula Wolfert
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry
                Quail

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     quail - (4 oz ea) -- fresh or defrosted
                        Water mixed with white vinegar -- as needed
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        crushed with
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  sweet paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  hot Spanish or Hungarian paprika -- or more to taste
  1         tablespoon  vinegar with 7 percent acetic acid
  6             ounces  domestic beer
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
  1             Sprigs  parsley or watercress -- as garnish
  8                     lemon wedges

Cut the quail in half with shears.  Wash the halves in the vinegared water, drain, and pat dry with kitchen towels.

Combine the crushed garlic and paprikas, and rub the mixture over the quail.  Combine the 1 tablespoon of vinegar and the beer in a bowl, add the quail, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, turning occasionally.

Put the quail, marinade, and olive oil in a large skillet and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes.  Transfer the quail to a deep bowl.  Boil the cooking liquid until it's reduced enough to coat the back of spoon.  Add more hot paprika to taste.  Pour the cooking liquid over the quail, cool to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate for up to 2 days.

Preheat the oven to broil.  Remove the quail from the cooking liquid and, without drying, broil them close to the heat, turning once and basting with the liquid until crisp and well browned.  Serve at once, sprinkled with coarse salt and surrounded by parsley and lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In this specialty of the Azores, the quail is marinated in sweet-and hot-paprika-scented beer for an intense flavor, then cooked in the marinade and left to marinate again for up to two days.  When ready to serve, the quail may be broiled or grilled quickly until the skin crisps.

                Breakfast/Brunch

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cold
  3              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  2             ounces  Cheddar shredded - (1/2 cup)
  2              large  eggs -- lightly scrambled,
                        and broken up into pieces abt 1" square
  3                     strips bacon -- partially cooked,
                        and cut into 1/2"-wide strips

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Lightly butter a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.

Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together.  Place in either a medium bowl or the work bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade.  Cut the butter into the flour so that it is completely incorporated, using two knives, a pastry blender, your hands, or food processor until incorporated.  Beat 2 of the raw eggs and the cream together and add to the dry ingredients.  Mix or process just to incorporate the eggs into the flour and butter; do not overmix.  If using the processor, dump the flour-and-butter mixture into a clean bowl.  Fold the cheese, scrambled eggs, and bacon into the flour mixture.  It will be sticky and chunky.  Stir and knead the dough as little as possible while distributing the cheese, scrambled eggs, and bacon throughout.

Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface.  Pat the dough into a rectangle about 12 x 4 x 3/4 inch high.  Cut the dough into three 4-inch squares.  Cut the squares on the diagonal to form six triangles.

Place the scones at least 1 inch apart on the baking sheet.  Beat the remaining 1 egg with 2 tablespoons water and use this wash to brush the tops of the scones.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove and serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 scones.

Comments:  Scones, which originated in England, are similar to biscuits, but they are much richer.  They are made from a short pastry, with lots of butter and cream incorporated into the dough.  They are very flaky and tender.  They are usually cut into large triangles.

Once on a morning walk I passed an elegant coffee bar in downtown Seattle.  There on the counter were the most gorgeous scones, labeled Bacon and Egg Scones.  I had never heard of this variation before, but I thought it was a great idea, combining all the ingredients for a complete breakfast into a handheld meal.

          Baked Chicken With Olives, Turnips, And Turnip Greens

Recipe By     :Victoria Jenanyan Wise
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    baby turnips -- with greens
                        = (or 3 regular turnips plus 1/2 bunch
                        fresh turnip greens)
  1              whole  chicken - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs) -- quartered
  1              small  yellow or white onion -- halved, sliced thin
  1              large  tomato -- cut into 1" wedges
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  hot or mild paprika
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  white wine
  1                cup  picholine or other mild green olives -- not pitted

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

If using baby turnips, trim and scrub them, saving the greens.  Cut the turnips in half and set aside.  If using regular turnips, peel them and cut into 1/2- to 3/4-inch wedges.  Set aside.  Thinly shred the greens, wash and drain them, and set aside.

Place the chicken, onion, tomato, bay leaf, paprika, salt, pepper, and wine in an oven dish large enough to hold the ingredients in one crowded layer.  Turn to coat, winding up with the chicken skin-side up.  Cover and bake for 30 minutes.  Turn the chicken over, and continue baking uncovered for 25 minutes, until the chicken is almost done.

Remove the cover and turn the chicken over again (skin-side up again).  Tuck the turnips and olives under the chicken and bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes, until the turnips are tender and the chicken is golden on top.  Remove the bay leaf, stir in the turnip greens, and cook uncovered for 3 minutes more, until the greens wilt.  Serve right away.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  I cooked a variation of this dish, made with duck rather than chicken and without the turnip greens, for the first-ever meal served at Berkeley 's world-famous Chez Panisse restaurant on August 28, 1971.  I don't know why I chose it for the opener, except its elements appealed to my French-cuisine style at the time, and also to my Armenian taste for turnips and olives.  Dinner was rather later than advertised, we were all novices in the restaurant business, and was not quite perfect that night.  I have made the dish countless times since.  Adding turnip greens is one of my favorite latter-day innovations.

     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3              large  ripe -- soft, darkly
                        speckled bananas, mashed well
                        = (about 1 1/2 cups)
     1/4           cup  plain yogurt
  2              large  eggs -- beaten lightly
     3/4         stick  unsalted butter -- melted and cooled
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease the bottom and sides of a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan; dust with flour, tapping out the excess.

Spread the walnuts on a baking sheet and toast until fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes.  Set aside to cool.

Whisk the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and walnuts together in a large bowl; set aside.

Mix the mashed bananas, yogurt, eggs, butter, and vanilla with a wooden spoon in a medium bowl.  Lightly fold the banana mixture into the dry ingredients with a rubber spatula until just combined and the batter looks thick and chunky.  Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan.

Bake until the loaf is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes.  Cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  (The bread can be wrapped with plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.)

This recipe yields one 9-inch loaf.

Comments:  Overripe bananas on the kitchen counter are an excellent excuse to make banana bread.  However, many banana breads are flat, gritty, or heavy.  Worse, some loaves taste only remotely of bananas.  Good banana bread is soft and tender with plenty of banana flavor and crunchy toasted walnuts.  It should be moist and light, something so delicious that you look forward to the bananas on the counter turning soft and mushy.

For best results, be sure to use a loaf pan that measures 9 inches long, 5 inches across, and 3 inches deep.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Spanish paprika
     1/2           cup  ground ancho chile
     1/2           cup  kosher salt
     1/4           cup  ground chipotle chile
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  granulated garlic
     1/4           cup  granulated onion
     1/4           cup  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  ground cumin

Thoroughly mix together all the ingredients.

Use at once or store in an airtight jar at room temerature for up to 6 months.

Comments:  Be sure to keep this on hand for seasoning everything from chicken to steaks.  It even makes a great coating for potato chips.  When applied to meats, fish or chicken the night before, the salt and sugar content draws out moisture while infusing flavors ó curing the food.

This recipe yields 3 1/2 cups.

          Bay-Studded Pork Shoulder With Sauce Of Wild Mushrooms

Recipe By     :Edna Lewis and Scott Peacock
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PORK SHOULDER ===
  1                     bone-in pork shoulder -- brined*
                        = (picnic or Boston butt)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-cracked black peppercorns
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried thyme
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        sliced thinly lengthwise
  12             whole  bay leaves
  2                     small whole onions -- peeled, and
                        thickly sliced
  1             bottle  red wine - (750 ml)
                        = (or ruby or tawny port)
                        === WILD MUSHROOM SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2               cups  mushrooms or a mixture of wild and
                        cultivated mushrooms -- cleaned and cut
                        into 1/3" slices (or, if very small,
                        trimmed and left whole)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     shallot -- minced
  2              small  garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  finely-snipped parsley
                        Reserved liquid from cooking the pork
                        shoulder
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

* Brining for poultry and meat:  Brining poultry or pork, that is, soaking it in a saltwater solution before cooking, serves a twofold purpose: it helps the flesh retain moisture and seasons it all the way through.  To make the brine, stir kosher salt into cold water until dissolved, in the proportion of 1/4 cup salt to 1 quart of water.  (Don't use table salt in this formula, by the way; it will be too salty).  Mix enough brine to cover the poultry or meat completely in a (non-reactive) bowl or pot.  Store refrigerated 24 hours for pork shoulder.

Make The Pork Shoulder:  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Rinse the pork shoulder and pat dry.  Using a sharp paring knife, cut twelve slits in the skin side of the pork shoulder, about 1 inch wide and 1 1/2 inches deep - the slits should be in three rows of four each, spaced equally apart.

Mix together the salt, cracked peppercorns, and thyme.  Sprinkle approximately 1/8 teaspoon of the seasoning mixture into each slit, then insert 1 garlic sliver and 1 whole bay leaf.  (The bay leaves should protrude from the shoulder so that you can easily remove them before serving.)  Sprinkle any remaining seasonings all over the pork shoulder.

Scatter the sliced onions over the bottom of a baking dish or roasting pan that will just hold the meat.  Place the seasoned pork shoulder on top of the onion slices, and pour the wine into the bottom of the pan.  Lay a piece of parchment paper directly on top of the pork shoulder, and wrap the pan tightly with a double thickness of foil.

Put in the preheated oven to cook for 4 1/2 to 5 hours, until the meat is very tender when pierced with a sharp knife.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.  If you have a roast that has its skin intact, raise oven temperature to 425 degrees.  If not, disregard.

Remove the onions and cooking liquid from the roasting pan, and strain through a fine-meshed sieve, pressing gently on the onions with the back of a wooden spoon to extract as much liquid as possible.  Skim any visible fat from the surface of the cooking liquid, and reserve for the sauce.

Meanwhile, remove the bay leaves from the pork shoulder and discard.  Using a sharp knife, carefully separate the skin (rind) from the top of the pork shoulder, and remove in 1 piece.  Transfer the pork shoulder to a heated serving platter and keep warm.

Gently scrape any soft fat from the underside of the pork rind.  Place the rind on a baking sheet and put into the 425 degree oven until crisp and deep golden brown, about 10 minutes.  While the rind is crisping, make the wild-mushroom sauce.

Make The Mushroom Sauce:  Heat the butter in a large skillet until hot and foaming.  Add the mushrooms, and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until they begin to brown, about 5 to 10 minutes.

Season with salt and a small amount of freshly ground black pepper.  Add the minced shallot and garlic and snipped parsley, and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes, stirring often.  Pour in the reserved cooking liquid, and boil until the liquid is reduced by one-half.  Add the heavy cream and simmer briefly.  Taste carefully for seasoning, and adjust if needed.  Serve hot.

To Serve:  Cut the crisped pork rind into 1/2-inch strips and arrange on top of the pork shoulder.  At the table, slice the pork shoulder thinly against the grain, and serve with a piece of crisped pork rind (or crackling) on the side and the wild-mushroom sauce spooned over the sliced meat.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Long, slow oven-braising ó in red wine or tawny port ó is an excellent way to cook a big cut of pork so that it's moist and succulent.  We first cooked a pork shoulder this way several years ago, on a Sunday visit to a friend's farm.  We'd brought the pork and a bottle of port with us.  We then took a walk through the woods and discovered a cache of wild mushrooms as well as wild blackberries ripening on the bushes.  So we gathered what we could and, following the principle that what grows together goes together, we sautÈed the mushrooms and added them to the sauce, and then, finally, tossed in the blackberries.  The special flavors that they yielded are not essential, and if you don't have such treats at hand, you can serve it with just the defatted and reduced braising liquid.  This pork is particularly good served with creamy grits, and any leftover meat is delicious sliced and served cold with a salad or in a sandwich.  Try to get a shoulder with the bone in and the skin attached.  If, however, you can't find one, a boneless, skinless shoulder roast is still very good.

This pork is particularly good served with creamy grits, and any leftover meat is delicious sliced and served cold with a salad or in a sandwich.  Try to get a shoulder with the bone in and the skin attached.  If, however, you can&apos;t find one, a boneless, skinless shoulder roast is still very good.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2         pounds  fillet of beef -- tied with thin
                        sheets of larding fat at room temperature
     3/4         pound  mushrooms -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  p‚tÈ de foie gras -- room temperature
                        = (available at specialty foods shops)
  1              pound  thawed puff pastry -- plus
                        additional for garnish
  1              large  egg white -- beaten
  1              large  egg yolk -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for egg wash
     1/2           cup  Madeira
  2          teaspoons  arrowroot -- dissolved in
  1           teaspoon  cold water
     1/2           cup  beef broth
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped black truffles
                        = (available at specialty food shops)
  1              bunch  watercress

In a roasting pan, roast fillet in the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until a thermometer registers 120 degrees.  Let the fillet cool completely and discard larding fat and strings.  Skim the fat from the pan juices and reserve juices.

In a heavy skillet, cook the mushrooms in the butter over moderately-low heat, stirring until all the liquid is evaporated and the mixture is dry; season with salt and pepper and let cool completely.

Spread the fillet evenly with the p‚tÈ de foie gras, covering the top and sides; spread the mushrooms evenly over the p‚tÈ de foie gras.  Set aside.

On a floured surface, roll 1 pound of the puff pastry into a rectangle large enough to enclose the fillet completely, about 20 by 12 inches.

Invert the coated fillet carefully onto middle of the dough and fold up the long sides of the dough to enclose the fillet.  Brush the dough's edges with the egg white to seal.  Repeat with the ends of dough.

Transfer the fillet, seam-side down, to a jelly roll pan or a shallow roasting pan and brush with some of the egg wash.  Roll out the additional dough and cut shapes with decorative cutters.  Arrange the cutouts on top, brush with the remaining egg wash and chill for at least 1 hour, but no more than 2 hours.

Bake the fillet in the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven for 30 minutes, reduce the heat to 350 degrees and bake for 5 to 10 minutes more or until a meat thermometer registers 130 degrees for medium-rare.  Remove and let stand for 15 minutes.

In saucepan, boil the reserved pan juices and Madeira until the mixture is reduced by one quarter.  Add the arrowroot mixture, beef broth, truffles and salt and pepper to taste.  Cook over moderate heat, stirring (being careful not to boil) for 5 minutes or until thickened.

Loosen the fillet from jelly roll pan, transfer with two spatulas to a heated platter and garnish with watercress.  To serve, cut the fillet into 3/4-inch-thick slices, dress with the sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The enduring popularity of this dish ó a fillet of beef tenderloin coated with p‚tÈ de foie gras and a duxelles of mushrooms that are then all wrapped in puff pastry ó is legendary.  It has remained a favorite in Britain and the U.S. for over a century ever since it was created to honor the Duke of Wellington, a hero of the Napoleonic Wars

       Beer-Simmered Bratwurst With Grilled Onions, Red Sauerkraut

Recipe By     :Bobby Flay
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUERKRAUT ===
  2               cups  red wine vinegar
  1                cup  water
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1              large  red cabbage head -- cored, and
                        thinly shredded
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  whole mustard seeds
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BRATWURST ===
  3              large  onions -- thinly sliced
  3             pounds  precooked bratwurst -- pricked with a fork
  6            bottles  dark beer - (12 oz ea)
  2               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  coriander seeds
  1           teaspoon  caraway seeds
  1           teaspoon  mustard seeds
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 1") -- peeled, chopped
                        Hot dog buns, hoagie buns, or
                        bratwurst buns
                        Various mustards
                        = (like spicy brown, sweet-ho, and
                        coarse-grain)

Make The Sauerkraut:  Combine the vinegar, water, and sugar in a large saucepan (not aluminum or cast-iron), bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the sugar has dissolved.

Add the remaining ingredients and simmer until the cabbage is soft, about 20 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (The sauerkraut can be made up to 2 days in advance, cooled, covered, and kept refrigerated.  Bring to room temperature and drain before serving.)

Make The Bratwurst:  Arrange the onion slices on the bottom of a medium stockpot.  Place the bratwurst on top and add the beer, water, coriander, caraway, mustard seeds, and ginger.  Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside for at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour.

When ready to serve, heat your grill to high.

Lift the sausages out of the pot.  Remove the onions with a slotted spoon and place in a serving bowl.  Discard the remaining liquid and aromatics.

Grill the sausages until crisp and golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes total.  If you like, grill the buns until lightly toasted.  Serve the bratwurst on the buns with sauerkraut, onions, and mustard.

This recipe yields 4 servings as appetizer; can be doubled.

Comments:  My favorite dish for grilling or a tailgate party takes only a little more effort than plain hot dogs but is so much more delicious.  Bratwursts are usually precooked, like hot dogs, so grilling crisps them up and makes them juicy.  A quick, homemade sauerkraut is very easy to make; I like mine a little sweet and spicy.  I've infused the whole dish with warm spices ó mustard, coriander, ginger, and caraway ó to make your guests sit up and take notice.  This dish is better than your average dog!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PAPILLOTES ===
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced cauliflower florets
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  thinly-sliced leeks -- carefully washed
  4                     sheets wide aluminum foil, 12" long
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
                        extra for coating the foil
  4                     black sea bass fillets - (6 to 7 oz ea)
     3/4           cup  cooked assorted wild mushrooms
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === SAUCE ===
  1              large  shallot -- minced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  sliced raw cauliflower
  1              sprig  French thyme
  2        tablespoons  white wine
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  chopped black truffles -- (optional)
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  12                    seedless red or green grapes -- peeled, and
                        cut lengthwise into quarters

For The Papillotes:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Toss the cauliflower florets in the olive oil and spread in one layer on a sheet pan.  Place in oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until tender.  Remove, cool and reserve.

Bring 2 quarts of salted water to a boil and cook the leeks for 45 seconds.  Remove and shock in an ice bath.  Drain and reserve.

For The Sauce:  Sweat the minced shallot in 1/2 tablespoon of the butter until soft; do not let it color.  Add the cauliflower and sautÈ briefly.

Add the thyme and wine and reduce by three quarters, until almost dry.  Add the chicken stock and simmer for 7 to 8 minutes, reducing by one-third.

Pour the sauce into a blender along with the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter, lemon juice and truffles.  Blend until smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour into a small sauce pot, add the grapes and keep warm until ready to serve.

To Assemble:  Brush the center of each foil sheet with butter.  Combine the cauliflower, leeks and mushrooms, and then divided evenly in the center of each sheet.  Top with 1/2 tablespoon of butter.

Place 1 bass fillet on top of the vegetable mixture.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Fold the foil over the fish to make an envelope and crimp the edges to seal.

To Serve:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place the foil packages on a sheet pan and bake for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the bass is cooked through.

Unwrap each papillote carefully ó beware of the hot steam.  Remove the fish and vegetables onto 4 warm plates.  Nap with the sauce and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "This dish is our most popular fish offering," says Brennan.  "Most of the work can be done ahead of time.  Right before serving, the papillotes go in the oven and can be opened at the table with all the flourish and drama you want."

For The Papillotes:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Toss the cauliflower florets in the olive oil and spread in one layer on a sheet pan.  Place in oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until tender.  Remove, cool and reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring 2 quarts of salted water to a boil and cook the leeks for 45 seconds.  Remove and shock in an ice bath.  Drain and reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For The Sauce:  Sweat the minced shallot in 1/2 tablespoon of the butter until soft; do not let it color.  Add the cauliflower and sautÈ briefly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the thyme and wine and reduce by three quarters, until almost dry.  Add the chicken stock and simmer for 7 to 8 minutes, reducing by one-third.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the sauce into a blender along with the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter, lemon juice and truffles.  Blend until smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pour into a small sauce pot, add the grapes and keep warm until ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To Assemble:  Brush the center of each foil sheet with butter.  Combine the cauliflower, leeks and mushrooms, and then divided evenly in the center of each sheet.  Top with 1/2 tablespoon of butter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1 bass fillet on top of the vegetable mixture.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Fold the foil over the fish to make an envelope and crimp the edges to seal.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To Serve:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place the foil packages on a sheet pan and bake for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the bass is cooked through.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Unwrap each papillote carefully ó beware of the hot steam.  Remove the fish and vegetables onto 4 warm plates.  Nap with the sauce and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  &quot;This dish is our most popular fish offering,&quot; says Brennan.  &quot;Most of the work can be done ahead of time.  Right before serving, the papillotes go in the oven and can be opened at the table with all the flourish and drama you want.&quot;

                            Blue Corn Pancakes

Recipe By     :Gwen Walters
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  blue corn meal
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  3                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1 1/2           cups  fresh or frozen blueberries -- (optional)

In a large bowl, combine the flour, blue corn meal, sugar, baking soda, and baking powder.

Beat the eggs with the buttermilk.  Pour the egg mixture over the flour mixture and stir until just mixed.  Stir in melted butter.  The batter will be very thick.

Heat a griddle or nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Brush with butter or spray with cooking spray.  Ladle 1/4 cup (2 fluid ounces) of the batter for each pancake onto the hot surface.  (Dot with a few blueberries, if using.)  Cook until the edges start to dry and bubbles burst on surface, about 2 to 3 minutes.

Flip and cook the other side until brown, about another minute or so.  Keep warm in a 200 degree oven until all the cakes are cooked.  Serve with your favorite syrup.

This recipe yields 12 (4-inch) pancakes.

Comments:  The texture is similar to cornbread thanks to the blue corn meal, but it's not too grainy, like some recipes I've tried.  Blueberries are a natural addition, so I added a handful to each cake after ladling the batter into the skillet.  They crush easily and streak the batter if you add them to the bowl instead of each individual pancake.  I keep a container of dried buttermilk powder in my refrigerator (it's in the baking aisle) so that I can have these without having to have fresh buttermilk on hand.

           Boneless Beef Short Ribs With Opal Basil Chimichurri

Recipe By     :Douglas Rodriguez and Andrew DiCataldo
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  boneless beef short ribs -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 3" lengths
  1                cup  Barbecue Spice Rub -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  canola oil
  1              quart  beef stock
  1                cup  red wine
  3                     celery stalks -- chopped
  2                     carrots -- chopped
  2                     onions -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === OPAL BASIL CHIMICHURRI ===
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves
  1                     jalapeÒo
  2                     dried bay leaves -- crumbled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped opal basil leaves
     1/2           cup  olive oil

Prepare a medium fire in the grill.

Place the ribs in a bowl and toss with the spices and oil, rubbing it in with your hands.  Oil the grate.  Arrange the seasoned ribs on the hot grate and brown evenly on all sides for about 10 minutes.

Transfer the ribs to a roasting pan and add the beef stock, wine, celery, carrots, onions, thyme, salt, and pepper.  Bring to a boil on your grill or stovetop, lower the heat to a simmer, and braise the ribs until fork-tender, about 1 1/2 hours.

While the ribs are braising, prepare the chimichurri.  Combine the vinegar, garlic, jalapeÒo, bay leaves, and salt and pepper in a blender and purÈe until smooth.  Pour into a bowl and stir in the basil and olive oil.  Set aside.

Using tongs, remove the ribs from the roasting pan and place on a serving dish.  Strain the braising liquid and reduce to thicken.  Adjust the seasoning and pour over the ribs.  Drizzle the chimichurri over the ribs and serve immediately, passing the leftover chimichurri at the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  These are the most tender, succulent, mouth-watering ribs you will ever have.  I like to serve them with stacks of warmed flour tortillas, in which the meat can be rolled up to make quick sandwiches.

                         Braised Brisket Of Beef

Recipe By     :Richard Ruben
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2          pound  brisket of beef -- trimmed well of
                        excess fat and sinew
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             medium  onions -- sliced thin
     1/4         pound  black radishes - (see note) -- peeled, julienned
  3                     garlic cloves -- roughly chopped
  3                     celery ribs -- diced 1/4"
  2              small  parsnips -- diced 1/4" rounds
  1                     quince -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2" cubes
     1/4         pound  mushrooms -- stems discarded,
                        and quartered
  2                     chipotles -- left whole
     3/4           cup  seltzer water
  5                     plum tomatoes -- skinned, seeded,
                        and quartered
     1/2           cup  Italian parsley, leaves only -- roughly chopped

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Heat a 9-quart casserole pot or Dutch oven, wide enough to fit the brisket laying down flat, over a medium-high heat.

Season the brisket with salt and pepper.  Place the fattier side of the brisket down in the pan and sear to deep brown.  No oil is needed, since the fat on the brisket should be sufficient.  However, if you cut away the entire fat cap, add about 1/8 cup olive oil to the pan first.  Flip the brisket over and sear the other side.  Brisket will take about 4 to 5 minutes per side to sear.  Remove the brisket to a platter.  Then add the onions, radishes, and garlic to the pan.  Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, and then return the brisket to the pan on top of the onion mixture.  Add the celery, parsnips, quince, mushrooms, chipotles, and seltzer.

Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to a simmer.  Cover the pan with a lid or aluminum foil.  Place the brisket in the oven and cook for 1 hour.  After 1 hour flip the brisket over and add the quartered tomatoes.  Re-cover and place back in the oven for 1 1/2 to 2 hours longer.

Remove the brisket from the pan to a platter and hold.  Don't slice the brisket for at least 30 minutes after removing it from the oven.  This will allow the juices to relax back into the meat.  In the meantime, return the casserole pot to the stove top and add the Italian parsley to the braising juices and vegetables and bring to a boil over a medium heat.  Reduce the liquid to concentrate the flavors.  If you desire, remove the chipotles and discard.  Taste and correct seasoning with salt and pepper.  Slice the brisket against the grain of the meat and place on a platter.  Spoon the reduced juices and vegetables on top.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  In a way, this recipe pays homage to my mother and her holiday braise.  In another, it says I have wandered far from my Eastern European roots.  Sure, the black radishes, parsnips and mushrooms hearken back to my younger days.  But the use of the chipotle chili and quince offer a hybridization of flavor.  The chipotle is a dried, smoked jalapeÒo that is incendiary.  It is available dried or in cans slathered in a tomato sauce (adobo sauce).  Whichever one you find will work in this recipe.

Note: The black radish used in this recipe is also known as a winter radish.  It has a black skin and mild-tasting white flesh.  I like to slice it very thinly and drizzle it with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt to serve as an appetizer.  I grew up eating it ó grated and tossed with warm rendered chicken fat, which then garnished a smear of chopped liver.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Heat a 9-quart casserole pot or Dutch oven, wide enough to fit the brisket laying down flat, over a medium-high heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the brisket with salt and pepper.  Place the fattier side of the brisket down in the pan and sear to deep brown.  No oil is needed, since the fat on the brisket should be sufficient.  However, if you cut away the entire fat cap, add about 1/8 cup olive oil to the pan first.  Flip the brisket over and sear the other side.  Brisket will take about 4 to 5 minutes per side to sear.  Remove the brisket to a platter.  Then add the onions, radishes, and garlic to the pan.  Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, and then return the brisket to the pan on top of the onion mixture.  Add the celery, parsnips, quince, mushrooms, chipotles, and seltzer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to a simmer.  Cover the pan with a lid or aluminum foil.  Place the brisket in the oven and cook for 1 hour.  After 1 hour flip the brisket over and add the quartered tomatoes.  Re-cover and place back in the oven for 1 1/2 to 2 hours longer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the brisket from the pan to a platter and hold.  Don&apos;t slice the brisket for at least 30 minutes after removing it from the oven.  This will allow the juices to relax back into the meat.  In the meantime, return the casserole pot to the stove top and add the Italian parsley to the braising juices and vegetables and bring to a boil over a medium heat.  Reduce the liquid to concentrate the flavors.  If you desire, remove the chipotles and discard.  Taste and correct seasoning with salt and pepper.  Slice the brisket against the grain of the meat and place on a platter.  Spoon the reduced juices and vegetables on top.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  In a way, this recipe pays homage to my mother and her holiday braise.  In another, it says I have wandered far from my Eastern European roots.  Sure, the black radishes, parsnips and mushrooms hearken back to my younger days.  But the use of the chipotle chili and quince offer a hybridization of flavor.  The chipotle is a dried, smoked jalapeÒo that is incendiary.  It is available dried or in cans slathered in a tomato sauce (adobo sauce).  Whichever one you find will work in this recipe.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note: The black radish used in this recipe is also known as a winter radish.  It has a black skin and mild-tasting white flesh.  I like to slice it very thinly and drizzle it with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt to serve as an appetizer.  I grew up eating it ó grated and tossed with warm rendered chicken fat, which then garnished a smear of chopped liver.

                   Braised Lamb Shanks With Masala Raan

Recipe By     :Neela Paniz
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     lamb shanks - (abt 12 oz ea)
  12                    garlic cloves
  1              piece  ginger - (abt 2") -- peeled
     1/2           cup  yogurt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  garam masala -- (see Note)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  8              small  onions -- halved, and
                        sliced into thin half-moons
  6             medium  tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
  1 1/2    tablespoons  ground coriander
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cayenne
     1/4      teaspoon  turmeric
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  dark rum
  1           teaspoon  saffron threads
                        Chopped fresh cilantro -- for garnish

Trim any excess fat off the shanks, being careful not to pull the meat away from the bone.  With the point of a knife, pierce holes in the meat.

In a mini-blender, grind the garlic, ginger, and 1/4 cup of the yogurt to a smooth paste.  Transfer to a bowl and mix in the remaining yogurt and the garam masala.  Put the lamb in a shallow dish and rub the marinade into the lamb.  Set aside.

Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven.  Add the onions and sautÈ until dark golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes, stirring frequently so as not to burn them.  Add the tomatoes, mixing well, and continue to sautÈ until incorporated.  Add the coriander, cumin, cayenne, and turmeric to what is now masala raan.  Cook until the oil separates and the mixture pulls away from the sides of the pan.

Carefully add 3 of the shanks to the pot and brown them on all sides for about 5 minutes.  Return them to the dish with the marinade and repeat with the remaining 3 shanks.  Return all the shanks, with their marinade, to the pot and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes over high heat, turning the shanks every so often.  Add the salt, mixing well, lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hour, turning the shanks once or twice so they absorb the masala evenly.

Add the rum and saffron threads and cook for another 45 minutes, or until the meat is very tender.

Place on a serving platter, topping off with the masala remaining in the pot.  Garnish with cilantro and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "Lamb shanks are the closest to the small legs of lamb we get in India." ó Neela Paniz

Note:  Garam masala is a North Indian spice blend containing cumin, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and black pepper.  It is available in specialty and Indian grocery stores.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        additional for garnish
  3                     rabbits
                        = (have butcher separate the front legs,
                        loins, and back legs, leaving all on the
                        bone)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     red onion -- peeled, minced
  1                     celery stalk -- minced
  1             medium  carrot -- peeled, minced
  2               cups  dry white wine
  10             whole  peeled plum tomatoes -- (canned or fresh)
  6             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  1                cup  pitted NiÁoise olives
  6               cups  brown chicken stock -- more or less
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        Minced zest of 1 lemon -- (optional)

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Heat a large, high-sided ovenproof skillet over medium heat.  Add the oil.  Salt and pepper the rabbit and add to fill but not crowd the pan.  Brown on both sides, about 20 minutes in all, then transfer to a plate.  Repeat until all the rabbit has been browned.

Add the onion, celery, carrot, and salt and pepper to the pan.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and nicely browned, about 30 minutes.  Pour in the wine and reduce by about half.  Add the tomatoes, breaking them up with your hands or a wooden spoon, then add the rosemary and olives.  Cook for a minute or so, and then fit the rabbit snugly into the pan.  Add enough stock to not quite cover the rabbit and bring to a simmer.

Transfer the pan to the oven and braise, uncovered, at a slow bubble.  Cook the rabbit, turning it once or twice, until it is so tender it almost falls from the bone, about 1 1/2 hours.  Degrease the braising liquid if necessary and serve the rabbit with the chopped parsley mixed with lemon zest and a little olive oil.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This straightforward braising recipe would also work well with chicken, beef, or lamb.  Note that unless you have a very large pan, it may be necessary to divide the vegetable, tomato, and wine mixture between two pans before adding the rabbit and the stock.

  1                cup  chicken stock

Make The Short Ribs:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over high heat until smoking.  Season the ribs with salt and pepper and cook them over high heat until deep brown on all sides, about 15 minutes total.  Remove the short ribs to a plate and set aside.  Add the carrots, onion, celery, and garlic to the pan and cook over high heat until browned and softened, about 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and stir in the red wine, tomatoes and juices, beef stock, and herbs, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to dislodge browned bits.  Bring the mixture to a boil and return the short ribs to the pan.  Cover with aluminum foil and place in the oven.  Cook for 2 hours, or until the meat is very tender and literally falling off the bones.

Make The Gremolata:  In a small bowl, combine the parsley, lemon zest, and horseradish and toss loosely by hand.

Make The Orzo:  Cut the pumpkin or squash into 3 or 4 evenly sized pieces.  Season with salt and pepper, drizzle with the olive oil, and wrap in foil.  Roast in the 375 degree oven for 30 to 45 minutes, or until very soft.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes, then place the cooked squash in the bowl of a food processor.  Add the honey, balsamic vinegar, and salt and pepper and pulse to form a relatively smooth purÈe.  Set aside.

Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt.  Set up an ice bath nearby.  Cook the orzo in the boiling water for 3 minutes, to blanch but not cook through.  Drain the orzo and plunge it into the ice bath.  Once cooled, drain it and lay it out on a baking sheet to dry.

Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a 12-inch sautÈ pan.  Add the orzo and squash purÈe and cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until the chicken stock is fully absorbed by the orzo.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.

Divide the pumpkin orzo evenly among four warmed bowls.  Place one short rib in each bowl, top with a little of the pan juices and a handful of the gremolata, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  We use beef short ribs for this dish and it works out great.  You could just as easily use brisket or blade, but I prefer the richness of the ribs.  Have your butcher cut between and along the length of the bone.  The most important step here is the initial browning; do not shorten it or the final braise will not be as intensely flavored or colored.

       Broccoflower Couscous With Curry Oil, Aged Balsamic Vinegar

Recipe By     :Charlie Trotter and Roxanne Klein
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === INDIAN SPICE MIX ===
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground green cardamom
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground coriander
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground cumin
                        === CURRY OIL ===
  2        tablespoons  Indian Spice Mix -- (above)
  1                     garlic clove
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground turmeric
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground cayenne pepper
  6                     grains smoked salt
     1/4      teaspoon  Celtic sea salt
  1                cup  olive oil
                        === COUSCOUS ===
     1/2          head  broccoflower -- broken into florets
                        the size of tiny peas
  1                cup  champagne grapes -- stems removed
     1/3           cup  finely-cut carrot
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro
  1           teaspoon  fresh lavender -- soaked for 15
                        minutes in filtered water, drained,
                        patted dry, and lightly crushed
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground coriander seeds
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  champagne vinegar
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed orange juice
                        Celtic sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  4          teaspoons  Curry Oil -- (above)
  4          teaspoons  Villa Manodori 25-year-old balsamic
                        vinegar
  1         tablespoon  fresh chervil leaves
  2          teaspoons  fresh tiny tarragon leaves
  2          teaspoons  fresh micro flat-leaf parsley leaves

Make The Indian Spice Mix:  Stir together all the ingredients in a small bowl until well mixed.  Transfer to a jar, cover tightly, and store at room temperature for up to 1 month.

Make The Curry Oil:  In a high-speed blender, combine all the ingredients and process for 2 to 3 minutes or until the outside of the blender container is warm.  Pour into a glass jar or bowl, cover, and let stand overnight.

The next day, strain through a coffee filter (do not press on the contents of the filter) into a container with a tight-fitting lid.  Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Make The Couscous:  Combine the broccoflower, grapes, carrot, parsley, tarragon, cilantro, lavender, coriander, olive oil, champagne vinegar, and orange juice in a bowl and stir to mix.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

To Assemble:  Place a shallow ring mold 5 inches in diameter in the center of each plate.  Fill it to a depth of 1/2 inch with the couscous, and then gently press on the couscous with the back of a spoon.  Remove the ring mold.  Drizzle 1 teaspoon of the Curry Oil and 1 teaspoon of the vinegar around the plate, and sprinkle with the chervil, tarragon, and parsley leaves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This preparation is inspired by a similar idea from genius chef Ferran Adri· of Spain.  The broccoflower is finely cut to emulate the look of couscous.  Here, though, champagne grapes have been added to provide a burst of sweet fruit juice.  Also present are accents of curry and aged balsamic vinegar, both of which lend a poignant and exotic note, making for an overall stunning complexity of flavor.  Wisps of herbs complete this intoxicating dish.

Wine Notes:  0ne of the classic pairings with curry is Gewurztraminer, and this is no exception.  Use caution and do not overpower the tender grape and broccoflower flavors with an excessively ripe and sweet wine.  Going with a leaner producer such as Trimbach or Lorentz from Alsace is a preferable choice.  A New World Gewurztraminer from Edmeades in California's Anderson Valley also matches the spiciness of the curry and the hint of sweetness from the balsamic vinegar.

            Bruschetta With Black Mission Figs And Gorgonzola

Recipe By     :Jack Cakebread
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  dry red wine
                        = (such as merlot)
  8             ounces  dried black mission figs -- stemmed, halved
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4      teaspoon  anise seed
     1/2                loaf country-style bread -- cut 1/2"-thick
                        slices
     1/2           cup  crumbled Gorgonzola
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley

Preheat the broiler.

Combine the wine, figs, bay leaf, and anise seed in a small saucepan.  Bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Cook for 10 minutes, until the figs are rehydrated and soft.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

Remove the bay leaf, transfer to a food processor, and puree.  At this point you can store the mixture in an airtight container, refrigerated, for up to one month.

Put the bread slices on a baking sheet and place under the broiler for 2 minutes per side, until golden brown.  Spread a thin layer of the fig puree over the bread slices.  Crumble the Gorgonzola and spread equal amounts atop the fig puree on each bruschetta.  Place under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes, until the cheese begins to melt.  Cut each slice into 3 pieces on the diagonal, sprinkle with the parsley, and serve.  Enjoy with a merlot with fruit-forward aromas and flavors.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  We are incredibly lucky to have struck up a friendship with the Waltenspiels of Timber Crest Farms many years ago.  Located in Healdsburg in Sonoma County, Timber Crest was a pioneer in the organic farm movement and they employ the strictest of growing practices to ensure that all of their fruits and vegetables are grown without chemicals.  The Waltenspiels' fruits and vegetables, like the dried figs used in this recipe, are tree ripened and dried naturally The fig puree can be made in advance and refrigerated for up to one month.

Put the bread slices on a baking sheet and place under the broiler for 2 minutes per side, until golden brown.  Spread a thin layer of the fig puree over the bread slices.  Crumble the Gorgonzola and spread equal amounts atop the fig puree on each bruschetta.  Place under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes, until the cheese begins to melt.  Cut each slice into 3 pieces on the diagonal, sprinkle with the parsley, and serve.  Enjoy with a merlot with fruit-forward aromas and flavors.

Comments:  We are incredibly lucky to have struck up a friendship with the Waltenspiels of Timber Crest Farms many years ago.  Located in Healdsburg in Sonoma County, Timber Crest was a pioneer in the organic farm movement and they employ the strictest of growing practices to ensure that all of their fruits and vegetables are grown without chemicals.  The Waltenspiels&apos; fruits and vegetables, like the dried figs used in this recipe, are tree ripened and dried naturally The fig puree can be made in advance and refrigerated for up to one month.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  small white beans -- soaked overnight
                        = (such as Great Northern)
     1/2         pound  salt pork or thick-cut bacon -- blanched
  2                     onions -- halved, and
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- smashed, and
  1                     garlic glove -- minced
                        Bouquet garni composed of
  4             sprigs  parsley -- plus
  3             sprigs  thyme -- and
  2                     bay leaves -- tied together
  2             quarts  chicken stock
  1              pound  pork sausages
  4        tablespoons  rendered duck fat or olive oil
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1 1/2         pounds  red tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
                        = (or one 28-oz can of tomatoes)
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              whole  confit of duck -- cut in 8 pieces
                        = (or 8 whole legs, halved on the bone;
                        available at D'Artagnan)
  1 1/2           cups  toasted bread crumbs

To prepare the beans, drain and put them in an 8-quart casserole with the bacon, the halved onions, the smashed garlic, bouquet garni, and chicken stock.  Bring to a boil over moderately-high heat.  Reduce the heat and simmer over low heat, uncovered, for about an hour.  Remove the bacon and cut it into 1-inch pieces.  Strain the beans, reserving both the beans and the cooking liquid and discarding the onions and bouquet garni.  Set the beans aside in a bowl.

To cook the sausages, prick each one in two places with a fork and put them in the bottom or a 10-inch sautÈ pan with 1/4 inch water.  Cook over medium heat, turning from time to time, until the water has evaporated and the sausages are browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Remove them and cut at an angle into 1-inch pieces.

Add 2 tablespoons of the duck fat to the pan with the chopped onion and cook, stirring from time to time until the onion is soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the minced garlic and continue to cook and stir for another minute.  Add the white wine and cook for another minute.  Stir in the tomatoes and continue cooking for another 5 minutes, stirring from time to time.  Season well with salt and pepper and remove from the heat.

To assemble the cassoulet, layer one-third of the beans on the bottom of the casserole and add half the bacon or salt pork, sausages, and duck confit (on the bone).  Cover this layer with half the tomato mixture.  Repeat with another third of the beans and the remaining bacon, sausages, and duck confit.  Cover this with the rest of the tomatoes and then the beans.  Add salt and pepper to taste to the bean-cooking liquid.  Pour in enough of the bean liquid to come up just to the top of the beans.  Cover the entire cassoulet with bread crumbs, dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons duck fat, and bake in a 350-degree oven for an hour and 15 minutes, or until the bread crumbs have formed a crust.  You can break through the crust with the back of a spoon three or four times during the cooking to allow the juices to help form a crust.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Cassoulet is a dish cooked in the winter in southwest France.  It is a winter dish because it is very hearty and uses preserved meats such as sausages and duck confit cooked with white beans called flageolet.  Since Cassoulet is a traditional peasant dish, there is no need to buy fancy imported ingredients.  Serve it with a green salad, plenty of red table wine, and a simple dessert such as poached oranges.

          Cedar-Planked Lobster Tails, Corn, Smoked Chile Relish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RELISH ===
  8               ears  corn -- silks removed,
                        husks left on, soaked in cold water for
                        10 minutes
     1/2                red onion -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  chipotle puree*
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
  3        tablespoons  mild vegetable oil
                        = (such as canola)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === LOBSTER ===
  4                     cedar planks - (abt 10" by 12" ea) -- soaked in cold
                        water for 1 hour
  4                     lobster tails - (8 to 10 oz ea)
                        = (or 8 smaller tails in the shell)
                        Mild vegetable oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* To make chipotle puree, buy canned chipotles in adobo and puree the chiles with the sauce in a blender or food processor. Covered and refrigerated, chipotle puree keeps for weeks.

Make The Relish:  Heat your grill to medium-high.

Place the wet corn on the grill, close the grill hood, and cook, turning once, for 15 to 20 minutes until steamed through and hot but still crisp (test by carefully piercing with a knife).

When the corn is cool enough to handle, strip off the husks and cut the kernels from the corncobs by standing them on end in a large bowl and cutting downward with a small knife.  Place in a medium bowl and add the onion.  Whisk the chipotle, lime juice, and oil together in a small bowl and pour over the corn mixture.  Mix in the cilantro and parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.  (The relish can be made a few hours in advance, covered, and kept refrigerated.)

Make The Lobster:  Heat your grill to medium-high.

Remove the planks from the water and place them on the grill to heat.  Brush the lobster tails with oil and season with salt and pepper.

Arrange the tails meat-side down on two of the planks (leave the planks on the grill).  Using tongs, place the two remaining planks on top (the planks will be hot).  Close the grill hood and cook until just cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove to a platter and top with corn relish.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings; can be doubled for 6 to 8.

Comments:  Sometimes ó admit it ó part of the fun of grilling is showing off.  When you're doing something really cool, like smoking lobster tails between two planks of wood, it's fun to have an audience to appreciate it.  More important, the results taste amazing.  The smoky, piney cedar perfumes the sweet lobster like you would not believe.  This method was traditionally used by the Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest to cook salmon, and it still works.

You'll need untreated cedar planks, which you can buy at a lumberyard or at barbecuewood.com or justsmokedsalmon.com.  For the freshest lobster tails, the Internet is also your best bet: Visit mainelobsterdirect.com or thelobsternet.com.

Recipe By     :Tori Ritchie
Serving Size  : 15    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  water
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  4              large  eggs
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dry mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1 1/2           cups  shredded sharp Cheddar cheese - (abt 6 oz)
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh chives

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Put the water, butter, and salt in a medium, heavy saucepan and place over medium-high heat.  Cook, swirling the pan a few times until the butter melts; once it has melted, increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a rolling boil.  Turn off the heat and dump in the flour.  Beat the mixture with a wooden spoon until it starts to pull away from the sides of the pan.

Take the pan off the stove, set it on a counter or hot pad, and let it cool, without stirring, for 5 minutes.

Now, work in the eggs, 1 at a time, beating the mixture well with the spoon after each addition (you have to put some muscle into it to incorporate the eggs fully).  With each addition, the dough should look glossy and slick at first, then stick to the sides of the pan before you add the next egg.  After beating in the last egg, beat in the dry mustard and cayenne, then the cheese and chives.

Scoop up a heaping teaspoon of dough and with another spoon, push it off onto the paper-lined baking sheet (it should form a mound about 1 inch in diameter).  Continue with the remaining dough, leaving an inch of space between the gougËres (work in batches as necessary, the dough can stand, covered with buttered waxed paper or parchment, for up to 1/2 hour).

Bake until the gougËres are puffy and light golden, about 25 minutes, switching pan positions halfway through.  Remove from oven and let cool slightly before serving, or turn off oven and let gougËres remain in oven, with door ajar, for up to 1 hour.

This recipe yields about 15 servings (40 to 50 gougËres).

Comments:  Making p‚te · choux was one of the first things I learned in cooking school, and I've had the pastry formula rattling around in my head ever since.  When flavored with cheese and baked, it puffs into addictive gougËre.  The French tend to make theirs with GruyËre, I use Cheddar, and either way they beg to be eaten with Pinot Noir.  For parties, I make one-bite gougËres and people tend to eat 3 or 4.  You can also split these and fill them with chicken, ham, or lobster salad for substantial hors d'oeuvres.

<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the water, butter, and salt in a medium, heavy saucepan and place over medium-high heat.  Cook, swirling the pan a few times until the butter melts; once it has melted, increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a rolling boil.  Turn off the heat and dump in the flour.  Beat the mixture with a wooden spoon until it starts to pull away from the sides of the pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Take the pan off the stove, set it on a counter or hot pad, and let it cool, without stirring, for 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Now, work in the eggs, 1 at a time, beating the mixture well with the spoon after each addition (you have to put some muscle into it to incorporate the eggs fully).  With each addition, the dough should look glossy and slick at first, then stick to the sides of the pan before you add the next egg.  After beating in the last egg, beat in the dry mustard and cayenne, then the cheese and chives.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Scoop up a heaping teaspoon of dough and with another spoon, push it off onto the paper-lined baking sheet (it should form a mound about 1 inch in diameter).  Continue with the remaining dough, leaving an inch of space between the gougËres (work in batches as necessary, the dough can stand, covered with buttered waxed paper or parchment, for up to 1/2 hour).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake until the gougËres are puffy and light golden, about 25 minutes, switching pan positions halfway through.  Remove from oven and let cool slightly before serving, or turn off oven and let gougËres remain in oven, with door ajar, for up to 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 15 servings (40 to 50 gougËres).

                        Cheddar-Parmesan Crackers

Recipe By     :Laura Werlin
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  cheddar cheese -- coarsely grated
  2             ounces  Parmesan cheese -- finely grated
     3/4           cup  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter -- softened, and
                        cut into small pieces
  2        tablespoons  water -- plus more if needed

In the bowl of a food processor, place all the ingredients except the butter and water.  Pulse 5 times.  Add the butter and pulse again until the butter pieces are the size of BB's.  Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse just until the dough holds together.  If the dough is still crumbly, add more water 1 teaspoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency.

Turn the dough out onto a large piece of waxed paper.  Roll the dough into a log, 9 to 10 inches long, and square off the ends.  Refrigerate, well wrapped, for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days or freeze it for up to 1 month.  (You may want to cut the log in half or in thirds to freeze if you think you will want to defrost a smaller amount at a time.)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

To make the crackers, cut the log into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Arrange the slices on a baking sheet 1 inch apart.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the crackers are a light golden color.  Turn the crackers and bake for 3 to 5 more minutes, or until they are golden around the edges.

Cool on a rack.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 3 dozen crackers.

Comments:  These cheesy, buttery gems will likely become a mainstay in your repertoire.  Not only are they crispy, rich, and well, addictive, they can be partially made up to a month in advance.  That's because once the dough is made, it can be frozen and simply "cut to order" as you need it.  Just be sure to freeze it in small portions so that you don't have to defrost it all at once.  Although these crackers are great plain, you can draw on the age-old "apples and cheddar" theme by topping them with a dollop of Apple-Pear Butter.

                           Chesapeake Crab Cake

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  3        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped pimientos
  8                     crumbled no-salt saltine crackers
                        = (4 to go inside crab cake; 4 to coat
                        crab cake)
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  Old Bay Seasoning -- for mild flavor
                        = (add 2 extra tspns for a spicier
                        version)
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
  1              pound  lump crabmeat -- picked over for
                        shell slivers and cartilage
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil -- for frying
  4                     white rolls -- sliced, toasted
  4                     tomato slices, 1/4" thick -- (optional)
     3/4           cup  prepared tartar sauce -- for serving

In a medium bowl, combine the egg, mayonnaise, pimiento, 4 of the crumbled crackers, salt, Old Bay, and parsley.  Mix well.  Gently fold in the crabmeat and form into 4 patties without "mixing it up too much."  The patties will be fairly wet.  Gently coat with the remaining 4 crumbled crackers on both sides.

Preheat a skillet, coat the bottom with the vegetable oil, and fry the crab cakes over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Gently turn with a thin metal spatula.

Place a crab cake on each roll with a tomato slice, if using, and serve with a ramekin of tartar sauce for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  When I was growing up, every summer weekend, my father's family would pull out the newspapers, line the picnic tables, and have a crab feast overlooking the Chesapeake Bay.  It was during one of those festive occasions that I had my first crab cake.  My grandmother, Edna, had a secret to her crab cakes: Simply put, "Don't mix it up too much" ó wise advice that I use to this day.

The trick here is to fry the crab cake quickly before it falls apart.  More expensive crabmeat, mostly "back fin," is sometimes so lumpy that it doesn't hold together.  In that case, I break apart a few of the lumps so there will be smaller pieces to help hold it together.  Another trick is to include more mayo, but I would do that only as a last resort.

                   Chevys' Three-Cheese Chile RelleÒos

Recipe By     :Peter Serantoni
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  shredded Cheddar cheese
  1 1/2           cups  shredded Monterey Jack cheese
  1                cup  queso fresco -- plus
                        additional for garnish
  6                     eggs
     1/4           cup  flour -- plus
  2               cups  flour -- for dredging
  8                     poblano chiles, at least 5" long -- roasted, peeled*
                        Canola oil -- as needed
                        Ranchero Sauce -- (see recipe)

* To roast peppers, preheat the broiler.  Place the peppers under the hot broiler, turning regularly until all side are evenly blackened.  Place them in a container and cover tightly with plastic wrap.  Let the peppers steam for 5 to 10 minutes.  Peel or rub the skin off with paper towels.

Make The RelleÒos:  Combine the three cheeses in a mixing bowl.  Cover and refrigerate.

Separate the eggs, placing the whites in a clean, dry mixing bowl and the yolks in a separate mixing bowl.  (The bowl for the whites must be completely grease free and the egg whites must not have even the slightest bit of yolk in them in order to stiffen properly when whipped.)  Using a handheld mixer on high speed, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form when the beaters are lifted up and out of the whipped whites.  Add the 1/4 cup of flour and mix for 10 seconds.  Add the reserved egg yolks and mix into the whites and flour, using medium speed, for 10 seconds.  Using a large rubber spatula, finish incorporating the yolks by folding them in.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to batter the relleÒos.

Make a cut down the length of the chiles.  Gently open chiles and hold under cold running water to rinse away the seeds.  Carefully remove the stem.  Pat the chiles dry with paper towels.  Gently press about 1/3 cup of the cheese mixture into an oval-shaped ball and place inside one of the chiles.  Using a wooden toothpick, "sew" the seam of the chile shut.  Repeat until all the chiles are filled.

Place the flour on a plate.  Gently roll the stuffed chiles in the flour to coat.  Then dip the stuffed chiles in the egg mixture and coat completely.  Line another plate with paper towels.

Fill a heavy skillet with 3 to 4 inches of the oil and heat over high until oil sizzles when a pinch of flour is dropped in.  Add the stuffed chiles and fry one at a time.  When the chiles are light golden brown, turn them to brown the other side.  Remove the chiles from the hot oil with tongs and transfer to the paper towel-lined plate to drain.

To Serve:  Place 2 relleÒos on each plate and remove the toothpicks.

Spoon the Ranchero Sauce over the relleÒos and sprinkle with any remaining cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe may be a bit time-consuming, but it's worth it.  If you really don't want to spend time making all the elements, skip the sauce and use your favorite salsa.

* To roast peppers, preheat the broiler.  Place the peppers under the hot broiler, turning regularly until all side are evenly blackened.  Place them in a container and cover tightly with plastic wrap.  Let the peppers steam for 5 to 10 minutes.  Peel or rub the skin off with paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The RelleÒos:  Combine the three cheeses in a mixing bowl.  Cover and refrigerate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Separate the eggs, placing the whites in a clean, dry mixing bowl and the yolks in a separate mixing bowl.  (The bowl for the whites must be completely grease free and the egg whites must not have even the slightest bit of yolk in them in order to stiffen properly when whipped.)  Using a handheld mixer on high speed, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form when the beaters are lifted up and out of the whipped whites.  Add the 1/4 cup of flour and mix for 10 seconds.  Add the reserved egg yolks and mix into the whites and flour, using medium speed, for 10 seconds.  Using a large rubber spatula, finish incorporating the yolks by folding them in.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to batter the relleÒos.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make a cut down the length of the chiles.  Gently open chiles and hold under cold running water to rinse away the seeds.  Carefully remove the stem.  Pat the chiles dry with paper towels.  Gently press about 1/3 cup of the cheese mixture into an oval-shaped ball and place inside one of the chiles.  Using a wooden toothpick, &quot;sew&quot; the seam of the chile shut.  Repeat until all the chiles are filled.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the flour on a plate.  Gently roll the stuffed chiles in the flour to coat.  Then dip the stuffed chiles in the egg mixture and coat completely.  Line another plate with paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill a heavy skillet with 3 to 4 inches of the oil and heat over high until oil sizzles when a pinch of flour is dropped in.  Add the stuffed chiles and fry one at a time.  When the chiles are light golden brown, turn them to brown the other side.  Remove the chiles from the hot oil with tongs and transfer to the paper towel-lined plate to drain.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To Serve:  Place 2 relleÒos on each plate and remove the toothpicks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon the Ranchero Sauce over the relleÒos and sprinkle with any remaining cheese.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This recipe may be a bit time-consuming, but it&apos;s worth it.  If you really don&apos;t want to spend time making all the elements, skip the sauce and use your favorite salsa.

           Chicken Braised With Saffron, Cinnamon, And Lavender

Recipe By     :Deborah Krasner
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  peppery olive oil
  4              whole  chicken legs -- thigh and drumstick
                        separated
                        = (or 1 whole chicken, cut up)
  2              small  onions -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dry sherry or Marsala
     1/2      teaspoon  saffron threads -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  very hot water
     1/2           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/2           cup  vodka
     1/2    tablespoon  dried lavender buds - (heaping)
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1                cup  chopped toasted almonds

Heat a large heavy Dutch oven or braising pot over medium heat until the pot's edges are warm to the touch; then add the olive oil.  When the oil is hot and shimmery and is beginning to thin and flow, add the pieces of chicken, skin-side down, until the floor of the pot is filled.  Don't overcrowd the pot.  You will need to brown the chicken in at least two batches unless your pan is very large.  As pieces brown, turn them and brown the other side.  Remove the browned pieces and hold them on a platter.  When all of the chicken is browned, drain off all but a very thin film of fat and oil.

Add the onions to the pot and cook over low heat until limp and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.  Then add the spices and cook for another minute or two.  Mix in the sherry, saffron water, and balsamic vinegar and return the chicken to the pot.  Cover tightly and let cook slowly, over the lowest possible heat, turning once, for 45 minutes or until just cooked through.

Remove the chicken pieces, and pour the excess fat into a defatting pitcher or scoop it off with a spoon.  (If you are serving the chicken later in the day or the next day, you can chill the liquid and then remove the hardened fat with a spoon).  There will be about 1 1/4 cups liquid.

About 20 minutes before serving time, heat the vodka to just below boiling in a small pan.  Take it off the heat and add the lavender buds.  Allow to steep for 15 minutes.  Then strain out and discard the flowers, and add the vodka to the defatted pan juices.  Heat the juices to cook off the alcohol, 3 to 4 minutes.

Return the chicken and its sauce to the pot and heat gently until warmed through.  Pour the honey over the top, add the toasted almonds, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Based on a list of ingredients in an anonymous 13th-century Andalusian cookbook, this recipe reflects the way aromatic spices were used in Islamic Spain.  I think they create an exotic yet homey dinner in cold or wet weather.  You can buy dried lavender buds in stores that sell bulk teas and spices, or by mail; make sure they are pesticide-free and fit for human consumption.  The flavor of this dish improves over time, so it's a good candidate for making ahead and reheating; or for leftovers for later in the week.  Serve it over rice, couscous, rosemary mashed potatoes, or polenta.

                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- fillets* removed
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  diced fresh green or black figs - -- (abt 6 figs)
     1/2           cup  crumbled well-chilled goat cheese
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  4             slices  pancetta or bacon, 1/8" thick
     1/2           cup  dry white wine

* The fillet is the long slender piece attached to the bottom side of each breast half.  They are sometimes removed from the chicken breasts and sold separately as "chicken tenders."  Pull them off and reserve them for another use, such as in stir-fries or soup.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place the chicken breasts, smooth-side up, on a work surface with the thickest portion to your right.  Butterfly the breast by cutting through the thick side toward the tapered side so that you can open the breast like a book.  Sprinkle the butterflied chicken breasts inside and out with 1/2 tablespoon of the thyme leaves, a pinch of salt, and a grinding of pepper.

In a small bowl combine the remaining 1/2 tablespoon thyme, the figs, the goat cheese, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a grinding of black pepper.  Toss to combine.  Spoon the stuffing onto one side of each chicken breast, dividing it evenly.  Close the chicken over the stuffing.  Wrap a slice of pancetta around each chicken breast.  Hold the breast closed and the pancetta in place with a toothpick or a small metal skewer.

Oil a large (about 13- by 9-inch) shallow flameproof baking pan with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Place the chicken breasts in the pan and roast in the oven for 10 minutes.  Turn and roast the other side until cooked through, about 10 minutes.

Remove the pan from the oven; transfer the chicken to a serving platter and cover with foil.  Add the wine to the pan and heat to a boil over high heat, scraping up the browned bits and reducing the wine to a syrup, about 5 minutes.  Drizzle the wine over the chicken, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This elegant recipe, good enough for entertaining, goes together in a few minute and cooks in less than half an hour.  Serve it with a side dish of freshly cooked green beans seasoned with olive oil, chopped fresh mint, and salt.

         Chicken Breasts With Chanterelle Mushrooms And Wild Rice

Recipe By     :Marianne Paquin
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             sprigs  parsley
  1                     shallot
  2        tablespoons  wild rice
  2                     chicken breasts
     1/4         pound  chanterelle mushrooms*
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

* If fresh chanterelle mushrooms are unavailable, you can replace them with dried or canned gourmet "forest" mushrooms.

Wash, drain, and chop the parsley.  Peel and chop the shallot.  Cook the wild rice according to the directions on the packet and drain.

Using a sharp knife, cut pockets in the chicken breasts and set aside. (See Note)

Wipe the mushrooms and gently sautÈ with the shallots in the butter in a frying pan for 3 minutes.  Stir into the cooked rice, add the chopped parsley, and season with salt and pepper.

Fill the pockets you have made in the chicken breasts with this mixture, and secure them with a toothpick.  Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, and cook the chicken breasts, covered, for about 7 minutes on each side.  Serve with a green salad.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Chicken has become clichÈ in these days of low-carb eating.  And lots of people find facing yet another plate of poultry just too tough to take.  But this recipe from Marianne Paquin offers up a savory stuffed breast that's anything but dull and guaranteed to jumpstart anyone's taste buds.

Note:  Lay the chicken breasts on a cutting board and slice almost in half to make a pocket as when you slice a roll for a sandwich.  Do not cut completely through (you will be stuffing the inside of the breast like a sandwich).

                       Chicken Grand-MËre Francine

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              whole  chicken - (abt 3 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  12                    cippolini onions -- peeled, trimmed
  4                     shallots -- peeled, trimmed
  2                     garlic heads -- cloves separated
                        but not peeled
  3             sprigs  thyme
  4              small  Yukon gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" chunks
  2              small  celery roots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" chunks
  1                     slab bacon -- (2 ounces) cut
                        short thin strips
  12             small  cremini or oyster mushrooms -- cleaned, trimmed
  2               cups  unsalted chicken stock
                        = (or store-bought low-sodium chicken
                        broth)

Working over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil in a 12-inch ovenproof sautÈ pan or skillet ó choose one with high sides and a cover.  Season the chicken pieces all over with salt and pepper, slip them into the pan, and cook until they are well browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Take your time ó you want a nice, deep color and you also want to cook the chickens three-quarters through at this point.  When the chicken is deeply golden, transfer it to a platter and keep it in a warm place while you work on the vegetables.

Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the cooking fat from the pan.  Lower the heat to medium, add 2 tablespoons of the butter, the onions, shallots, garlic and thyme and cook and stir just until the vegetables start to take on a little color, about 3 minutes.  Add the potatoes, celery root, and bacon and cook 1 to 2 minutes, just to start rendering the bacon fat.  Cover the pan and cook another 10 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes.

Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and return the chicken to the pan.  Cook for 10 minutes, until the vegetables and chicken are completely cooked through.  Spoon everything onto a warm serving platter or into an attractive casserole and keep warm while you finish the sauce.

Pour the chicken stock into the pan and bring it to a boil over medium heat, scraping up the bits of vegetable and chicken that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan.  Cook the stock at a boil until it is reduced by half.  Remove the pan from heat and swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.

To Serve:  Strain the sauce over the chicken and vegetables, and serve immediately with plenty of pieces of crusty baguette to sop up the sauce and spread with the soft, caramely garlic that is easily squeezed out of its skin.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Chicken grand-mËre, a savory fricassÈe, is a classic in French cuisine in general, but it was a classic in my family, too.  It was a specialty and a favorite of my Grandmother Francine, the grandmother who cooked at the original CafÈ Boulud outside Lyon, and at no time was it better than at mushroom harvest time.  Mushrooms are a typical chicken grand-mËre ingredient, but there was nothing typical about the dish when my grandmother would add roses des prÈs, pink field mushrooms, newly dug potatoes and new garlic.  Fortunately, this dish always seems to be both satisfying and soothing whether you're making it plain, with cultivated cremini or oyster mushrooms and creamer potatoes, or fancy, dressing it up with exotic mushrooms and any of the small fingerling or banana potatoes that many greenmarkets now offer.

                     Chicken Potpie With Phyllo Crust

Recipe By     :Marian Burros
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  pearl onions - (heaping)
  1 1/2         pounds  skinless chicken breasts
  1 1/2         pounds  skinless chicken thighs
  20                    baby carrots -- peeled
  1                     leek, white part only -- trimmed, sliced
  4                     thyme sprigs -- plus
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  red bell pepper
  1              large  yellow bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2         pound  shiitake mushrooms -- washed, stemmed,
                        and cut in 1/4" strips
  1                cup  fresh or frozen peas
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1              stick  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  flour
  2               cups  reserved chicken stock
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg - (to 1/2)
                        === PHYLLO TOPPING ===
  8                     phyllo leaves -- (see Help Note)
  4        tablespoons  melted butter -- for brushing

Make The Filling:  Plunge the pearl onions in boiling water for 30 seconds and drain.  Cut off the root end and slip the outside skin off the onions.  Set aside.

Cut each whole chicken breast into quarters.  In a pot, combine the chicken breasts and thighs, onions, carrots, leek, and 4 sprigs of thyme.  Season with the salt and pepper.  Add water just to cover.  Cover the pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked.

Meanwhile trim, seed, and halve the peppers.  Cut each half into thin strips, and then cut the strips in half.  Heat the oil; sautÈ the peppers over medium-high heat until they soften.  Stir in the mushrooms and sautÈ until they soften, about four minutes.  Set aside.

When the chicken is cooked, strain, reserving the liquid.  Let the chicken cool, remove the meat from the bone, and cut the meat into 1-inch chunks.  Add the chicken meat to the peppers and mushrooms.  Add the pearl onions.  Cut twelve of the carrots in half and add.  Stir in the peas, lemon juice, and chopped thyme.  Discard the leek, thyme sprigs, and the remaining carrots (or use for something else).

Melt 8 tablespoons butter over medium heat, remove from the heat, and stir in the flour.  Return to medium heat and cook, stirring, a couple of minutes until blended and bubbling.  Remove from the heat and stir in the stock.  Return to the heat and cook, stirring until the mixture thickens.  Take the pan from the heat, cool slightly, and stir in the cream.  Season with salt, pepper, and the nutmeg and stir into the chicken and vegetables.  Adjust the seasonings.

Make The Phyllo Topping:  Place a rack in the lower third of the oven.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Open the package of phyllo and cover with a damp towel.

Place a stack of 8 phyllo leaves on a work surface.  Trace the top of a deep 10-inch baking dish on the pile of phyllo leaves.  Cut the phyllo to fit and then cover them again.  Wrap the remaining phyllo in an airtight bag and use on another occasion.  Phyllo will last about a week.

Spoon the chicken and vegetables into the baking dish.

Remove one leaf, brush it with some of the melted butter, and place it butter-side up on top of the chicken and vegetables in the baking dish.  Butter the next leaf and place it on top of the first.  Repeat until all the leaves are used and brush butter on top of the final leaf.  Tuck the edges of the phyllo into the dish.  Cut a 1-inch hole in the middle of the phyllo to allow steam to escape.

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the filling is bubbly and the top is golden brown.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  I don't like getting bogged down in the kitchen.  One of the ways to make the pie easier to bake was to move from using a traditional crust to using phyllo.  The crust is wonderfully flaky and crisp this way.  I like the contrast of the crispy crust and the creamy interior, and then little bits of carrot and peas here and there, so you have all kinds of textures going on.  Sensually, it's delicious. I also like to use some of the thigh meat, as well as the breast, because it's juicier and more flavorful.

It isn't just the eating, but also the actual process of cooking this dish that is very comforting, very stress relieving. ó Marian Burros, Oct. 17, 2003

Help Notes:  The filling can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator, well covered.  It must be returned to room temperature before it is baked.

Phyllo are the paper-thin sheets of pastry used for so many Greek pastries like baklava.  Many supermarkets carry them in the frozen-food section.  Fresh is better, but not so easily available, unless there is a Greek market near you.  Completely defrost the phyllo in the refrigerator or at room temperature before using.

If you want a thicker sauce for the filling use an additional 2 tablespoons of flour.

  1                     chicken - (3 to 4 lbs) -- cut into 10 pieces
                        (each breast should be cut in half) with
                        liver reserved and minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  onion -- sliced thin rounds
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
     2/3           cup  white wine
  1 3/4           cups  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh sage

Heat a large, heavy Dutch oven (cast-iron preferred) over medium-high heat.  When hot, add the bacon bits and cook until brown and crisp, stirring frequently.  Drain the bacon bits on paper towels and reserve.  Meanwhile, season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the fat from the pot.  Add the chicken pieces, in batches if necessary, and cook until deeply browned on all sides.  (Use lots of heat and render as much of the fat from the skin as possible.)  Remove and reserve the chicken.

Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat.  Add the onion and chicken liver and cook over medium heat until the onion is soft and translucent, 7 to 8 minutes.  Add the chicken and bacon pieces back to the skillet.  Add the tomato paste and 1/3 cup of the wine and stir to coat the chicken.  Add the remaining 1/3 cup wine and the chicken stock and scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the thighs reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees measured on an instant-read thermometer.

Add the sage and salt and pepper to taste.  Remove the chicken to a bowl and cover to keep warm.  (At this point, you can degrease the sauce, if you like, by straining it into a fat separator or by letting it sit for a few minutes in a glass measuring cup and spooning off the fat that rises to the top.)

Simmer the sauce another 8 to 10 minutes or until thickened.  Remove the skin from the chicken and then add the pieces back to the pot; heat through and serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a very flavorful stew because the chicken liver gives it depth.  Be sure to sautÈ the chicken pieces over medium-high heat.  This will render as much fat as possible from the skin, which is then discarded.  The chicken breasts need to be halved in order to provide uniform pieces for cooking.  Serve this dish with mashed potatoes.

                   Chicken With Forty Cloves Of Garlic

Recipe By     :James Beard
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  olive oil
  8                     chicken drumstick and thighs
                        = (or 16 of either)
  4                     celery ribs -- cut long strips
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  6             sprigs  parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon
                        = (or 1 tspn dried tarragon)
     1/2           cup  dry vermouth
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  40                    garlic cloves -- unpeeled

Put the oil in a shallow dish, add the chicken pieces, and turn them to coat all sides evenly with the oil.

Cover the bottom of a heavy 6-quart casserole with a mixture of the celery and onions, add the parsley and tarragon, and lay the chicken pieces on top.  Pour the vermouth over them, sprinkle with salt and pepper, add a dash or two of nutmeg, and tuck the garlic cloves around and between the chicken pieces.  Cover the top of the casserole tight with aluminum foil and then the lid (this creates an air-tight seal so the steam won't escape).  Bake in a 375 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours, without removing the cover.

Serve the chicken, pan juices, and whole garlic cloves with thin slices of heated French bread or toast.  The garlic should be squeezed from the root end of its papery husk onto the bread or toast, spread like butter, and eaten with the chicken.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  "This is a ProvenÁal recipe that I taught for years in my classes," Beard said, "and one that never failed to astonish the students because the garlic becomes so mild and buttery when it's cooked through!"

                    Chicken With Peanuts - {Gong Bao}

Recipe By     :Fuchsia Dunlop
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     boneless chicken breasts - (2/3 lb total)
                        = (with or without skin)
  3                     garlic cloves
                        Fresh ginger equal to garlic amount
  5                     scallions -- white parts only
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
                        Generous handful of dried red chiles - -- (at least 10)
                        = (preferably Sichuanese)
  1           teaspoon  whole Sichuan pepper
     2/3           cup  roasted unsalted peanuts
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  Shaoxing rice wine
                        = (or medium-dry sherry)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  potato flour
                        = (or 2 1/4 tspns cornstarch)
  1         tablespoon  water
                        === SAUCE ===
  3          teaspoons  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  potato flour
                        = (or 1 1/8 tspns cornstarch)
  1           teaspoon  dark soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  light soy sauce
  3          teaspoons  Chinkiang
                        = (or black Chinese vinegar)
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  chicken stock
                        = (or water)

Cut the chicken as evenly as possible into 1/2-inch strips and then cut these into small cubes.  Place in a small bowl and mix in the marinade ingredients.

Peel and thinly slice the garlic and ginger, and chop the scallions into chunks as long as their diameter (to match the chicken cubes).  Snip the chiles in half or into 2-inch sections.  Wearing rubber gloves, discard as many seeds as possible.

Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl ó if you dip your finger in, you can taste the sweet-sour base of the gong bao flavor.

Season the wok, then add 2 tablespoons of oil and heat over a high flame.  When the oil is hot but not yet smoking, add the chiles and Sichuan pepper and stir-fry briefly until they are crisp and the oil is spicy and fragrant.  Take care not to burn the spices (you can remove the wok from the heat if necessary to prevent overheating).

Quickly add the chicken and fry over a high flame, stirring constantly.  As soon as the chicken cubes have separated, add the ginger, garlic, and scallions and continue to stir-fry for a few minutes until they are fragrant and the meat is cooked through (test one of the larger pieces to make sure).

Give the sauce a stir and add it to the wok, continuing to stir and toss.  As soon as the sauce has become thick and shiny, add the peanuts, stir them in, and serve.

This recipe yields 2 main dish servings.

Variations:  The same dish can be made with cubes of pork, shrimp, or prawns.  Cashew nuts can be used instead of peanuts for a grander version of this dish, although peanuts are more traditional.

Comments:  This dish, also known as Kung Pao chicken, has the curious distinction of having been labeled as politically incorrect during the Cultural Revolution.  It is named after a late Qing Dynasty (late nineteenth century) governor of Sichuan, Ding Baozhen, who is said to have particularly enjoyed eating it ó gong bao was his official title.  No one can quite agree on the details of its origins: some say it was a dish Ding Baozhen brought with him from his home province of Guizhou; others that he ate it in a modest restaurant when he went out in humble dress to observe the real lives of his subjects; still others, rather implausibly, that his chef invented the finely chopped chicken dish because Ding Baozhen had bad teeth.  Whatever the truth of its origins, its association with an imperial bureaucrat was enough to provoke the wrath of the Cultural Revolution radicals, and it was renamed "fast-fried chicken cubes" (hong bao ji ding) or "chicken cubes with seared chiles" (hu la ji ding) until its political rehabilitation in the 1980s.

Gong Bao chicken is beautiful to look at: a glorious medley of chicken, golden peanuts and bright red chiles.  The sauce is based on a light sweet-and-sour, pepped up with a deep chile spiciness and a trace of Sichuan pepper that will make your lips tingle pleasantly.  The ingredients are all cut in harmony, the chicken in small cubes and the scallion in short pieces to complement the peanuts.  The chicken should be just cooked and wonderfully succulent; the nuts are added at the very last minute so they keep their crispness.

                     Chicken With Sichuan Peppercorns

Recipe By     :Grace Young
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  boneless skinless chicken thigh -- cut 1/2" cubes
  3          teaspoons  Shao Hsing rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  black soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Chinkiang
                        = (or balsamic vinegar)
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  chili oil
  2        tablespoons  homemade chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  8              small  dried red chilies
  1           teaspoon  thinly-sliced ginger
  1              small  garlic clove -- thinly sliced
     1/4      teaspoon  roasted and ground Sichuan peppercorns
  1                     scallion -- chopped

In a medium bowl, combine the chicken, 1 teaspoon of the rice wine, the cornstarch, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and the white pepper.  In a small bowl, combine the black soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, chili oil, broth, the remaining 2 teaspoons rice wine, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.

Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok over high heat until a bead of water vaporizes within 1 to 2 seconds of contact.  Swirl in the vegetable oil, add the dried chilies, and carefully add the chicken, spreading it evenly in the wok.  Cook undisturbed 1 minute, until the chicken begins to brown.  Then, using a metal spatula, stir-fry 1 to 2 minutes or until the chicken is browned on all sides but not cooked through.  Transfer to a plate and set aside.

Add the ginger, garlic, ground Sichuan peppercorns, and scallion and stir-fry in the dry wok 15 seconds.  Return the chicken to the wok.  Stir the sauce mixture and swirl it into the wok.  Stir-fry 30 seconds or until the chicken is just cooked through and the sauce is slightly thickened.  Discard the chilies.

This recipe yields 4 servings as part of a multi-course meal.

Comments:  Instructor Chef Kevin Chuk, of the Chinese Cuisine Training Institute in Hong Kong, stir-fries this dish using a northern-style wok.  I have adapted Chef Chuk's recipe by making it medium hot, but for more heat increase the chili oil.  Sichuan peppercorns add a wonderful aromatic taste.

        Chicken With Tart Grape Sauce As Prepared In The Dordogne

Recipe By     :Paula Wolfert
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  meaty chicken legs -- room temperature
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
  12                    plump garlic cloves -- whole but not peeled
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  6        tablespoons  verjus - (to 7)
  3               cups  unsalted chicken stock -- reduced to 1 cup
  12                    sour green grapes -- preferably tart
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley

Trim away any excess fat from the chicken legs.  Dry well and rub with salt and pepper.

Set a large, deep skillet, preferably a sauteuse, over moderately-high heat.  Add 2 1/2 tablespoons of the butter, then the chicken, skin-side down, and the garlic cloves.  Brown for 1 minute each side, shaking the skillet to keep the chicken and garlic from sticking.

Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet tightly, and cook for 10 minutes.  Uncover the skillet, tilt, and skim the fat off the pan juices.  Turn the chicken over.  Add the white wine, cover again, and cook slowly for another 10 minutes.

Uncover the skillet, add 5 tablespoons of the verjus, and quickly cover the pan so that chicken pieces absorb all the aroma and flavor.  Cook slowly for 5 minutes longer.

Add 3/4 cup of the stock and cook for 5 minutes.  Raise the heat and add the butter and the remaining stock and verjus.  Swirl the skillet over the heat to combine the ingredients.  Add the grapes and warm through.  Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.

Arrange the chicken, garlic, and grapes on a warm platter.  Pour the sauce over the chicken.  Sprinkle with the parsley and serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Verjus is made from sour green grapes.  You can make it yourself and freeze it or purchase a bottle at www.earthy.com.  Its tart, fruity flavor provides a refreshing balance to the garlic, which becomes very sweet after cooking.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2         pounds  russet or Yukon Gold potatoes - (to 1 3/4) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  diced onion
     1/4           cup  diced green bell pepper
     1/4           cup  diced red bell pepper
                        = (or additional green bell pepper)
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder -- (optional)
                        Minced fresh chives or parsley -- (optional)

Warm the butter in a 10- to 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat.  Stir in the potatoes, and when coated with a bit of butter, season them with salt and pepper and cover the skillet.  Cook for 20 minutes, during which you should hear only a faint cooking sound.

Uncover the potatoes and cook for 30 minutes longer, turning them at 10 minute intervals and patting them back down.  When you turn them the first time, stir in the onion, bell peppers, and chili powder if desired.  As the potatoes soften, pat them down more lightly, bringing as much of their surface in contact with the skillet as possible without mashing them.

Cook the potatoes for about 20 minutes longer, turning them at 5-minute intervals.  During the last 10 minutes, bring the heat up to medium and, if you wish, add more salt and pepper.  The home fries are ready when the potato cubes are richly browned and clearly crisp with tender, melting centers.  Plate them up immediately, scatter with chives if you wish, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 side dish servings.

Comments:  If you don't have leftover potatoes for hash browns, make equally good home fries from scratch.  Starting with raw potatoes means a longer cooking time, but they require little more than an occasional stir while you're figuring out your weekend.  If you want to double the serving, make it in two skillets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DEEP-DISH PIZZA DOUGH ===
  4               cups  unbleached bread flour
     2/3           cup  fine-grind yellow cornmeal
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/4      teaspoons  table salt
                        = (or 2 1/2 tspns kosher salt)
  2 1/4      teaspoons  instant yeast
  5        tablespoons  corn oil
  1 1/2           cups  lukewarm water -- (90 to 95 degrees)
                        === CRUSHED TOMATO SAUCE ===
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried basil -- (optional)
                        = (or 2 tbspns minced fresh basil)
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano -- (optional)
                        = (or 1 tbspn minced fresh oregano)
  1         tablespoon  granulated garlic powder
                        = (or 5 cloves fresh garlic, minced or
                        pressed)
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
                        = (or freshly-squeezed lemon juice, or a
                        combination)
  1           teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
                        === FOR THE PIZZA ===
  2                     Deep-Dish Pizza Dough balls - (18 oz ea)
  2 1/2           cups  coarsely shredded full-fat or
                        low-fat low-moisture mozzarella cheese
  4               cups  Crushed Tomato Sauce
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano,
                        Pecorino Romano, Asiago, or other dry
                        aged cheese

Make The Dough:  With a large metal spoon, stir together all the ingredients in a 4-quart bowl or the bowl of an electric stand mixer until combined.  If mixing with an electric mixer, fit it with the dough hook and mix on low speed for about 4 minutes or until the dough forms a coarse ball and clears the sides and the bottom of the bowl.  Add more flour or water by the tablespoonful as needed.  Let the dough rest for 15 minutes, then mix again on low speed for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, or until the dough is smooth, stretchy, and tacky but not sticky.  The dough should pass the windowpane test.

If mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the spoon into room-temperature water and use it much like a dough hook, working the dough vigorously as you rotate the bowl with your other hand.  Continue mixing for about 4 minutes, or until the dough forms a coarse ball, adding more flour or water by the tablespoonful as needed.  Let the dough rest for 15 minutes, then transfer it to a lightly floured counter.  Dust the top with flour to absorb the surface moisture, then knead the dough by hand for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it is smooth, stretchy, and tacky but not sticky.  The dough should pass the windowpane test.

Form the dough into a ball and place it in a bowl brushed with olive oil.  Roll the dough in the oil to coat the entire surface, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap.  Let the dough sit at room temperature for about 2 hours, or until doubled in size.

Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and round them into balls.  Rub the surface of the dough balls with olive oil, place them on the countertop, and cover them with plastic wrap.  Let the dough sit at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before making the pizza.

Make The Crushed Tomato Sauce:  In a bowl, stir together all the ingredients, starting with 1/2 teaspoon salt and adding more to taste.  Store in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Make The Pizza:  Place a baking stone, if using, on the middle shelf of the oven (unless you know your oven well enough to place it on a different shelf) and preheat to 400 degrees.  If you do not have a baking stone, position 1 oven shelf in the center of the oven and a second in the lowest position.

Oil two 10-inch round cake pans.  Roll out each dough ball with a rolling pin, working from the center outward, into a disk about 14 inches in diameter.  If the dough resists rolling or becomes too springy and elastic, cover it with a towel and let it rest for 5 minutes before resuming.  Lay a finished disk over a prepared pan, lower it gently into the pan, and then press the dough snuggly into the bottom, corners, and then up the sides.  Ideally the dough will drape slightly over the rim; crimp the overhang to form a thick edge around the top of the rim.  Prick the entire surface with a fork to minimize bubbling in the oven.

If you like a thin crust, bake immediately.  If you prefer a thicker crust, cover the dough-lined pans with a kitchen towel and let sit at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes.  Bake the crusts on the middle shelf of the oven for 3 to 4 minutes to set them.  The rim of the dough will slide back down into the pan somewhat, but this is normal and will form the edge.

Place each crust in its pan on the counter and let cool for at least 5 minutes.  Evenly spread the mozzarella cheese in the bottom, then ladle in the tomato sauce to fill the pans.  Sprinkle the grated aged cheese evenly over the top of the sauce.

Place the pans in the oven on the baking stone or, if not using a stone, on the lowest oven shelf.  Immediately reduce the heat to 375 degrees and bake for 15 minutes.  Then, if baking on a stone, rotate the pan 180 degrees.  If baking directly on the shelf, move the pans to the middle shelf and rotate them 180 degrees.  In either case, continue to bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer, or until the edges of the crust are a deep brown (but not burned) and the cheese is golden.

Remove the pizzas from the oven and place on a cooling rack for 5 minutes.  Remove the pizzas from the pans by loosening the crust with a metal spatula and then gently sliding the spatula under the pizza to lift it out.  Serve the pizzas on a cutting board, or cut and serve directly from the pan.

This recipe yields two 10-inch pizzas.

Comments:  Admittedly, I was not totally won over by the deep-dish pizzas of Chicago.  But if the happy crowds I saw there are any indication, thousands of people clearly feel as strongly about the pizzas at Lou Malnatti's, Gino's East, Giordano's, Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due as I do about the pizzas at Pizzeria Bianco, Da Michele, and Frank Pepe's.  It is instead a question of category preference: I just happen to be a thin-crust neo-Neapolitan kind of guy.  Still, I have discovered that every once in a while I'm in the mood for the full-bodied adventure of deep-dish, and I have developed recipes for the Chicago model to satisfy that craving.  Various toppings follow.

DEEP-DISH TOPPINGS:

ï Ricotta And Cheese:  Cut the quantity of mozzarella cheese in the master recipe to 1 1/2 cups and stir it together with 1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese or full-fat or low-fat small-curd cottage cheese.  Add 2 eggs, beaten, and 1 teaspoon salt and stir until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.  Fill the prebaked shells with the cheese mixture and ladle the tomato sauce over the cheese to fill the shell.  Omit the grated aged cheese, if desired.  Bake as directed.

ï Italian Sausage:  This is the most popular deep-dish topping in restaurants.  You can make it two different ways.  For my favorite method, shape 2/3 pound Italian pork sausage meat (removed from the casing) into 2 patties the diameter of the deep-dish pans.  Layer the mozzarella cheese, the tomato sauce, and the dry aged cheese in the pan as directed, then lay the patty over the top like a lid.  Brush the patty with olive oil and bake as directed.  The sausage will have taken on a dark, rich color when the pizza is ready.

For the second method, which is less fatty, fry 2/3 pound Italian sausage meat in a frying pan over medium heat, stirring to break up any lumps, for about 5 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Transfer the contents of the pan to a sieve placed over a bowl to drain off the fat.  Layer the mozzarella cheese and the tomato sauce in the pan, scatter the cooked sausage over the top, and then finish with the grated aged cheese.  Bake as directed.

You can substitute ground beef, lamb, chicken, or turkey seasoned with salt and pepper (about 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper) and minced fresh garlic or granulated garlic powder to taste for the sausage in either method.

ï Spinach:  In a bowl, stir together 12 ounces thawed, frozen chopped spinach, squeezed dry, with 2 1/2 cups shredded full-fat or low-fat low-moisture mozzarella cheese.  Season to taste with minced fresh garlic or granulated garlic powder to taste, if desired.  Substitute this mixture for the mozzarella cheese in the master recipe and then continue as directed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3             pounds  boneless beef chuck -- cut 4-oz cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  16             large  garlic cloves
                        = (4 minced -- 12 halved)
  2              large  onions -- minced
  1              large  onion -- stuck with
  4                     whole cloves
  2              large  carrots -- diced
  3              large  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
                        = (or a 14-oz can crushed Italian
                        tomatoes)
  1             bottle  red wine - (750 ml)
                        = (such as CÙtes du RhÙne)
     1/4           cup  sherry wine vinegar
                        Bouquet garni made with
  5                     flat-leaf parsley sprigs -- plus
  3                     thyme sprigs -- plus
  2                     bay leaves -- and
  2                     leek greens -- tied in cheesecloth

In a large flameproof casserole or Dutch oven, heat the oil over moderately-high heat until hot.  Add the beef in batches, without crowding, and cook until well browned on all sides.  Regulate the heat to avoid scorching the meat.  As each batch is browned, transfer the meat to a large plate and season generously with salt and pepper.

In the remaining fat in the casserole, cook the minced garlic, minced onions, and carrots over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until soft and fragrant; about 8 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and their liquid and cook for 3 minutes longer.  Add the wine and vinegar and bring to a boil over high heat; boil for 3 minutes.  Add the beef and any accumulated juices, the halved garlic cloves, the onion stuck with cloves, and the bouquet garni.  Let cool completely, then cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Let the meat and vegetables return to room temperature.  Cover and bring to a boil over moderate heat.  Reduce the heat to very low and simmer very gently until the meat is fairly tender; about 2 hours.  Let cool completely, then cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Scrape off any fat that has solidified on the surface of the daube.  Bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally.  Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer gently for 1 hour.  The daube is ready to serve at this point, but for even better flavor, repeat the cooling, overnight chilling, and cooking one more time.

Discard the bouquet garni.  Remove the meat from the casserole and boil the liquid until thickened; about 10 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Return the meat to the casserole and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This recipe appeared in Food & Wine many years ago and is a winner.  In the autumn whenever I ask family and friends what they'd like for a weekend dinner, all voices rise in unison: "That French stew!"  Slightly offended because no one asked for any of my dishes, I make them grovel a bit.  And then I make it.

You'll be tempted to serve the daube after the second cooking, but don't.  It really does benefit from the extra 24 hours of mellowing.

You&apos;ll be tempted to serve the daube after the second cooking, but don&apos;t.  It really does benefit from the extra 24 hours of mellowing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TURKEY STOCK ===
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
  2                     turkey wing drumettes
                        = (the meatiest part of the wing)
                        Turkey neck, heart, and gizzard -- (optional)
  3               cups  chopped yellow onion
  2               cups  chopped carrot
  1                cup  chopped celery
                        Stems from 1 bunch fresh parsley
  2                     fresh thyme sprigs
                        = (or 2 tspns dried thyme)
  2                     bay leaves
  8               cups  low-sodium canned chicken broth
     3/4           cup  dry white wine, dry sherry or tawny Port
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === TURKEY ===
  1                     fresh 12-pound turkey -- neck, heart,
                        and gizzard used to make Turkey Stock,
                        liver reserved
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  low-sodium canned chicken broth
     1/2           cup  tawny Port
     1/4           cup  peanut oil
  1                     yellow onion -- unpeeled, quartered
  2              large  carrots -- unpeeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
                        === GRAVY ===
  7               cups  Turkey Stock -- prepared tawny Port
     1/4           cup  corn-starch (corn flour)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Make The Stock:  Warm the oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat.  Brown the turkey parts well, turning once or twice, about 14 minutes.  Stir in the vegetables and herbs.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pot occasionally, about 15 minutes.  (If making giblet gravy, remove the heart and gizzard at this point and reserve.)

Add the broth, wine, and salt and pepper to taste and bring to a simmer.  Cover partially and cook for 35 minutes.  Strain the stock, pouring it through a sieve into a large bowl.  If using right away, spoon off the visible fat or pour into a fat separator.  Otherwise, let cool for about 30 minutes, then cover and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.  Using a large spoon, remove the solid fat from the top of the stock and discard.  Refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months.

Make The Turkey:  Remove the turkey from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for up to 2 hours to take off the chill.  Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees.

Rinse the turkey inside and out and pat dry.  Trim off and discard excess fat.  Fold the wings underneath the back of the turkey to prevent their over browning.  Lightly salt and pepper the turkey inside and out.  Stuff and truss the turkey if desired.

Place the turkey on a rack in a flameproof roasting pan.  Spread 2 tablespoons of the butter over the turkey breast.  Dampen an 18-inch square of doubled cheesecloth (muslin) and drape it over the turkey breast, leaving the drumsticks uncovered.  Place the pan in the oven and roast the turkey for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the chicken broth, the remaining 6 tablespoons butter, the Port, and the peanut oil.  Warm over low heat until the butter has melted.  At the 30-minute mark, using a bulb baster, baste the turkey through the cheesecloth with some of the broth mixture.  Continue to roast, basting every 20 minutes, for 1 1/4 hours.  Add the onion and carrots to the roasting pan, stirring to coat them with the drippings.  Continue to roast, basting the turkey every 30 minutes with the remaining broth mixture and then with the accumulated pan juices, until the vegetables are well browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the turkey thigh away from the bone registers 175 degrees, about 1 1/4 hours longer (for a total roasting time of about 3 hours).  Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and cover it loosely with aluminum foil while you make the gravy.

Make The Gravy:  To make the gravy, place the roasting pan with the pan juices and vegetables over 2 burners and turn the heat to medium-high.  Add all but 1/4 cup of the turkey stock to the roasting pan and bring to a brisk simmer.  Stir to deglaze the pan, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom, about 5 minutes.

Pour the contents of the pan through a sieve set over a large bowl, pressing hard on the vegetables with the back of a large spoon to extract all the liquid; discard the solids.  Spoon off as much of the fat from the liquid as possible, or pour the liquid into a fat separator and pour off the liquid.

Transfer the liquid to a medium saucepan.  Place over medium-high heat and simmer briskly for 5 minutes.  Finely chop the heart and gizzard reserved from making the turkey stock and the reserved uncooked liver.  Reduce the heat to low and stir the giblets into the gravy.  In a small bowl, stir the remaining 1/4 cup stock into the cornstarch to make a slurry.  Gradually stir the slurry into the gravy.  Cook until the gravy thickens, 3 to 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Carve the turkey and serve with the gravy.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Make-Ahead Tip:  The stock may be made up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated, or up to 3 months before and frozen.  Or, it may be made while the turkey sits before roasting.

Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  onions -- thinly sliced
  6        tablespoons  honey
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2              large  or 4 small Cornish game hens
  2        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  12                    threads Spanish saffron -- toasted and crushed
  12                    fresh figs -- peeled and halved

In a heavy ovenproof skillet or Dutch oven, combine the onions with 3 tablespoons of the honey, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions turn a deep caramel color, 25 to 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, wash and dry the hens.  In a small bowl, mix the oil with the saffron, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Coat the hens inside and out with the mixture and set them on top of the onions.  Still over medium heat, cover, and cook until the hens are tender and the juices run clear, 45 to 50 minutes.

Preheat the broiler.  Remove the hens from the pan and cut them in half, if desired.  Return to the pan and surround with the figs.  Drizzle the dish with the remaining 3 tablespoons honey.  Broil, watching carefully, until the breasts turn brown, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer to a serving platter and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Figs ripen in late summer or early fall.  All over Morocco, Sephardic cooks try to incorporate them into their family menus.  This luscious tagine, best served with warm crusty bread, is one way of doing so.

Meanwhile, wash and dry the hens.  In a small bowl, mix the oil with the saffron, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Coat the hens inside and out with the mixture and set them on top of the onions.  Still over medium heat, cover, and cook until the hens are tender and the juices run clear, 45 to 50 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the broiler.  Remove the hens from the pan and cut them in half, if desired.  Return to the pan and surround with the figs.  Drizzle the dish with the remaining 3 tablespoons honey.  Broil, watching carefully, until the breasts turn brown, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer to a serving platter and serve.

Comments:  Figs ripen in late summer or early fall.  All over Morocco, Sephardic cooks try to incorporate them into their family menus.  This luscious tagine, best served with warm crusty bread, is one way of doing so.

                            Corsican Omelette

Recipe By     :Nigella Lawson
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        Leaves from 3 or 4 good-sized
                        fresh mint sprigs -- shredded
  4             ounces  chËvre

Beat the eggs and season with salt and pepper.  Melt the butter in a frying pan approximately 10 inches in diameter.

When the butter has melted and is bubbling, throw in most of the shredded mint, saving some for sprinkling on top at the end.  When it has sizzled in the butter and become vibrantly green, pour in the beaten eggs and tip the egg around the pan.

Crumble the cheese over the omelette and cook, lifting the sides and swilling the pan around to let any runny egg cook in the heat underneath.

When the top of the omelette looks nearly set but still gooey, fold into thirds lengthwise ó in other words, fold in two sides, leaving a strip of white-blobbed omelette facing up in a strip in the middle ó and slide onto a plate.  Sprinkle with the reserved mint and eat.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Comments:  Bear with me ó as telemarketers like to say ó while I gush for a bit.  This has to be the world's best omelette.  I call it Corsican not because it stems from any in-depth research into, or indeed intimate knowledge of, the food of Corsica but because it is the adaptation, from memory, of the best thing I ate there on a holiday now nearly 17 years ago.

Also, to be fair, the key ingredient is itself Corsican, brocciu, a soft goat's whey cheese that's left to drain and shape in woven baskets; think ricotta with an edge.  You sometimes come across this omelette in a sweetened version, with sugar sprinkled along with the mint (an herb that the Corsicans use much more in their cooking than the French) but I like it sharp and savory.  I'm not pretending that you can get brocciu, but that hasn't ever stopped me making it: I just use that goat's cheese ó chËvre ó that comes in a log and is incredibly easy to come by.  Cut away the soft-kid skin and crumble the white sharp cheese into the eggs in the pan: the salty sharpness contrasts exquisitely with the rich fattiness of the eggs; against which, too, the fresh hit of mint is positively exhilarating, though to tell the truth, I make this just as often (just because it's easier to keep both chËvre and eggs in the refrigerator on constant standby) without it.  Think of this more as a lunch or supper dish, although I wouldn't turn it down at any time of day.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BEET AND HORSERADISH R…MOULADE ===
  1              bunch  small beets
                        Extra-virgin olive oil for coating -- if baking, plus
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  rice or champagne vinegar
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated horseradish - (to 3)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === CRAB CAKES ===
     3/4         pound  yellow Finn potatoes - (to 1 lb)
  1              pound  fresh blue-crab meat -- picked clean
  1                     red bell pepper -- roasted, peeled,
                        seeded, and minced
  3                     scallions, white part only -- minced
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
     1/2                jalapeÒo -- seeded, minced
  1                     egg
  6        tablespoons  mayonnaise - (to 7)
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  fresh toasted bread crumbs - (to 3/4)
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish
                        Chervil or tarragon sprigs -- for garnish

To Make The RÈmoulade:  Bake or steam the beets.  To bake the beets, trim them, leaving 1 inch of the stem intact, but do not peel.  Lightly coat with olive oil and put them in a roasting pan or baking sheet.  Bake at 375 degrees until fork tender.  This should take 30 to 50 minutes, depending on their size and age.  To steam the beets, trim as directed but do not rub with oil.  Place on a steamer rack over boiling water, cover, and steam for 15 to 25 minutes, until tender.  Allow the beets to cool, then peel and grate enough to measure 1 cup.  Save any leftover beets for salads.

Whisk together the vinegar, mustard, and 1/4 cup oil in a bowl, until emulsified.  Stir in the 1 cup beets, the horseradish to taste, and the pepper.  Cover and refrigerate until serving.

To Make The Crabcakes:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Bake the potatoes for 15 to 20 minutes for small ones and up to 1 hour if they're very large, until tender.  Allow them to cool, then peel and finely grate.

To make the crab mixture, combine the crabmeat, potatoes, bell pepper, scallions, parsley, jalapeÒo, egg, 6 tablespoons mayonnaise, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.  Mix gently.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon mayonnaise if the mixture seems too dry.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs over the mixture and combine gently, adding more bread crumbs, as necessary, until the mixture just holds together.  (If you are going to panfry the crab cakes, the mixture can be looser.)  Cover and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes (or for as long as several hours).

When the crab mixture is well chilled, form the cakes.  Make 12 small ones or 6 large ones, depending on your preference, making each one an equal thickness at least 3/8-inch.  To deep-fry the crab cakes, pour the oil to a depth of 2 inches into a deep, heavy saucepan and heat to 375 degrees on a deep-frying thermometer.  Working in batches, add the crab cakes and fry until golden brown and warm through.  This should take 4 to 6 minutes, depending on how cold they are when they go in.  Do not crowd the pan, and turn the cakes over if they float.  Using tongs or a wire skimmer, transfer the cakes to paper towels to drain briefly and keep warm in a low oven while you fry the remaining crab cakes.

To panfry the crab cakes, use just enough oil to coat the surface on a nonstick skillet.  Place over medium-high heat, and when hot, add the crab cakes, again being careful not to crowd the pan.  Cook for about 7 minutes, until golden brown and crisp on one side.  Turn the crab cakes over and cook on the second side for about 5 minutes until brown.  Place on a platter in a low oven while you cook the remaining crab cakes.

To serve, divide the crab cakes among serving plates and top each with a small dollop of the rÈmoulade.  Garnish with lemon wedges and chervil sprigs and serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Believe it or not, the secret ingredient in these crab cakes is grated baked potatoes.  Most recipes call for a lot of bread crumbs, which makes for very dry crab cakes, but we've found that substituting potatoes for part of the bread crumbs keeps the cakes nice and moist.  We use yellow Finns, but if you can't find them, use any small, creamy potato or even a russet type.  We have made these crab cakes with our local Dungeness crab, which works well, but we like the East Coast blue-crab better.  It has a sweeter flavor and a better texture for this dish.

Other decisions to make: The crab cakes can be deep-fried or sautÈed in a nonstick skillet, and you can make them any size.  I like appetizer-sized crab cakes, but Brigid loves them so big you could make sandwiches with them.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STARTER ===
  1                cup  warm milk
  2 1/2    tablespoons  active dry yeast
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached flour
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        === DOUGH ===
  1                cup  raw pistachios
  1           teaspoon  salt -- plus a few pinches
  4 1/2           cups  unbleached flour -- plus
                        more for kneading and shaping the dough
  1         tablespoon  freshly-grated lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  freshly-grated orange zest
     1/2           cup  candied orange and lemon rind -- (optional)
  1                cup  dried cranberries
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- softened, plus
                        extra butter for the pans
  1                cup  sugar
  4              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks (whites reserved for glaze)

Make the Starter:  In a small glass bowl, combine the warm milk, yeast, flour, and sugar and stir to blend.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes.

Make the Dough:  Place the pistachios on a baking sheet and spray them with water, sprinkle with a pinch or two of salt, and toast for 10 minutes, watching to make sure they do not burn.  Cool completely and chop coarsely.

In a bowl, combine the 1 teaspoon salt, the flour, lemon and orange zests, candied orange and lemon peel, if using, cranberries, pistachios, rum, and vanilla.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed for 2 minutes or until fluffy.  Add the eggs and yolks and beat well.  Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture, mixing just until combined.  Gradually add the starter and continue to beat on low speed until all ingredients are incorporated.  The dough should not be sticky or too firm.  It should look buttery and a little ragged.

Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and knead for 1 to 2 minutes, pushing the dough away from you with the heels of your hands, and then folding it back over on itself.  The dough will be smooth and satiny.

Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for about 2 hours, or until doubled in size.  Gently turn out the dough onto a work surface and divide it into 4 equal pieces, if making smaller loaves, or into 2 pieces if making larger loaves; keep as much air in the dough as possible.  Let the pieces rest, covered with a clean dish towel, for 10 minutes.

For the smaller loaves, butter four 1-pound coffee cans or other deep molds that are 4 to 5 inches wide.  Use 2-pound coffee cans to make two large panettone.  Shape each piece into a smooth ball and place the dough in the mold.  It should fill half the mold.

Beat the reserved egg whites and brush the tops of the loaves.  Cover and let the loaves rise for 1 hour, or until just slightly less than doubled.  (The dough may be active and rise quickly, so you may not need the full hour.)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Uncover the loaves, place the molds on the middle rack of the oven, and reduce the heat to 350 degrees.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes for the smaller molds and up to 45 minutes for the larger molds.  (If, after 20 minutes of baking, the top of the bread is taking on too much color, cover loosely with a piece of aluminum foil.)  The bread is done when a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.  Cool for 15 minutes, then carefully remove the loaves from the cans and place the panettone on wire racks to cool completely.  Panettone will keep fresh for up to a week in a plastic bag; freeze them for up to 6 months.

This recipe yields 4 small or 2 large loaves.

Comments:  Originating in Milan, Italy, this cake is traditionally served at Christmas, but its popularity is so widespread that it can be found in bakery and pastry shops almost year round.

Make the Starter:  In a small glass bowl, combine the warm milk, yeast, flour, and sugar and stir to blend.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the Dough:  Place the pistachios on a baking sheet and spray them with water, sprinkle with a pinch or two of salt, and toast for 10 minutes, watching to make sure they do not burn.  Cool completely and chop coarsely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl, combine the 1 teaspoon salt, the flour, lemon and orange zests, candied orange and lemon peel, if using, cranberries, pistachios, rum, and vanilla.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed for 2 minutes or until fluffy.  Add the eggs and yolks and beat well.  Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture, mixing just until combined.  Gradually add the starter and continue to beat on low speed until all ingredients are incorporated.  The dough should not be sticky or too firm.  It should look buttery and a little ragged.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and knead for 1 to 2 minutes, pushing the dough away from you with the heels of your hands, and then folding it back over on itself.  The dough will be smooth and satiny.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for about 2 hours, or until doubled in size.  Gently turn out the dough onto a work surface and divide it into 4 equal pieces, if making smaller loaves, or into 2 pieces if making larger loaves; keep as much air in the dough as possible.  Let the pieces rest, covered with a clean dish towel, for 10 minutes.

               Cranberry-Cream Cheese-Stuffed French Toast

Recipe By     :Cheryl Alters Jamison and Bill Jamison
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  white bread or brioche loaf - (to 1 1/4) -- unsliced
                        === FILLING ===
     1/4         pound  cream cheese -- softened
  1         tablespoon  sugar - (to 2)
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract -- optional
  1                can  jellied whole cranberry sauce - -- (14 to 15 oz)
  1 1/4           cups  whole milk
  3              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1              pinch  salt
                        Unsalted butter
                        Vegetable oil
                        Confectioners' sugar
                        Real maple syrup -- warmed

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Butter a baking sheet.  Cut the bread into 8 equal slices about 1 inch thick.

Mash the cream cheese with 1 tablespoon sugar and, if you wish, the almond extract in a medium bowl.  Stir in the cranberries and add more sugar if the flavor is too tart.  The mixture should be thick and chunky.

In a shallow dish or bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, 1 tablespoon sugar, vanilla, and salt.

With a serrated knife, cut a pocket into the side of each piece of bread, carefully slicing into but not through the bread.  Spoon equal portions of the filling into each slice.  Dunk the stuffed bread slices into the egg mixture and soak them for several minutes, turning if needed to coat evenly, until saturated but short of falling apart.

Warm 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon oil together on a griddle or in a large heavy skillet over medium heat.  Briefly cook the French toast in batches until golden brown and lightly crisp, turning once.  Place the first slices on the baking sheet and keep them warm in the oven.  Continue cooking the remaining slices, adding more butter and oil as needed.  When all of the French toast is ready, dust it with confectioners' sugar, sprinkling it through a strainer.  Serve immediately with maple syrup.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Fresh fruit or cooked compotes make a good topping for French toast, but they work even better as a filling.  With a stuffing of cranberries in this case, or other fruits, you can start with lofty slices of bread but maintain a moist center through the cooking process.

        Cream Cheese, Dried Fig, Walnut Spread With Smoked Salmon

Recipe By     :Marie Simmons
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dips/Spreads                    Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  dried Calimyrna figs* -- stems trimmed,
                        figs quartered (see Note)
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
  2             ounces  smoked salmon -- diced
     1/4           cup  chopped walnuts
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced green scallion tops -- (optional)

* To finely chop figs in a food processor, lightly brush or spray the inside of the processor bowl and the metal blade with vegetable oil.  If the figs are unusually dry, reconstitute them in boiling water for 10 minutes; drain and blot dry before chopping.

Finely chop the figs in a food processor.  Add the cream cheese and process until combined.  Add the salmon, walnuts and salt; pulse just to blend.  Scrape into a bowl.  Add the scallions, if desired.

Serve the spread on crisped endive leaves, celery boats, crackers, apple or slices, or toast, or use it as a sandwich spread.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 cups.

Comments:  This simple cream cheese spread, made entirely in the food processor, reminds me of the cream cheese and date-nut-bread sandwiches I once relished at my favorite Chock Full o' Nuts coffee shop when I was in college.  (They were so rich that they were sold by the half sandwich.)  Spoon it into crisp endive leaves or celery boats, spread it on pear or apple slices, crackers or toast, or make a half sandwich on whole-grain bread.  Hot-smoked salmon has a more pronounced salty, smoky taste than brined salmon, but either type will work.

* To finely chop figs in a food processor, lightly brush or spray the inside of the processor bowl and the metal blade with vegetable oil.  If the figs are unusually dry, reconstitute them in boiling water for 10 minutes; drain and blot dry before chopping.

Finely chop the figs in a food processor.  Add the cream cheese and process until combined.  Add the salmon, walnuts and salt; pulse just to blend.  Scrape into a bowl.  Add the scallions, if desired.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve the spread on crisped endive leaves, celery boats, crackers, apple or slices, or toast, or use it as a sandwich spread.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 1 1/2 cups.

Comments:  This simple cream cheese spread, made entirely in the food processor, reminds me of the cream cheese and date-nut-bread sandwiches I once relished at my favorite Chock Full o&apos; Nuts coffee shop when I was in college.  (They were so rich that they were sold by the half sandwich.)  Spoon it into crisp endive leaves or celery boats, spread it on pear or apple slices, crackers or toast, or make a half sandwich on whole-grain bread.  Hot-smoked salmon has a more pronounced salty, smoky taste than brined salmon, but either type will work.

Recipe By     :David Page
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  1              large  yellow onion -- cut 1/8" dice
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  whole milk
  1           teaspoon  mild paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  grated extra-sharp Cheddar cheese
     3/4           cup  grated Wisconsin Asiago cheese
     3/4           cup  grated dry Jack cheese
  1              pound  elbow macaroni -- cooked, drained
  2                     plum tomatoes -- sliced
     1/2           cup  seasoned breadcrumbs
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chives

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat.  Add the onions and garlic and cook until they are softened, about 2 minutes.  Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture turns light brown, about 3 minutes.  Gradually whisk in the milk.  Add the paprika, nutmeg, salt and pepper.  Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring, until the sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes.  Add the cheeses and stir until they are melted.  Add the macaroni and stir until the noodles are thoroughly coated.  Remove from the heat.

Butter two 6-inch cast-iron skillets or one 12-inch skillet.  Transfer the macaroni mixture into the skillets.  Top with the sliced tomatoes.  Sprinkle the breadcrumbs on top.

Bake until the cheese is bubbling and golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Garnish with the chopped herbs.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Comments:  Every other Thursday night was bridge club.  Mom and her friends would get together and enjoy a break from their nightly routines of feeding hungry mouths and monitoring homework.  We weren't too upset, however, because we knew that for dinner Dad would make macaroni and cheese, baked in a cast-iron skillet with sliced tomatoes and breadcrumbs on top.

Then he'd take us out to the country in his car and drive really fast.  Being an ex-stock-car driver, Dad missed racing.  I guess macaroni-and-cheese night held a lot of memories for us all. ó David Page

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOBACCO ONION RINGS ===
  5               cups  peanut oil
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  1         tablespoon  sweet paprika
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
                        Several grinds fresh black pepper
  1                     Spanish onion -- peeled, and
                        sliced into very thin rings, preferably
                        using a mandoline
  1                     red onion -- peeled, and
                        sliced into very thin rings, preferably
                        using a mandoline
                        === BURGERS ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (to 2)
                        = (to season grill or skillet)
  2             pounds  ground beef chuck
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8             slices  American cheese
  4                     burger buns -- halved
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  yellow mustard
  8                     iceberg lettuce leaves -- washed, dried
  4             slices  ripe tomato, 1/2" thick
  4             slices  yellow onion, 1/2" thick
  16                    dill pickle chips
                        Dean Fearing's Tobacco Onion Rings
                        Ketchup -- for serving

Make The Tobacco Onion Rings:  Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Heat the oil in a deep-sided saucepan until it measures 350 degrees on a candy or deep-fry thermometer.

In a shallow bowl, blend the flour, cayenne, paprika, salt, and black pepper.  Separate the onion rings and dredge in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.

Carefully place in the hot oil, a few at a time, making sure they don't stick together.  Fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain briefly on paper towels.  Place on a warm platter and keep warm in the low oven until all the onions are fried.  Serve immediately.

Make The Burgers:  Wipe down a grill or a well-seasoned flat griddle with the olive oil, or use a large nonstick sautÈ pan and pre-heat over a medium-high flame.

Gently form the ground beef into eight 4-ounce burgers, each about 1/2 inch thick.  Season with the salt and pepper.  Cook the burgers over medium-high heat until medium-rare: 4 minutes per side on the grill, 4 1/2 minutes per side in a skillet (see Note).

Place 1 slice of the American cheese on each burger to melt, about 1 minute.

Meanwhile, toast the burger buns, butter them generously, and smear each of them with about 1/2 tablespoon of mayonnaise and mustard.

To serve, place 2 of the burgers, one on top of the other, on the bottom half of each bun.  Top each stack of 2 burgers with 2 of the lettuce leaves, a slice each of tomato and onion, and 4 of the pickle chips.  Top with the other half of the bun, and serve at once with Tobacco Onion Rings and ketchup.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The famous Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas is often referred to as the birthplace of innovative Southwestern cuisine, thanks to the tireless efforts of chef Dean Fearing, whose signature dishes, like his lobster taco and tortilla soup, are admired and imitated far and wide.  Feast on this distinctive double cheeseburger and find out how Chef Fearing earned the distinction of being named one of America's best new chefs by Food & Wine.

Note:  This cooking time will yield a medium-rare burger.  For rare, cook 3 1/2 minutes on each side; for medium, cook about 4 1/2 minutes on each side.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CINNAMON BUNS ===
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     3/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed) -- abt 5 1/4 oz
  6        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/8      teaspoon  salt -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (12 1/2 oz) -- plus
                        more for dusting the work surface
  1 1/4      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1 1/4           cups  buttermilk
                        === GLAZE ===
  2        tablespoons  cream cheese -- softened
  2        tablespoons  buttermilk
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar - (4 oz)

Make The Buns:  Adjust an oven rack to the upper-middle position and heat the oven to 425 degrees.  Brush a round 9-inch nonstick cake pan with 1 tablespoon butter.  Spray a wire cooling rack with nonstick cooking spray.

Combine the brown sugar, 4 tablespoons granulated sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a small bowl.  Add 1 tablespoon melted butter and stir with a fork or fingers until the mixture resembles wet sand; set the filling mixture aside.

Whisk together the flour, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.  Whisk together the buttermilk and 2 tablespoons butter in a measuring cup.  Add the liquid to the dry ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon until the liquid is absorbed (the dough will look shaggy), about 30 seconds.  Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until just smooth and no longer shaggy about 30 seconds.

Pat the dough with your hands into a 12- by 9-inch rectangle.  Brush the dough with 2 tablespoons melted butter.  Sprinkle the dough evenly with the brown sugar filling, leaving a 1/2-inch border.  Press the filling firmly into the dough.  Using a bench scraper or metal spatula, loosen the dough from the work surface.  Starting at a long side, roll the dough, pressing lightly, to form a tight log.  Pinch the seam to seal.  Roll the log seam-side down and cut it evenly into 8 pieces.  Turn the pieces over on their flat sides, and with your hand, slightly flatten each piece of dough to seal the open edges and keep the filling in place.  Place 1 roll in the center of the prepared pan and then place the remaining 7 rolls around the perimeter of the pan.  Brush the rolls with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter.

Bake until the edges are golden brown, 23 to 25 minutes.  Use an offset metal spatula to loosen the buns from the pan.  Wearing oven mitts, place a large plate over the pan and invert the buns onto the plate.  Place the greased cooling rack over the plate and invert the buns onto the rack.  Cool about 5 minutes before glazing.

Make Glaze And Finish Buns:  While the buns are cooling, line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper (for easy cleanup); set the rack with the buns on the baking sheet.  Whisk the cream cheese and buttermilk in a large bowl until thick and smooth (the mixture will look like cottage cheese at first).  Sift the confectioners' sugar over the mixture and whisk until a smooth glaze forms, about 30 seconds.  Spoon the glaze evenly over the buns; serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 buns.

Comments:  Melted butter is used in both the filling and the dough, and to grease the panóits easiest to melt the total amount (8 tablespoons) all at once in a heatproof measuring cup and then measure it as needed.  The cream cheese makes the glaze thicker and less grainy, but it can be omitted.

Make The Buns:  Adjust an oven rack to the upper-middle position and heat the oven to 425 degrees.  Brush a round 9-inch nonstick cake pan with 1 tablespoon butter.  Spray a wire cooling rack with nonstick cooking spray.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the brown sugar, 4 tablespoons granulated sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a small bowl.  Add 1 tablespoon melted butter and stir with a fork or fingers until the mixture resembles wet sand; set the filling mixture aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk together the flour, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.  Whisk together the buttermilk and 2 tablespoons butter in a measuring cup.  Add the liquid to the dry ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon until the liquid is absorbed (the dough will look shaggy), about 30 seconds.  Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until just smooth and no longer shaggy about 30 seconds.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pat the dough with your hands into a 12- by 9-inch rectangle.  Brush the dough with 2 tablespoons melted butter.  Sprinkle the dough evenly with the brown sugar filling, leaving a 1/2-inch border.  Press the filling firmly into the dough.  Using a bench scraper or metal spatula, loosen the dough from the work surface.  Starting at a long side, roll the dough, pressing lightly, to form a tight log.  Pinch the seam to seal.  Roll the log seam-side down and cut it evenly into 8 pieces.  Turn the pieces over on their flat sides, and with your hand, slightly flatten each piece of dough to seal the open edges and keep the filling in place.  Place 1 roll in the center of the prepared pan and then place the remaining 7 rolls around the perimeter of the pan.  Brush the rolls with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake until the edges are golden brown, 23 to 25 minutes.  Use an offset metal spatula to loosen the buns from the pan.  Wearing oven mitts, place a large plate over the pan and invert the buns onto the plate.  Place the greased cooling rack over the plate and invert the buns onto the rack.  Cool about 5 minutes before glazing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make Glaze And Finish Buns:  While the buns are cooling, line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper (for easy cleanup); set the rack with the buns on the baking sheet.  Whisk the cream cheese and buttermilk in a large bowl until thick and smooth (the mixture will look like cottage cheese at first).  Sift the confectioners&apos; sugar over the mixture and whisk until a smooth glaze forms, about 30 seconds.  Spoon the glaze evenly over the buns; serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 buns.

                  Feta Saganaki With A Sesame-Seed Crust

Recipe By     :Diane Kochilas
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  hard Greek feta or telemes cheese -- aged in tins, not
                        barrels
  1              large  egg
  1                cup  sesame seeds
     1/4           cup  extra virgin olive oil for sauteing
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

The feta should be a rectangular, not triangular, piece.  Cut it into four 1/2-inch slices and cut each slice into quarters to get bite-sized rectangles.

Beat the egg lightly in a shallow bowl.  Spread the sesame seeds onto a large plate.  Dip the cheese in the egg and then in the sesame seeds.  Heat the olive oil and butter in a large heavy, nonstick skillet.  Place about 6 of the cheese pieces in the skillet, and sautÈ over medium-high heat.  As soon as the feta begins to soften, flip it over to brown on the other side.

Remove and serve hot.  Repeat with the remaining feta and sesame seeds.

This recipe yields about 16 pieces.

Comments:  Saganaki is a two-handled shallow skillet with a rounded perimeter, and any food cooked in it takes on its name.  So, saganaki as a recipe includes many things.  It can be a bubbling shrimp or mussel dish with spicy tomato sauce and melted cheese; it can be one of many flour-dusted pan-fried cheeses, too.

This recipe is a take on the fried-cheese tradition, and one that began to make its way onto Athenian menus in the late 1990s.  I like the contrast in textures, the crunchiness and subtle flavor of the sesame seeds next to the intenseness and softness of the feta as it is heated.

                    Figs Stuffed With Foie Gras Mousse

Recipe By     :Katherine Alford
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOIE GRAS MOUSSE ===
  6             ounces  grade-B or -C duck foie gras -- clean
  2        tablespoons  Cognac, Armagnac, or Sauterne
     3/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  chicken stock
  2             sprigs  thyme
  2                     gratings nutmeg
  1         tablespoon  minced summer or black winter truffle -- (optional)
                        === FIGS ===
  1              pound  fresh Black Mission or green figs
  2             ounces  homemade foie gras mousse -- (above)
                        = (or, to save time, store-bought mousse)
  2          teaspoons  verjus
                        = (available in specialty foods stores,
                        or 1 tspn white wine vinegar diluted
                        with 1 tspn water)
  1         tablespoon  sliced almonds -- toasted, and
                        finely chopped (see Note)

Note:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Spread nuts on a baking sheet.  Bake until brown, about 5 to 10 minutes, depending upon size.

Make The Foie Gras Mousse:  Combine the foie gras, Cognac, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Drain the foie grasñmarinating liquid into a small saucepan.  Add the stock and thyme.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 1 minute to make a poaching broth.

Put the foie gras in the hot broth, cover, and turn off the heat.  Poach for 5 minutes, or until the foie gras has an internal temperature of 115 degrees.  Remove the foie gras from the broth.  Transfer the broth to a small bowl and set over ice to cool it to room temperature.  Return the foie gras to the cool liquid and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Remove the foie gras from the liquid, pat dry, and puree the foie gras along with any rendered fat in a food processor until smooth.  (If the mousse gets a broken, curdy look to it, add about 1 tablespoon of the poaching liquid to stabilize the emulsion.)  Taste and adjust the seasoning.  Add the nutmeg and truffle, if desired.  Transfer the mousse to a ramekin.  Refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours before serving.

Make The Figs:  Trim the stem end of the figs.  With the tip of a serrated apple corer, a melon baller, or a grapefruit knife, cut a small round out of the bottom of each fig and reserve.  Carefully scoop about one-third of the flesh from the center of each fig and reserve.

In a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or with a handheld mixer, beat the foie gras mousse or prepared foie gras until it is light, like a buttercream icing.  Put the mousse or foie gras in a pastry bag and pipe it into the figs.  Plug each fig with a reserved round piece of fig.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until the mousse or foie gras is firm.

In a small pan, heat the reserved fig flesh with the verjus or vinegar mixture until liquefied.  Press through a fine-meshed sieve to remove the seeds.

To serve, cut each fig in half lengthwise and brush the cut side with the glaze.  Sprinkle with the toasted almonds and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  I was once told that a successful amuse-gueule ó little treats served before a meal ó is like the opening line of a novel: It should catch your attention and set a tone for things to come.  When fresh figs are in season, I serve them stuffed with foie gras as the "Call me Ishmael" of a celebratory feast.

       Fillet Of Salmon Cooked On A Bed Of Salt And Aromatic Spice

Recipe By     :Lora Zarubin
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  kosher salt
  2             pieces  cinnamon - (3" ea) -- crushed
  4                     star anise
  8                     whole cloves
  1           teaspoon  peppercorns
  4                     salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, combine the kosher salt, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, and peppercorns and toss.  Spread the spice mixture evenly over the bottom of a heavy-duty earthenware or enameled baking dish.  Lay the salmon fillets, skin-side down, on the mixture allowing one inch between each fillet.  Cut out a piece of parchment paper to fit inside the dish and place it over the salmon.  Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.

Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes for medium, or, if you prefer the salmon well done, continue baking for an additional 5 minutes.  Remove the salmon from the oven and allow the fish to rest for 3 minutes.

Remove the foil and parchment.  Using a long metal spatula, place each fillet on an individual bed of couscous, leaving its skin behind.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The only reservation I have about cooking salmon is that the smell lingers in my apartment for days ó no incense or scented candle can get rid of it.  I recently discovered that cooking fish on a bed of salt infused with some wonderful aromatic spices significantly reduces the smell and the aromatic spices delicately permeate the salmon.

In a mixing bowl, combine the kosher salt, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, and peppercorns and toss.  Spread the spice mixture evenly over the bottom of a heavy-duty earthenware or enameled baking dish.  Lay the salmon fillets, skin-side down, on the mixture allowing one inch between each fillet.  Cut out a piece of parchment paper to fit inside the dish and place it over the salmon.  Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes for medium, or, if you prefer the salmon well done, continue baking for an additional 5 minutes.  Remove the salmon from the oven and allow the fish to rest for 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the foil and parchment.  Using a long metal spatula, place each fillet on an individual bed of couscous, leaving its skin behind.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The only reservation I have about cooking salmon is that the smell lingers in my apartment for days ó no incense or scented candle can get rid of it.  I recently discovered that cooking fish on a bed of salt infused with some wonderful aromatic spices significantly reduces the smell and the aromatic spices delicately permeate the salmon.

       Garganelli Pasta, Spot Prawns, Lemon-And-Thyme Butter Sauce

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  garganelli or penne pasta
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  4             sprigs  thyme -- plus
  2                     thyme sprigs -- with leaves removed
  1           teaspoon  heavy cream -- (optional)
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter - (1/2 cup)
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  fine lemon zest
                        === PASTA GLAZE ===
  1                cup  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
  2        tablespoons  julienned flat-leaf parsley
  1           teaspoon  finely-minced lemon zest
                        === PRAWNS ===
  12             large  prawns -- peeled
  1         tablespoon  grapeseed oil
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/4      teaspoon  minced garlic
  1              small  shallot -- minced

Prepare the Pasta:  In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta to al dente stage.  Strain without rinsing the pasta.  Toss with a small amount of olive oil.  Spread on a flat baking sheet to air dry-this step allows the starch to remain on the pasta, which makes sauces cling better.  You can do this ahead of time and store the pasta in resealable plastic bags.

Prepare the Sauce:  In a small pot, combine vinegar, wine and the 4 sprigs thyme.  Reduce to a syrupy consistency.  Remove thyme sprigs.  Whisk in cream - this step will prevent the sauce from separating.  Remove from heat and whisk in butter a bit at a time.  If sauce cools too much, return to low heat, but do not let it boil.  When butter is incorporated, add lemon juice and zest along with thyme leaves to mixture.  Season with salt.  Keep warm.

Prepare the Pasta Glaze:  In a large sautÈ pan over medium heat, reduce stock by half.  Whisk in butter.  Add the pasta and toss to warm through.  Add tomato, chives, parsley and lemon zest, and season to taste with salt and freshly ground white pepper.

Prepare the Prawns:  Season prawns with salt.  In a nonstick frying pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  When the pan is lightly smoking, add the prawns and quickly sautÈ.  When prawns are pink on one side, add butter, garlic and shallot.  Turn prawns and continue sautÈing until cooked through.  Remove from pan and keep warm.

Assemble:  Over low heat, add the pasta and 1/4 cup of the lemon and thyme sauce to the prawn juices.  Toss until thoroughly warmed.  Divide among 4 large bowls.  Place 3 prawns on top of the pasta.  Drizzle warm sauce on top of the prawns and around the plate.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This dish was invented one night when I was craving some pasta, and it quickly went on the menu.  The pasta is just coated rather than swimming in sauce.  Serve this meal with a light Macon Chardonnay or a New Zealand Chardonnay.

Recipe By     :Marcus Samuelsson
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     cinnamon sticks -- broken into pieces
  1           teaspoon  cardamom pods
  1                     small piece ginger -- peeled
                        Grated zest of 1/2 orange
  6                     whole cloves
     1/2           cup  vodka
  1             bottle  dry red wine - (750 ml)
  1                cup  ruby port or Madeira
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla sugar -- (see Note)
     1/2           cup  blanched whole almonds
     1/2           cup  dark raisins

Crush the cinnamon and cardamom using a mortar and pestle (or put them on a cutting board and crush them with the bottom of a heavy pot).  Put them in a small glass jar and add the ginger, orange zest, cloves, and vodka.  Let stand for 24 hours.

Strain the vodka through a fine sieve into a large saucepan; discard the spices.  Add the red wine, port or Madeira, sugar, vanilla sugar, almonds, and raisins, and heat over medium heat just until bubbles start to form around the edges.

Serve the glˆgg hot in mugs, with a few almonds and raisins in each one; keep any remaining glˆgg warm over very low heat until ready to serve (do not let boil).

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 quarts.

Comments:  From the beginning of December on through the New Year, glˆgg is served in Swedish homes on every festive occasion or when visitors drop by.  A plate of St. Lucia Buns is typically offered with the hot spice wine.  Many families also like to serve Glˆgg after the evening meal, when everyone is sitting around the fire ó a plate of Ginger Citrus Cookies makes a great accompaniment.

Note:  When you are using only the vanilla seeds in a recipe, save the pod for vanilla sugar.  One or two are enough to flavor a pound of sugar; freeze extra pods to use later if you like.  Simply bury the pod (or pods) in a canister of granulated sugar and let stand for a few days before using.  Replenish the sugar as you use it - buried in sugar, the vanilla pod will remain aromatic for a few months or longer.  Use the sugar in desserts and sweets, or stir it into hot coffee or chocolate.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     2/3           cup  mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh basil - (to 2)
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1                     plump garlic clove -- minced
     1/8      teaspoon  anchovy paste -- (optional)
                        Coarse salt (kosher or sea salt) -- to taste
                        === MARINADE ===
                        Minced zest and juice of 3 lemons
  1                     Big pinch of saffron threads
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt (kosher or sea salt)
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
                        === CHICKEN ===
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        Several cups of mixed vegetables
                        = (such as baby zucchini or yellow
                        squash, red or white pearl onions,
                        multicolored bell peppers, baby button
                        mushrooms, endives, tiny ears of corn,
                        marinated artichoke hearts, and/or pitted
                        black or green olives, cut if needed into
                        neat squares no larger than the chicken
                        cubes)
                        Basil sprigs -- (optional)
                        Soaked bamboo skewers, 6" to 10" long

Make The Sauce:  Whisk together the ingredients in a small bowl.  Refrigerate until time to serve.

Make The Marinade:  Combine the lemon zest and juice with the saffron in a small bowl and let sit for a couple of minutes.  Mix in the remaining ingredients, then set aside about one-third of the mixture to brush over the skewers while cooking.

Place the chicken and vegetables in a large zippered plastic bag and pour the larger portion of marinade over them.  Seal the bag, then toss back and forth to coat the ingredients evenly Refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Cook The Chicken:  Fire up the grill, bringing the heat to medium (4 to 5 seconds with the hand test (see note).

While the grill heats, drain the chicken and vegetables, discarding the marinade.  Thread just a couple of bites' worth of chicken and vegetables on each skewer, without crowding.

Arrange the kebabs on the grill with the handles of the skewers off or away from the fire.  Grill uncovered for 7 to 9 minutes, turning to cook on all sides.  After about the first 5 minutes, brush the skewers all over with the reserved marinade.  When done, the chicken should be firm and white and the vegetables tender, with a few crisp edges.

Arrange the kebabs on a bed of basil sprigs, if you wish.  Serve hot or chilled, accompanied by the sauce.

This recipe yields approximately 2 1/2 dozen kebabs.

Comments:  Appetizer-sized skewers from the grill turn any gathering into a party.  They always look tempting, and when done well, they tease the taste buds with a bite or two of an intensely flavored treat.  In this case, we bathe chicken cubes and vegetables in saffron, mustard, and olive oil, skewer them together for grilling, and offer a basil mayonnaise for dunking.  Vary the veggies according to the season and your whims, striving for a mix of colors and a balance of tastes.  The kebabs lose nothing in appeal when served cool after a few hours in the refrigerator, allowing you to prepare them in advance for a special occasion.

Note: Place your hand a couple of inches above the top of the cooking grate and count the seconds until the heat of the fire forces you to pull away: one to two seconds means hot, three seconds indicates medium high, and four to five seconds denotes moderate.

Make The Sauce:  Whisk together the ingredients in a small bowl.  Refrigerate until time to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Marinade:  Combine the lemon zest and juice with the saffron in a small bowl and let sit for a couple of minutes.  Mix in the remaining ingredients, then set aside about one-third of the mixture to brush over the skewers while cooking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the chicken and vegetables in a large zippered plastic bag and pour the larger portion of marinade over them.  Seal the bag, then toss back and forth to coat the ingredients evenly Refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook The Chicken:  Fire up the grill, bringing the heat to medium (4 to 5 seconds with the hand test (see note).
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the grill heats, drain the chicken and vegetables, discarding the marinade.  Thread just a couple of bites&apos; worth of chicken and vegetables on each skewer, without crowding.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the kebabs on the grill with the handles of the skewers off or away from the fire.  Grill uncovered for 7 to 9 minutes, turning to cook on all sides.  After about the first 5 minutes, brush the skewers all over with the reserved marinade.  When done, the chicken should be firm and white and the vegetables tender, with a few crisp edges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the kebabs on a bed of basil sprigs, if you wish.  Serve hot or chilled, accompanied by the sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields approximately 2 1/2 dozen kebabs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Appetizer-sized skewers from the grill turn any gathering into a party.  They always look tempting, and when done well, they tease the taste buds with a bite or two of an intensely flavored treat.  In this case, we bathe chicken cubes and vegetables in saffron, mustard, and olive oil, skewer them together for grilling, and offer a basil mayonnaise for dunking.  Vary the veggies according to the season and your whims, striving for a mix of colors and a balance of tastes.  The kebabs lose nothing in appeal when served cool after a few hours in the refrigerator, allowing you to prepare them in advance for a special occasion.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note: Place your hand a couple of inches above the top of the cooking grate and count the seconds until the heat of the fire forces you to pull away: one to two seconds means hot, three seconds indicates medium high, and four to five seconds denotes moderate.

         Grilled Beef Tagliata With Rosemary, Capers, And Lemons

Recipe By     :John Ash
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  fragrant extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  fragrant extra-virgin olive oil
  6              large  garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  2          teaspoons  cracked black pepper -- (see Notes)
  1 1/2         pounds  New York strip steak or sirloin, 2" thk -- excess fat removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6               cups  tender young arugula - (lightly packed)
                        Reduced Balsamic Vinegar -- (see Notes)
  3        tablespoons  Fried Capers -- (see Notes)
                        Lemon wedges

Prepare a charcoal fire or preheat a gas or stovetop grill.  In a small saucepan over low heat, cook 2/3 cup of the olive oil and the garlic until the garlic is lightly browned and beginning to crisp.  Take the pan off the heat, stir in the rosemary and cracked pepper, set aside, and keep warm.

Rub the steak liberally with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and liberally with salt and pepper.  Grill the steak over high heat until rare to medium-rare.  (If you do this on the stovetop with a ridged grill pan, you'll need plenty of ventilation!)  Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let it rest for 5 minutes or so.  This allows the juices to "retreat" back into the meat and redistribute themselves.

Spread the arugula on a serving platter.  Slice the steak thinly across the grain.  Arrange the meat on top of the arugula and pour the warm seasoned oil over the meat.  Drizzle with Reduced Balsamic Vinegar and scatter Fried Capers over all.  Serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This dish epitomizes the best of Italian cooking.  Just a few great ingredients treated simply, but the result is unforgettable.  I still remember the first time I had this at a roadside trattoria.  Like all Italian recipes, this has infinite variations, so here's my version.  Tagliata, from the Italian tagliare, means "carved" or "cut."  The meat is cut into thin slices, which produces a lot more surface area on which to drizzle seasoned or condiments.

Notes:

Cracked Peppercorn:  To get the right consistency, put the peppercorns in a clean envelope or fold of waxed paper and smack it with something heavy.

Reduced Balsamic Vinegar:  Here it is, the moment you've all been waiting for and a useful restaurant trick well worth knowing.  Boil some balsamic vinegar, uncovered, over high heat, until it is reduced by a little more than half, say 60 percent.  As it cools, it will thicken into a syrup that can be drizzled over all manner of things.  Its advantage over straight-out-of-the-bottle balsamic is that in this state, it "stays put."  It can be stored at room temperature almost indefinitely.

Fried Capers:  When capers are fried, they take on a different flavor and texture that I really like.  Drain the capers well, pat dry with paper towels, and then fry them in small batches in about 1/4 inch of hot olive oil until the buds begin to open and are lightly browned and crisp.  Drain on paper towels.  Can be done a few hours in advance.

                Grilled Marinated Shrimp With Salsa Fresca

Recipe By     :John Ash
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALSA FRESCA ===
  2             medium  ripe tomatoes - (abt 3/4 lb) -- seeded, diced
     1/2           cup  diced red onion
  1           teaspoon  minced seeded serrano chile -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh garlic
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
                        Few drops of lime or lemon juice -- to taste
  1              pinch  sugar
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SHRIMP ===
  1              pound  large shrimp - (16-20 size or larger)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  finely-minced or pressed garlic
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced green onions
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh oregano
                        = (or 1/4 tspn dried oregano)
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2        tablespoons  white wine
                        = (preferably a dry or off-dry aromatic)
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
                        Avocado slices
                        Lime wedges

Make The Salsa:  Combine all the ingredients in a mixing or serving bowl, and set aside for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.

Before using the salsa, taste it and add more of any of the seasonings you think are needed.  Store covered in the refrigerator.  For best flavor, eat within 1 day but it can be stored for as long as 3.  (Use your judgment here.)  You can easily multiply the quantities to make more.

Make The Marinated Shrimp:  Peel and devein the shrimp (tail on, tail off, it's up to you).  Whisk the marinade ingredients together, toss with the shrimp, and marinate for up to 45 minutes in the refrigerator.  Skewer, if desired, to facilitate grilling.

Prepare a charcoal fire or preheat a gas or stovetop grill or broiler.  Grill or broil the shrimp quickly, 1 to 2 minutes per side, until they just begin to turn pink.  Be careful not to overcook; the shrimp should remain slightly transparent in the middle.

Spoon the salsa onto the middle of each plate and arrange the shrimp around it.  Garnish with avocado slices and lime wedges, if desired, and serve.  I eat this with my fingers.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  These shrimp can be served right off the grill or at room temperature as part of a summer buffet.  You can either peel the shrimp as suggested or grill them with the shell on, which adds a lot of flavor.  If you choose to grill with the shell on, snip it along the back with a pair of scissors so that you can remove the sand vein.

Make The Salsa:  Combine all the ingredients in a mixing or serving bowl, and set aside for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Before using the salsa, taste it and add more of any of the seasonings you think are needed.  Store covered in the refrigerator.  For best flavor, eat within 1 day but it can be stored for as long as 3.  (Use your judgment here.)  You can easily multiply the quantities to make more.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Marinated Shrimp:  Peel and devein the shrimp (tail on, tail off, it&apos;s up to you).  Whisk the marinade ingredients together, toss with the shrimp, and marinate for up to 45 minutes in the refrigerator.  Skewer, if desired, to facilitate grilling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare a charcoal fire or preheat a gas or stovetop grill or broiler.  Grill or broil the shrimp quickly, 1 to 2 minutes per side, until they just begin to turn pink.  Be careful not to overcook; the shrimp should remain slightly transparent in the middle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon the salsa onto the middle of each plate and arrange the shrimp around it.  Garnish with avocado slices and lime wedges, if desired, and serve.  I eat this with my fingers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  These shrimp can be served right off the grill or at room temperature as part of a summer buffet.  You can either peel the shrimp as suggested or grill them with the shell on, which adds a lot of flavor.  If you choose to grill with the shell on, snip it along the back with a pair of scissors so that you can remove the sand vein.

                  Grilled Miso-Citrus Scallop Lollipops

Recipe By     :Ming Tsai
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                cup  sake
  1                cup  ponzu (without added soy sauce)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2               cups  light miso (shiro-miso)
  3        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1                cup  grapeseed or canola oil
                        === SCALLOPS ===
  2              large  portobello mushrooms -- stemmed
  1              pound  medium sea scallops
  2               cups  Miso-Citrus Marinade -- (above)
  2        tablespoons  grapeseed or canola oil -- plus
     1/4           cup  grapeseed or canola oil -- if needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  15                    five-inch wooden skewers - (to 20) -- soaked in cold
                        water for 1 hour
                        === IF SERVED AS A FIRST COURSE ===
     1/4         pound  mixed greens
  1                     lemon

Make the Marinade:  In a large bowl, combine the sake, ponzu, and sugar and whisk until the sugar is dissolved.  Whisk in the miso until smooth.  Add the ginger, then whisk in the oil gradually, to emulsify the mixture.  Store in the refrigerator.  Lasts 2 weeks, refrigerated.

Make the Scallops:  With a spoon scrape the gills from the mushroom caps.  Set aside the caps.

Toss the scallops with the marinade in a medium bowl.  Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.

Prepare a grill, a grill pan, or a large sautÈ pan over high heat until hot, and spray the grid with nonstick cooking spray.

Lightly rub the portobellos with 2 tablespoons of the oil and season with salt and pepper.  If using a pan, add 2 additional tablespoons of oil and swirl to coat the pan.  Grill or sautÈ the mushrooms, turning once, until brown, 8 to 10 minutes total.  Transfer the mushrooms to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap so the mushrooms can steam to complete their cooking, about 15 minutes.  Cut the mushrooms into 1/4-inch-thick slices.

Remove the scallops from the marinade and wipe to remove excess marinade.  Encircle each scallop with 1 or 2 portobello slices then insert a skewer through the center to make a "handle" and hold the mushroom in place.  Place 2 scallops on each skewer.  If using a pan, reheat over high heat, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, and swirl to coat the pan.  Lightly pepper the scallops and, working in batches, if using a pan, sautÈ the lollipops, turning once, until the scallops are cooked, about 3 minutes per side.  If using a grill, grill until the scallops are cooked through, turning once, about 2 minutes on each side.

If serving as an hors díoeuvre, arrange the lollipops on an oval platter.  To serve as a starter, divide the greens among 4 plates.  Top with the lollipops, squeeze the juice from the lemon over the lollipops, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Coming up with a great hors d'oeuvre can be a challenge.  You need something delicious that can also be picked up and enjoyed without mess.  These scallop lollipops ó so called because the skewered portobello-wrapped scallops resembles the candy ó are just the thing.

The idea for these came after a visit to the Minnesota State Fair, where I first saw mac and cheese on a stick (skewered chunks of the casserole breaded and fried), among other brochette innovations.  A little East-West refinement of traditional bacon-wrapped scallops (the portobellos replace the meat) resulted in these bites, which also make a fine starter when served atop some dressed greens.

Soak the wooden skewers in cold water for 1 hour before grilling.

            Grilled New York Strips With Roasted Garlic Butter

Recipe By     :Jamie Purviance and Sandra S. McRae
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GARLIC BUTTE ===
  1                     large head garlic
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire Sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        === STEAKS ===
  4                     New York strip steaks, 1" thk - -- (abt 3/4 lb ea)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  whole black peppercorns -- coarsely ground
                        Extra-virgin olive oil

To Make The Garlic Butter:  Remove the loose, papery outer skin from the garlic head and cut about 1/2 inch off the top to expose the cloves.  Place the garlic head on an 8-inch square of aluminum foil and drizzle the olive oil over the top of the cloves.  Fold up the foil sides and seal to make a packet, leaving a little room for the expansion of steam.  Grill over Indirect Medium heat until the cloves are soft, 30 to 45 minutes.  Remove from the grill and allow to cool.  Squeeze the contents of the cloves into a small bowl.  Using the back of a fork, mash the garlic together with the rest of the garlic butter ingredients.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

To Prepare The Steaks:  Season both sides of the steaks with the salt and pepper, pressing the spices into the meat.  Allow to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.

To Cook The Steaks:  Lightly spray or brush both sides of the steaks with the oil.  Grill over Direct High heat until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees for medium-rare, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove the steaks from the grill and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes.  Cut the garlic butter into four equal-sized pieces.  Serve the steaks warm with the butter on top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Sweet garlic butter sliding across a sizzling slab of peppered steak?  Decadent.  Outrageous.  And 100% legal.

Note:  You will be moving from Indirect-Medium to Direct-High cooking in this recipe.

             Grilled Snapper With A Mango, Shrimp, And Chile

Recipe By     :Rick Stein
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALSA ===
  2              large  medium-hot red chile peppers
  4             ounces  peeled cooked tiger shrimp -- thickly sliced
  4                     green onions -- thinly sliced
  1              small  garlic clove -- minced
  1                     ripe-but-firm avocado -- peeled, and
                        cut into small dice
     1/2                ripe-but-firm mango -- peeled, and
                        cut into small dice
                        Juice of 1 lime
  1              pinch  salt
                        === FISH ===
  4             pieces  unskinned snapper fillet - (6 oz ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Cilantro sprigs -- for garnish

Make The Salsa:  Cut the chiles in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with the tip of a small knife; leave behind the ribs to give the salsa a little more heat.  Cut the chiles across into thin slices.  Then simply mix all the salsa ingredients together.

Make The Fish:  If you are using a charcoal grill, prepare and light it 30 to 40 minutes before you want to cook the fish.

If you are not cooking the fish over charcoal, put a ridged cast-iron grill pan over a high heat (or preheat the broiler).  Brush the snapper fillets on both sides with olive oil and season well with salt and pepper.  Cut each one into three, slightly on the diagonal.

Cook the pieces of snapper, either skin-side down on the grill or grill-pan, or skin-side up under the broiler, for 3 to 4 minutes.

To serve, spoon the salsa onto four plates and arrange the grilled strips of fish on top.  Drizzle a little oil around the edge of the plates and garnish with cilantro sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The salsa, which is a mixture of, among other things, cool citrus and hot chile peppers, makes a perfect backdrop for the snapper.  Although you can make this in the broiler, opt for the outdoor grill; the taste is that much better.

Alternative Fish:  Red mullet, sea bass, bream or porgy, John dory, or gray or striped mullet.

Make The Salsa:  Cut the chiles in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with the tip of a small knife; leave behind the ribs to give the salsa a little more heat.  Cut the chiles across into thin slices.  Then simply mix all the salsa ingredients together.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Fish:  If you are using a charcoal grill, prepare and light it 30 to 40 minutes before you want to cook the fish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you are not cooking the fish over charcoal, put a ridged cast-iron grill pan over a high heat (or preheat the broiler).  Brush the snapper fillets on both sides with olive oil and season well with salt and pepper.  Cut each one into three, slightly on the diagonal.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the pieces of snapper, either skin-side down on the grill or grill-pan, or skin-side up under the broiler, for 3 to 4 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, spoon the salsa onto four plates and arrange the grilled strips of fish on top.  Drizzle a little oil around the edge of the plates and garnish with cilantro sprigs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The salsa, which is a mixture of, among other things, cool citrus and hot chile peppers, makes a perfect backdrop for the snapper.  Although you can make this in the broiler, opt for the outdoor grill; the taste is that much better.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Alternative Fish:  Red mullet, sea bass, bream or porgy, John dory, or gray or striped mullet.

               Grilled Teriyaki Mahi Mahi With Mango Salsa

Recipe By     :Jamie Purviance and Sandra S. McRae
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALSA ===
  1              large  ripe mango
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped red onion
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh mint
  1           teaspoon  minced jalapeÒo pepper -- with seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  sweet sake
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
                        === FISH ===
  4                     mahi mahi fillets, 1" thk - (abt 6 oz ea)
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed

To Make The Salsa:  Peel the mango and cut into 1/4-inch dice.  Place in a small bowl along with the remaining salsa ingredients.  Stir to blend.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.

To Make The Marinade:  In a small bowl whisk together the marinade ingredients.

To Prepare The Fish:  Place the mahi mahi fillets in a large, resealable plastic bag and pour in the marinade.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute the marinade, place in a bowl, and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes.

To Cook The Fish:  Remove the fillets from the bag and discard the marinade.  Brush or spray both sides of the fillets with vegetable oil.  Grill over direct high heat until the fish is opaque throughout, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill and serve warm with the salsa.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Mahi mahi (the fish so good they named it twice!) is great on the grill because it's firm and moist with a low-fat flesh that has an endearing sweetness.  This simple marinade turns to a nice glaze as it cooks ó just oil the fillets well before grilling so the glaze doesn't stick to the grate.  If you like a hotter salsa, add more jalapeÒo.  (Suitable substitute: sea bass.)

This recipe requires the direct-cooking method over a high heat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     garlic clove
                        Good handful of fresh basil leaves
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary, leaves only -- very finely chopped
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1           teaspoon  sea salt -- or to taste (1 to 2)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  4                     small whole fish such as snapper - (abt 1  -- cleaned, scaled
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish

Place the garlic and all the herbs in a food processor, and pulse to chop roughly.  Add the salt and pepper and continue to process until the herbs begin to form a paste.  Drizzle in some olive oil and work the oil into the herbs to form a smooth mixture.

Make 4 shallow slashes on each side of the fish.  With your fingers, work the herb paste into the slashes, rubbing some into the cavity as well.  Lay the fish on a platter to marinate for about 30 minutes.

Heat a grill or grill pan until very hot.  Carefully lay the fish onto the grill.  Cook the fish until a thin crust forms on the skin, which enables you to turn it with a spatula.  As the fish cooks, baste it with a little oil.  Allow approximately 2 to 4 minutes per side.  Garnish with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Pastes like this one can also be used under the skin of chicken breasts or patted onto the back of lamb racks.  Vary it with different herbs, or the addition of ground nuts, spices or lemon zest.  They can turn simple grilled meats into something spectacular.

                         Grilled-Roasted Chicken

Recipe By     :Cheryl and Bill Jamison
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRY RUB ===
  1         tablespoon  smoked paprika
                        = (or regular paprika)
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  2          teaspoons  coarse salt (kosher or sea salt)
  2          teaspoons  freshly-milled pepper
                        === CHICKEN ===
  1                     plump chicken - (3 1/4 to 3 1/2 lbs)

Combine the dry rub ingredients in a small bowl.  Rub the mixture inside and outside the chicken both over and under the skin, being careful not to tear the skin.  Let the chicken sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.

Prepare the grill for indirect cooking, making a hot fire in one half of the grill and leaving the other half unheated.  Place an inexpensive portable oven thermometer (available at any kitchen supply store) on the cool half of the cooking grate; don't rely on your grill's built-in thermometer because you want to measure the temperature only on the unheated side.  Close the grill, and bring the temperature to 400 degrees on the unheated side.

Preferably wearing washable heatproof mitts, place the chicken breast-side down on the unheated side of the cooking grate.  (If you have a low-powered gas grill that won't reach the ideal 400 degree roasting temperature, you can still grill-bake your chicken in standard oven fashion, increasing the cooking time.)  Plan on a total cooking time of 65 to 85 minutes.  After 35 minutes, turn the chicken breast-side up, brush with butter for a glossier skin, and reduce the heat to 350 degrees.  (On a gas grill, simply turn the heat down; on a charcoal grill, close the vents and spread out the charcoal as necessary.)  Cook until the skin is crisp and well browned and an instant-read thermometer stuck in the thickest part of a thigh reads 170 to 175 degrees.

Let the chicken sit for 5 to 10 minutes on a cutting board, then carve and serve.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Comments:  Crispy and brown, juicy and succulent, a roasted whole chicken makes a magnificent centerpiece for a meal.  A front-of-the-flame rotisserie does the job best, but you can rival that success with covered indirect cooking on a grill if you do it properly.  Forget the generally recommended simplistic method of using a steady baking temperature, which produces, predictably, a half-baked result.  Instead, start at relatively high heat, in a true roasting style, then rotate the chicken and finish the cooking at a lower temperature.  Since we're cooking covered here, the instructions give actual oven temperatures to guide the process rather than our usual hand-test pointer.

        Hard-Boiled Eggs Stuffed With Tomato, Onion, And Olive Oil

Recipe By     :Diane Kochilas
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  eggs -- hard boiled
     1/2           cup  good-quality tomato paste -- preferably organic
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  red onion -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Peel and halve the eggs being careful not to break the whites.  Scoop out the yolks and mash with a fork.

In a small bowl, mix together the tomato paste, the mashed egg yolks, the olive oil, and the onion.

Season with salt and pepper, and spoon or pipe the mixture back into the hollowed-out whites.

Serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 12 servings.

Comments:  The filling for this easy dish comes from a Greek island dip that calls for nothing but good tomato paste, olive oil, and onions.  These little bites are ideal for mid-afternoon snacking, a light lunch, or even a late-night supper with friends.

Comments:  The filling for this easy dish comes from a Greek island dip that calls for nothing but good tomato paste, olive oil, and onions.  These little bites are ideal for mid-afternoon snacking, a light lunch, or even a late-night supper with friends.

            Il Vecchio Molinetto Erminia's Pan-Crisped Chicken

Recipe By     :Lynne Rossetto Kasper
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     frying or roasting chicken - -- (abt 3 1/2 lbs)
                        A 3-inch branch fresh rosemary -- leaves only
                        = (or 1/3 tspn dried rosemary)
  1              small  garlic clove
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        a little extra for the second cooking
     1/2           cup  water
  2                     to 3 branches fresh rosemary for garnish -- (optional)

For the best flavor season the chicken 18 to 24 hours before cooking.  Rinse the chicken.  Cut it into 8 pieces, halving each side of the breast and eliminating the wings and backbone.  Pat the pieces dry.  Blend the rosemary, garlic, salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice into a paste and rub over the chicken.  Set the pieces on a platter, lightly cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate.

THE FIRST COOKING:

Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  Slip in the chicken pieces skin-side down.  Turn the heat to medium.  Cook for 1 minute to lightly sear them, then turn the pieces to coat them with oil.

Arrange the pieces in a circle in the pan's center.  Set a 9-inch cake pan on top of the chicken and weight it with several heavy cans.  The breast pieces will cook faster than the thigh and leg pieces.  Cook the weighted chicken, turning the breast pieces after 8 minutes and the thigh and leg pieces after 10 minutes, putting the pan back on the chicken after each turning; sprinkle the chicken with the remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice before returning the weighted pan.  Cook the breasts another 8 minutes and remove.  Cook the thigh and leg pieces another 10 minutes.

Crisp the chicken to a rich dark brown by turning the heat to medium-low, arranging all the pieces back in the pan skin-side up and cooking under the weighted pan for another 2 minutes.  With a slotted spoon or tongs, immediately remove the pieces to a platter (set the pan aside).  Cool for about 10 minutes, and then lightly cover the chicken with plastic wrap or foil.  Set aside, or cover and refrigerate (see Note).

Pour away all the fat and replace the sautÈ pan over high heat.  Swirl in the water and boil down by half while scraping up the brown bits with a wooden spatula.  Turn the pan juices into a small bowl and put in freezer for 2 hours; then lift off hardened fat.

THE SECOND COOKING:

Have a serving dish warming in a low oven.  Film the bottom of the sautÈ pan with a little olive oil.  Have the heat at medium when you slip in the chicken piece, skin-side down.  Top with the cake pan and weights, and heat for 5 minutes.  Then remove the weighted pan.  Turn the chicken pieces, moistening each piece with the defatted pan juices.  Lightly cover with aluminum foil and heat for another 5 to 8 minutes.

Pile the pieces on the platter and garnish with rosemary sprigs if desired.  Serve hot or cold.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  At Erminia Marasi's trattoria Il Vecchio Molinetto in Parma, this dish is the specialty of the house.  Cooking the chicken in two stages and weighting it as it sautÈs draws off most of the bird's fat while crisping it perfectly.  (The weight is improvised with what is available in the kitchen.)  The two-step cooking also makes this good company food, as it needs little last-minute attention.  First the chicken is sautÈed, then hours later, just before dinner; it is reheated and given its final crisping.

Note:  This is an easy recipe, but it uses a technique unfamiliar for most of us.  Follow the timing for the two-step cooking carefully, and you will have no difficulties.  The chicken is excellent eaten cold or hot.  If serving it hot, do not refrigerate it between cooking and reheating.

              Individual Meat Pies With Cointreau Marmalade

Recipe By     :Francine Segan
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RENAISSANCE DOUGH ===
  2               cups  sifted pastry flour - (loosely packed)
     1/2           cup  ice-cold water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              large  egg -- cold, beaten
     1/2           cup  cold unsalted butter -- cut small cubes
                        === MEATPIES ===
  8             ounces  ground lamb, beef, or veal
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-milled black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  ground mace
  3                     pitted dried plums (prunes) -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  currants
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
     1/2        recipe  Renaissance Dough -- (listed above)
     1/4           cup  Cointreau
     1/2           cup  thick-cut orange marmalade

Make The Dough:  Mix the flour, 1/2 cup ice-cold water, the salt, and egg together on a cold surface until crumbly.  Flatten the dough with a rolling pin and place one quarter of the butter cubes on the dough.  (Keep the remaining butter refrigerated until ready to use.)

Roll the butter into the dough, fold the dough over, and roll it again.  Repeat the process 3 more times until all the butter is incorporated.  Cover the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Make The Meatpies:  Combine the meat, pepper, salt, nutmeg, mace, dried plums, currants, and orange juice in a bowl and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or overnight.  Remove the meat mixture from the refrigerator 1 hour before baking.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Roll out Renaissance dough 1/16-inch thick on a floured work surface.  Cut twenty-four 3-inch circles from the dough.  Press the dough circles into mini-muffin pans.  Loosely fill each muffin cup with the meat mixture (about 1 tablespoon per pie) and bake for 15 minutes.

Bring the Cointreau to a boil in a small saucepan, stir in the marmalade, and cook until the marmalade is warm.

Spoon some of the marmalade mixture on top of each mince pie and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Elizabethan street vendors sold little minced pies like these, as well as oyster pies, apples, and nuts, to theatergoers.  The audience ate during the entire play and tossed cores, shells, and scraps onto the theater floor.

These tiny meat pies delicately flavored with orange liqueur are just perfect now as then, for picnics or pre-theater nibbling.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2         stick  butter
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated orange rind
                        === BISCUITS ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  whole milk
                        === FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice

Make The Glaze:  Grease an 8-inch square baking pan.  In a small, heavy saucepan, bring the glaze ingredients to a boil, spoon the mixture into the prepared pan so it completely covers the bottom, and set aside.

Make The Biscuits:  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

To make the biscuits, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the center.  In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the oil and milk till well blended, pour into the well, and stir just till a soft dough forms.

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll into an 18- by 10-inch rectangle.

Make The Filling And Arrange:  In a small mixing bowl, mix together the filling ingredients, then sprinkle evenly over the rectangle.  Starting from the short side, roll up the rectangle jelly-roll style into an 18-inch-long log, slice into 9 biscuits 2-inches thick, arrange the biscuits cut-side down in 3 rows in the glazed pan, and bake till puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Invert the pan immediately onto a large platter so the glaze runs down over the biscuits and serve hot.

This recipe yields 9 biscuits.

Comments:  My long-time friend, colleague, and fellow Southerner, Jean Andersen, relates in her wonderful American Century Cookbook how her mother came up with this delightful variation on old-fashioned sticky buns as a way to avoid having to fool with yeast dough.  Contrary to what the long list of ingredients might imply, the biscuits are quick and easy and perfect for a stylish brunch.

Make The Glaze:  Grease an 8-inch square baking pan.  In a small, heavy saucepan, bring the glaze ingredients to a boil, spoon the mixture into the prepared pan so it completely covers the bottom, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Biscuits:  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the biscuits, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the center.  In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the oil and milk till well blended, pour into the well, and stir just till a soft dough forms.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll into an 18- by 10-inch rectangle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Filling And Arrange:  In a small mixing bowl, mix together the filling ingredients, then sprinkle evenly over the rectangle.  Starting from the short side, roll up the rectangle jelly-roll style into an 18-inch-long log, slice into 9 biscuits 2-inches thick, arrange the biscuits cut-side down in 3 rows in the glazed pan, and bake till puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Invert the pan immediately onto a large platter so the glaze runs down over the biscuits and serve hot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 9 biscuits.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  My long-time friend, colleague, and fellow Southerner, Jean Andersen, relates in her wonderful American Century Cookbook how her mother came up with this delightful variation on old-fashioned sticky buns as a way to avoid having to fool with yeast dough.  Contrary to what the long list of ingredients might imply, the biscuits are quick and easy and perfect for a stylish brunch.

Recipe By     :Amanda Hesser
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  sea salt
  8                     chicken thighs
                        = (organic or natural, not Perdue or
                        somesuch)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper

In the morning, combine 2 tablespoons salt and about a cup of warm water in a large bowl or container.  Stir to dissolve the salt.  Trim the chicken of excess skin and fat.  Add the chicken to the bowl.  Cover with very cold water and add a tray of ice cubes.  Swish around with your hand to disperse them.  Chill in the refrigerator until dinner time.

Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.  Remove the chicken from the fridge and pat dry completely with paper towels.  Put the butter in a roasting pan large enough to fit the chicken in one layer.  Place the pan in the oven.  In a 1-gallon freezer bag, pour in the flour, remaining 1 tablespoon salt and the pepper.  Give it a good shake.  Add the chicken pieces two at a time and shake them until thoroughly coated.  As you lift them out of the bag, shake them off vigorously.  This is vital.  You do not want a gummy coating.  Line them up on a plate, and repeat with the rest.

Lay the chicken pieces in the roasting pan, skin-side down, and oven-fry until a chestnut brown and crisp on the bottom, about 40 minutes (sometimes it takes as long as an hour).  Don't flip them until this happens.  Use a thin spatula to scrape them up off the pan and turn them; cook the other side the same way.  Remove the pieces from the oven as they finish cooking, and place on a plate lined with paper towels.  Just before serving, grind fresh pepper over top and sprinkle lightly with sea salt.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Comments:  I sometimes add grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and grated lemon zest to the flour mixture.  The cheese underlines the nutty flavor you get from frying and the zest brightens the dish.  It is delicious without these, too.  My family likes it at any temperature and at any time of day, even cold out of the fridge for breakfast.

For years I had been frying the chicken and wondering why mine was never the same as my mother's.  Then when I was home visiting recently, she told me I had been skipping the one real trick to this recipe, which is to soak the chicken in salted ice water for a few hours before cooking.  It seasons the meat and tightens the flesh, so the skin crisps better and the seasoning permeates the meat.  My mother would put the chicken in the water and chill it while she was at work.

Her other trick is to use good farmers' market chickens, which taste better and have less fat, so the chicken fries in a film of oil rather than a bath of fat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  lardons -- cut into 1/4"
                        by 1 1/2" strips (optional)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- or more
  2 1/2         pounds  ready-cut frying chicken -- thoroughly dried
                        = (a selection of parts, or all of one
                        kind)
     1/4           cup  Cognac or Armagnac
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     imported bay leaf
     1/4      teaspoon  thyme
  16             small  white onions - (to 20) -- peeled
  3        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  red wine
                        = (Burgundy, CÙtes du RhÙne, or
                        Pinot Noir)
  2               cups  brown chicken stock or beef bouillon -- more or less
  1                     garlic clove - (to 2) -- mashed or minced
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste -- more or less
     3/4         pound  fresh mushrooms -- trimmed, washed,
                        and quartered

If you are using lardons, sautÈ several minutes in 2 tablespoons oil in a heavy-bottomed casserole until lightly browned; remove lardons to a side dish and leave fat in pan.  (Otherwise, film pan with 1/8 inch of oil.)

Heat fat or oil in pan to moderately hot, add chicken, not crowding pan; turn frequently to brown nicely on all sides.  Pour in the Cognac, shake pan a few seconds until bubbling hot, then ignite Cognac with a match.  Let flame a minute, swirling pan by its handle to burn off alcohol; extinguish with pan cover.

Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper; add bay leaf and thyme.  Place onions around the chicken.  Cover and cook slowly 10 minutes, turning once.

Uncover pan, sprinkle on the flour, turning chicken and onions so flour is absorbed; cook 3 to 4 minutes more, turning once or twice.

Remove from heat, gradually stir and swirl in the wine and enough stock or bouillon to almost cover the chicken.  Add the browned lardons, garlic, and tomato paste to the pan.  Cover and simmer slowly 25 to 30 minutes, then test chicken; remove those pieces that are tender, and continue cooking the rest a few minutes longer.  If onions are not quite tender, continue cooking them; then return all chicken to the pan, add mushrooms, and simmer 4 to 5 minutes.  Taste carefully, and correct seasoning.  Sauce should be just thick enough to coat chicken and vegetables lightly.  If too thin, boil down rapidly to concentrate; if too thick, thin out with spoonfuls of bouillon.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  From her 1960s TV show, The French Chef, came many classic dishes.  Julia made good on Herbert Hoover's promise of a "chicken in every pot" with her wildly popular recipe for Coq au Vin.  A simple chicken dish made with mushrooms, onions, bacon and red wine, Coq au Vin was copied in millions of kitchens around the country.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HOLLANDAISE SAUCE ===
  3                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  water
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice -- or more, if needed
  6             ounces  soft unsalted butter - (to 8)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === JACQUES' POACHED EGGS ===
  2        tablespoons  distilled white vinegar per 2 quarts water
  4              large  eggs -- the fresher the
                        better
                        === EGGS BENEDICT ===
  4             slices  brioche or home-style white bread -- cut 4" rounds
                        = (or English-muffin halves)
                        Butter -- as needed
  4                     thin boiled ham or prosciutto slices
                        Thin black truffle slices -- (optional)
  4                     warm poached eggs
  1                cup  Hollandaise Sauce

Make The Hollandaise Sauce:  Whisk the yolks, water, and lemon juice in the saucepan for a few moments, until thick and pale (this prepares them for what is to come).

Set the pan over moderately-low heat and continue to whisk at reasonable speed, reaching all over the bottom and insides of the pan, where the eggs tend to overcook.  To moderate the heat, frequently move the pan off the burner for a few seconds, and then back on.  (If, by chance, the eggs seem to be cooking too fast, set the pan in the bowl of cold water to cool the bottom, then continue.)  As they cook, the eggs will become frothy and increase in volume, and then thicken.  When you can see the pan bottom through the streaks of the whisk and the eggs are thick and smooth, remove from the heat.

By spoonfuls, add the soft butter, whisking constantly to incorporate each addition.  As the emulsion forms, you may add the butter in slightly larger amounts, always whisking until fully absorbed.  Continue incorporating butter until the sauce has thickened to the consistency you want.

Season lightly with salt and a dash of cayenne pepper, whisking in well.  Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding droplets of lemon juice if needed.  Serve lukewarm.

Poach The Eggs:  Fill the pan with water to a depth of 2 inches or so, add the vinegar, and bring to a slow boil.

Rapidly crack and open each egg into the water, holding the shell as close to the surface as possible.  The eggs will cool the water; adjust the heat to maintain a slow simmer.  After a few moments, when the whites have just begun to set, drag the back of the slotted spoon gently across the top of the eggs, to move them off the pan bottom so they don't stick.  Cook the eggs for about 4 minutes, adjusting the heat as necessary.

To test for doneness, lift 1 egg from the water with the slotted spoon and press both white and yolk.  The whites should feel fully set but not too firm, and the yolks very soft.  Poach longer for firmer eggs.

When set the way you like them, remove the eggs from the saucepan with the slotted spoon or strainer and immerse them in a bowl of warm tap water to wash off the vinegar.  Set the spoon on a clean towel (or folded paper towels) for a moment to remove excess water, and serve eggs immediately.

Assemble The Eggs Benedict:  Just before serving, toast the bread circles or muffins lightly, butter both sides, and warm the ham and the optional truffle slices in a frying pan with a tablespoon of butter.

Center a toast round on each warm serving plate; cover with a slice of ham and then a poached egg.  Spoon hollandaise sauce generously over each egg and top with an optional warm truffle slice.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Hollandaise sauce is an essential component of Eggs Benedict, and a lovely adornment for all kinds of egg dishes and vegetable dishes, like warm asparagus and broccoli, and for delicate fish poached in white wine.  Like mayonnaise, it is a classic "emulsion" sauce, which depends on the marvelous capacity of an egg yolk to hold in suspension a much greater volume of butter (or oil, in the case of mayonnaise).  But in a hollandaise, careful heating and constant whisking bring the butter and yolks together in an even more delicate alliance, with rich flavor and a thick, smooth texture.

<DirS>
<DirT>
Make The Hollandaise Sauce:  Whisk the yolks, water, and lemon juice in the saucepan for a few moments, until thick and pale (this prepares them for what is to come).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set the pan over moderately-low heat and continue to whisk at reasonable speed, reaching all over the bottom and insides of the pan, where the eggs tend to overcook.  To moderate the heat, frequently move the pan off the burner for a few seconds, and then back on.  (If, by chance, the eggs seem to be cooking too fast, set the pan in the bowl of cold water to cool the bottom, then continue.)  As they cook, the eggs will become frothy and increase in volume, and then thicken.  When you can see the pan bottom through the streaks of the whisk and the eggs are thick and smooth, remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
By spoonfuls, add the soft butter, whisking constantly to incorporate each addition.  As the emulsion forms, you may add the butter in slightly larger amounts, always whisking until fully absorbed.  Continue incorporating butter until the sauce has thickened to the consistency you want.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season lightly with salt and a dash of cayenne pepper, whisking in well.  Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding droplets of lemon juice if needed.  Serve lukewarm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Poach The Eggs:  Fill the pan with water to a depth of 2 inches or so, add the vinegar, and bring to a slow boil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rapidly crack and open each egg into the water, holding the shell as close to the surface as possible.  The eggs will cool the water; adjust the heat to maintain a slow simmer.  After a few moments, when the whites have just begun to set, drag the back of the slotted spoon gently across the top of the eggs, to move them off the pan bottom so they don&apos;t stick.  Cook the eggs for about 4 minutes, adjusting the heat as necessary.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To test for doneness, lift 1 egg from the water with the slotted spoon and press both white and yolk.  The whites should feel fully set but not too firm, and the yolks very soft.  Poach longer for firmer eggs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When set the way you like them, remove the eggs from the saucepan with the slotted spoon or strainer and immerse them in a bowl of warm tap water to wash off the vinegar.  Set the spoon on a clean towel (or folded paper towels) for a moment to remove excess water, and serve eggs immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Assemble The Eggs Benedict:  Just before serving, toast the bread circles or muffins lightly, butter both sides, and warm the ham and the optional truffle slices in a frying pan with a tablespoon of butter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Center a toast round on each warm serving plate; cover with a slice of ham and then a poached egg.  Spoon hollandaise sauce generously over each egg and top with an optional warm truffle slice.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Hollandaise sauce is an essential component of Eggs Benedict, and a lovely adornment for all kinds of egg dishes and vegetable dishes, like warm asparagus and broccoli, and for delicate fish poached in white wine.  Like mayonnaise, it is a classic &quot;emulsion&quot; sauce, which depends on the marvelous capacity of an egg yolk to hold in suspension a much greater volume of butter (or oil, in the case of mayonnaise).  But in a hollandaise, careful heating and constant whisking bring the butter and yolks together in an even more delicate alliance, with rich flavor and a thick, smooth texture.

                    King Crab Salad With Citrus Fruit

Recipe By     :Lidia Bastianich
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  onion -- cut into quarters
  2                     celery stalks -- cut into 2" pieces
  2             medium  carrots -- cut 1/2"-thk slices
  2                     fresh or dried bay leaves
  2             pounds  king crab legs - (2 to 3 whole legs) -- defrosted if frozen
     1/4           cup  extra virgin-olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  fresh orange juice
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  6             ounces  young salad leaves -- washed, dried
                        = (such as baby arugula or tender baby
                        lettuces, or mesclun greens)
  12                    grapefruit segments without membranes -- (see Note)
  12                    blood orange or navel orange
                        segments without membranes -- (see Note)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Choose a pot large enough to hold the crab legs comfortably and fill it to about 3 inches from the top with water.  Bring to a boil, add the onion, celery, carrots, and bay leaves, and boil for 15 minutes.  Add the crab legs and cook for 5 minutes.  Remove the crab and let cool.  Discard the cooking liquid.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the olive oil, lemon and orange juices, and salt together until the dressing is golden yellow and emulsified.  Whisk in the parsley.

With sturdy kitchen scissors, cut apart the crab legs between their joints and pull out the meat with a cocktail fork or skewer.  Cut each leg segment open with the kitchen shears if you have difficulty removing the meat from the shell.  Cut the crabmeat into 2-inch pieces, removing any cartilage as you go.

Divide the crabmeat evenly and place in small mounds in the center of six salad plates.  Place a cluster of salad leaves next to each.  Arrange the grapefruit and orange segments decoratively around the crabmeat.  Grind some fresh pepper and drizzle the citrus dressing over the crabmeat and salad leaves and serve.

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings.

Comments:  Traditionally the spiny crab found in the Adriatic is used to make this salad, but king crab is readily available here and makes a delicious substitute.  About one pound of the meat from Dungeness or blue claw crabs is also a good substitute but requires some work freeing it from the shell.  The fresh lump or jumbo lump crabmeat sold in containers by your fishmonger is the easiest alternative, but also the most expensive.

These quantities are for appetizer servings; double them for main-course servings

Note:  To remove grapefruit and orange segments from the fruit, cut away all the peel and white pith with a small sharp knife.  Hold the fruit over a bowl and, with the knife, cut along each membrane to free the citrus segments, allowing the juice to drip into the bowl.  Reserve some of the orange juice for the dressing, and the rest as a reward for the cook

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------

  1              piece  cinnamon stick - (abt 1")
  12                    green cardamom pods
  9                     whole cloves
  10                    black peppercorns
  3              whole  dried red chiles
  1           teaspoon  coriander seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin seeds
  1                     fresh hot green Chile -- cut in half
  2              large  tomatoes -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/4           cup  plain yogurt -- whisked until smooth
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        Juice of 1 lemon

Combine the chicken, potatoes, 1/2 teaspoon of the turmeric, 1/4 teaspoon of the cayenne, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl and stir to coat the chicken and potato with the spices.  Let stand while you make the sauce.

Finely mince the onions, garlic, and ginger in a food processor and set aside.

Combine 2 tablespoons of the oil, the cinnamon stick, cardamom, cloves, black peppercorns, red chiles, coriander, and cumin in a large casserole over medium-high heat.  Cook, stirring, until the cinnamon unfurls, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the minced onion mixture, the green Chile, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the vegetables brown around the edges, 10 to 15 minutes

Remove the cinnamon and green chile, and stir in the remaining 1/4 teaspoon turmeric and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne.  Add the tomatoes and tomato paste and cook, stirring, 5 minutes.  Transfer to a food processor or blender and puree until smooth; set aside.

Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same pan over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and potatoes and cook, stirring, 2 minutes.  Add the yogurt 1 tablespoon at a time and stir well after each addition.  Cook, stirring, 2 minutes, to evaporate some of the moisture.

Add the pureed tomato mixture and bring to a boil.  Stir in the water.  Return to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, until the chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes.  Stir every 5 to 8 minutes and scrape the bottom of the pan to keep the sauce from sticking.  Then uncover and cook 5 more minutes to reduce and thicken.  Stir in the cilantro and lemon juice.  Taste for salt and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  We have a saying in India that a person who hasn't seen Lahore has yet to be born.  Lahore is a city in what is now Pakistan.  The hub of land trade between India and the Middle East, it used to be call "the Paris of the East" because it was such an important center of high culture in India.  The street foods and meat preparations of Lahore are still legendary.  This chicken curry is a staple for Lahoris.  The inclusion of potatoes makes it hearty and a wide assortment of spices delivers complexity.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     eggplant - (abt 1 1/2lbs) -- cut 1/4" slices
                        === SAUCE ===
  1              pound  ground lamb
  1              large  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  2              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1 1/2    tablespoons  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes - (to 1/2)
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt - (to 1)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
  1                cup  water
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        === TOPPING ===
  2               cups  crumbled feta cheese
                        = (or ricotta salata cheese)
     1/2           cup  walnuts -- toasted, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint -- for garnish
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro -- for garnish

Make The Eggplant:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil an 8- by 11-inch (2 quart) gratin dish.  Generously oil a large baking sheet with olive oil.

Arrange the eggplant slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.  Turn the slices over once so that both sides are lightly coated with the oil.  Bake until they begin to take on some color and are soft and pliable, about 30 minutes.

Make The Sauce:  Heat a large sautÈ pan over high heat.  Add the lamb and cook, using a spatula to break up the lumps, until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the lamb to a bowl.  Drain all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan.

Add the onion and cook about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Add the cumin, cinnamon, allspice, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Return the lamb to the pan and stir to combine.  Add the tomatoes and 1/2 cup of the water; bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened and the flavors have melded, 5 to 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 1/2 cup water and the parsley.  Set aside.

Make The Topping:  In a medium bowl, combine the feta, walnuts, breadcrumbs, and parsley; toss well.  Drizzle the olive oil over the bread-crumb mixture and toss until the bread crumbs have absorbed all of the oil.  Set aside.

Assemble The Gratin:  Spread about 1 cup of the sauce in the bottom of the prepared gratin dish.  Arrange half of the eggplant slices over the sauce so that they are touching but not overlapping.  Sprinkle 1 cup of the topping over the eggplant; cover with about 2 more cups of the sauce.  Arrange the remaining eggplant slices over the sauce, again touching but not overlapping.  Cover the eggplant with about 1 cup of the sauce and sprinkle the remaining topping evenly over the top.

Place the gratin on a sturdy baking sheet.  Bake until hot and bubbly and the topping is crisped and lightly browned, 20 to 30 minutes.  Let rest for at least 10 minutes before serving, garnished with the mint and cilantro.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  With its rich layers of eggplant, spiced ground lamb, tangy feta cheese, and walnuts, this hearty gratin has all the flavors of a rich moussaka, the well-loved eggplant casserole of Greece ó but it's much easier to make.  This is one of those dishes that tastes best when made a day ahead.  Top it with a dollop of creamy yogurt, if you like, and serve it with a crisp green salad made with cucumbers and a bit of dill.

                   Merguez Meatballs With Yogurt Sauce

Recipe By     :Tori Ritchie
Serving Size  : 20    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MEATBALLS ===
  1              pound  ground lamb or beef -- (not too lean)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  2          teaspoons  ground coriander
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === YOGURT SAUCE ===
  1                cup  plain lowfat yogurt
     1/2           cup  fresh mint leaves - (loosely packed)
     1/2           cup  fresh cilantro leaves - (loosely packed)

Make The Meatballs:  Put the meat in a large bowl and add the garlic, cilantro, vinegar, paprika, cumin, coriander, salt, and a generous grinding of pepper.  Mix it with your hands until well blended.  Set aside.

Make The Sauce:  Blend the yogurt, mint, and cilantro in a food processor fitted with the metal blade, or in a blender.  (Meat mixture and sauce can each be made up to 1 day ahead, covered, and refrigerated separately.)

To Serve:  Preheat a broiler and adjust the rack so it is about 4 inches from the heating element.

Form the meat mixture into 1-inch meatballs and place them on a baking sheet with sides (work in batches if necessary).  Broil the meatballs until they are no longer pink inside, about 8 minutes, shaking the pan once or twice so the meatballs cook evenly.  Transfer them to paper towels to drain.

Skewer the meatballs with toothpicks and serve them immediately on a platter with the yogurt sauce in a small bowl alongside.  (Offer guests a small container or glass for depositing used toothpicks.)

This recipe yields 20 servings.

Comments:  Meatballs are a cocktail party standard, but this version, dunked into minty yogurt sauce, is hardly predictable.  The spicing takes its cue from merguez, a type of Moroccan sausage.  The meat will taste best if blended up to a day in advance, but cooked at the last possible moment or it will dry out.

Heat the leeks and olive oil in a small sautÈ pan over medium heat.  Add the 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Cook, stirring often to prevent browning, for 8 to 10 minutes, until wilted and tender, but not browned.  Transfer to a small bowl and let cool.

Add the fromage blanc and Parmigiano to the leeks and stir to mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.  Scoop up about 1 heaping teaspoon of the mixture and spoon into the bottom of the mushrooms.  Set on the prepared baking sheet.

Bake in the top third of the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, until the cheese mixture begins to brown and the mushrooms become tender to the bite.  Transfer to a serving plate and drizzle with a few drops of truffle oil.  Enjoy with a chardonnay with great structure and rich fruit flavors.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  One dairy that we are particularly fond of is Bellwether Farms.  Cindy Callahan and her two sons, Liam and Brett, produce outstanding sheep's milk and cow's milk cheeses at Bellwether, including fromage blanc.  It is a fresh, tangy cheese, not unlike fresh ricotta.  In fact, you can use ricotta as a substitute for fromage blanc in this recipe.  Just wrap the ricotta in cheesecloth and hang it over a bowl in the refrigerator overnight to eliminate any excess moisture.

                Mushroom Turnovers - {Empanadas De Hongos}

Recipe By     :Maria Baez Kijac
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RELLENO (filling) ===
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter
  1              pound  fresh firm white mushrooms -- wiped clean with a
                        damp cloth and finely chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped scallions
                        = (white part and 1" of the green)
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
  2        tablespoons  day-old bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
                        = (or dill)
  8             ounces  cheddar cheese -- shredded
                        === DOUGH ===
  2           packages  Pepperidge Farm frozen puff pastry shells -- thawed
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water

Make The Relleno:  Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and scallions and cook, stirring, until all the liquid from the mushrooms has evaporated.  Add the cream, and cook until reduced enough to just coat the mushrooms.  Remove from the heat and add the salt, pepper, and nutmeg.  Toss with the bread crumbs and parsley.  Let cool, then stir in the cheese.

Make The Empanadas:  Remove 1 pastry shell and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface into a 5- to 6-inch circle.  Place 2 heaping tablespoons of the filling in the center of the circle and lightly moisten the edge of half of the circle with the egg mixture.  Fold the round in half and press firmly to seal the edges.  Crimp the edge with a fork dipped in flour and pierce the top with a fork to allow steam to escape.  Repeat with the remaining shells and filling, then refrigerate for 30 minutes before baking.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Brush the empanadas with the egg mixture and bake on the upper oven rack until golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Let cool for a few minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 12 main course empanadas.

Comments:  This was one of my mother's favorite first courses for dinner parties.  Of course, the puff pastry was always made at home.  I remember my sister Ximena loved to make puff pastry; I think she was 10 years old when she learned how to make this dough.  These empanadas were also a favorite of my cooking-class students, and they are always a treat for family and friends.  The bonus is that they freeze beautifully.  To accommodate today's busy schedules, I often rely on ready-made puff pastry, as in this version of the dish.

Note: These empanadas freeze very well unbaked.  Freeze on baking sheets lined with waxed paper until hard, then store in covered containers.  You can pop them into the oven frozen just increase the baking time by 5 minutes.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Cakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING AND TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  finely-chopped walnuts
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon
                        === CAKE ===
  2             sticks  unsalted butter softened
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  2 1/2           cups  cake flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  sour cream

Mix together the walnuts, sugar, and cinnamon and set aside.

Place a rack in the bottom third of the oven.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9-inch springform or tube pan.

Using an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until very light in color.

Sift the flour and re-measure.  Sift the flour again with the baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  In a mixer set at low speed, alternately add the eggs and the flour mixture to the butter mixture.

Beat in the vanilla and sour cream until thoroughly blended.

Spoon half the batter into the prepared pan.  Top with half the nut mixture, stirring as you add it to keep it mixed.  Top with the remaining batter, smooth the top, and sprinkle with the remaining nut mixture.

Bake for 50 to 60 minutes until a cake tester inserted just off center comes out clean.  Take the cake from the oven and cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes; remove the cake from the pan.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 to 12 servings.

Comments:  I remember my mother telling me that this cake is better the second day.  There are certain ingredients that have to meld.  It's like stew, all the flavors have a chance to mingle.  I also remember the fragrance that wafted out of the kitchen when this cake was baking.  There's nothing fancy about it.  This is a cake that says "home," that says your mother is in the kitchen with her apron on, the way she was when you were a little child and she was taking care of you.

I know it has butter, sugar, and sour cream, but your readers don't have to eat the whole thing.  They could try using a little willpower.  But if they have enough people over, they're not going to get a chance. óMarian Burros, Oct. 17, 2003

       New Year's Eve GougËres With Arugula, Bacon, Carol's Onions

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAROL'S PICKLED ONIONS ===
  12            ounces  firm yellow onions
                        = (preferably no more than 2 1/2"
                        diameter)
  1 1/4           cups  Champagne vinegar
                        = (or white wine vinegar)
  1 1/4           cups  water
  2                     generous tablespoons sugar
  2                     bay leaves
  1              small  dried chili
                        A few whole black peppercorns
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === BATTER ===
  1                cup  water
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        = (a little more if using kosher salt)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  4              large  raw eggs -- cold
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly cracked black pepper - (to 3/4)
  2             ounces  GruyËre - (abt 1/2 cup) -- cut 1/4" cubes
                        === TO STUFF THE GOUG»RES ===
  10                    bacon slices - (to 12)
                        About 1 1/2 ounces arugula -- carefully washed,
                        and dried
  1                cup  Carol's Pickled Onions -- drained

For The Carol's Pickled Onions:  Peel and slice the onions into rings about 1/8-inch thick, discarding the end cuts; a mandoline will make this job very easy.  The slices will tend to fall into rings on their own, but you may need to separate the tight centers.  Discard any green sprouts or pithy or discolored rings.

Combine the vinegar, water, sugar, bay leaves, chili pod, peppercorns and a few pinches of salt in a small saucepan.  If you like things spicy, break the chili pod in half before you add it.  Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, then turn the heat up to medium and add the onion rings.  Gently stir the crowded onions as they return to a simmer.  Simmer for a little less than 1 minute.

Pour the hot onions and brine into a wide bowl or directly into jars.  The skinny rings will turn glassy as they cool.  Cover and store refrigerated.

For The GougËres:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a 2- to 4-quart saucepan, bring the water, butter, and salt to a simmer over medium heat.  Add the flour all at once and stir vigorously until the mixture masses and detaches itself from the sides of the pan.  Reduce the heat to low and cook, beating constantly, until the batter is very stiff and almost shiny, usually a few minutes.

Off the heat, add the eggs one by one, beating thoroughly with a wooden spoon to completely incorporate each egg before adding the next.  The mixture will initially resist each addition; you'll find yourself cutting through and slapping together slabs of slippery, warm paste until it gradually absorbs the egg and becomes sticky again.  The final mixture should be no hotter than tepid.  Add the pepper to taste and stir in the GruyËre.

If you are proficient with one, transfer the batter to a pastry bag, and pipe 2- to 3-inch-long bands onto a parchment paper-lined (or nonstick) baking sheet about 2 inches apart.  Otherwise, use a spoon to scoop out a heaping tablespoon of batter per gougËre and a second spoon to scrape it into a peaky mound on the prepared baking sheet.

Bake until firm and a rich golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Inevitably, some bits of cheese will ooze and form a delicious, crispy bib on the edges of the gougËres.  To check doneness, remove 1 gougËre and pry open.  The interior strands of dough should be tender and moist, but not mushy; if they are, close the gougËre and return it to the oven to bake with the rest for another few minutes.  If you are concerned they may over brown, simply turn off the oven and leave to finish cooking in the ambient heat.

Meanwhile, cut the bacon into 1 1/2- to 2-inch segments and panfry or roast to your taste.  Drain on towels.

Serve the gougËre warm from the oven (or reheated), split through the middle and overstuffed with a few pieces of bacon, several leaves of peppery arugula, and a few ringlets of the pickled onions.

This recipe yields 20 to 24 three-bite-size gougËres.

Comments"  This was the most successful New Year's Eve hors d'oeuvre of the last decade, outselling foie gras, oysters, caviar, crab salad, and little truffle-laden pizzas.  Many tables ordered several more after they had had one.  A gougËre is a savory, cheese-studded cream puff pastry; for this dish, you split and stuff the puffs like sandwiches.

<DirT>
For The Carol&apos;s Pickled Onions:  Peel and slice the onions into rings about 1/8-inch thick, discarding the end cuts; a mandoline will make this job very easy.  The slices will tend to fall into rings on their own, but you may need to separate the tight centers.  Discard any green sprouts or pithy or discolored rings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the vinegar, water, sugar, bay leaves, chili pod, peppercorns and a few pinches of salt in a small saucepan.  If you like things spicy, break the chili pod in half before you add it.  Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, then turn the heat up to medium and add the onion rings.  Gently stir the crowded onions as they return to a simmer.  Simmer for a little less than 1 minute.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the hot onions and brine into a wide bowl or directly into jars.  The skinny rings will turn glassy as they cool.  Cover and store refrigerated.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For The GougËres:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 2- to 4-quart saucepan, bring the water, butter, and salt to a simmer over medium heat.  Add the flour all at once and stir vigorously until the mixture masses and detaches itself from the sides of the pan.  Reduce the heat to low and cook, beating constantly, until the batter is very stiff and almost shiny, usually a few minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Off the heat, add the eggs one by one, beating thoroughly with a wooden spoon to completely incorporate each egg before adding the next.  The mixture will initially resist each addition; you&apos;ll find yourself cutting through and slapping together slabs of slippery, warm paste until it gradually absorbs the egg and becomes sticky again.  The final mixture should be no hotter than tepid.  Add the pepper to taste and stir in the GruyËre.

         Olives Stuffed With Ground Beef In Piquant Tomato Ragout

Recipe By     :Clifford A. Wright
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TABIL ===
  1              large  garlic clove -- chopped, and left
                        to dry in the open air for 2 days
                        = (or 2 tspns garlic powder)
     1/4           cup  coriander seeds
  1         tablespoon  caraway seeds
  2          teaspoons  cayenne pepper
                        === HARISA ===
  2             ounces  mildly-hot dried guajillo chiles
  2             ounces  mild dried Anaheim chiles
  5              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for topping off
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground caraway seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground coriander seeds
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        === OLIVES ===
     1/2         pound  ground beef
  2               cups  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves - -- (3 to 4 bunches)
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  Tabil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             pounds  pitted large green olives -- drained
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste -- mixed with
     1/4           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1         tablespoon  Harisa
  1 1/4           cups  water

Make The Tabil:  In a mortar, pound all the ingredients together until homogenous.  Store in the refrigerator if using fresh garlic for up to 2 months, or indefinitely, in a spice container, if using powdered garlic, although the pungency will decline as time goes by.  (Makes 1/4 cup)

Make The Harisa:  Soak the chiles in tepid water to cover until soft, 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Drain and remove the stems and seeds.  Place in a food processor with the garlic, water, and olive oil.  Process until smooth, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides.

Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the caraway and coriander seeds, and salt.  Store in a jar in the refrigerator, covering the surface of the paste with a layer of olive oil.  As you use the Harisa, make sure to top it off with a little olive oil so that it is never exposed to the air to prevent spoilage.  Properly topped off with olive oil so bacterial growth cannot occur, Harisa can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.  (Makes 1 cup)

Make The Olives:  In a large bowl, knead together the beef, parsley, onion, egg, tabil, salt, and black pepper.  Stuff the olives with this stuffing, using a small, narrow baby spoon or the handle of a teaspoon.

In a casserole, preferably earthenware, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat, then add the diluted tomato paste, red pepper flakes, Harisa, 1 teaspoon salt, and the water.  Bring to a boil and add the olives.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the meat is done (you'll need to taste one), about 1 hour.

Serve the olives with the sauce if serving this dish as an appetizer at the table or serve with cocktail toothpicks if serving as a passed appetizer.

This recipe yields 8 servings as plated appetizer and 12 servings as a passed appetizer.

Comments:  This Tunisian ragout called maraqat al-zaytun is served as a main course, but because of the convenience of the olives and their size, I think the dish lends itself well to a meze table.  This recipe requires large pitted olives preserved in a mild brine, not a strongly flavored one.  You'll notice that this recipe calls for a huge amount of parsley ó three to four bunches, and you must trust me that that is not excessive.  The tabil (pronounced "table" in Tunisian Arabic) is an all-purpose Tunisian spice mix.  The word means "seasoning."  Harisa is the most important prepared condiment used in Tunisian and Algerian cooking.  It can also be found in tubes in specialty food stores.

                  Pan-Fried Eggplant With Crumbled Feta

Recipe By     :Diane Kochilas
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  eggplants -- washed, and
                        cut into 1/4" rounds
                        Salt -- as needed
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  crumbled Greek feta - (abt 6 oz)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Paprika -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley - (to 4) -- to taste

Place the eggplant slices in a colander in layers and salt each layer.  Place a plate or other weight on top and press down.  Let the eggplants drain for 1 hour.  Rinse in the colander and pat dry very well.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet.  Place the eggplant slices in the skillet.  Fry until lightly golden on both sides, turning once in the process.  Repeat with the remaining eggplant slices and olive oil.

Preheat the broiler.  Place the eggplant slices on an ovenproof platter, sprinkle with the crumbled feta, pepper, and paprika and place under the broiler, about 8 inches from the heat source, for a few minutes until the feta starts to melt.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Eggplants with feta are found in tavernas and prepared at home with equal gusto.  You don't even have to follow through on the last stepóbroiling the dish so that the cheese melts.  Once the eggplants are softened in the skillet you can serve them, warm or at room temperature, with feta crumbled on top.

                        Pan-Fried Shrimp With Dill

Recipe By     :Clifford A. Wright
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  large fresh shrimp with their heads or
                        one pound previously frozen headless
                        shrimp, shells and/or heads removed and
                        saved for making shrimp stock, if desired
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh dill - (to 2) -- to your taste

In a large skillet, melt the butter with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat, then cook the shrimp seasoned with salt until red-orange and firm, 2 to 3 minutes, tossing and stirring.  Remove and set aside in a serving bowl.

In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the lemon juice, and dill to make a creamy yellow vinaigrette and pour over the shrimp.

Toss well and serve warm with the sauce on individual small meze plates or on a platter.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  According to Wright, in Greece, there are a variety of meze that go by the name garides tighanites, "fried shrimp."  This particular recipe is best made with fresh shrimp and served warm, although room temperature is very nice, too.  I usually serve this with some crusty Greek or Italian bread and a glass of ouzo.  Quite perfect, I think.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        pounds  pork liver -- cut into chunks
                        just small enough to fit in meat grinder
     1/2        pounds  pork fat -- cut into chunks
                        just small enough to fit in meat grinder
  1              pound  pork shoulder -- cut into chunks
                        just small enough to fit in meat grinder
     1/2    tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  allspice (careful!)
  5                     garlic cloves
  2                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  3             ounces  Cognac
  3             ounces  white wine
  4             sprigs  flat parsley
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1                     egg
                        Caul fat -- to wrap
                        = (purchase from your butcher)
  1                cup  duck fat

In the large bowl, combine the liver, pork fat, pork shoulder, pepper, allspice, garlic, shallots, Cognac, white wine, and parsley and cover.  Refrigerate overnight.  That was easy.

The next day, remove the mixture from the refrigerator, add the salt, and pass everything through the strong meat grinder which you have fitted with a medium blade.  The grind size should not be too small (paste) nor too large (chunks).  Basically, you're looking for a grind size about that of meat loaf.  If you don't have a durable meat grinder, suck up to your friendly neighborhood butcher and take your mix down to him.  He should like you by now; he doesn't get a lot of calls for pork liver and pork fat.  (If that's also not an option, trim off as much sinew as possible, cut the pork into small dice, and hope for the best.)

When your meat and other ingredients are ground up, add the egg and mix through by hand.  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Line the terrine mold with one big piece of caul fat (or overlapping pieces, if you must) so that plenty of extra flops over the edge ó enough to cover the top of the p‚tÈ when you fill the mold.  Fill the terrine with the ground mixture, packing it tightly.  Lift the terrine and firmly drop it onto the work surface (easy, don't go nuts) a few times, to knock out any air pockets.  Fold over the remaining caul fat to neatly cover the p‚tÈ, trimming and tucking until it looks nice.  Now cover the whole megillah with foil.

Set up a bain-marie inside the preheated oven.  Put the filled terrine in the center.  Obviously, you do not want the water level to be so high that the water leaks into the terrine mold.  You want just enough water so that it comes up below the rim.  Cook the terrine in the water bath in the oven for about 2 1/2 hours, or until the internal temperature is 160 degrees (this is where your meat thermometer comes in).

When done, remove from the oven and allow to cool.  Place a weight on top of the terrine (still in foil) and refrigerate overnight.  The next day, remove the weight, remove the foil, melt down the duck fat in a small saucepan, and pour it carefully over the pate.  Then refrigerate again for a few hours.  The p‚tÈ will keep in the refrigerator for at least 5 days.

Serve with cornichons and maybe a tiny salad.  If you did everything right, the p‚tÈ, when sliced, should be firm and moist, not dry or crumbly.  The color should be uniform, not pink at the bottom and gray on the top.  It should be cooked through, and the slices should have structural integrity, meaning they don't break when you cut them.

This recipe yields a 2 1/2 pound terrine.

Comments:  You've made meat loaf, right?  You've eaten cold meat loaf, yes?  Then you're halfway to being an ass-kicking, name-taking charcutier.  "Ooooh...p‚tÈ, I don't know."  Please.  Campagne means "country" in French, which means even your country-ass can make it.

Caul fat is the lacelike intestinal lining that you are going to use to line your terrine mold.  It's one of those things you want to have ordered from your butcher way in advance, so that it's there, fresh and ready to go, when your other meat arrives.  Caul fat is great, multipurpose stuff.  Your butcher has probably heard the tales of his fellow butchers binding wounds with it.  You can wrap forcemeats in it (as we will do), fish, or roasts.  It helps keep shape and retain moisture, and it adds flavor.  And it looks really cool and professional.  It has the added benefit of being easy to work with.

Recipe By     :Gordon Hamersley
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1            package  dry active yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === TOPPING ===
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- more or less
  2              large  onions -- thinly sliced
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  anchovy paste
  3             ounces  oil-cured olives - (to 4) -- pitted, and
                        roughly chopped
  3                     anchovy fillets - (to 6) -- well rinsed (or
                        soaked if salt-packed), patted dry, and
                        cut in half

Make The Dough:  Put the flour in a large bowl. In a small bowl, combine 1 cup warm water with the yeast and sugar.  Let the yeast proof for about 8 minutes then add the 2 tablespoons olive oil and stir to combine.  Pour the yeast mixture over the flour, stirring well to combine.  When the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, turn it out onto a floured surface and knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes.

Put the dough back into a clean large bowl and drizzle with the 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm spot until just about doubled in size, about 1 hour.  Another way to tell if it's properly risen: When you poke it with the tip of your finger the dough will not spring back.

Make The Topping:  While the dough rises, heat a couple of teaspoons of olive oil in a large sautÈ pan over medium heat.  Add the onions and pepper and cook, stirring every few minutes, until tender, 7 to 9 minutes.  Lower the heat to medium-low and let the onions cook until they become golden brown and very soft, another 30 to 40 minutes.  Add the garlic, stir to combine, and cook an additional 2 minutes.  Let the onions cool.

To Assemble And Bake:  Heat the oven to 425 degrees.  Oil a 10- by 15-inch sided baking sheet with about 2 teaspoons olive oil.

Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Roll the dough out into a rough rectangle measuring about 12 by 18 inches.  Fit the dough into the baking sheet, letting the ends of the dough ride up onto the sides of the baking sheet.  Drizzle the top of the dough with 2 to 3 teaspoons olive oil.

Spread the olive oil over all the dough including the edges.  Cover the dough again with plastic wrap and let it relax for about 5 minutes.

Spread the top of the dough with a thin layer of anchovy paste.  Spread the onions over the anchovy paste in one layer.  Scatter the olives over the top and lay the anchovy pieces ó as many as you want ó on top of the tart intermittently.

Bake until the crust is browned and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This is the ubiquitous olive-and-anchovy tart from the CÙte d'Azur.  Nothing beats its full-flavored saltiness as an hors d'oeuvre served with a glass of crisp white wine or a dry rosÈ.  If you use salt-packed anchovies, soak them in a few changes of water to rid them of their excess salt.

Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Roll the dough out into a rough rectangle measuring about 12 by 18 inches.  Fit the dough into the baking sheet, letting the ends of the dough ride up onto the sides of the baking sheet.  Drizzle the top of the dough with 2 to 3 teaspoons olive oil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the olive oil over all the dough including the edges.  Cover the dough again with plastic wrap and let it relax for about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the top of the dough with a thin layer of anchovy paste.  Spread the onions over the anchovy paste in one layer.  Scatter the olives over the top and lay the anchovy pieces ó as many as you want ó on top of the tart intermittently.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake until the crust is browned and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This is the ubiquitous olive-and-anchovy tart from the CÙte d&apos;Azur.  Nothing beats its full-flavored saltiness as an hors d&apos;oeuvre served with a glass of crisp white wine or a dry rosÈ.  If you use salt-packed anchovies, soak them in a few changes of water to rid them of their excess salt.

                     Popovers With Strawberry Butter

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STRAWBERRY BUTTER ===
  1 1/2           cups  butter -- room temperature
  1                cup  good-quality strawberry preserves
                        === POPOVERS ===
  3 1/2           cups  milk
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  6              large  eggs -- room temperature

Make The Strawberrry Butter:  Place the butter in the work bowl of an electric mixer and beat on high until light and fluffy.  Add the preserves and beat until well combined.

To serve, spoon or pipe the flavored butter into 2-tablespoon ramekins or onto side plates.

Chef's note: Keep refrigerated in an airtight container.  This spread will last for two to three days.

Make The Popovers:  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Place the milk in a bowl and microwave on high for 2 minutes, or until warm to the touch.  Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder together in a large mixing bowl.

Crack the eggs into the work bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk and beat on medium speed for about 3 minutes, until foamy and pale in color.  Turn down the mixer to low and add the warm milk.  Gradually add the flour mixture and beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes.  Turn the machine off and let the batter rest for 1 hour at room temperature.

Spray a popover tin generously with nonstick spray.  Fill the popover cups almost to the top with the batter and place the popover tin on a cookie sheet.  Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 minutes.  Turn down the oven temperature to 375 degrees and bake for 30 to 35 minutes longer, until the popovers are a deep golden brown on the outside and airy on the inside.

Turn out the popovers and serve hot with strawberry butter.

Chef's note: The key to making great popovers is having the eggs and milk warm before mixing.  It is also important to let the batter sit for an hour before baking it.  Popovers do not freeze well, and pre-made batter has a tendency not to work properly the next day.

This recipe yields 2 dozen popovers.

Comments:  Popovers are another trademark food itemóand the most recognizableóat Neiman Marcus restaurants.  As we open new restaurants around the country, I always warn our chefs that they should never run out of popovers during lunch.  Invariably, shortly after opening, they do anyway because they have not gotten the timing down yet -- these popovers take almost an hour to bake and if you are not paying attention, you get caught waiting for them to finish.  The worst sin a chef can commit at Neiman Marcus is to attempt to send out different bread to substitute for late popovers.  I let them know that it's better to tell our customers that the popovers will take a few more minutes, because they'll prefer to wait.  Popovers are best served straight from the oven.  If you're serious about perfect popovers, I recommend checking your oven calibration with an accurate oven thermometer.  Remember that these popovers will rise by three or four inches, so make sure your oven racks are spaced appropriately.

Categories    : Accompaniment                   Condiments
                Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     3/4           cup  chopped onion
  3               cups  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
  2          teaspoons  tomato paste
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh oregano

Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add the garlic and onion and sautÈ until soft.  Add the rest of the ingredients, increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil.  Once boiling, decrease the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.  To use, heat slowly over low heat.

This recipe yields 3 cups.

Comments:  This chunky, quick-cooked salsa has a lot more flavor than the store-bought stuff.  Serve it with chips for dipping.  Use it on Chevys Three-Cheese Chile RelleÒos, huevos rancheros and omelets.  Or heat it up and toss it with pasta, just like a traditional Italian tomato sauce (for extra credit, crumble some queso fresco on top).

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  sweet red bell peppers
  1              small  hot chile pepper
                        = (or 1 tbspn Turkish red pepper paste)
  1 1/2           cups  walnuts
     1/2           cup  wheat crackers or zweibach
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2         tablespoon  pomegranate molasses -- or more to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin -- more for garnish
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- more for garnish

Roast the peppers and chili over a gas burner or under a broiler, turning frequently until blackened and blistered all over, about 12 minutes.  Place in a covered bowl to steam for 10 minutes.  Rub off the skins, slit peppers open, and remove stems, membranes and seeds.  Spread the peppers, smooth side up, on a paper towel and let drain for 10 minutes.

In a food processor, grind the walnuts and crackers with the lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, cumin, salt, and sugar until smooth.  Add the bell peppers and process until purÈed and creamy.

With the machine on, add the olive oil in a thin stream.  Add the chile to taste.  If the paste is too thick, thin with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water.  Refrigerate overnight.

To serve, let the dip come to room temperature and sprinkle with cumin and olive oil.

This recipe yields about 3 cups.

Comments:  This is one of the outstanding dips of the eastern Mediterranean, as delicious and striking as the far more famous hummus and baba ghanoush.  Try it with meat or fish kabobs, or simply with crisp pita triangles or warmed, floppy lavash.  The dip will keep for one week in a closed container in the refrigerator, improving a little each day.  Remember to return the dip to room temperature before serving.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     container ricotta cheese - (15 to 16 oz)
                        = (low fat can be used)
  4              large  eggs
  6        tablespoons  flour
  2        tablespoons  melted and cooled butter or margarine
  1         tablespoon  sugar - (to 2)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Vegetable oil or non stick vegetable spray

Place the batter ingredients in a blender or food processor.  Process until smooth.

Lightly grease a large griddle or frying pan and heat it over medium heat.  Spoon about 2 tablespoons (or more) of batter, depending on the size pancakes you want.  Silver-dollar size makes for a lovely presentation.

When a few bubbles have risen to the surface of the pancakes and the tops have lost their sheen, turn them over and cook for another few seconds.  The pancakes should be very lightly browned.  Serve with jam, applesauce, yogurt, or fresh berries.

This recipe yields about 30 small pancakes.

Comments:  Because there is so little flour in this dish, the taste is quite different from regular pancakes.  Great as an appetizer or for brunch.

<DirT>
When a few bubbles have risen to the surface of the pancakes and the tops have lost their sheen, turn them over and cook for another few seconds.  The pancakes should be very lightly browned.  Serve with jam, applesauce, yogurt, or fresh berries.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 30 small pancakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Because there is so little flour in this dish, the taste is quite different from regular pancakes.  Great as an appetizer or for brunch.

               Roasted Eggplant Dip With Spiced Pita Crisps

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DIP ===
  1                     Italian eggplant - (abt 1 lb)
  2                     garlic cloves -- unpeeled
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 3)
     1/4           cup  fresh Italian parsley leaves - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice - (to 2)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === PITA CRISPS ===
  3                     pita breads - (6" dia)
                        Olive or vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper

Make the Dip:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the whole eggplant in a baking dish just large enough to hold it and pierce the eggplant 2 or 3 times with the tip of a knife.  Place the garlic cloves on a small square of foil and splash them with a bit of oil; enclose the garlic in foil.  Put the foil packet in the dish along side the eggplant and place them in the oven.

Bake until the garlic is soft when squeezed (open the packet to test), about 35 minutes.  Remove the garlic and let it cool in the foil.  Continue to bake the eggplant until it is wrinkled, soft, and almost collapsed, about 25 minutes more.  Let it cool in the pan and leave the oven on.

Cut the stem off the cooled eggplant and pull off and discard the skin.  Chop the flesh and set it aside.  Peel the garlic cloves and put them in a food processor fitted with the metal blade.  Add the parsley and pulse until it is finely chopped.  Add the chopped eggplant, 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of the extra-virgin olive oil; pulse until just combined (do not puree).  Taste the dip and add salt and more lemon juice and/or oil as needed.  Pulse again until the mixture is almost smooth; it should have the texture of guacamole.  (If made ahead, transfer the dip to a bowl and wrap it with plastic, pressing the wrap right onto the surface.  Refrigerate for up to 2 days.)

Make the Pita Crisps:  Cut the pitas in half and peel them apart to make quarters.  Arrange the quarters on a work surface and brush them well with oil.  Stir together the salt, paprika, and cayenne in a small ramekin or bowl and sprinkle them over the pita quarters.

Stack and cut the pita into wedges (you should get 3 wedges per quarter, or 36 total).

Spread the wedges on baking sheets and bake them until crisp and golden about 12 minutes.  (Crisps can be cooled and stored airtight for up to 2 days.)

Serve the dip in a bowl surrounded with the pita crisps.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  This milder cousin of baba ghanoush has no tahini so you can fully taste the roasted eggplant.  Be generous with the parsley; its fresh green taste pumps up the dip.

                             Rosemary Cashews

Recipe By     :Ina Garten
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  roasted unsalted cashews
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh rosemary leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  2          teaspoons  light brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spread the cashews out on a sheet pan.  Toast in the oven until warm, about 5 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine the rosemary, cayenne, sugar, salt, and butter.  Thoroughly toss the warm cashews with the spiced butter and serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Here is a savory cocktail nibble that would satisfy a French host's needs.  These cashews were inspired by the bar nuts served at Union Square Cafe in New York City, which is one of my favorite restaurants in the world.  The cashews are best served warm, but you can prepare the rosemary mixture in advance.

                    Soft Polenta With Forest Mushrooms

Recipe By     :Rick Tramonto
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  polenta meal or cornmeal
  2 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  grapeseed oil
     1/4           cup  chopped shiitake mushrooms
     1/4           cup  chopped black trumpet or chanterelle
                        mushrooms
     1/4           cup  chopped oyster mushrooms
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2                     shallots -- finely chopped
  1                     bay leaf
  3        tablespoons  dry white wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- or more
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Put the polenta meal and cream in a large saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the bottom from burning.

Heat the oil in a large sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  When the oil is hot, add the mushrooms and sautÈ for 10 to 15 minutes or until the mushrooms are browned and softened.  Add the garlic, shallots, and bay leaf and cook for an additional 3 minutes or until the garlic and shallots are softened.  Add the white wine while stirring the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to dissolve any browned solids into the liquid.

Remove from the heat, remove and discard the bay leaf, and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover to keep warm.

Add the cheese and butter to the warm polenta.  Stir until the butter melts and the cheese is incorporated.  Taste and add more cheese, if desired.

To serve, arrange a mound of polenta on a small plate or in small bowls.  Top with some of the mixed mushroom sautÈ.  Repeat to make 5 to 9 more servings.

This recipe yields 6 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Most people are potato crazed; I am polenta crazed.  Soft polenta is as versatile as mashed potatoes ó mix it with cheese, mushrooms, vegetables, even lobster.  The key is to add enough butter so that it's irresistibly rich.  I remember once eating soft polenta with roast pork at Chef Gualtiero Marchesiís three-star Michelin restaurant in Milan, Italy, in the early 1990s, and when we asked for seconds, they brought the pot from the kitchen, and scooped the golden polenta straight onto our plates.

Polenta is cornmeal cooked with liquid ó usually water or stock ó until it thickens.  A careful cook stirs it with a wooden spoon, never altering the direction of the stir.  Soft polenta has the consistency of hot cereal, while firm polenta, which is cooked with less liquid, cools to form a firm, sliceable block.  In Italy, firm polenta is traditionally sliced with a length of taut string.  Both types of polenta can be sautÈed, grilled, baked, or fried and served as a side dish or as part of a main course.  I like to serve it as an amuse with a tumble of earthy mushrooms cooked with shallots until softened.  When you select polenta meal for this recipe, try to buy a good imported brand.  If you cannot find it, substitute stone-ground domestic cornmeal.  Try not to buy instant polenta, which never quite achieves the desired consistency.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MUSHROOMS ===
  12            medium  fresh shiitake mushrooms
                        A little all-purpose flour
  1 1/4           cups  ground chicken
     2/3           cup  ground raw shrimp
  3                     green onions -- minced
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  sake (rice wine)
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Olive oil
                        === SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  Mirin (sweetened rice wine)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  sake

Clean the shiitake well and discard the stems.  Dust the inner part of the shiitake with the flour.

Mix together the chicken, shrimp, green onion, ginger, sake, soy sauce, and a pinch of salt.  Use a little to fill the cavity of each mushroom.

SautÈ the stuffed mushrooms gently for 5 minutes on each side in a little olive oil, covered.

Uncover and add the ingredients for the sauce.  Let them heat through and evaporate a little.  Serve 3 mushrooms per person, with a little sauce on each one.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This Japanese recipe also suggests Chinese cooking because the shiitake mushroom, so popular now and available in every supermarket, is very commonly used in both countries (and indeed, increasingly, in the rest of the world).  The recipe was suggested by my Japanese friend, Miho.

Comments:  This Japanese recipe also suggests Chinese cooking because the shiitake mushroom, so popular now and available in every supermarket, is very commonly used in both countries (and indeed, increasingly, in the rest of the world).  The recipe was suggested by my Japanese friend, Miho.

                                Tabbouleh

Recipe By     :Clifford A. Wright
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  medium or coarse bulgur - (no. 3 or 4)
                        Juice of 4 lemons
  6               cups  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves - -- (6 to 7 bunches)
  1                cup  finely-chopped fresh mint leaves
  1              pound  ripe tomatoes -- very finely chopped
  2              large  onions -- very finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/4           cups  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 1 3/4) -- as needed
  1              bunch  romaine lettuce -- leaves separated,
                        washed, and dried
  8                     scallions -- cut 1" lengths

Cover a strainer with cheesecloth and place the bulgur on top.  Place the strainer in a pot filled with cold water and soak the bulgur for 10 minutes.  Pull up the sides of the cheesecloth, encasing the bulgur, and squeeze out all the water.  Transfer to a large bowl.

Toss the bulgur with the lemon juice.  Toss again with the parsley, mint, tomatoes, and onions and season with salt and pepper.  Stir in 1 1/4 cups of the olive oil and leave to rest at room temperature until the bulgur has absorbed enough liquid to be tender, 4 to 6 hours.  Correct the seasonings and olive oil; there should be enough that it looks shiny and moist but not gooey and oily.

Serve garnished with romaine lettuce leaves and scallions.  Place a few slices of scallion in a leaf of romaine lettuce, then scoop up the tabbouleh with the lettuce leaf.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  I worry that although everyone has heard of tabbouleh, no one has actually tasted a proper one.  Tabbouleh is a Lebanese herb salad with bulgur, not a bulgur salad with herbs, as it often seems to be made.  It's served as a meze in the Middle East and has migrated to America, where it is now regularly sold prepackaged in supermarkets.  The taste of a true tabbouleh should not be of wheat but of herbs.  The longer the bulgur sits and absorbs the olive oil, lemon juice, tomato, and onion juices, the more it will swell and dominate the salad, so keep that in mind when you prepare this salad.  Remember that the proper ratio of parsley to bulgur is about 7 to 1.  Many cooks make tabbouleh with a food processor by pulsing in short bursts, although I still prefer the texture of the labor-intensive method of hand-chopping all the ingredients with a large chef's knife.  Tabbouleh is properly eaten by scooping up small amounts of it with pieces of romaine lettuce, not with a fork and knife, nor with pita bread

                            Truffled Egg Toast

Recipe By     :Amanda Hesser
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  3                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  crËme fraÓche
                        Sea salt -- to taste
  1              slice  country bread
                        = (not too chewy, not too sour, but
                        sturdy)
                        White truffle oil -- for sprinkling

Melt the butter in a tiny skillet over very low heat.  Whisk together the eggs and crËme fraÓche.  Season with salt.  Pour this into the skillet and use a whisk or wooden spoon to stir it, making sure to cover the entire bottom surface.  This will take at least 10 minutes, so be patient.  If you do it too fast, the egg will dry and the curds won't be as silky.  Toast the bread and put it on your favorite dinner plate.

As soon as the eggs have formed soft curds and are loose but not raw, spoon them onto the toast.  If some of the egg tumbles off, that's fine.  Sprinkle with truffle oil, and let sit for a minute before digging in.  (Eat with a fork and knife.)

This recipe yields 1 serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TRUFFLE VINAIGRETTE ===
  3                     fresh black truffles -- (see Note)
     1/2           cup  truffle juice -- plus
  2        tablespoons  truffle juice -- (see Note)
  2        tablespoons  sherry vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
     1/2           cup  white truffle oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BACON VINAIGRETTE ===
  4             ounces  thick-cut bacon -- cut 1/4" cubes
  2        tablespoons  sherry vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === LENTILS ===
     1/4           cup  warm cooked orange lentils -- (see Note)
     1/4           cup  warm cooked black lentils
     1/4           cup  warm cooked French green lentils
  3        tablespoons  Truffle Vinaigrette -- (above)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  Bacon Vinaigrette -- (above)
  6             sprigs  fresh chervil or flat-leaf parsley -- for garnishing

Make The Truffle Vinaigrette:  In a blender, combine the truffles, truffle juice, vinegar, mustard, and lemon juice.  Puree until smooth.

With the motor running, slowly add the oil and blend until emulsified.

Transfer to a small glass or ceramic bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Use immediately or refrigerate the vinaigrette in a tightly lidded non-reactive container for up to 2 weeks.  Whisk well before using.

Make The Bacon Vinaigrette:  In a small skillet or sautÈ pan cook the bacon over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes or until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crispy.

Remove from the heat and allow the bacon and bacon fat to cool slightly.  Stir in the vinegar and mustard.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve warm.

Make The Lentils:  Combine the lentils in a medium-sized bowl and toss gently with the truffle vinaigrette.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

To serve, spoon about 2 tablespoons of the truffled lentils onto a decorative spoon, such as a long-handled iced tea spoon.  Set the spoon on a small plate and drizzle the bacon vinaigrette over and around the "truffles."  Garnish each with a sprig of chervil.  Repeat to 5 more servings.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Here's an easy take on saucisson, the French classic that combines lentils and sausage, although I have chosen to serve it without the sausage.  I had the best saucisson of my life at Paul Bocuse's restaurant in Lyon, France.  I had planned to eat there one Saturday night, assured when I called ahead that the chef would be in the restaurant.  I was heartbroken when I arrived to find he was not on the premises.  The maitre d' invited me to come back the next day so that I could get my book and menus autographed and surprised me the next afternoon when he told me I was expected in the kitchen as the chef's guest.  There, I sat at a granite table where I ate saucisson with Chef Bocuse himself!  This truly was one of the highlights of my career, to sit and listen to the wisdom of such a legend.

If you want to add sausage, cut a warmed link into coins and impale them on the end of a fork's tines.  Lentils are legumes that cook quickly without presoaking, which makes them endlessly versatile.  They are smaller and flatter than other legumes and maybe yellow, brown, black, green, or mottled.  The small green French lentils known as Le Puy are considered to be the finest example.

Notes:  You can buy truffle juice in specialty stores.  I use white truffle oil, but you may use black truffle oil if you prefer it.  The same goes for fresh truffles: I suggest black truffles but if white truffles are in season and you can find them, use them.

You can cook the lentils ahead of time and refrigerate them for up to 24 hours.  Reheat them gently in a saucepan with a little water, or in the microwave, until warm.  Take care not to cook them any further.  You want only to warm them.

Make The Bacon Vinaigrette:  In a small skillet or sautÈ pan cook the bacon over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes or until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crispy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the heat and allow the bacon and bacon fat to cool slightly.  Stir in the vinegar and mustard.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Lentils:  Combine the lentils in a medium-sized bowl and toss gently with the truffle vinaigrette.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, spoon about 2 tablespoons of the truffled lentils onto a decorative spoon, such as a long-handled iced tea spoon.  Set the spoon on a small plate and drizzle the bacon vinaigrette over and around the &quot;truffles.&quot;  Garnish each with a sprig of chervil.  Repeat to 5 more servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Here&apos;s an easy take on saucisson, the French classic that combines lentils and sausage, although I have chosen to serve it without the sausage.  I had the best saucisson of my life at Paul Bocuse&apos;s restaurant in Lyon, France.  I had planned to eat there one Saturday night, assured when I called ahead that the chef would be in the restaurant.  I was heartbroken when I arrived to find he was not on the premises.  The maitre d&apos; invited me to come back the next day so that I could get my book and menus autographed and surprised me the next afternoon when he told me I was expected in the kitchen as the chef&apos;s guest.  There, I sat at a granite table where I ate saucisson with Chef Bocuse himself!  This truly was one of the highlights of my career, to sit and listen to the wisdom of such a legend.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you want to add sausage, cut a warmed link into coins and impale them on the end of a fork&apos;s tines.  Lentils are legumes that cook quickly without presoaking, which makes them endlessly versatile.  They are smaller and flatter than other legumes and maybe yellow, brown, black, green, or mottled.  The small green French lentils known as Le Puy are considered to be the finest example.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Notes:  You can buy truffle juice in specialty stores.  I use white truffle oil, but you may use black truffle oil if you prefer it.  The same goes for fresh truffles: I suggest black truffles but if white truffles are in season and you can find them, use them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
You can cook the lentils ahead of time and refrigerate them for up to 24 hours.  Reheat them gently in a saucepan with a little water, or in the microwave, until warm.  Take care not to cook them any further.  You want only to warm them.

                          Tuna And Olive Spread

Recipe By     :Patricia Wells
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  best French brine-cured black olives -- pitted
                        = (such as Nyons)
  2        tablespoons  capers in vinegar -- drained
  2        tablespoons  dry red wine
  2                     plump cloves garlic -- peeled, green germs
                        removed, and minced
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  1                can  best-quality tuna in olive oil - (7 oz) -- do not drain
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 2) -- as necessary

In the bowl of a food processor or blender, combine all the ingredients.  Process to form a thick paste, adding additional oil if necessary to form a smooth puree.  Taste for seasoning.  The spread can be stored, covered and refrigerated, for up to 1 week.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 cups.

Variation:  Along the same lines, prepare a more pungent sardine-based spread, or sardinade, substituting a 3 3/4 ounce can of best-quality sardines cured in olive oil for the canned tuna.

Comments:  The markets of Provence provide a wealth of inspiration.  Colorful stands feature as many as twenty-five varieties of olives, cured in salt, mixed with herbs or garlic, cured in brine, flavored with wild fennel, to name just a few, as well as delicious olive-based spreads made for spreading on crackers and serving with a glass of rose at aperitif time.  This is just one of the many variations inspired by those markets.

               Walnut And Raisin Coffee Cake - {Ciambella}

Recipe By     :Carol Field
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Cakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  raisins
  6        tablespoons  Marsala or rum
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature,
                        plus
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  sugar
  4              large  eggs -- separated
     1/3           cup  milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2           cup  toasted walnuts or blanched almonds -- roughly chopped,
                        plus
  1         tablespoon  toasted walnuts or blanched almonds -- roughly chopped
  1 1/2    tablespoons  turbinado sugar

Soak the raisins in the Marsala or rum for 30 minutes.  Drain, reserving the liquid.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cream the butter and sugar together well.  Add the egg yolks, one at a time, incorporating each one well before adding the next.  Mix together the milk, reserved Marsala or rum, and vanilla.

Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder.  Using a rubber spatula, beat the milk mixture into the butter mixture in three additions alternating with the dry ingredients.

Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks.  With the rubber spatula, stir one quarter of them into the batter to lighten it, then fold in the rest along with the nuts and raisins.

Turn the batter into a buttered and lightly floured angel food pan or ring mold, sprinkle the top with the turbinado sugar, and bake for about 45 minutes, until the top is golden and a tester comes out clean.

If you prefer to use a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan, bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Cool the cake in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes, then invert onto a rack, and cool to room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This sublime coffee cake, spiked with a little Marsala or rum, is real comfort food.  It is even more delicious accompanied by a glass of wine.

Variation:

Ciambella Al Anice:  Use 1 tablespoon anise seeds instead of the raisins and nuts.  Substitute Sambuca for the Marsala or rum, or omit it altogether and increase the milk to 1/2 cup.
