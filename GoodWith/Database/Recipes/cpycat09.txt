                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Granulated garlic -- to taste
                        Melted butter -- as needed
  2             pieces  Italian bread
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise with roasted garlic and mustard
  2             slices  Swiss cheese
  2             slices  Cheddar cheese
     1/2           cup  sliced onions

Season one side of the burger with salt, pepper and garlic.  Place on grill or in broiler, seasoned-side down.  Then season the other side.  Cook to desired doneness.  (At our Applebee's, the minimum internal temperature of any burger is 155 degrees.

While burger is cooking, melt butter in fry pan on medium heat or in electric skillet (set at 350 degrees).  Spread mayonnaise onto bread.  Drop bread, dry-side down, onto melted pools and swirl to coat (to avoid sticking/burning).

Cover one slice of bread with two slices of Swiss cheese and the other with two slices of cheddar.

In a separate frying/sautÈ pan, melt butter and sautÈ sliced onions.  Season with salt, pepper and garlic while heating.

Place cooked burger patty on top of one cheese-topped slice of bread and the sautÈed onions on the other.  Carefully close and cut sandwich.  Serve with your favorite summer side dish.  We serve ours in "classic" style with seasoned French fries and a pickle.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     eggs
  6             ounces  shredded Monterey Jack cheese
  6             ounces  shredded Colby cheese
  1                     box frozen chopped broccoli - (16 oz) -- thawed, drained,
                        and dried
  2 1/2         ounces  bacon pieces
     1/2         ounce  diced yellow onion
  1              ounce  all-purpose flour
                        Italian bread crumbs as needed
                        === HONEY MUSTARD DRESSING ===
     3/4           cup  sour cream
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
     1/3           cup  Dijon mustard
     1/3           cup  honey
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice -- plus
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice

Drain thawed broccoli thoroughly by pressing through a strainer.  Beat eggs in a mixing bowl with a whisk until well blended.  Place all the ingredients into a plastic container, except the bread crumbs.  Stir together with a spatula until thoroughly combined.  Refrigerate mixture for about 1 hour.  This will help to bind the mix making preparation much easier.

Heat about 4 cups oil in a fryer or deep pan for frying at 350 degrees.  Set up a shallow pan with bread crumbs.  Scoop about 1/2 ounce portion of the broccoli mixture into the bread crumbs.  Form each portion into a ball and coat it well.

Place broccoli bites into the fry basket or frying pan.  Make sure they do not stick together.  Fry for one minute, then remove and place onto a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.  Serve with Honey Mustard Dressing.

Honey Mustard Dressing:  In a mixing bowl, combine sour cream, mayonnaise and mustard.  Blend thoroughly using a whisk.  Slowly pour in the honey and lemon juice, continue mixing until smooth and well combined.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     boneless skinless chicken breasts - (to 3)
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2       package  Old El Paso fajita seasoning
  1                     box Old El Paso flour fajita shells
                        Spreadable butter
  1              large  ripe tomato
     1/2                onion
  1              pound  Cheddar/mozzarella cheese mix

Start by cutting the chicken (while still slightly frozen, cuts easier) into small squared pieces.  Fry in pan then add water and seasoning to the pan, sauce will thicken slightly after a few minutes.  Set the chicken aside while preparing the other ingredients.

Butter one side of all the fajita shells you intend on using and set aside.

Dice the tomato and the onion, mix and also set aside.

Either finely shred yourself or buy 1 pound of finely shredded Cheddar/mozzarella cheese and set aside.

Let pan or griddle get hot, about 350 degrees, and then assemble quesadillas similar to a sandwich.  First, one shell butter-side down, then generously sprinkle the cheese.  Next add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of chicken mixture.  Now add a small amount (1/4 cup) of the tomato and onion mix.  More cheese, generously sprinkled, and finally top with another fajita shell, butter-side up.

Once the cheese starts to bubble from the sides of the quesadilla it typically is time to flip it, make sure to either flip quickly or rest your fingers on the top shell holding it together while you flip it.  Shell should be crunchy and a golden color.  If you find that the quesadilla is semi-plump in the center, simply press down with spatula once you have flipped it.

Let stand for a few moments and then cut into quarters, serve with your choice of sour cream, guacamole or salsa for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  linguini
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  12                    scallops
  10                    shrimp - (26 to 30 count) -- peeled, deveined
  8                     clams
     1/3           cup  Garlic Lemon Butter -- (see below)
  4               cups  Marinara Sauce -- (see below)
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley -- plus
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh parsley
                        === GARLIC LEMON BUTTER ===
  1              stick  butter -- room temperature
  2          teaspoons  crushed garlic
  1 1/2      teaspoons  lemon juice
                        === MARINARA SAUCE ===
  3 1/2    tablespoons  vegetable oil
  8 1/2         ounces  diced yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1                can  crushed tomatoes -- (6 lbs 4 oz)
  3 1/2    tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  2 1/8      teaspoons  dried oregano leaves
  1 1/4      teaspoons  dried basil leaves
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
  1              whole  bay leaf

Cook linguini 8 to 10 minutes; drain well.  Rinse and mix in vegetable oil to prevent sticking.

Place Garlic Lemon Butter in a large sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  When butter begins to sizzle, add shrimp, scallops and clams and sautÈ for 5 minutes.

Place Marinara Sauce in the pan and bring sauce to a boil.  Stir well to ensure even heating of all the ingredients.  Add linguini and toss until noodles are well covered with sauce.  Continue to cook for additional 2 minutes.

Pour pasta into a large bowl and sprinkle evenly with Parmesan cheese and parsley to garnish.

For Garlic Lemon Butter:  Place butter in mixing bowl; cream with electric mixer.  Add garlic and lemon juice, continue mixing until smooth.  Cover and refrigerate until needed.

For Marinara Sauce:  In large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat until hot.  Add onions.  Cook, stirring frequently until onions start to become limp and are clear, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic; cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add remaining ingredients to saucepan, stir well.  Bring sauce to boil, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to low, simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.  Once cooked, remove bay leaf.  (Makes 3 quarts)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            medium  garlic cloves
  3               cups  drained canned cannellini beans -- abt two 15 oz cans
                        = (or great northern beans)
     1/2           cup  sesame paste (tahini)
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  soy sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/8      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/4           cup  cold water - (to 1/2) -- if needed
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh Italian parsley -- for garnish
                        === CHECCA ===
  2              pound  Roma tomatoes -- cut 1/2" dice
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh basil
  2           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Fit a food processor with the steel blade.  Process the garlic cloves until finely minced, stopping the processor occasionally to scrape down the sides of the work bowl.  Add the beans and pulse the machine a few times to chop them coarsely.  Then, with the machine running, puree them while you slowly pour the sesame paste through the feed tube.

Still with the motor running, pour the olive oil, lemon juice, and soy sauce through the feed tube, stopping the processor occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl.

Stop the processor, open the lid, and add the salt, cumin, coriander, and cayenne.  Process until thoroughly blended.  If the puree seems too thick for dipping or spreading, pulse in the 1/4 to 1/2 cup cold water.  Transfer the puree to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate to chill well before serving.

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.

Put the pita breads in the oven and heat until thoroughly warmed, 6 to 8 minutes.

Carefully remove and cut into wedges.  Place the chilled hummus in a serving plate or bowl and arrange the tomato Checca on top.  Garnish with the chopped parsley and surround with the pita triangles.  Serve immediately.

For the Checca:  In a mixing bowl, toss together the Checca ingredients, mixing them thoroughly.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until serving time.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

               Carrabba's Italian Grill's Spiedino Di Mare

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     scallops - (U-10 to U-20)
  4                     shrimp - (U-16 to U-20)
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                     splash olive oil
                        Seasoned Italian bread crumbs -- as needed
  2             ounces  lemon butter
  1              pinch  chopped fresh parsley

Lightly season scallops and shrimp with salt and pepper.  Lightly coat with olive oil, then dip in seasoned bread crumbs.  Skewer and grill on both sides.

Melt lemon butter and serve with seafood.  Sprinkle chopped parsley on top.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Comments:  I found that it tasted more like the Carrabba's dish when I just poured the lemon butter over the scallops and shrimp and served it like that instead of having it on the side.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     avocados -- pitted, and
                        mashed into pulp
  1                     container sour cream - (16 oz)
  1                can  Rotel diced tomatoes with chiles
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1                can  green chiles - (4 oz)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  3             ounces  cream cheese
  5              drops  green food coloring - (to 6)
                        = (optional, if avocados aren't ripe and
                        dark green in color)
  2                     fresh or canned jalapeno peppers -- stems removed
                        = (optional, if you like it hotter)

In a blender, mix and blend all ingredients until smooth.  Refrigerate for a couple of hours before serving.  Do not taste the sauce until it has chilled.  If you taste it right after blending, it won't taste "salty enough."  But let the sauce chill and let the flavors develop and it will be great!  Serve with white corn tortilla chips.

This recipe yields 4 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREAMY BANANA CHEESECAKE ===
  20                    vanilla sandwich cookies
     1/4           cup  margarine -- melted
  3           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- softened
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  3                     eggs
     3/4           cup  mashed bananas - (abt 2)
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
                        === VANILLA BAVARIAN CREAM FROSTING ===
  1           envelope  unflavored gelatin -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  unflavored gelatin
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  cold water
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  6                     egg yolks
  1 1/2       teaspoon  vanilla extract
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream -- whipped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place cookies in a blender; process with on/off pulse until finely crushed.  Add margarine; process with pulses until blended.  Press crumb mixture onto bottom of 10-inch springform pan; refrigerate.

Beat cream cheese in large bowl with electric mixer at medium speed until creamy.  Add sugar and cornstarch; beat until blended.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in bananas, whipping cream, and vanilla.

Pour cream cheese mixture into prepared crust.  Place pan on cookie sheet and bake 15 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees (DO NOT forget to reduce temperature -- very important) and continue baking 75 minutes or until center is almost set.  Loosen edge of cheesecake; cool completely on wire rack before removing rim of pan.  Refrigerate cheesecake, uncovered, 6 hours or overnight.  Allow cheesecake to stand at room temperature 15 minutes before serving.

For Vanilla Bavarian Cream Frosting:  Soften the gelatin in cold water and set aside for later use.

Beat the egg yolks in the top of a double boiler until light and lemon colored.  Gradually beat in the sugar.  Add the salt.  Scald the milk and gradually stir it into the egg mixture.  Cook over hot, not boiling, water until thickened, stirring constantly.

Blend in the softened gelatin and vanilla.  Chill until the mixture begins to thicken, stirring occasionally to prevent a crust from forming on the surface.  Fold in the whipped cream and spread cream mixture onto cheesecake.  Chill until firm.  Garnish with lightly sweetened whipped cream.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped pecans
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped almonds
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped walnuts
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped vanilla Wafers
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2          pound  cream cheese
  1 1/3            cup  sugar
  5              large  eggs
  16            ounces  sour cream
     1/4           cup  flour
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice

Crust:  Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.  Mix all nuts and vanilla wafer crumbs with melted butter and press in the buttered spring pan, trying to line the sides as much as possible about 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the pan, set aside.

Filling:  All ingredients should be at room temperature before your begin.  Beat the cream cheese until light and fluffy.  Keep the mixer on a low setting throughout the beating and mixing process.  Add the sugar a little at a time and continue beating until creamy.  Add one egg at a time and beat after each egg.  When eggs have been mixed into the cream cheese add flour, vanilla and lemon juice, mix well.  Add the sour cream last and beat well.

Pour cream cheese into the springform pan.  Place on the top rack in the middle of a 325 degree preheated oven for one hour and 15 minutes.  When time is up, prop open oven door and leave in oven for one hour.

After one hour, remove from oven.  Let cool enough before the cheesecake is put into the refrigerator for 24 hours.  A cheesecake should season.  The wait is worth it.  The flavor ripens and becomes enriched.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This cheesecake is based from the one that you can purchase from Sam's Wholesale Club.  You will find the nut crust quite unusual.

  24            ounces  cream cheese -- softened, and
                        cut into chunks
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2                     eggs

     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick)
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  4                     eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/2            cup  all-purpose flour
                        === CHOCOLATE GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
                        === GERMAN CHOCOLATE TOPPING ===
  2                     egg yolks
     2/3           cup  granulated sugar
     1/3           cup  butter -- cut small pieces
     2/3           cup  whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

                        Whipped cream -- (optional)

For Cheesecake:  In bowl of electric mixer or in food processor fitted with metal blade, blend together cream cheese, sugar, eggs, sour cream and vanilla extract until smooth.  Set aside.

For Chocolate Cake:  In large microwave safe bowl, combine chocolate and butter.  Microwave on HIGH (100%) power for 2 to 3 minutes, or until just melted.  Cool slightly.

With fork, beat in sugar, eggs and vanilla extract until smooth.  Add flour and mix until blended.  Spoon into well-greased 9 1/2-inch springform pan, spreading evenly.  Carefully, spread cheese mixture evenly over top of chocolate batter.  Bake in preheated 425 degree oven for 15 minutes.

Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue baking 55 to 60 minutes.  Turn oven off, open oven door and let cake cool completely to room temperature in oven.  Refrigerate until well chilled.

Remove sides from springform.  Invert cake onto serving plate, so cheesecake is on bottom and chocolate cake is on top.  Spread sides with Chocolate Glaze.  Spread top evenly with German Chocolate Topping.  Refrigerate until serving time.  Garnish with whipped cream, if desired.

For Chocolate Glaze:  In small microwave-safe bowl combine chocolate chips with whipping cream.  Microwave on HIGH power for 45 to 60 seconds.  Beat until smooth.  Spread on sides of cheesecake.

For German Chocolate Topping:  In small microwave-safe bowl, beat egg yolks.  Stir in sugar, butter and whipping cream.  Microwave on HIGH power 4 minutes, stirring every minute.  Remove from microwave and stir in vanilla extract.  Stir in coconut and pecans until well blended.  Refrigerate until mixture is of spreading consistency.  Spread on top of the cheesecake.

This recipe yields 1 (9 1/2-inch) cheesecake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  Oreo cookie crumbs
                        = (abt 23 finely-chopped Oreo cookies)
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2         pounds  cream cheese
  1                cup  sugar
  5              large  eggs
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4           cup  flour
  8             ounces  sour cream
  5                     Oreo cookies -- coarsely chopped
                        === TOPPING ===
  10                    Oreo cookies -- coarsely chopped
                        for the top of cheese cake

Crust:  Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.  Mix melted butter with Oreo crumbs and press into the pan covering the bottom and 1 1/2 inches up the sides with crumbs, set aside.

Filling:  All ingredients need to be at room temperature before beginning.  Beat cream cheese until light and fluffy.  Keep mixer on a low setting during the mixing and beating process.  Add sugar gradually and continue beating cream cheese until mixed through.  Add eggs one at a time and continue to beat until blended.

Measure the vanilla, salt and flour, pour into cream cheese and egg mixture and beat until smooth.  Add the sour cream and beat well.  Turn off the mixer and stir in the coarsely chopped Oreo cookies with a spoon.

Pour cream cheese into the spring pan and place the ten coarsely chopped Oreo cookies on top of the cream mixture.  Place pan on the top rack and in the middle of a preheated 325 degree oven and bake for one hour and 15 minutes.  When time is up prop the oven door open and let the cheese cake stay in the oven for one hour.

Remove from oven and let cool enough to place in the refrigerator for 24 hours.  It is worth the anticipation.  A cheese cake should season.  The flavor ripens and becomes enriched.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  margarine -- softened
     1/4           cup  masa harina
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  water
  2               cups  corn kernels (fresh or frozen) -- thawed, divided
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  milk -- plus
  1           teaspoon  milk

In a small mixing bowl, mix the margarine, masa and sugar using an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 1 minute.

In a blender container, blend half the corn kernels with the water until smooth.  Combine this mixture with the margarine mixture, stirring well.  Add the remaining corn kernels, corn meal, baking powder, salt and milk and mix well.  Pour the corn mixture into an 8-inch square baking pan.

Tightly cover with plastic wrap and steam by setting atop a medium saucepan of water on top of the stove.  The pan must be tightly wrapped at all times.  Bring water to a boil and steam corn mixture for 50 minutes to one hour (check to see whether you might need to add more water), until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Tomalito should have a smooth, moist texture.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

                        in the store, if not available can
                        substitute farmer cheese or feta cheese)
  6                     eggs
     1/4           cup  flour -- plus
  2               cups  flour -- for dredging
  8                     poblano chiles - (abt 5" long) -- roasted, peeled
                        Canola oil -- for frying
                        === RANCHERO SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     3/4           cup  chopped onion
  3               cups  chopped tomatoes
  2          teaspoons  tomato paste
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chipotle puree
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh oregano

Combine the 3 cheeses in bowl and refrigerate.

Separate the eggs into separate mixing bowls.  Beat the whites on high speed until soft peaks form; add the 1/4 cup flour and mix for 10 seconds.  Add the yolks and mix at medium speed for 10 seconds.  Using a large rubber spatula finish incorporating the yolks by folding them in.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to batter the rellenos.

Make a cut down the length of the chiles, gently open chiles and hold under cold running water to rinse away the seeds.  Pat dry with paper towels.  Gently press about 1/3 cup of the cheese mixture into an oval shaped ball and place inside one of the chiles.  Using a wooden toothpick "sew" the seam of the chile shut.  Repeat until all chiles are filled.

Place the flour on a plate.  Gently roll the stuffed chiles in the flour to coat.  Dip into egg mixture and coat completely.

Line another plate with paper towels.  Fill a heavy skillet with 3 to 4 inches of the oil and heat over high until oil sizzles when a pinch of flour is dropped in.  Add the stuffed chiles and fry one at a time.  When chiles are light golden brown, turn them to brown the other side.  Remove with tongs and transfer to paper towel lined plate to drain.

To serve:  Place 2 rellenos on each plate and remove the toothpicks and discard.  Spoon the Ranchero Sauce over the rellenos and sprinkle the cheese over.

For the Ranchero Sauce:  Heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic and onion and saute until soft.  Add the rest of the ingredients, increase the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil.  Once boiling, decrease the heat to low and simmer for ten minutes.  Remove from heat and let cool.  Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.  To use, heat slowly over low heat.  If necessary, thin with 1 tablespoon of chicken stock.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  6                     eggs
  3               cups  granulated sugar
  6        tablespoons  butter -- softened

  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  3          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  6 3/4           cups  flour
  4 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  4 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  3               cups  boiling water
  3               cups  chocolate chips -- divided
                        === CHOCOLATE GANACHE FROSTING ===
  1              pound  fine-quality semisweet chocolate -- such as Callebaut
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  light corn syrup
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Put eggs, sugar, butter, oil, cocoa powder, buttermilk and vanilla extract into a mixing bowl, mixing well after each addition.

Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt, and add to the wet ingredients.

Fold in the water.  Pour equally into 6 (8-inch) baking pans and add 1/2 cup chocolate chips into each pan.  Bake for 25 minutes.

Cool.  Wrap and place the cake rounds in the freezer.  Remove and ice the rounds with Chocolate Ganache Frosting.

For the Chocolate Ganache Frosting:  Finely chop chocolate.  In a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan bring cream, sugar, and corn syrup to a boil over moderately-low heat, whisking until sugar is dissolved.  Remove pan from heat and add chocolate, whisking until chocolate is melted.  Cut butter into pieces and add to frosting, whisking until smooth.

Transfer frosting to a bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, until spreadable (depending on chocolate used, it may be necessary to chill frosting to spreadable consistency).

Spread frosting between cake layers and over top and sides.

Cake keeps, covered and chilled, 3 days.  Bring cake to room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Put two medium skillets over medium heat.  In one add butter and scramble the eggs.  Salt to taste.  In the other brown the ham without separating the slices.  When ham is brown a bit on both sides remove.

Butter one side of bread and put in pan butter-side down to grill.  Immediately put Swiss cheese on unbuttered side of grilling bread.  Place heated ham on cheese.  Scoop eggs out of skillet with spatula and put on ham.  Place the American cheese on top of eggs.  Top off with remaining sourdough bread unbuttered-side to cheese.

Bread touching grill should be golden brown.  Flip over and grill other side for 2 mintues or until brown.  Cut diagonally in middle and serve.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

           Einstein Bros. Bagels' Eggs 4 Ways - Santa Fe Style

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast                       Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  turkey breakfast sausage
  3              large  eggs -- beaten (abt 2/3 cup)
  2                     bagels -- sliced in half
  2             slices  pepper jack singles
  2         tablespoon  Ortega medium salsa
                        === JALAPENO SALSA CREAM CHEESE ===
  8             ounces  cream cheese
     1/4           cup  Ortega medium salsa
  2        tablespoons  minced (canned) jalapeÒo slices
     1/8      teaspoon  chili powder

First make your JalapeÒo Salsa Cream Cheese by mixing all ingredients together in a small bowl.  Cover and chill cream cheese until it's needed.

Make the turkey sausage patties by forming sausage into two 3-ounce patties that are about 4 1/2 inches in diameter.  If you have time, form the patties on wax paper and freeze them to make handling easier.  They will shrink when cooking to just the right size.

Beat the eggs in a bowl, then measure half (about 1/3 cup) into a bowl with the same approximate diameter as the bagels.  Microwave each bowl (separately) for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes on high, or until the egg is completely cooked.

Lightly toast all of the bagel halves.  Spread about 2 teaspoons of the JalapeÒo Salsa Cream Cheese on the toasted face of the bottom half of the bagel.

When the eggs are cooked, arrange them on the cream cheese on each bagel bottom.  Lay a slice of pepper jack cheese on each of the egg layers.  Arrange a sausage patty on top of the cheese on each sandwich.

Spread about 2 teaspoons of salsa on the toasted face of each of the top bagel halves.  Top off the sandwiches with the top bagel halves, slice each sandwich in half and serve while hot.

This recipe yields 2 sandwiches.

Comments:  This way is by far the most creative of the 4 ways you can have your bagel breakfast sandwich at Einstein Bagels.  For the turkey breakfast sausage, Wampler makes a good version (it comes in a 1 pound tube and might be found in the freezer section).  You can also use small uncooked turkey breakfast links.  Just squeeze the sausage out of the casing and form your patties.  Toss out the casings.  You can also use regular pork sausage if you like.  A lower-fat version is best if you can find it.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  very warm water -- (110 to 115
                        degrees, not steaming)
     1/2    tablespoon  yeast
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup -- plus
  1           teaspoon  light corn syrup
  1         tablespoon  molasses -- plus
  1           teaspoon  molasses
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  bread flour -- plus about
     2/3           cup  bread flour -- to incorporate
                        while kneading
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar -- for water bath
                        cornmeal -- for dusting
  1         tablespoon  dry minced onion
  1         tablespoon  dry minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  poppy seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  caraway seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt

Combine the warm water and yeast in a medium bowl and stir until the yeast is dissolved.  Be sure the water is not too hot, or it may kill the yeast.

Add the corn syrup, molasses, and oil to the bowl and stir thoroughly.  Add the salt.  Pour the 2 cups of bread flour into the bowl and incorporate it with the other ingredients.

Sprinkle a little of the reserved flour over the dough in the bowl and turn it out onto a surface that has been dusted with more of the reserve flour (depending on your climate you may not have to use all of the reserve flour, but you will surely use most of it).  The dough should become very smooth and elastic, dry to the touch, and not tacky.  You will have to knead for 6 to 7 minutes to get the right consistency.

Put the dough back into the bowl or another container, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for 30 to 40 minutes.  The dough should double in size.

Punch down the dough and cut it into 4 even portions.  Working with one portion of the dough at a time, form the dough into a ball.  Turn the edge of the dough inward with your fingers while punching a hole in the center with your thumbs.  Work the dough in a circle while stretching it out and enlarging the center hole so that it looks like a doughnut.  The hole should be between 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Place the 4 portions of shaped dough onto a greased board or baking sheet, cover (a clean towel works well), and allow the dough to rise for 20 to 30 minutes.  The dough should nearly double in size.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Fill a medium saucepan 2/3 full of water and bring it to a boil.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar to the water.

Working with one bagel at a time, first enlarge the hole if it has closed up to less than 3/4 of an inch.  Be careful not to overwork the dough at this point or it won't have the proper consistency.  Drop the bagel into the water, cover the saucepan, and boil for 20 seconds.  Flip the bagel over, and boil for another 20 seconds.  Immediately take the bagel out of the water with a slotted spoon, let the water drip off for about 10 seconds, then place the bagel onto a baking sheet that has been dusted with cornmeal.  Repeat for the remaining bagels.  Be sure the bagels do not touch each other.

After the bagels have been arranged on the cornmeal-dusted baking sheet, and while they are still moist, sprinkle a scant teaspoon each of dry minced onion and dry minced garlic over the top of each bagel.  Combine the poppy seeds, caraway seeds, sesame seeds, and kosher salt in a small bowl.  Sprinkle 1/4 of the mixture over the top of each bagel.

Bake the bagels for 26 to 30 minutes, or until they are golden brown.

This recipe yields 4 bagels.

Combine the warm water and yeast in a medium bowl and stir until the yeast is dissolved.  Be sure the water is not too hot, or it may kill the yeast.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the corn syrup, molasses, and oil to the bowl and stir thoroughly.  Add the salt.  Pour the 2 cups of bread flour into the bowl and incorporate it with the other ingredients.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sprinkle a little of the reserved flour over the dough in the bowl and turn it out onto a surface that has been dusted with more of the reserve flour (depending on your climate you may not have to use all of the reserve flour, but you will surely use most of it).  The dough should become very smooth and elastic, dry to the touch, and not tacky.  You will have to knead for 6 to 7 minutes to get the right consistency.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the dough back into the bowl or another container, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for 30 to 40 minutes.  The dough should double in size.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Punch down the dough and cut it into 4 even portions.  Working with one portion of the dough at a time, form the dough into a ball.  Turn the edge of the dough inward with your fingers while punching a hole in the center with your thumbs.  Work the dough in a circle while stretching it out and enlarging the center hole so that it looks like a doughnut.  The hole should be between 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Place the 4 portions of shaped dough onto a greased board or baking sheet, cover (a clean towel works well), and allow the dough to rise for 20 to 30 minutes.  The dough should nearly double in size.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Fill a medium saucepan 2/3 full of water and bring it to a boil.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar to the water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Working with one bagel at a time, first enlarge the hole if it has closed up to less than 3/4 of an inch.  Be careful not to overwork the dough at this point or it won&apos;t have the proper consistency.  Drop the bagel into the water, cover the saucepan, and boil for 20 seconds.  Flip the bagel over, and boil for another 20 seconds.  Immediately take the bagel out of the water with a slotted spoon, let the water drip off for about 10 seconds, then place the bagel onto a baking sheet that has been dusted with cornmeal.  Repeat for the remaining bagels.  Be sure the bagels do not touch each other.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the bagels for 26 to 30 minutes, or until they are light brown.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 bagels.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SECRET MOPPIN' SAUCE ===
  3            bottles  Famous Dave's BBQ sauce - (20 oz ea)
  2             quarts  water
  1                cup  beef stock base
     1/4           cup  Kahl˙a
  2        tablespoons  yellow mustard
  2        tablespoons  blackstrap molasses
  1         tablespoon  liquid smoke
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame seed oil
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2             sticks  butter
                        === RIB RUB ===
  2               cups  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  kosher salt
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  garlic seasoning
     1/4           cup  chili powder
     1/4           cup  lemon pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  onion salt
     1/4           cup  celery salt
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  whole celery seeds
  1           teaspoon  crushed cloves
  1         tablespoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2           cup  Mrs. Dash original blend
     1/4           cup  salt
                        === BEEF ===
  1              whole  brisket
  1         tablespoon  fresh minced garlic
     1/2           cup  Rib Rub -- (see above)

Secret Moppin' Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in stockpot and mix well.  Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  (Makes 1 gallon)

Rib Rub:  Mix together all rub ingredients.  Store in airtight container.  (Makes 6 cups)

Beef:  Ask butcher to remove most of the fat from a whole brisket, leaving only 1/4 inch to help preserve the juiciness during the cooking process.  Have butcher separate brisket into two muscles, the flat and the point.  Hand rub each brisket with garlic and Rib Rub.  Start the smoking process!  Smoke briskets for a minimum of 8 hours, keeping the temperature from 180 to 200 degrees.

After 4 hours, start mopping with sauce every hour.  After 8 hours, briskets should be almost black.  This blend of smoke, rib rub and sauce forms a crunchy exterior called "bark."  To ensure brisket turns out tasty and tender, wrap each brisket in a double layer of aluminum foil and pour 2 cups of Moppin' Sauce over brisket.  Seal foil tightly and return to grill at 200 degrees for 3 hours.

Remove briskets from aluminum foil and cool down.  Once cool, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Next day, re-smoke over indirect heat at 225 to 235 degrees for 2 to 3 hours or until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees.

Let stand for 15 minutes before slicing.  Slice just before serving to preserve juiciness.  Save the "burnt ends" for yourself, they're the best part!

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

     1/4           cup  salt
                        === RIBS ===
  2                     racks sparerib racks - (4 to 5 lbs ea)
     1/2           cup  Italian salad dressing
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  dried minced onion
  1                cup  Rib Rub -- (see above)
  1             bottle  Famous Dave's BBQ sauce - (20 oz)

Rib Rub:  Mix all rub ingredients.  Store in airtight container.  (Makes 6 cups)

Ribs:  Night before smoking, trim ribs of fat.  Place in large plastic bag and pour in Italian dressing to coat.  Remove and wipe dressing off.  Sprinkle each rib with pepper and then 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup onion flakes.  Wrap each rib in plastic and refrigerate overnight.

The next morning remove from wrap and wipe off ribs.  Coat front and back with Rib Rub and rub into meat.  Using a chimney charcoal starter get 15 briquettes red hot.  Place coals on end of grill and 1 pound of green hickory around coals.  Use water-soaked hickory chunks if you can't get fresh cut hickory.  Keep internal temperatures of grill at 200 to 255 degrees.  Add more charcoal and hickory chunks every hour as needed.  Place ribs bone-side down but not directly over hot coals.

After 3 hours, remove ribs from grill and wrap in aluminum foil.  Hold in covered grill at 180 to 200 degrees for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until fork tender.  Build hot bed of coals over entire bottom of grill.  Place ribs on grill to add char flavor.  When meat becomes bubbly it is done.  Slather with BBQ sauce.  Let heat caramelize sauce (secret to tender smoky ribs).

This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings

Rib Rub:  Mix all rub ingredients.  Store in airtight container.  (Makes 6 cups)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Ribs:  Night before smoking, trim ribs of fat.  Place in large plastic bag and pour in Italian dressing to coat.  Remove and wipe dressing off.  Sprinkle each rib with pepper and then 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup onion flakes.  Wrap each rib in plastic and refrigerate overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The next morning remove from wrap and wipe off ribs.  Coat front and back with Rib Rub and rub into meat.  Using a chimney charcoal starter get 15 briquettes red hot.  Place coals on end of grill and 1 pound of green hickory around coals.  Use water-soaked hickory chunks if you can&apos;t get fresh cut hickory.  Keep internal temperatures of grill at 200 to 255 degrees.  Add more charcoal and hickory chunks every hour as needed.  Place ribs bone-side down but not directly over hot coals.
</DirT>
<DirT>
After 3 hours, remove ribs from grill and wrap in aluminum foil.  Hold in covered grill at 180 to 200 degrees for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until fork tender.  Build hot bed of coals over entire bottom of grill.  Place ribs on grill to add char flavor.  When meat becomes bubbly it is done.  Slather with BBQ sauce.  Let heat caramelize sauce (secret to tender smoky ribs).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  Baby back ribs
                        === WATERMELON BBQ SAUCE ===
                        Watermelon rind from 1/2 small watermelon
  1                cup  dark corn syrup
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  tomato catsup
     1/4           cup  distilled white vinegar
     3/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  liquid smoke
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To prepare the watermelon rind, cut off the green skin and about 1/2 inch of the hard white part of the rind, keeping the part that is lighter red to white.  This is the tender part of the rind.  (Avoid using the harder, white rind that is just inside the green skin.)

Cut the trimmed rind into chunks or pieces, and purÈe in a blender or food processor for about 10 seconds only.  Strain the liquid from the pulp, and measure 1 cup of strained pulp.

In a saucepan, combine the 1 cup of strained pulp with all of the remaining ingredients, and bring this mixture to a boil over high heat.  Immediately reduce heat and simmer, covered, for about 1 hour or until the sauce has reached desired thickness.

To make the famous ribs:  Marinate 4 pounds of baby back ribs for two hours minimum -- or overnight -- in 1 recipe for Watermelon Barbecue Sauce, reserving some sauce (marinade) for basting at grilling time.

Bake the marinated ribs, wrapped in foil (seam-side up so the package won't leak in the oven), at 300 degrees for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until ribs are very tender and the rib meat begins to pull back (about 1/2 inch) from the cut ends of the bone.

Remove ribs from foil and place on grill, brushing with reserved marinade -- about 2 to 4 minutes per side.  Finished ribs should be slightly charred, but not burned.

Serve with leftover sauce on the side.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  1              large  garlic clove
                        = (or granulated garlic, to taste)
  1 1/2         pounds  potatoes -- peeled
  1                     large can creamed corn
  1                can  Ro-tel tomatoes - (10 oz) -- crushed

                     KFC's Mashed Potatoes And Gravy

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRAVY ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  4 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                can  Campbell's chicken broth -- plus
  1                can  water
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  MSG
                        = (or Accent Flavor Enhancer)
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === MASHED POTATOES ===
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/3           cup  milk
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  instant mashed potato flakes -- (Potato Buds)

First make a roux by combining the oil with 1 1/2 tablespoons of flour in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Heat the mixture for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring often, until it is a chocolate color.

Remove the roux from the heat, add the remaining ingredients to the saucepan, and stir.

Put the saucepan back over the heat, turn it up to medium, and bring the gravy to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until thick.  (Makes about 3 cups)

As the gravy is reducing, prepare the potatoes by combining 1 1/2 cups of water, 1/3 cup of milk, butter, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Bring to a boil, then remove the pan from heat.  Add the potato flakes, and whip with a fork until fluffy.

Serve the mashed potatoes, with gravy poured over the top. As if you didn't know.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Comments:  This gravy recipe should come very close to that tasty tan stuff that's poured over fluffy mashed potatoes at the Colonel's chain of restaurants.  And since the original recipe contains MSG (as does their chicken), this clone was designed with that "secret" ingredient.  You may choose to leave out the MSG, which is a natural amino acid found in vegetables and seaweed.  But your clone won't taste exactly like the real thing without it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  3             ounces  fresh basil
     1/2           cup  pine nuts
  2              small  garlic cloves
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  grated Romano cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === PASTA ===
  1              pound  linguine pasta
                        === OPTIONAL ===
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cut small pieces

Combine the basil, pine nuts, olive oil and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped.  Transfer to a bowl and mix in the cheeses and black pepper.  (This sauce does not call for salt because of the saltiness of the cheeses used.)

In a large pot, bring 5 quarts of water to a boil.  Add about 1 tablespoon of salt.  Add the pasta and stir frequently until al dente (about one or two minutes less than the cooking time recommended on the package).  Drain the pasta, reserving 3 ounces of the cooking water.

Place the pasta, pesto sauce, water, and butter in a large bowl and toss until all ingredients are well mixed.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Remember, pesto can be applied to any shape of pasta you like, and it's also excellent in many soups.  In fact, the possibilities for using pesto are endless!

  1 1/2         pounds  ricotta cheese
  4             ounces  shredded Parmesan cheese
     3/4         pound  shredded mozzerella cheese
     1/8           cup  panko bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil

     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === TO MAKE THE LASAGNE ===
  5                     pasta sheets - (9" by 7") -- cooked
  5               cups  prepared tempura batter
  2 1/2           cups  panko bread crumbs
  1                     egg -- beaten with
     1/4           cup  water -- for egg wash
                        Bolognese Mixture -- (see above)

  40            ounces  four-cheese sauce

Bolognese Mixture:  Saute onions, peppers, garlic in olive oil, add meats and brown ensuring all meat is broken up finely.  Drain off all grease.  Add tomato puree, tomato sauce, black pepper and salt.  Simmer 10 minutes; add parmesan cheese and simmer 10 minutes longer.  Cool mixture in refrigerator at least 2 hours.  After cooling add in panko bread crumbs (just enough to bind), a pinch of salt, Italian seasoning and black pepper.  Refrigerate 1/2 hour.

LA Cheese Stuffing:  Mix all ingredients together until well combined and refrigerate.

To Make the LA Lasagne:  Layout pasta sheets and scoop 4 ounces of Bolognese Mixture onto pasta sheets spreading evenly leaving a 1-inch lip on top, then spread the Cheese Mixture on top of the meat mixture in the same manner.  Brush the top edge of pasta sheet with egg wash and tightly roll lasagne up and seal.  Refrigerate until cold.

Take roll and dip in tempura batter and then roll in the bread crumbs until completely coated.  Dip each end back into the batter and seal with more bread crumbs.  Fry in hot oil at 350 degrees for approximately 8 minutes.

Carefully remove from oil and place on a cutting board.  Slice off both ends of roll and discard.  Cut the roll in half and cut each piece on the bias.

Ladle 2 ounces of marinara sauce in the bottom of a large soup bowl.  Place lasagne pieces in center of bowl.  Top with 8 ounces of four-cheese sauce and garnish with fresh basil.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  baking potatoes
  3               cups  BÈchamel Sauce -- (see below)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     3/4           cup  grated mozzarella cheese
     1/4           cup  grated Colby cheese
                        === BECHAMEL SAUCE ===
  1              quart  half-and-half
  2             ounces  flour
  2             ounces  clarified butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Bake potatoes in preheated oven at 400 degrees until completely cooked.  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature, then slice into half-inch thick rounds.

Mix together the BÈchamel Sauce, salt and white pepper.  Add remaining ingredients.  Fold in potatoes.  Place mixture in covered baking dish, in an oven, at 300 degrees for one hour or until potatoes are hot all the way through.  Remove the cover and allow potatoes to brown.

For the BÈchamel Sauce:  In a saucepan, combine the flour and butter.  Cook over a low flame for about 15 minutes until the mixture begins to bubble.  Stir frequently so the roux does not color.  Gradually add the half-and-half, stirring out the lumps as it thickens.  After the entire amount of half-and-half has been added, cook for 45 minutes over a low flame, stirring occasionally to keep the mixture from sticking to the pan.  Season to taste.  Cool in an ice bath.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Bake potatoes in preheated oven at 400 degrees until completely cooked.  Cool for 30 minutes at room temperature, then slice into half-inch thick rounds.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix together the BÈchamel Sauce, salt and white pepper.  Add remaining ingredients.  Fold in potatoes.  Place mixture in covered baking dish, in an oven, at 300 degrees for one hour or until potatoes are hot all the way through.  Remove the cover and allow potatoes to brown.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the BÈchamel Sauce:  In a saucepan, combine the flour and butter.  Cook over a low flame for about 15 minutes until the mixture begins to bubble.  Stir frequently so the roux does not color.  Gradually add the half-and-half, stirring out the lumps as it thickens.  After the entire amount of half-and-half has been added, cook for 45 minutes over a low flame, stirring occasionally to keep the mixture from sticking to the pan.  Season to taste.  Cool in an ice bath.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  butter or margarine
     3/4         pound  milk chocolate (bars)
  6                     eggs
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1                cup  toasted almond pieces -- plus
     1/4           cup  toasted almond pieces -- for garnish
  12            ounces  Famous chocolate wafers
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine
     1/2        gallon  coffee ice cream

In saucepan over low heat, melt margarine or butter, then stir in chocolate.  (This will greatly reduce the chance of scorching the chocolate.  Mixture may look separated but it will come together after cooking with egg yolks.)

Separate eggs, reserving yolks in mixing bowl and retaining whites in separate container.  Whip yolks on medium-high speed until they turn pale yellow.  Slightly warm egg yolks by slowing adding 1 to 1 1/2 cups of chocolate-margarine mixture while mixer is running on medium-high speed.

Return this mixture to remaining chocolate/margarine mixture, stirring constantly with rubber spatula as it cooks over low heat until mixture thickens, about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and immediately pour into large mixing bowl to speed up cooling.  Add powdered sugar, vanilla and almonds; mix well with wire whisk.  Allow to cool to room temperature.

Place chocolate wafers in plastic bag and roll into fine crumbs using rolling pin.  Pour into separate bowl and add melted butter.  Mix thoroughly with wire whisk, until moist and crumbly.  Reserve 1 cup of crumb mixture for final step.

Spread remaining crumb mixture in even layer across bottom of 13-by-9-inch baking pan, gently pressing down.  (If crumb mixture is not pressed, it will fall apart during cutting.)  Set aside.

Whip egg whites in clean and chilled bowl until whites are stuff but not dry, just holding a soft peak.  Using rubber spatula, gently fold all egg whites at once into chocolate/margarine mixture.  Be sure to mix almonds thoroughly since they tend to sink to bottom of mixture.

Spread half of chocolate filling, about 1 quart, evenly over bottom crust.  Add overflowing scoops of coffee ice cream on top of chocolate filling.  Place 4 scoops across by 6 scoops down.  Work quickly to prevent ice cream from overly melting.

Pour remaining chocolate filling over ice cream.  Smooth top with rubber spatula.  Surface will be slightly bumpy.  Sprinkle reserved crumb mixture evenly over top of pie.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Place in freezer on flat surface to ensure even freezing, at least 8 hours.

To cut, dip chef's knife into hot water and pull knife through the pie.  Redip in hot water after each cut.  To serve, top each piece with hot fudge sauce and garnish with toasted almond slices.

This recipe yields ?? servings.
