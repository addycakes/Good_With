  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  whole almonds -- toasted
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  powdered sugar
  1              large  egg
                        === FILLING ===
  2             ounces  crumbled almond paste
                        = (abt 3 packed tbspns)
  6        tablespoons  sugar -- divided
  3 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1              large  egg
  3        tablespoons  cake flour
  9             medium  apricots - (abt 22 oz) -- pitted, quartered
  20                    cherries -- pitted, halved

For Crust:  Blend first 3 ingredients in processor until almonds are finely ground.  Using electric mixer, beat butter and powdered sugar in medium bowl until blended.  Beat in egg.  Add flour mixture; beat until blended.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into square.  Wrap in plastic; refrigerate 1 hour.

Roll out dough on floured surface to 10-inch square.  Transfer to 9-inch square tart pan with removable bottom; press crust over bottom and up sides of pan.  Trim any excess dough.  Pierce crust all over with fork; chill at least 2 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; keep chilled.)

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Using electric mixer, beat almond paste and 4 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl until fine meal forms, about 3 minutes.  Add butter; beat until almost smooth.  Add egg; beat until smooth.  Beat in flour.  Spread filling evenly in unbaked crust.  Arrange apricot quarters on sides with rounded side up in rows atop filling.  Place cherry halves between apricots.  Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons sugar over fruit.

Bake tart 30 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees.  Bake until crust is golden and filling is puffed and golden, about 30 minutes longer.  Cool tart in pan on rack at least 1 hour.  Serve tart warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  For a shiny finish, brush the warm tart with melted apricot preserves.

  12            ounces  linguine
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  4              large  portobello mushrooms - (5" dia) -- stemmed, dark
                        gills removed, caps sliced 1/4" thick

  2               cups  grated Asiago cheese -- divided
  2               cups  chopped fresh basil -- divided

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid.

Heat oil in same pot over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms; sautÃˆ until tender and brown, about 6 minutes.  Add salami; toss 30 seconds.

Fresh raspberries flavor the dressing and give this light salad its sweet tang; the pine nuts add crunch.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POLENTA ===
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
     1/4           cup  minced green onions
  3               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  polenta (coarse cornmeal)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme
                        === BAKED EGGS ===
  20                    thick slices applewood-smoked bacon
  6             ounces  extra-sharp white cheddar cheese -- grated
  6             ounces  GruyÃ‹re cheese -- grated
  8              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme

For Polenta:  Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add green onions and stir until wilted, about 1 minute.  Add 3 cups water and salt; bring to boil.  Gradually whisk in polenta.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer until thick and creamy, stirring occasionally, about 13 minutes.  Stir in cheese and thyme.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cool to lukewarm.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate; polenta will become firm.)

For Baked Eggs:  Heat large skillet over medium heat.  Add bacon; fry until beginning to brown but still pliable, about 4 minutes.  Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.  Cool slightly.  Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon drippings for Spring Greens With Sherry Vinaigrette (see recipe).

Line sides of eight 1 1/4-cup custard cups with 2 slices bacon each, forming collar.  Place 1/2 slice bacon on bottom of each cup.  Divide polenta among cups, about generous 1/3 cup each.  Press polenta over bottom and up sides of bacon.  Mix cheeses in bowl.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup cheese mixture over polenta in each cup.  (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Crack 1 egg into center of each cup.  Sprinkle eggs with remaining cheese, green onions, thyme, and black pepper.  Transfer cups to rimmed baking sheet.  Bake until egg whites are almost set, about 20 minutes.  Let eggs stand at room temperature 5 minutes (eggs will continue to cook).

Run small sharp knife around edge of cups; tilt cups and slide bacon, polenta, and egg onto plates and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Make the polenta a couple of days ahead, then assemble each serving an hour or so before guests arrive.

For Polenta:  Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add green onions and stir until wilted, about 1 minute.  Add 3 cups water and salt; bring to boil.  Gradually whisk in polenta.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer until thick and creamy, stirring occasionally, about 13 minutes.  Stir in cheese and thyme.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cool to lukewarm.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate; polenta will become firm.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Baked Eggs:  Heat large skillet over medium heat.  Add bacon; fry until beginning to brown but still pliable, about 4 minutes.  Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.  Cool slightly.  Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon drippings for Spring Greens With Sherry Vinaigrette (see recipe).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line sides of eight 1 1/4-cup custard cups with 2 slices bacon each, forming collar.  Place 1/2 slice bacon on bottom of each cup.  Divide polenta among cups, about generous 1/3 cup each.  Press polenta over bottom and up sides of bacon.  Mix cheeses in bowl.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup cheese mixture over polenta in each cup.  (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Crack 1 egg into center of each cup.  Sprinkle eggs with remaining cheese, green onions, thyme, and black pepper.  Transfer cups to rimmed baking sheet.  Bake until egg whites are almost set, about 20 minutes.  Let eggs stand at room temperature 5 minutes (eggs will continue to cook).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Run small sharp knife around edge of cups; tilt cups and slide bacon, polenta, and egg onto plates and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Make the polenta a couple of days ahead, then assemble each serving an hour or so before guests arrive.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4          teaspoons  chili powder
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2                     slabs baby back pork ribs - (abt 2 lbs)
  2 1/2           cups  fresh blackberries or frozen -- thawed

     1/2           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2          teaspoons  hot pepper sauce

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Mix chili powder, garlic, and salt in small bowl; rub mixture into ribs.  Place ribs on large rimmed baking sheet, meaty-side up.  Bake ribs 50 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (not unsweetened)
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  instant espresso powder
  3               cups  sugar
  1                can  fat-free evaporated milk - (12 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  walnut pieces -- toasted
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract

Line 13- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan with foil, leaving overhang.  Combine first 4 ingredients in large bowl.

Stir sugar and evaporated milk in heavy large deep saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves and mixture comes to boil.  Attach clip-on candy thermometer to side of pan.  Boil until temperature registers 234 degrees, stirring constantly and adjusting heat to avoid boiling over, about 10 minutes.  Immediately pour milk mixture over chocolate mixture.  Whisk until chocolate and butter melt and fudge is smooth.  Mix in nuts and vanilla.

Spread fudge evenly in prepared pan.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold and set, about 3 hours.  Using foil as aid, lift fudge from pan.  Cut crosswise into 7 strips, then lengthwise into 5 strips.  Return to pan, cover, and chill.  (Can be made 2 weeks ahead.  Keep covered and chilled.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields 35 pieces.

Comments:  Espresso powder makes this creamy fudge taste more intensely chocolaty.  Any nuts you prefer (such as pecans or macadamia nuts) can stand in for the walnuts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CUPCAKES ===
  3 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
     1/4           cup  canola oil
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  buttermilk or low-fat yogurt
  1                cup  whole milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  1 1/4           cups  fresh blueberries -- frozen for 4 hours
                        === FROSTING ===
  2 1/4           cups  powdered sugar
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  maple sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  maple sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  4          teaspoons  whole milk - (or more)
  1                cup  chilled fresh blueberries
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line two 12-cup muffin pans with paper liners.

Sift flour and next 4 ingredients into large bowl.  Whisk melted butter and oil in medium bowl.  Add eggs; whisk to blend.  Whisk in buttermilk, milk, vanilla extract, and peel.  Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients; whisk just to blend.  Stir in frozen blueberries.  Divide batter among liners.

Bake cupcakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 23 minutes.  Transfer cupcakes to racks; cool.

For Frosting:  Combine first 5 ingredients in medium bowl.  Add 4 teaspoons milk.  Using electric mixer, beat until well blended and fluffy, adding more milk by teaspoonfuls if dry (small granules of maple sugar will still remain), about 4 minutes.  Spread frosting over top of cupcakes.

Garnish cupcakes with chilled berries, and mint sprigs, if desired.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 24 cupcakes.

Comments:  Freezing the berries before adding them to the batter prevents them from sinking to the bottom and from discoloring the cupcakes.

Maple sugar can be found at some supermarkets and natural foods stores.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line two 12-cup muffin pans with paper liners.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sift flour and next 4 ingredients into large bowl.  Whisk melted butter and oil in medium bowl.  Add eggs; whisk to blend.  Whisk in buttermilk, milk, vanilla extract, and peel.  Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients; whisk just to blend.  Stir in frozen blueberries.  Divide batter among liners.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake cupcakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 23 minutes.  Transfer cupcakes to racks; cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Frosting:  Combine first 5 ingredients in medium bowl.  Add 4 teaspoons milk.  Using electric mixer, beat until well blended and fluffy, adding more milk by teaspoonfuls if dry (small granules of maple sugar will still remain), about 4 minutes.  Spread frosting over top of cupcakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Garnish cupcakes with chilled berries, and mint sprigs, if desired.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 24 cupcakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Freezing the berries before adding them to the batter prevents them from sinking to the bottom and from discoloring the cupcakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Maple sugar can be found at some supermarkets and natural foods stores.

Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped chives
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1                     fresh or 2 dried Turkish bay leaves
  1              pound  broccoli -- stems and crowns
                        cut into 1" pieces - (abt 6 cups)
  4               cups  low-salt chicken broth

Puree 1/4 cup oil, chives, and cayenne in blender. Season with salt.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion and bay leaves; cook until onion is golden, stirring often, about 7 minutes.  Add broccoli; stir until bright green, about 1 minute.  Add broth.  Simmer until broccoli is tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove bay leaves.  Cool soup slightly.

Working in batches, puree soup in blender until smooth, about 1 minute per batch.  Return soup to pot.  Rewarm until hot.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Recipe Remix:  Any remaining chive-cayenne oil is delicious drizzled over mashed potatoes.  It can also be used as a topping for steamed fish or a dipping oil for crusty bread.

Comments:  This low-fat soup is rich in calcium and antioxidants.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  raw unsalted pistachios
  2               cups  fresh cilantro leaves - (packed)
  4          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice -- divided
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  ground cardamom
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- plus
  5        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  4              large  chicken breast halves with
                        skin and ribs attached

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Toast pistachios on baking sheet until golden, about 7 minutes.  Transfer to processor.  Maintain oven temperature.  Add cilantro leaves, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, garlic, cardamom, and 3/4 teaspoon salt to processor.  Using on/off turns, process until coarse paste forms.  With machine running, gradually add 1/2 cup olive oil.  Season with pepper.

Using fingers, gently loosen skin from 1 side of each chicken breast, forming pocket.  Spread 1 tablespoon pesto evenly under skin of each.  Sprinkle chicken generously with salt and pepper.

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chicken, skin-side down.  Cook until skin is dark golden, about 5 minutes.  Turn chicken over and transfer skillet to oven.  Roast chicken until cooked through, about 25 minutes.

Place 1/2 cup remaining pesto into small bowl.  Whisk in remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and remaining 1 teaspoon lemon juice.  Drizzle pesto sauce over chicken breasts and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Stir any remaining pesto into steamed vegetables or couscous.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Toast pistachios on baking sheet until golden, about 7 minutes.  Transfer to processor.  Maintain oven temperature.  Add cilantro leaves, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, garlic, cardamom, and 3/4 teaspoon salt to processor.  Using on/off turns, process until coarse paste forms.  With machine running, gradually add 1/2 cup olive oil.  Season with pepper.

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chicken, skin-side down.  Cook until skin is dark golden, about 5 minutes.  Turn chicken over and transfer skillet to oven.  Roast chicken until cooked through, about 25 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1/2 cup remaining pesto into small bowl.  Whisk in remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and remaining 1 teaspoon lemon juice.  Drizzle pesto sauce over chicken breasts and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  plum tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
                        = (a scant 4 cups)
  8             ounces  crimini (baby bella) mushrooms
  1              large  red onion -- thinly sliced
                        = (abt 3 cups)
  5        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  Sherry wine vinegar
  1                     chicken - (4 1/2 to 4 3/4 lbs) -- cut 8 pieces,
                        and excess fat trimmed
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary -- divided
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                cup  low-salt chicken broth
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced basil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  drained capers -- divided
  12            ounces  gemelli or penne -- freshly cooked

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine plum tomatoes, mushrooms, and onion in large bowl.  Add 3 tablespoons oil and vinegar; toss to blend.  Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  Spread vegetable mixture in single layer on large rimmed baking sheet.  Roast until onion slices are golden brown and all vegetables are tender, stirring frequently, about 50 minutes.  Remove from oven and set aside.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Sprinkle chicken with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon rosemary.  Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large deep ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chicken and sautÃˆ until golden brown, about 6 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to bowl.

Add wine to skillet and boil until wine is reduced by half, scraping up browned bits, about 1 minute.  Stir in canned tomatoes with juice, then broth and bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer 10 minutes to blend flavors.

Return chicken to sauce in skillet.  Place skillet in oven and roast uncovered until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear when pierced with knife, about 25 minutes.  Remove skillet from oven.  Stir in roasted vegetables, remaining 1/2 tablespoon rosemary, half of basil, and half of capers.  Simmer over medium heat until vegetables are heated through.  Season with salt and pepper.

Place pasta in large shallow bowl.  Top with chicken and sauce.  Sprinkle remaining basil and capers over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The classic dish is updated by adding oven-roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, and onions to deepen the flavors.

What to drink:  A soft, fruity Sangiovese.

Comments:  Joy Ackerman of Cincinnati, Ohio, writes: "After cooking for a family of six for years, I've become a pro at streamlining recipes and being organized in the kitchen.  My children are now grown and out of the house, but that hasn't changed how I cook or shop.

Unpeeled red-skinned potatoes give this rich, garlicky side its great texture.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dried tart cherries
     1/2           cup  orange juice
  1            package  amaretti cookies - (5.5 oz)*
     1/4           cup  almonds -- toasted
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1 1/2          pints  chocolate ice cream -- softened
  1                     imported milk chocolate - (3 oz) -- chopped
  1 1/2          pints  raspberry sorbet -- softened
  1 1/2          pints  pistachio ice cream -- softened
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
                        Chocolate curls
                        = (or additional amaretti cookies)
                        Hot Fudge Sauce -- (see recipe)

* Light, airy Italian almond macaroons that are available at some supermarkets and Italian markets.

Boil dried tart cherries and orange juice in heavy small saucepan until all liquid is absorbed, stirring often, about 8 minutes.  Remove pan from heat; cool completely.

Line 9- by 9- by 2-inch metal baking pan with foil, extending over sides of pan.  Finely grind cookies and almonds in processor; add butter and process until moist crumbs form.  Press crumbs onto bottom of foil-lined pan.  Place in freezer.

Mix chocolate ice cream, chopped chocolate, and cherry mixture in medium bowl.  Spoon over crust; smooth top.  Freeze 30 minutes.  Top with raspberry sorbet; smooth top.  Freeze 30 minutes.  Mix pistachio ice cream and orange peel in another medium bowl.  Spoon over sorbet; smooth top (ice cream will come all the way up to top of pan).  Cover and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours or overnight.

Using foil as aid, lift ice cream cake from pan; peel off foil.  Use spatula dipped into hot water to smooth sides of cake.  Transfer cake to platter.  Garnish top of cake with chocolate curls or amaretti cookies dipped halfway into room-temperature Hot Fudge Sauce.  Cut cake into squares. Serve with Hot Fudge Sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Test-kitchen tip:  Soften the ice cream and sorbet in the microwave on high in two to three 10-second intervals until just soft enough to spread.

Comments:  Inspired by Neapolitan ice cream, this pretty dessert layers cherry-studded chocolate ice cream with pistachio ice cream and raspberry sorbet.  The press-in, no-bake crust is made with Italian amaretti cookies.

For cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter three 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line bottoms with parchment paper.  Sift first 4 ingredients into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat butter and peanut butter in large bowl until blended.  Beat in sugar.  Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, then vanilla.  At low speed, beat in flour mixture in 4 additions alternately with buttermilk in 3 additions.

Divide batter among pans and spread evenly.  Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Cool cakes 5 minutes.  Turn out onto racks; peel off parchment.  Cool cakes completely.

For frosting:  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, 1 1/4 cups powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla in large bowl to blend.  Whisk whipping cream and 3/4 cup powdered sugar in bowl until mixture holds medium-firm peaks.  Fold into cream cheese mixture in 3 additions; chill until firm but spreadable, about 1 hour.

Place 1 cake layer, bottom-side up, on 9-inch tart pan bottom.  Spread with half of filling.  Place another layer, bottom-side up, on work surface.  Spread with remaining filling; place atop first layer.  Top with remaining cake layer, bottom-side up.

Spread frosting over top and sides of cake.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome; chill.  Let stand at room temperature 2 hours before continuing.)  Press candy and peanuts onto top of cake.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  2        tablespoons  coriander seeds
  2        tablespoons  whole peppercorns
  3        tablespoons  fresh thyme -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  fresh rosemary -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  coarse kosher salt -- plus
  1           teaspoon  coarse kosher salt

Toast coriander seeds in a heavy small skillet over medium heat until aromatic, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to a mortar or spice mill.  Add peppercorns and crush until broken into coarse pieces.  Mix crushed spices in a small bowl with thyme, rosemary, and salt.  Store in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Homemade rubs are a quick way to transform roasted meat, poultry, and vegetables into something special.  Use this one on both steak and potatoes.

Improv:  Fennel, cumin, or caraway seeds can replace the coriander; intense, earthy herbs like oregano and sage can stand in for the thyme and rosemary.

Picadillo is a traditional dish in many Latin American countries; it's made with ground meat, tomatoes, and regional ingredients.  The Cuban version includes olives and is usually served with black beans and rice.

Comments:  Eli Gorelick of West Orange, New Jersey, writes: &quot;As a kid growing up in Cuba, I worked alongside my mother every day in the kitchen, learning how to make specialties like picadillo and fried bananas.  I still think Havana has the best Cuban food in the world, and I continue to love the recipes I learned during my childhood.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
Picadillo is a traditional dish in many Latin American countries; it&apos;s made with ground meat, tomatoes, and regional ingredients.  The Cuban version includes olives and is usually served with black beans and rice.

                Farro Salad With Peas, Asparagus, And Feta

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  semi-pearled farro
  12            ounces  asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" lengths
  1            package  sugar snap peas - (8 oz)
  12            ounces  grape tomatoes -- halved
     1/2           cup  chopped red onion
  6        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  Sherry wine vinegar
  1            package  feta cheese - (7 oz) -- crumbled

Cook farro in large saucepan of boiling salted water until just tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain.  Transfer to large bowl.

Meanwhile, cook asparagus and sugar snap peas in another saucepan of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain.  Add to farro with tomatoes, onion, and dill.  Whisk oil and vinegar in small bowl.  Season dressing with salt and pepper.  Add dressing and feta to salad; toss to coat and serve.

This recipe yields 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  This healthful vegetarian dish would be perfect for a picnic.  To speed prep time, use trimmed sugar snap peas with the strings removed (find them in the produce section of many supermarkets).

Market Tip:  Farro is an ancient Tuscan grain with a mellow, nutty flavor.  You'll find it in some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Italian markets.

  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     2/3           cup  chilled whipping cream

                        Fresh mint sprigs

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, 1/4 cup powdered sugar, and vanilla in medium bowl until fluffy.  Using same beaters, beat whipping cream in another medium bowl until peaks form.  Fold whipped cream into cream cheese mixture in 3 additions.  Cover mousse and refrigerate.

Roll out pastry sheet on lightly floured surface to 14- by 10 1/2-inch rectangle.  Cut sheet into twelve 3 1/2-inch squares.  Pierce squares all over with fork.  Sift 1/4 cup powdered sugar over squares.  Place squares on ungreased baking sheet.  Bake 12 minutes.  Using metal spatula, flatten squares and continue baking until crisp and brown, about 5 minutes longer.  Cool pastry squares on sheet.

Heat preserves in small saucepan until just melted.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Add berries and toss to coat.

Place 6 pastry squares on work surface.  Spread each with 1/4 cup mousse.  Top with 6 to 8 berries.  Cover with remaining pastry squares.  Dust napoleons with remaining 1/4 cup powdered sugar.  Top each with berry and mint sprig.  Place napoleons on plates.  Serve, passing remaining berries.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Joe Dion of North Charleston, South Carolina, writes: "Because I work in a restaurant (I'm a chef at a place called Slightly North of Broad in Charleston), I don't let my cooking at home get too complicated.  I'm at the restaurant five days a week and often work on weekends, but whenever I have the chance I enjoy getting together with friends and cooking for them."

Frozen puff pastry simplifies this dessert.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  chilled butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  5             ounces  soft fresh goat cheese log -- crumbled
     3/4           cup  buttermilk
                        European-style butter -- room temperature
                        = (such as PlugrÂ·)
  6             ounces  thinly-sliced smoked salmon
  1                     large bunch fresh dill sprigs

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Whisk first 6 ingredients in large bowl.  Using fingertips, rub butter into dry ingredients until coarse meal forms.  Add cheese and buttermilk; stir with fork just until dough comes together (bits of cheese will be visible in dough).

Pat dough out on lightly floured surface into 3/4-inch-thick round.  Using floured 2-inch-diameter cutter, cut out biscuits.  Gather scraps and pat dough out; cut out additional biscuits.  Arrange on prepared baking sheets and bake 6 minutes.  Turn sheets; bake until golden brown, about 8 minutes longer.  Cool biscuits on rack.  (Biscuits can be made 6 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Split biscuits in half horizontally.  Spread bottom halves with thin layer of butter.  Divide salmon among biscuits.  Top each with dill sprig and biscuit top.

This recipe yields 16 biscuits.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Whisk first 6 ingredients in large bowl.  Using fingertips, rub butter into dry ingredients until coarse meal forms.  Add cheese and buttermilk; stir with fork just until dough comes together (bits of cheese will be visible in dough).

Pat dough out on lightly floured surface into 3/4-inch-thick round.  Using floured 2-inch-diameter cutter, cut out biscuits.  Gather scraps and pat dough out; cut out additional biscuits.  Arrange on prepared baking sheets and bake 6 minutes.  Turn sheets; bake until golden brown, about 8 minutes longer.  Cool biscuits on rack.  (Biscuits can be made 6 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Split biscuits in half horizontally.  Spread bottom halves with thin layer of butter.  Divide salmon among biscuits.  Top each with dill sprig and biscuit top.

     1/4           cup  water
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice

                        = (or 1/2 large jalapeÃ’o chile with seeds)
  1              small  carrot -- peeled, and
                        cut into matchstick-size strips
  4                     halibut fillets - (6 to 7 oz ea)
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- divided
  1                     shallot -- thinly sliced
     3/4         pound  tatsoi or baby spinach - -- (abt 12 cups packed)

Mix first 7 ingredients in medium glass bowl.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  (Sauce can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Place carrot in medium bowl.  Cover with ice water.  Let stand 15 minutes, then drain well.  Brush fish on all sides with 2 tablespoons oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill until just opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side.

Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add shallot; stir 1 minute.  Add tatsoi; sprinkle with salt.  Toss until tatsoi is wilted but still bright green, about 2 minutes; divide among 4 plates.

Place fish atop tatsoi.  Sprinkle each fillet with carrot; drizzle each with 2 tablespoons sauce.  Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

        Grilled Steak Sandwiches With Chimichurri And Bell Peppers

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fresh Italian parsley - (packed)
  1                cup  fresh cilantro - (packed)
  3        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
     2/3           cup  olive oil -- plus
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2              large  bell peppers -- cut 3/4"-wide strips
                        = (preferably 1 red and 1 yellow)
  2                     beef rib-eye steaks - (12 oz ea)
  4                     sourdough demi-baguettes -- halved horizontally

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Combine first 6 ingredients in processor; add 2/3 cup oil and puree until almost smooth.  Season chimichurri with salt and pepper.

Brush pepper strips, steaks, and cut side of bread with remaining 1/4 cup oil.  Sprinkle peppers and steaks with salt and pepper.  Grill peppers until tender, about 5 minutes per side.  Grill steaks to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Grill bread, cut-side down, until beginning to brown lightly, about 2 minutes.  Thinly slice steaks crosswise; divide among bread bottoms.  Spoon chimichurri over steak (about 1/4 cup per sandwich), then top with pepper strips.  Cover with bread tops and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Chimichurri is an Argentine parsley sauce with bright flavors and a kick from crushed red pepper.  To save time: Prepare the fresh parsley and cilantro for the processor by simply cutting off the tops of the bunches and discarding the bottom stems.

Recipe Remix:  Toss any remaining chimichurri sauce with potato wedges and roast in 400 degrees oven until just tender, about 40 minutes.

Recipe By     :Dana Talusani, Longmont, CO
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  3          teaspoons  minced fresh parsley -- divided
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  6                     beef tenderloin steaks, 1" thick - -- (abt 6 oz ea)
  2             ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  finely-crumbled blue cheese - (abt 1 oz)
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped seeded red or green
                        jalapeÃ’o chiles
  1                     shallot -- finely chopped
     3/4      teaspoon  white wine vinegar

Combine olive oil, 2 teaspoons parsley, and garlic in 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass dish.  Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper.  Add steaks to dish and turn to coat.  Marinate steaks 30 minutes or cover and chill up to 1 day.

Mix cream cheese, blue cheese, chiles, shallot, vinegar, and remaining 1 teaspoon parsley in medium bowl.  Season blue cheese topping to taste with salt and pepper.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Place steaks on grill rack (some marinade should still cling to meat).  Cook 5 minutes.  Turn steaks over.  Divide blue cheese topping among steaks.  Grill until topping softens and steaks are medium-rare, about 5 minutes longer.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Dana Talusani of Longmont, Colorado, writes: "As the mother of two, I don't get to spend as much time in the kitchen as I would like.  That said, it's still important for our family to sit down and enjoy a meal together at the end of the day.  This is one of my favorite recipes Ã³ it's great for a last-minute dinner."

The classic combination of blue cheese and steak is updated with a kick of jalapeÃ’o chiles.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  olive oil -- divided
  1              large  fresh fennel bulb -- halved, very thinly
                        sliced, top fronds reserved
  2              large  lemons -- 1 sliced very thin,
                        and 1 cut into 8 wedges
  8                     halibut fillets - (4 oz ea)
  2             medium  carrots -- cut matchstick
                        strips
  1                     container grape tomatoes - (12 oz) -- halved
                        = (or cherry tomatoes)
  2                     large bunche fresh thyme
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Line large rimmed baking sheet with foil, leaving overhang as long as baking sheet.  Brush foil with 1 tablespoon oil.  Scatter sliced fennel in center of foil as bed for fish.  Top fennel with lemon slices, then fish, spacing slightly apart.  Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle carrots over fish; arrange tomatoes around fish.  Drizzle 3 tablespoons oil over fish and tomatoes.  Top with 16 thyme sprigs.  Cover fish with foil overhang and seal.  Bake fish until just opaque in center, about 12 minutes.

Meanwhile, blend remaining 3/4 cup olive oil and garlic in blender until smooth.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Open foil packet.  Drizzle all of sauce over fish and vegetables.  Reseal foil.  Let fish cool at room temperature 1 hour.  Chill overnight.

Discard thyme sprigs.  Using large spatula, transfer 1 fish fillet with fennel base to each of 8 plates.  Divide tomatoes, carrots, and sauce among plates.  Garnish fish with lemon wedges and fennel fronds.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  An alternative to traditional gefilte fish, this cold, oven-steamed halibut makes an elegant fish course.  Conveniently, it should be prepared one day ahead.

                  Lemon Cheesecake With Gingersnap Crust

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheesecake                      Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2               cups  ground gingersnap cookies
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  5           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  2               cups  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  7              large  eggs
  3               cups  sour cream - (24 oz)
  2        tablespoons  finely-grated lemon peel - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Lemon leaves or twists -- (optional)

For crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Stir cookie crumbs and butter in medium bowl until evenly moistened.  Press mixture onto bottom of 9-inch-diameter removable-bottom cheesecake pan with 3-inch-high sides.  Bake crust until deep golden, about 12 minutes.  Cool completely.  Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees.

Stack 3 large sheets of foil on work surface.  Place same cake pan in center.  Gather foil snugly around pan bottom and up sides to waterproof.

For filling:  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in large bowl until smooth and fluffy.  Gradually beat in sugar, then salt.  Beat in eggs, 1 at a time.  Beat in sour cream, grated lemon peel, and lemon juice.  Pour filling into pan.

Place wrapped cake pan in large roasting pan.  Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of cake pan.  Bake cake until filling is slightly puffed and moves only slightly when pan is shaken gently, about 1 hour 25 minutes.  Remove cake pan from water bath; remove foil.  Cool cake in pan on rack 2 hours.  Chill uncovered until cold; cover and keep chilled at least 1 day and up to 2 days.

Cut around pan sides; carefully loosen pan bottom from sides and push up pan bottom to release cake.  Place cake (still on pan bottom) on platter.  Garnish with lemon leaves or twists.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  Bake the cheesecake at least one day ahead so that it has enough time to chill.

Test-Kitchen Tips Ã¯The pan:  It must be three inches high to hold all the filling.  If your nine-inch springform pan is that high, it can be used instead.

Ã¯The cream cheese:  For best results, use Philadelphia brand.

Ã¯The crust:  Grind the gingersnaps in the processor or place them in a heavy-duty plastic bag and finely crush them with a rolling pin.

  5          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
     3/4           cup  sugar

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CURD ===
  2 1/3           cups  sugar
  4          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1                cup  fresh lemon juice
  4              large  eggs
  4              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        === CRUST ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  2               cups  shortbread cookie crumbs - (abt 7 1/2 oz)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
                        === MOUSSE ===
  5        tablespoons  water
  4          teaspoons  unflavored gelatin
  6              large  egg whites
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  chilled heavy whipping cream
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Lemon slices -- cut into quarters

For Curd:  Mix sugar and cornstarch in heavy large saucepan.  Gradually add lemon juice, whisking until all cornstarch dissolves.  Whisk in eggs and yolks.  Add butter.  Stir over medium heat until curd thickens and boils, about 12 minutes.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Chill until cold, at least 6 hours.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.

Press plastic wrap onto surface of curd and keep chilled.)

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray bottom of 8-inch-diameter springform pan with nonstick spray.  Blend cookie crumbs and butter in small bowl.  Press onto bottom of pan.  Bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Cool.

For Mousse:  Pour 5 tablespoons water into small saucepan.  Sprinkle gelatin evenly over.  Let stand until gelatin softens, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, place 1 3/4 cups lemon curd in large bowl.  Stir 3/4 cup curd in another small saucepan over medium-low heat until very warm.

Stir gelatin mixture over medium-low heat until dissolved and liquid is clear (do not boil).  Whisk warm gelatin mixture into 3/4 cup warm curd.  Gradually whisk gelatin-curd mixture into curd in large bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add sugar, beating until whites are thick and glossy.  Fold whites into curd mixture in 3 additions.  Using same beaters, beat cream in another medium bowl until peaks form.  Fold into egg white-curd mixture in 3 additions.  Pour enough mousse over cooled crust to fill pan completely.  Pour remaining mousse into small bowl and reserve.  Cover and chill mousse cake, reserved mousse, and remaining curd overnight.

Using long thin knife, cut around cake to loosen.  Remove pan sides.  Gently spread 3/4 cup of remaining curd over cake.  Transfer reserved mousse to pastry bag fitted with small star tip.  Pipe rosettes of mousse around top edge of cake.  Chill cake until ready to serve.  (Can be made up to 8 hours ahead.)

Arrange lemon slices between rosettes.  Cut cake into wedges.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  To make the shortbread cookie crumbs for the crust, seal the cookies in a heavy plastic bag and use a rolling pin to crush them into fine crumbs.

For Curd:  Mix sugar and cornstarch in heavy large saucepan.  Gradually add lemon juice, whisking until all cornstarch dissolves.  Whisk in eggs and yolks.  Add butter.  Stir over medium heat until curd thickens and boils, about 12 minutes.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Chill until cold, at least 6 hours.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Press plastic wrap onto surface of curd and keep chilled.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray bottom of 8-inch-diameter springform pan with nonstick spray.  Blend cookie crumbs and butter in small bowl.  Press onto bottom of pan.  Bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Mousse:  Pour 5 tablespoons water into small saucepan.  Sprinkle gelatin evenly over.  Let stand until gelatin softens, about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, place 1 3/4 cups lemon curd in large bowl.  Stir 3/4 cup curd in another small saucepan over medium-low heat until very warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir gelatin mixture over medium-low heat until dissolved and liquid is clear (do not boil).  Whisk warm gelatin mixture into 3/4 cup warm curd.  Gradually whisk gelatin-curd mixture into curd in large bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add sugar, beating until whites are thick and glossy.  Fold whites into curd mixture in 3 additions.  Using same beaters, beat cream in another medium bowl until peaks form.  Fold into egg white-curd mixture in 3 additions.  Pour enough mousse over cooled crust to fill pan completely.  Pour remaining mousse into small bowl and reserve.  Cover and chill mousse cake, reserved mousse, and remaining curd overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using long thin knife, cut around cake to loosen.  Remove pan sides.  Gently spread 3/4 cup of remaining curd over cake.  Transfer reserved mousse to pastry bag fitted with small star tip.  Pipe rosettes of mousse around top edge of cake.  Chill cake until ready to serve.  (Can be made up to 8 hours ahead.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange lemon slices between rosettes.  Cut cake into wedges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/3           cups  whole milk
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
     2/3           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  grated lemon peel - (packed)
  4 1/2           cups  bread flour - (or more) -- divided
  1           envelope  instant or rapid-rise yeast
  3              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  brandy or dark rum
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  10       tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/2           cup  apricot preserves
                        === GLAZE ===
  1 1/3           cups  powdered sugar - (or more)
  3        tablespoons  strained fresh lemon juice

For Dough:  Pour milk into small saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Bring to simmer.  Remove from heat; cover and let steep 20 minutes.  If necessary, rewarm milk until instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers between 105 degrees and 115 degrees before continuing.

Blend sugar and lemon peel in processor.  Mix 1 1/2 cups flour and yeast in bowl of heavy-duty mixer fitted with paddle attachment.  Discard vanilla bean and add warm milk to bowl; beat to blend.  Let stand until slightly puffed, about 15 minutes.  Add 3 cups flour, eggs, and brandy to yeast mixture; beat on medium speed until smooth and slightly firm dough forms, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls if dough is sticky or adding water by tablespoonfuls if dough is dry, about 6 minutes.  Add sugar-lemon peel mixture and salt.  Beat on medium speed 5 minutes.  Add butter and beat until absorbed and dough is smooth and soft, about 5 minutes longer.  Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

Generously butter 12-cup Bundt pan.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface; knead gently into ball.  Using fingers, make hole in center of dough, creating doughnut shape.  Transfer to prepared pan, pushing hole in dough over center tube in pan.  Cover pan with plastic wrap; refrigerate overnight (dough will rise to top of pan).

Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until dough no longer springs back when gently pressed with fingers, about 1 hour 30 minutes (dough will rise above pan by 1 to 1 1/2 inches).

Meanwhile, position rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Bake bread until well browned on top, about 20 minutes.  Wrap sheet of foil loosely over top and sides of pan to prevent overbrowning.  Continue to bake bread until deep brown on top and tester inserted near center comes out clean, rotating pan occasionally for even baking, about 40 minutes longer.  Immediately invert bread onto rack.

Stir preserves in small saucepan over medium heat until melted.  Brush preserves all over warm bread.  Cool completely, at least 3 hours.

For Glaze:  Sift 1 1/3 cups powdered sugar into small bowl.  Add lemon juice and whisk to blend.  Add more powdered sugar by tablespoonfuls if glaze is too thin to adhere to bread.  Drizzle glaze over cool bread and let stand until glaze sets, about 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap loosely in foil and store at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 1 large bread.

Comments:  You'll need an instant-read thermometer and a heavy-duty stand mixer with paddle attachment to make this brioche-like sweet bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- room temperature
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  finely-grated lemon peel
  2              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  3               cups  chopped walnuts
                        === GLAZE ===
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
                        Raw sugar*

* Also called turbinado or demerara sugar; available at most supermarkets and natural foods stores.

Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat butter, 1 1/3 cups sugar, and lemon peel in large bowl until blended.  Add 2 eggs, 1 at a time, beating just to blend after each addition.  Beat in lemon juice, then flour mixture.  Stir in walnuts.

Divide dough into 3 equal pieces.  Place each piece on sheet of plastic wrap.  Using plastic wrap as aid, form dough into 8-inch-long logs.  Press logs slightly, flattening to 2 1/2-inch-wide logs.  Enclose in plastic wrap and chill until firm, at least 3 hours and up to 3 days.

Position rack in upper third of oven and preheat to 325 degrees.  Line heavy large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.  Unwrap logs, leaving on plastic.  Brush top of logs with egg glaze.  Sprinkle with raw sugar.  Lift logs from plastic and transfer to prepared baking sheet, spacing evenly.  Bake until golden brown and just firm to touch, about 50 minutes.  Transfer to rack and cool completely.  Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees.

Line 2 heavy rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.  Using long serrated knife, carefully cut logs crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices.  Arrange biscotti, cut-side down, on prepared baking sheets.  Bake cookies until golden brown around edges, about 20 minutes.  Cool completely (biscotti will crisp as they cool).  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 5 dozen.

Comments:  These sweet-crisp cookies can be baked days ahead and, because the recipe is so generous, you can send your guests home with some.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SYRUP ===
  1                cup  water
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  pure maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  instant espresso powder
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cardamom
                        === TORTE ===
  2               cups  walnuts - (abt 8 oz) -- plus
                        walnut halves for decoration
     1/3           cup  matzo meal
  4              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  pure maple syrup
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4          teaspoons  instant espresso powder
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated lemon peel
  2          teaspoons  ground cardamom
                        Whipped nondairy topping* -- (optional)

* Kosher-for-Passover nondairy topping mix is usually available in the frozen foods section of kosher markets and some supermarkets.  Prepare it according to directions on the label.

For Syrup:  Bring all ingredients to boil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Boil until syrup thickens slightly and is reduced to 1 generous cup, about 5 minutes.  Set aside.

For Torte:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Lightly oil inside of 8-inch springform pan.  Line bottom with parchment paper.  Blend 2 cups walnuts and matzo meal in processor until nuts are finely ground.  Using electric mixer, beat eggs, maple syrup, sugar, and salt in large bowl at high speed 5 minutes.  Add espresso, lemon peel, and cardamom and beat until beginning to thicken, about 5 minutes longer.  Gently fold in nut mixture in 4 additions.  Pour batter into prepared pan.

Bake torte until brown on top and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.  Transfer torte to rack.  Spoon 4 tablespoons syrup over hot torte.  Decorate top with walnut halves.  Cool completely in pan on rack.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover remaining syrup and torte separately and let stand at room temperature.)

Cut around pan sides to loosen torte.  Remove pan sides.  Cut torte into wedges.  Serve with remaining syrup and whipped topping, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

        Mint-Truffle Ice Cream Terrine With Mint, Chocolate Sauces

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TRUFFLES AND CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  heavy whipping cream
  16            ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  pure peppermint extract
                        Unsweetened cocoa powder
  5               cups  vanilla ice cream - (2 1/2 pints) -- slightly softened
                        === MINT SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  water
  2               cups  fresh mint leaves - (lightly packed)

For Truffles And Chocolate Sauce:  Bring cream to simmer in heavy large saucepan; remove from heat.   Add chocolate; let stand 1 minute. Whisk until mixture is smooth.  Whisk in extract.  Freeze until firm, about 4 hours, or chill overnight.

Line baking sheet with foil.  Drop scant 1 tablespoon chocolate mixture for each of 16 truffles onto prepared sheet.  Dust hands with cocoa; roll chocolate mounds into rounds.  Cover and freeze truffles.  Cover and chill remaining chocolate mixture for sauce.  (Truffles and sauce can be made 2 days ahead.)

Line 8 1/2- by 4 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch metal loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving long overhang.  Spread 1/3 of ice cream (about 1 2/3 cups) over bottom of prepared pan.  Press 8 truffles in random pattern (and spaced apart) into ice cream layer.  Spread 1/2 of remaining ice cream over.  Press remaining 8 truffles in random pattern (and spaced apart) into second ice cream layer.  Spread remaining ice cream over.  Cover terrine with plastic wrap overhang.  Freeze at least 6 hours and up to 2 days.

For Mint Sauce:  Bring sugar and 1/3 cup water to boil in small saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Pour syrup into blender; cool 10 minutes.  Add mint leaves to syrup and puree until smooth.  Transfer sauce to bowl; cool.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Whisk to blend before using.)

Stir chocolate sauce over low heat until warm.  Transfer to pitcher.  Turn ice cream terrine out onto platter; peel off plastic.  Cut terrine crosswise into slices; arrange on plates.  Drizzle chocolate sauce and mint sauce around terrine.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Mint-chocolate truffles frozen in vanilla ice cream create a polka-dot dessert.

Test-kitchen tip:  Make quick work of softening the ice cream by microwaving it in ten-second intervals on the lowest power setting.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  slender asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" lengths
  5               cups  low-salt chicken broth - (about) -- divided
  1              pound  uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        tails left intact, shells reserved
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2      teaspoon  crumbled saffron threads
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     Spanish chorizo sausage links - (abt 6 oz) -- casings removed
  2 1/2           cups  chopped onions
  3              large  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1              large  tomato - (12 to 13 oz) -- halved, seeded,
                        and cut into 3/4" cubes
     1/3           cup  drained roasted canned Piquillo peppers -- coarsely chopped
                        = (or drained roasted red peppers from
                        jar)
  2          teaspoons  PimentÃ›n de la Vera (hot Spanish smoked
                        paprika)
                        = (or hot Hungarian paprika)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2 1/2           cups  Spanish Bomba rice, Italian arborio rice,
                        or medium-grain white rice - (abt 17 oz)
  18             small  littleneck clams - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- scrubbed
  24                    mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
  5             ounces  sugar snap peas -- trimmed
                        Lemon wedges

Cook asparagus in large saucepan of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold water, and drain again.

Bring 4 1/2 cups broth to simmer in medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add reserved shrimp shells; simmer 10 minutes.  Bring wine to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat; add saffron and set aside 5 minutes to steep.  Strain saffron-infused wine into 8-cup measuring cup.  Strain in shrimp broth.  Add enough chicken broth to measure 5 cups broth mixture.

Heat oil in large wide pot (at least 3 inches deep) over medium-high heat.  Add chorizo and sautÃˆ until lightly browned, breaking into 1/2-inch pieces with side of spoon, about 5 minutes.  Add onions.  Reduce heat to medium and sautÃˆ until onions are slightly soft, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic and stir 2 minutes.  Add tomato and peppers.  SautÃˆ until tomato is soft and juices evaporate, about 3 minutes.  Mix in paprika and salt, then rice.  (Asparagus, broth mixture, and rice mixture can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Let each stand at room temperature.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Add broth mixture to rice mixture and bring to boil over high heat, stirring frequently.  Reduce heat to low and simmer 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove pot from heat.  Scatter shrimp over.  Tuck clams and mussels into rice mixture, hinged-side down.  Place pot in oven and bake paella, uncovered, 15 minutes.  Sprinkle peas and asparagus over.  Continue to bake until broth is absorbed, rice is tender, and clams and mussels open, about 5 minutes longer.  Transfer pot to work surface.  Cover with foil; let stand 5 minutes.

Transfer paella to large shallow dish.  Garnish with lemon wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The unofficial national dish of Spain, paella makes a fantastic main course for entertaining.  Once you've prepped the components a couple of hours ahead, the finished product comes together in about 30 minutes.  Just add a green salad dressed with Sherry vinaigrette.

What to drink:  Chilled Spanish rosÃˆ (called rosado); Rick Rodgers likes Las Rocas de San Alejandro Rosado.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  orecchiette
                        = (little ear-shaped pasta)
  8             ounces  bacon -- chopped
  8                     shallots -- trimmed, quartered
  2               cups  sugar snap peas - (abt 8 oz)
  4               cups  pea tendrils - (4 1/2 oz)
  1                cup  frozen petite peas -- thawed
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced fresh mint
  1                cup  shaved Parmesan cheese
                        Additional shaved Parmesan cheese

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring often.  Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.  Transfer to large bowl.

Meanwhile, sautÃˆ bacon in heavy large skillet over high heat until crisp, about 5 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels.  Add shallots to skillet; sautÃˆ over medium-high heat until golden brown, pressing with spoon to separate layers, about 5 minutes.  Add snap peas; stir until bright green and crisp-tender, about 1 minute.  Add pea tendrils and petite peas, stirring just until tendrils wilt, about 1 minute.  Add pea mixture, bacon, mint, and enough cooking liquid to moisten pasta.  Stir in 1 cup cheese.  Serve, passing additional cheese alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Pea tendrils taste like a cross between peas and spinach and are used in Chinese cooking, where they are called dau miu.  Find them at farmers' markets and Asian markets.

Spinach or watercress can be substituted for pea tendrils in this lovely green dish.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  3        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  2 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (or more)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  instant or rapid-rise yeast
                        = (measured from 1 envelope)
  3        tablespoons  warm water -- (105 to 115 degrees)
     1/2           cup  sour cream -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sour cream
  4 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  3              large  egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  4 1/2    tablespoons  room temperature unsalted butter -- cut 4 pieces
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2           cups  pecans - (abt 6 oz)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vegetable oil
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  golden brown sugar
                        === GLAZE ===
  1                     egg -- beaten to blend

For Dough:  Mix 3 tablespoons flour and yeast in small bowl to blend.  Add 3 tablespoons warm water; whisk until smooth.  Let mixture stand until puffed, about 12 minutes.

Combine 2 1/4 cups flour, sour cream, sugar, egg yolks, vanilla, salt, and yeast mixture in large bowl of heavy-duty mixer fitted with paddle attachment.  Beat on medium speed until dough is sticky, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons water if mixture is too dry, about 5 minutes.  Add butter; beat until dough is smooth and soft, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls until dough is slightly firmer and pulls away from sides of bowl, about 5 minutes.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until at least doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

Meanwhile, prepare Filling:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Toss pecans and oil on rimmed baking sheet to coat.  Bake until aromatic, about 5 minutes.  Sprinkle nuts with 1/8 teaspoon sea salt; cool on sheet.  Coarsely chop pecans.

Scrape dough out onto floured surface.  Toss dough to coat with flour and press gently to deflate.  Line work surface with long sheet of parchment paper; sprinkle paper with flour.  Roll out dough on prepared parchment to 16- by 14-inch rectangle.  Using offset spatula, spread butter lengthwise in 5-inch-wide strip down center of dough.  Sprinkle sugar, then nuts over butter.  Cut unfilled dough on either side of filling into 3/4-inch-wide diagonal strips.  Fold alternating strips over filling on slight diagonal, forming lattice top.  Fold loose ends under bottom edge of bread.  Slide parchment with bread onto large rimmed baking sheet.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm draft-free area until very puffy, about 1 1/2 hours.

Position rack in top third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Brush bread with egg glaze.  Bake until golden, turning sheet after 15 minutes, about 25 minutes total.  Slide parchment with bread onto rack and cool at least 1 hour.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool completely, wrap in foil, and store at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

Comments:  An interesting mix of brown sugar, pecans, and sea salt fills this woven lattice-top bread.  You'll need a heavy-duty stand mixer with paddle attachment.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CANDIED ROSE PETALS ===
  2              large  egg whites
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        Petals from 2 organic roses
                        === CAKE ===
  1                cup  cake flour
  14       tablespoons  baker's sugar or superfine sugar -- divided
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
  3              large  eggs -- separated
  6        tablespoons  water
     1/4           cup  canola oil
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/4      teaspoon  whole cardamom seeds
                        = (removed from about 5 green cardamom
                        pods)
                        === FROSTING ===
  2 1/2           cups  chilled heavy whipping cream -- divided
  1              pinch  saffron threads
     2/3           cup  powdered sugar
  1           teaspoon  rose water
  2        tablespoons  natural unsalted pistachios

For Candied Rose Petals:  Whisk egg whites in small bowl until foamy.  Using pastry brush, brush rose petals on both sides with egg whites; sprinkle on both sides with sugar.  Dry on nonstick rack at least 6 hours or overnight.

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter two 8-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line pan bottoms with parchment paper; butter parchment.

Sift flour, 7 tablespoons baker's sugar, baking powder, and salt into large bowl.  Whisk yolks and next 4 ingredients in small bowl until smooth.  Add yolk mixture to dry ingredients; whisk until smooth.  Beat egg whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add 7 tablespoons baker's sugar; beat until whites resemble thick marshmallow fluff.  Fold whites into batter in 3 additions.

Divide batter between prepared pans.  Bake until cakes are golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Cool in pans on racks 15 minutes.  Turn out onto racks, peel off parchment, and cool completely.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Wrap and store at room temperature.)

For Frosting:  Combine 1/2 cup cream and saffron in small saucepan.  Bring to simmer.  Remove from heat; let steep 20 minutes.  Chill until cold.

Beat remaining 2 cups cream, powdered sugar, and rose water in large bowl until soft peaks form; strain in saffron cream.  Beat until peaks form.

Place 1 cake layer, flat-side up, on platter.  Spread 1 cup frosting over.  Top with second cake layer, flat-side down.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake.  Chill at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours.  Garnish cake with rose petals and pistachios.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This chiffon cake filled with rose-scented whipped cream is inspired by the aromatics found in Persian, Turkish, and Indian confections.  Cardamom seeds have more flavor than the ground powder and are like little explosions of spice in the cake.

For Candied Rose Petals:  Whisk egg whites in small bowl until foamy.  Using pastry brush, brush rose petals on both sides with egg whites; sprinkle on both sides with sugar.  Dry on nonstick rack at least 6 hours or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Cake:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter two 8-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.  Line pan bottoms with parchment paper; butter parchment.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sift flour, 7 tablespoons baker&apos;s sugar, baking powder, and salt into large bowl.  Whisk yolks and next 4 ingredients in small bowl until smooth.  Add yolk mixture to dry ingredients; whisk until smooth.  Beat egg whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add 7 tablespoons baker&apos;s sugar; beat until whites resemble thick marshmallow fluff.  Fold whites into batter in 3 additions.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide batter between prepared pans.  Bake until cakes are golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Cool in pans on racks 15 minutes.  Turn out onto racks, peel off parchment, and cool completely.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Wrap and store at room temperature.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Frosting:  Combine 1/2 cup cream and saffron in small saucepan.  Bring to simmer.  Remove from heat; let steep 20 minutes.  Chill until cold.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat remaining 2 cups cream, powdered sugar, and rose water in large bowl until soft peaks form; strain in saffron cream.  Beat until peaks form.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1 cake layer, flat-side up, on platter.  Spread 1 cup frosting over.  Top with second cake layer, flat-side down.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake.  Chill at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours.  Garnish cake with rose petals and pistachios.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This chiffon cake filled with rose-scented whipped cream is inspired by the aromatics found in Persian, Turkish, and Indian confections.  Cardamom seeds have more flavor than the ground powder and are like little explosions of spice in the cake.

               Rhubarb Lattice Pie With Cardamom And Orange

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Pies

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes,
                        and frozen 15 minutes
  7        tablespoons  ice water - (about)
                        === FILLING ===
  10              cups  rhubarb in 1" pieces - (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
     2/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  2 1/2      teaspoons  grated orange peel
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/4           cup  strawberry preserves
  1         tablespoon  whipping cream
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

For Crust:  Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor 5 seconds.  Add butter.  Using on/off turns, blend until coarse meal forms.  Add 6 tablespoons ice water.  Using on/off turns, blend until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by 1/2 tablespoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball.  Divide into 2 pieces, 1 slightly larger than the other.  Flatten into disks.  Wrap and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

For Filling:  Combine rhubarb, 2/3 cup sugar, orange juice, orange peel, and cardamom in large deep skillet.  Toss over medium-high heat until liquid starts to bubble.  Reduce heat to medium.  Cover and simmer until rhubarb is almost tender, stirring very gently occasionally to keep rhubarb intact, about 8 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer rhubarb to colander set over bowl.  Drain well.  Add syrup from bowl to skillet.  Boil until juices in skillet are thick and reduced to 2/3 cup, adding any additional drained syrup from bowl, about 7 minutes.  Mix in preserves.  Cool mixture in skillet 15 minutes.  Very gently fold in rhubarb (do not overmix or rhubarb will fall apart).

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Roll out larger dough disk on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch glass pie dish.  Roll out smaller dough disk to 11-inch round; cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips.  Spoon filling into pie dish.  Arrange 6 dough strips atop filling, spacing evenly apart.  Arrange 5 dough strips atop filling in opposite direction, forming lattice.  Seal strip ends to crust edge.  Stir cream and 2 teaspoons sugar in small bowl to blend.  Brush over lattice, but not crust edge.

Bake pie until filling bubbles thickly and crust is golden, covering edge with foil if browning too quickly, about 55 minutes.  Cool pie completely.  Cut into wedges; serve with ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The red portions of rhubarb stalks make the best-looking pie, so buy extra and trim as needed.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  To protect the pie edge from overbrowning, fold a yard-long piece of foli lengthwise into a four-inch-wide strip.  Stand the strip around the pie like a fence, securing the overlapping portion with a paper clip.

               Roast Chicken Noodle Soup With Chrysanthemum

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              whole  star anise
  3               cups  water
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2") -- peeled, and
                        sliced into thin rounds
  6               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2            bunches  chrysanthemum -- bottoms trimmed,
                        upper stems and leaves cut 2" strips - -- (abt 5 cups)
  1            package  thin fresh or dried Chinese egg noodles - -- (14 oz)
  2 1/2           cups  cubed 1/2" skinned and boned freshly
                        roasted or purchased roast chicken - -- (abt 2/3 lb)
     1/4         large  onion -- sliced paper-thin
  3                     red Thai bird chiles -- sliced thin rounds
                        = (or 1 large red jalapeÃ’o chile)

Stir star anise in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until slightly darker, wrinkled-looking, and fragrant, about 8 minutes.  Add 3 cups water and ginger; simmer 15 minutes.  Add broth, soy sauce, and sugar; simmer 15 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Stir oil and garlic in small skillet over low heat until garlic is crisp and golden, about 8 minutes.  Set garlic oil aside.

Blanch chrysanthemum in large pot of boiling salted water until just wilted, about 5 seconds.  Using strainer, transfer greens to colander.  Rinse with cold water and drain.  Return water in pot to boil.  Add noodles and cook until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring often, about 3 minutes.  Drain; transfer to large bowl.  Let stand 2 minutes.  Mix in 1 tablespoon garlic oil.  Using kitchen shears, cut noodles crosswise in several places.

Heat chicken in microwave in 10-second intervals at low setting until warmed through.  Divide noodles among 4 soup bowls; top each with 1/4 of chrysanthemum, chicken, and onion.  Ladle 2 cups broth mixture into each bowl.  Drizzle with some garlic oil.  Serve, passing red chiles separately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  If you're craving an aromatic Chinatown-style noodle soup, this recipe is a quick fix Ã³ especially if you use a roast chicken from the supermarket deli.  (For another variation, try using roast duck from a Chinese deli instead.)  The chrysanthemum leaves are a beautiful match with the delicate broth redolent of star anise, but watercress can be substituted if you like.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh mint
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh rosemary
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  5 1/4         pounds  boneless leg of lamb -- butterflied, and
                        trimmed of most fat and sinew
                        Coarse kosher salt -- to taste
                        Fresh mint sprigs
                        Lima Bean Puree -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

         Roasted Vegetable Meatloaf With Mustard Mashed Potatoes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              small  zucchini -- diced
  3                     red bell peppers -- diced
  2             medium  red onions -- diced
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary -- divided
  2             pounds  ground beef chuck (20% fat)
  2               cups  coarsely-grated whole-milk
                        mozzarella cheese - (abt 8 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  panko* (Japanese breadcrumbs)
  1                cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh marjoram
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  1                cup  ketchup -- divided
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  dry red wine
                        Mustard Mashed Potatoes -- (see recipe)

* Flaky panko crumbs are the best substitute for fresh breadcrumbs in almost anything, including meatloaf.  Look for them in the Asian foods section of the supermarket and at Asian markets.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Combine zucchini, peppers, and onions in medium bowl.  Add oil and 1 tablespoon rosemary; toss to coat.  Spread evenly on rimmed baking sheet; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.  Remove from oven; cool.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Mix ground beef, mozzarella, panko, basil, marjoram, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, dried crushed pepper, 1 tablespoon rosemary, and 1 cup roasted vegetables in large bowl.  Whisk 1/2 cup ketchup, eggs, and wine in medium bowl.  Add to beef mixture; stir with wooden spoon until well incorporated; spoon into 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan, forming rounded top.

Spoon 1/2 cup ketchup over top of loaf.  Bake meatloaf until cooked through, juices run clear, and top is browned, about 1 hour 10 minutes.  Remove pan from oven; let meatloaf rest 20 minutes.

Rewarm remaining vegetable mixture in large nonstick skillet.  Turn meatloaf out; cut into 1-inch-thick slices.  Top with warm roasted vegetable mixture; serve with mashed potatoes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Using ground beef with a higher fat content ensures a moist meatloaf.

* Flaky panko crumbs are the best substitute for fresh breadcrumbs in almost anything, including meatloaf.  Look for them in the Asian foods section of the supermarket and at Asian markets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Combine zucchini, peppers, and onions in medium bowl.  Add oil and 1 tablespoon rosemary; toss to coat.  Spread evenly on rimmed baking sheet; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.  Remove from oven; cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Mix ground beef, mozzarella, panko, basil, marjoram, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, dried crushed pepper, 1 tablespoon rosemary, and 1 cup roasted vegetables in large bowl.  Whisk 1/2 cup ketchup, eggs, and wine in medium bowl.  Add to beef mixture; stir with wooden spoon until well incorporated; spoon into 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan, forming rounded top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon 1/2 cup ketchup over top of loaf.  Bake meatloaf until cooked through, juices run clear, and top is browned, about 1 hour 10 minutes.  Remove pan from oven; let meatloaf rest 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rewarm remaining vegetable mixture in large nonstick skillet.  Turn meatloaf out; cut into 1-inch-thick slices.  Top with warm roasted vegetable mixture; serve with mashed potatoes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Using ground beef with a higher fat content ensures a moist meatloaf.

                        === SAFFRON CHICKEN BROTH ===
  6             pounds  chicken wings
  16              cups  water
  1 1/2         pounds  onions -- quartered
  6                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  coarse kosher salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  saffron threads
     1/2      teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
                        === SPINACH MATZO BALLS ===
  4              large  eggs
  1 1/4      teaspoons  coarse kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  unsalted matzo meal
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed, squeezed dry

For Saffron Chicken Broth:  Bring all ingredients to boil in very large pot.  Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer 2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Strain broth into another pot.  Spoon 1/4 cup fat from top of broth and place in medium bowl; add 1/4 cup broth.  Cool fat mixture and reserve for matzo balls.  Remove enough meat from chicken wings to measure 1 generous cup.  Finely mince chicken; reserve for matzo balls.  Chill remaining broth until ready to use.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and keep chilled.)

For Matzo Balls:  Whisk eggs, salt, and pepper into chicken fat mixture.  Mix in matzo meal, then spinach and reserved minced chicken.  Cover and chill until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

Bring large pot of generously salted water to boil.  Using wet hands and about 2 tablespoons for each, shape matzo mixture into 16 balls; drop into boiling water.  Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer until tender, about 45 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer matzo balls to 13- by 9- by 2-inch dish.  (Can be made 1 day ahead; chill.)

Skim any fat from top of broth; bring to simmer.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add cooked matzo balls; simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes.  Ladle broth and 2 matzo balls into each of 8 bowls and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2 1/2         pounds  center-cut wild salmon fillet -- skin and pinbones
                        removed
     1/2           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16            ounces  purchased fresh pizza dough ball
     2/3           cup  finely-grated Piave or Parmesan cheese
  2 1/4      teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
                        Coarse kosher salt -- to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2 1/2                 hot Italian sausages -- casings removed
  1              small  red onion -- thinly sliced
  7             ounces  fresh wild mushrooms -- thickly sliced
                        = (such as stemmed shiitake, oyster, and
                        chanterelle)
  1 3/4           cups  coarsely-grated whole-milk
                        mozzarella cheese - (abt 7 oz) -- divided
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- (optional)

Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Lightly flour 2 baking sheets.  Place dough on work surface; let stand until room temperature, about 20 minutes.  Divide dough in half.  Press and stretch each piece out on lightly floured surface to 5-inch round.  Sprinkle each with 1/3 cup Piave cheese, 3/4 teaspoon rosemary, and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper; sprinkle with coarse salt.  Roll each piece of dough out to 10-inch round, pressing in seasonings.  Transfer dough rounds to prepared baking sheets.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add sausage.  SautÃˆ until brown, breaking into 1/2-inch pieces with back of spoon, about 5 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage to bowl.  Add onion to skillet.  SautÃˆ until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes; transfer to plate.  Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to skillet.  Add mushrooms and remaining 3/4 teaspoon rosemary; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  SautÃˆ until brown, about 5 minutes.  Leaving 1/2-inch plain border, top each dough round with 3/4 cup mozzarella, then onion, sausage, and mushrooms.

Bake until crust bottoms are crisp and brown, reversing sheets after 10 minutes, about 20 minutes total.  Using large spatula, transfer pizzas to work surface.  Sprinkle each with 2 tablespoons mozzarella, then parsley, if desired.

This recipe yields 2 pizzas.

Test-kitchen tip:  Pizza-wheel cutters can drag toppings, so use a large chef's knife to cut pizzas into wedges.

Comments:  Fresh pizza dough is now available at some supermarkets; look for it in the refrigerated deli case or use thin Boboli crusts.

Piave is similar to, but a bit creamier than, Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Look for it at Italian markets and specialty cheese stores.

Place 2 scallop cakes on each of 4 plates.  Top with Cilantro-Lime Mayonnaise.  Place Buttered New Potatoes with Chives alongside.  Garnish scallop cakes with whole chives and cilantro sprigs.

          Soda Bread With Dark Chocolate And Candied Orange Peel

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  6             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- cut 1/3" pieces
                        = (not unsweetened)
  6             ounces  candied orange peel -- diced
  1 1/4           cups  buttermilk
  1              large  egg

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper; butter parchment.  Whisk first 5 ingredients in large bowl to blend.  Add butter; rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir in chocolate and orange peel.  Whisk buttermilk and egg in medium bowl to blend; add to dry ingredients.  Stir just until incorporated.

Turn dough out onto floured work surface and knead gently just until dough comes together, about 5 turns.  Form dough into 6 1/2-inch-diameter round, about 2 to 2 1/2 inches high.  Transfer to prepared baking sheet.  Using sharp knife, cut 1-inch-deep, 3-inch-long slits in top of bread, forming sunburst pattern.

Bake bread until well browned and very firm when pressed and tester inserted into center comes out clean, turning baking sheet halfway through baking, about 1 hour 10 minutes total.  Transfer bread to rack and cool completely, at least 3 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap in foil and store at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 1 large round loaf.

Comments:  Candied orange peel is usually sold in the supermarket's produce section.  It is also available from bakerscatalogue.com (labeled "Candied Fruit"); 800-827-6836.

Turn dough out onto floured work surface and knead gently just until dough comes together, about 5 turns.  Form dough into 6 1/2-inch-diameter round, about 2 to 2 1/2 inches high.  Transfer to prepared baking sheet.  Using sharp knife, cut 1-inch-deep, 3-inch-long slits in top of bread, forming sunburst pattern.

Bake bread until well browned and very firm when pressed and tester inserted into center comes out clean, turning baking sheet halfway through baking, about 1 hour 10 minutes total.  Transfer bread to rack and cool completely, at least 3 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap in foil and store at room temperature.)

                    Soy-Sake Shrimp With Ginger Aioli

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  2                     green onions -- chopped
  6        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  unseasoned rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sake or dry Sherry
  1         tablespoon  golden brown sugar
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  24                    deveined peeled uncooked large shrimp - -- (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  chopped peeled fresh ginger
                        Cooked white rice -- for serving

Combine soy sauce, green onions, 4 tablespoons oil, vinegar, sake, brown sugar, and garlic in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish; whisk marinade to blend.  Add shrimp and toss to coat.  Refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour, turning shrimp occasionally.

Blend mayonnaise and ginger in food processor until smooth.  Transfer ginger aioli to small bowl and refrigerate.

Drain marinade from shrimp into small saucepan; bring to boil.  Whisk 2 tablespoons boiled marinade into ginger aioli; reserve remaining boiled marinade.

Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shrimp; sautÃˆ until just opaque in center, about 4 minutes.  Mound rice in center of plates.  Arrange shrimp around rice; drizzle with ginger aioli.  Serve, passing reserved boiled marinade.

This recipe yields 6 first-course or 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  Joe Dion of North Charleston, South Carolina, writes: "Because I work in a restaurant (I'm a chef at a place called Slightly North of Broad in Charleston), I don't let my cooking at home get too complicated.  I'm at the restaurant five days a week and often work on weekends, but whenever I have the chance I enjoy getting together with friends and cooking for them."

This twist on the classic garlic mayonnaise is as simple as blending mayo and fresh ginger in a processor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Two 2"-thick porterhouse steaks
                        Olive oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Coriander-Herb Spice Rub -- (see recipe)

Place two 2-inch-thick porterhouse steaks on a heavy rimmed baking sheet.  Brush both sides with a full-flavored olive oil, then rub 1 1/2 tablespoons of the Coriander-Herb Spice Rub into each side of each steak.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Roast steaks until a meat thermometer inserted into the center registers 125 degrees for rare, about 25 minutes.  Transfer the steaks to a cutting board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest 10 minutes.

To serve, cut the 2 whole pieces of meat (known as the loin and the fillet) from each steak, and slice.  Give each guest a few slices of the loin and the fillet.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  All that these steaks need is about 30 minutes in a very hot oven: no browning, no sauce, no fuss.

Improv:  Try the same seasonings on two whole chickens, a pork roast, or three racks of lamb.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro -- divided
     1/4           cup  bottled clam juice
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onion
  1         tablespoon  grated peeled fresh ginger -- (see tip below)
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  fish sauce
                        = (such as nam pla or nuoc nam)*
  2                     red snapper fillets  - (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        = (or halibut fillets)

* Available in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets, at some specialty foods stores, and at Asian markets.

Mix 3 tablespoons cilantro and next 7 ingredients in small bowl to blend.  Set aside.  Pour enough water into large pot to reach depth of 1 inch.  Add steamer rack or basket.  Top with 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Bring water to boil.

Place fish in pie dish.  Pour cilantro sauce over.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Cover pot; steam fish just until opaque in center, about 6 minutes for snapper and 8 minutes for halibut.  Serve with sauce; garnish with 2 tablespoons cilantro.

To peel and grate fresh ginger:  Using a small knife, peel away the thin, light-brown skin from the portion needed.  Then rub the peeled ginger back and forth over the raised bumps of a small porcelain ginger grater (found at Asian markets).

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Low-fat, low-cal: Steaming helps preserve the flavor and nutrients of the fish without adding extra fat or calories.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  sugar -- plus
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon peel
     1/2           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2          teaspoons  dried lavender blossoms*
  3                     containers strawberries - (16 oz ea) -- hulled, sliced
                        CrÃ‹me fraÃ“che or sour cream

* Available at natural foods stores and some farmers' markets.

Mash 1/3 cup sugar and lemon peel in small bowl to blend well.  (Lemon sugar can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and store at room temperature.)

Bring 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water, honey, and lavender to boil in heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until lavender flavor is pronounced, about 3 minutes.  Strain syrup into small bowl.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm syrup before continuing.)

Place berries in large bowl.  Pour warm syrup over berries; stir to coat.  Divide berries and syrup among 8 bowls.  Spoon crÃ‹me fraÃ“che over berries, sprinkle with lemon sugar, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  You can make the lavender syrup and slice the berries ahead of time, but toss them together at the last minute.  Any remaining lemon sugar can be used to sweeten espresso or tea.

  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  minced red jalapeÃ’o chile
                        === SALAD ===
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  1         tablespoon  medium-dry Sherry
  2          teaspoons  tamari soy sauce
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/4         pounds  New York steak -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2/3" cubes
  2            bunches  watercress -- bottom 2" discarded,
                        cut into 1" lengths
  3               cups  mizuna leaves - (abt 1 1/2 oz) -- torn in half
                        if very large
  2               cups  torn Bibb lettuce leaves - -- (lightly packed)
  1                cup  Thai basil leaves -- cut 1/2"-wide strips
     1/2                English 12-oz hothouse cucumber -- halved lengthwise,
                        and sliced very thinly on diagonal
  12                    cherry tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2        medium  red onion -- cut thin wedges
  2                     shallots -- sliced thin rounds
     1/4        medium  pineapple -- peeled, cored,
                        halved lengthwise, and cut
                        crosswise 1/3"-thick slices

For Dressing:  Whisk all ingredients in small bowl to blend.

For Salad:  Mix oyster sauce, Sherry, tamari soy sauce, minced garlic, and brown sugar in medium bowl.  Stir in steak.  Marinate steak at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Combine watercress, mizuna, lettuce, basil, cucumber, and tomatoes in large bowl.  Add half of dressing and toss to coat.  Arrange greens mixture on large rimmed platter.

Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add onion and shallots and sautÃˆ 30 seconds.  Add beef with marinade.  SautÃˆ until beef is brown outside but still pink inside, about 4 minutes.  Add pineapple slices and stir until pineapple is heated through, about 1 minute longer.  Spoon steak mixture with any pan juices atop dressed greens mixture on platter.  Drizzle salad with remaining dressing and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Known in Asia as Shaking Beef Salad, or bo luc lac, this Vietnamese classic is made by shaking Ã³ essentially searing Ã³ steak in a very hot pan.  Jasmine rice or brown rice would be ideal alongside.

          Sweet-And-Sour Brisket With Shallots And New Potatoes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  orange juice
  5              large  soft dates (such as Medjool) -- pitted
  4              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
  5        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2             pounds  onions -- thinly sliced
  16             large  shallots -- peeled
  2 1/2           cups  low-salt chicken broth
  5             pounds  flat-cut (also called first-cut) brisket -- trimmed of
                        all but 1/4" of fat
  1 1/2           cups  canned tomato puree
  16                    red-skinned new potatoes -- scrubbed
                        = (abt 1" to 1 1/2" dia)

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Puree first 4 ingredients in blender until smooth.  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large wide ovenproof pot over medium-high heat.  Add onions and whole shallots.  SautÃˆ until onions are deep golden and shallots begin to brown, about 20 minutes.  Transfer shallots to small bowl; reserve.  Add chicken broth to onions; bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Pour onion mixture into large bowl.  Add 2 tablespoons oil to same pot.  Sprinkle brisket on all sides with salt and pepper.  Add to pot and brown well, about 5 minutes per side.  Turn brisket fat-side up.  Return onion mixture to pot.  Add tomato puree and orange juice mixture.  Bring to boil, stirring to blend sauce.

Cover pot; bake brisket 2 hours.  Add shallots and potatoes.  Cover; bake 1 hour.  Uncover; bake until brisket is tender, occasionally spooning sauce over, about 1 hour longer.  Let rest 30 minutes.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled.)

Scrape sauce off brisket.  Transfer brisket to work surface; slice thinly across grain, trimming any fat, if desired.  Overlap hot slices on platter or cold slices in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Surround with shallots and potatoes.  Rewarm sauce.  Spoon some sauce over.  Rewarm brisket, if necessary, in 350 degrees oven until heated through.  Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Roasting the meat uncovered during the last hour allows the sauce to reduce.  Serve with the Cauliflower-Leek Kugel With Almond-Herb Crust (see recipe) and steamed asparagus.  The brisket can be made two days ahead.

                     Warm Mushroom And Stilton Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         ounces  pancetta
  3              large  shallots
  1              pound  fresh chanterelle mushrooms
  2             ounces  Stilton
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  Sherry wine vinegar -- plus
  2          teaspoons  Sherry wine vinegar
  1                     bag Bordeaux lettuce mix - (4 to 5 oz)

Chop pancetta.  Thinly slice shallots.  Brush sand off 1 pound fresh chanterelle mushrooms and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Crumble Stilton.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the pancetta and shallots; sautÃˆ until beginning to brown.  Add 2 more tablespoons olive oil, then the mushrooms.  Sprinkle with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  SautÃˆ until the mushrooms are just tender, about 5 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon Sherry wine vinegar and boil until evaporated, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.

Pour lettuce mix into a shallow salad bowl.  Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and toss.  Add 2 teaspoons Sherry wine vinegar, season with salt and pepper, and toss again.  Add the mushrooms and cheese; toss lightly and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  SautÃˆed mushrooms are a classic steakhouse side dish.  Here they pair nicely with Stilton, the aristocratic English blue cheese.

Improv: Try a less pricey combo of baby bellas and shiitakes.  Instead of Stilton, go for Roquefort or Maytag blue.  Mâ€šche or arugula can stand in for the lettuce mix.

Chop pancetta.  Thinly slice shallots.  Brush sand off 1 pound fresh chanterelle mushrooms and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Crumble Stilton.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the pancetta and shallots; sautÃˆ until beginning to brown.  Add 2 more tablespoons olive oil, then the mushrooms.  Sprinkle with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  SautÃˆ until the mushrooms are just tender, about 5 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon Sherry wine vinegar and boil until evaporated, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour lettuce mix into a shallow salad bowl.  Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and toss.  Add 2 teaspoons Sherry wine vinegar, season with salt and pepper, and toss again.  Add the mushrooms and cheese; toss lightly and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  SautÃˆed mushrooms are a classic steakhouse side dish.  Here they pair nicely with Stilton, the aristocratic English blue cheese.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Improv: Try a less pricey combo of baby bellas and shiitakes.  Instead of Stilton, go for Roquefort or Maytag blue.  Mâ€šche or arugula can stand in for the lettuce mix.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     bacon slices -- chopped
  1              large  red bell pepper -- cut lengthwise
                        into thin strips

  2        tablespoons  sugar
  4             ounces  chilled soft fresh goat cheese -- crumbled

Cook bacon in large skillet over medium heat until brown and crisp.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.  Add bell pepper to drippings in skillet; sautÃˆ 2 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bell pepper to large bowl.  Add mushrooms to same skillet and sautÃˆ until tender and beginning to brown, about 4 minutes.  Add mushrooms to bowl with bell pepper and reserve skillet.  Add spinach and onion to same bowl.

Add oil, vinegar, and sugar to reserved skillet; bring to boil, whisking until sugar dissolves.  Season dressing with salt and pepper.  Toss salad with enough warm dressing from skillet to coat.  Divide salad among 4 plates.  Sprinkle with goat cheese.

Comments:  Daryl Getman of New York City, NY, writes: "I'm a second-year theater student at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, so most days are more about running from class to rehearsal to a performance than they are about cooking.  But since I moved out of the dorms last year, cooking has become my favorite distraction.  And on the weekends, it's my idea of a break."

Daryl likes to use top-notch applewood-smoked bacon for this salad.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bone-in leg of lamb - (5 3/4 lbs) -- well trimmed
  4              large  garlic cloves -- minced, divided
  3              large  garlic heads -- halved horizontally
  1              bunch  fresh thyme - (abt 1 oz)
  1             bottle  dry white wine - (750 ml)
                        = (such as Chardonnay)
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)

Preheat oven to 475 degrees.  Place lamb in large roasting pan.  Rub all over with half of minced garlic.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Place halved heads of garlic around lamb, cut-side up.  Scatter 1 bunch thyme over and around lamb.  Roast lamb 20 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Boil wine in large saucepan for 5 minutes.  Pour wine around lamb.  Cover and roast until lamb is very tender, about 2 hours 45 minutes longer.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool, uncovered, 1 hour.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm, covered, in 350 degree oven for 30 minutes before continuing.)

Transfer lamb and heads of garlic to platter.  Tent with foil.  Using slotted spoon, remove thyme sprigs and garlic skins from pan juices.  Place roasting pan over medium-high heat on stovetop.  Bring juices to boil.  Add butter and remaining minced garlic.  Boil until juices thicken slightly, about 12 minutes.  Season jus with salt and pepper.  Slice lamb; spoon jus over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Two elements make this dish special.  Usually the smaller shanks are braised, but a whole leg works just as well and looks more impressive.  Also, white wine is used for the braising instead of red.

What to drink:  A full-bodied Zinfandel.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed
                        = (half of a 17.3-oz package)
  1 1/2           cups  shredded mozzarella cheese
  6        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- plus
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2           cup  drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano
  1              small  zucchini -- cut thin rounds
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  half and half
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Roll out pastry on floured surface to 1/8-inch-thick square.  Trim pastry edges to form 13-inch round.  Transfer to 11-inch tart pan with removable bottom.  Fold in overhang to form double-thick sides.  Pierce with fork.  Cover; chill 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Line pastry with foil; fill with beans or pie weights.  Bake pastry until sides are set, about 20 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Bake crust until bottom is golden brown, pressing with back of fork if bubbles form, about 8 minutes.  Cool 5 minutes.

Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees.  Sprinkle mozzarella over bottom of crust.  Top with 6 tablespoons Parmesan, tomatoes, basil, green onions, and oregano.  Arrange zucchini rounds in concentric circles to cover top of tart.  Whisk eggs, half and half, salt, and pepper in medium bowl.  Pour mixture into tart.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan.

Bake tart until custard is set and crust is golden brown, about 35 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Using frozen puff pastry for the crust makes this quiche-like tart super-easy.
