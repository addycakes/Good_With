  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1            package  dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water
  1                cup  milk
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2                     eggs
  4 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour - (to 5)
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  chopped tart green apple
     1/4           cup  butter -- melted, divided
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2           cup  chopped pecans
                        === GLAZE ===
     3/4           cup  powdered sugar
  1         tablespoon  orange juice

Dissolve yeast in water.  Set aside until foamy.

Meanwhile, heat milk, sugar, butter and salt in a small saucepan to 110 degrees.

In a mixing bowl combine the milk mixture, yeast mixture and eggs; mixing well.  Add enough flour and stir until a soft dough forms.  Turn out onto a floured surface and knead dough 5 minutes or until elastic.

Oil a large bowl, place dough in bowl, turn to coat all sides; cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour.

Saute apples in 2 tablespoons butter until soft.  Remove from heat and add brown sugar, cinnamon, orange peel and pecans.  Mix well and set aside.

Once dough has risen, roll out on floured surface to an 11- by  9-inch rectangle.  Brush with remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter and top with apple mixture, leaving 1/2-inch border at edges.

Fold dough in thirds lengthwise to make 11- by 3-inch roll.  Cut crosswise into 12 equal pieces.  Arrange pieces, cut-side up, in greased 9-inch springform pan forming a ring.  Cover and let rise 40 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool on wire rack.  Remove from pan and place on a serving plate.  Combine glaze ingredients and drizzle over the ring and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COFFEE CAKE ===
  1 1/2           cups  flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  2                     eggs
     1/3           cup  skim milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine -- softened
  1              large  apple -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
                        === STREUSEL TOPPING ===
  3        tablespoons  flour
  3        tablespoons  powdered sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine -- chilled
                        === GLAZE ===
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  4          teaspoons  or more water

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9-inch round cake pan.

In a small bowl combine flour and baking powder.  Beat together eggs, milk and vanilla in another small bowl.  Next, combine sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl.  Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until creamy.  Alternately add flour mixture and egg mixture, beating well after each addition; end with flour mixture.

Spread batter into prepared cake pan.  Arrange apples on top, gently pressing into batter.  Bake for 20 minutes.

While the cake bakes, make the streusel topping by combining flour, powdered sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.  Cut in remaining 2 tablespoons butter until crumbly.

Next, make the glaze by mixing together powdered sugar and enough water to form a smooth consistency that's just thin enough to drizzle; set aside.

When cake is ready, sprinkle top with streusel topping.  Bake for 15 to 18 more minutes, or until toothpick inserted near center comes out clean.  Cool in pan on wire rack.  Drizzle with powdered sugar glaze.

This recipe yields 9 servings.

             Baked Banana-Stuffed French Toast With Streusel

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STUFFING ===
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  4                     firm ripe bananas -- sliced 1/4" rounds
                        === BREAD ===
  1                     unsliced loaf sourdough -- cut into 8 slices
                        about 1" thick
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  old-fashioned oats
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        === BATTER ===
  2 1/2           cups  milk
  6              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Maple syrup -- for accompaniment

Melt first four stuffing ingredients in a large saute pan.  Simmer on low heat for a few minutes.  Add bananas and saute for 5 more minutes.  Transfer to a bowl and cool.

Using a small paring knife, cut a slit into one side of the bread to make a pocket -- don't go through the other 3 sides of the bread.  Repeat with the remaining bread slices.  Use a teaspoon to stuff the banana mixture into the bread pockets.  Set aside.

Combine the topping ingredients until crumbly; place in another large shallow bowl.

Combine the batter ingredients together and beat well.  Pour into a 15- by 10- by 1-inch baking pan.  Arrange the stuffed bread slices in the batter and let soak for 10 minutes.  Turn and soak for 10 more minutes.

Generously grease another 15- by 10- by 1-inch baking pan (or set stuffed bread slices onto a sheet of waxed paper, wash and dry baking pan and then grease).

Dip one side of each stuffed bread into the sliced almonds and place almond-side up on the greased baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining slices.  Sprinkle any remaining almonds over the 8 slices.  Sprinkle the streusel topping evenly over the 8 slices.

Bake in a preheated 400 degrees oven for about 25 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve with maple syrup.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                        Maple syrup -- for accompaniment

Slice the loaf as follows: cut bread in 1/2-inch slices and then make pockets in bread by cutting slice down through slice not all the way through.

Peel the bananas and cut each one into 3 lengthwise slices; if you're using large bananas, cut them in half first.  Lay 3 slices inside each pocket, making a banana sandwich.  Sprinkle the tops of the bananas with a tablespoon of brown sugar and about 2 tablespoons of chopped nuts.

In a large bowl, lightly whisk the eggs until frothy, then whisk in the milk, sugar and vanilla.  Set aside.  Put 1 tablespoon of the butter in a skillet just slightly larger than your bread and place it on the burner with the heat off.

Make the banana cream:  Mash the banana with a potato masher and scrape it onto a plate.  Cover with plastic and place in the freezer.  Pour the cream into the same bowl you mashed the banana in and beat it with an electric mixer until it holds soft peaks.  Add powdered sugar and beat until it stiffens a little more, then beat the banana in on low speed.  Cover and refrigerate.

Begin heating the butter over medium heat.  Once it has melted, quickly rewhisk the egg mixture, then dip both sides of the sandwich into it, letting it saturate for 5 to 6 seconds.  Place the sandwich in the skillet and fry over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until golden brown.

If you would like to serve these all at once, put them on serving plates and hold in a preheated low oven.  Add another tablespoon of butter to the skillet and repeat for the remaining sandwiches.  This can be done with a larger skillet, but may cause some smoking from butter.

Serve hot with maple syrup and a big dollop of the banana cream on top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BERRY FILLING ===
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- softened
     1/2           cup  blackberry jam
                        = (or jam of your choice)
  1                     egg
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        === DOUGH ===
  2 1/4      teaspoons  dry yeast
     1/3           cup  warm water
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  4 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening
     1/4           cup  butter
  1 1/4           cups  buttermilk
                        Fresh blackberries for garnish -- (optional)

Beat ingredients for berry filling together with an electric mixer.

Proof the yeast in the warm water, mixed with a teaspoon of sugar, for 10 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, combine remaining dry ingredients.  Blend the butter and shortening with the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  Mix in the buttermilk and yeast mixture.  The dough will be slightly sticky.

Roll the dough out on a floured surface and press into a greased 10-inch bundt pan, leaving a well in the center for the filling.

Reserve 1/2 cup of the filling and spoon the remaining filling evenly into the well.  Press the dough together over the filling, completely enclosing it.

Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until cake is lightly brown.  Unmold onto a serving platter and allow to cool slightly.  Drizzle remaining filling over top.  Garnish with fresh berries, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  2        tablespoons  molasses
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1            package  dry yeast - (0.25 oz)
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1              large  egg
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  buckwheat flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Heat the milk in a 2-quart saucepan just until bubbles form around the side of the pan.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in the molasses and butter.  Allow to cool until just warm.

Place the warm water in a medium bowl.  Sprinkle the yeast over.  Stir.  Set aside to soften for 5 minutes.

Beat the egg into the yeast mixture.  Add the flours and salt, alternating with the warm milk mixture, stirring with a wire whisk until well blended.  Cover the batter with a cloth and let rise in a warm place, away from drafts, until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.

Preheat the waffle iron.

Ladle enough batter into the waffle iron to cover 2/3 of the grid.  Use a spatula to spread the batter to the edges.  Close the cover.  Cook until the steaming stops.  Remove the waffle from the iron.  Continue with the remaining batter.

This recipe yields about 6 waffles.

     1/2           cup  slivered almonds

Reserve 8 to 10 maraschino cherries for garnish; chop remaining cherries.  Combine chopped cherries, cream cheese, almonds, sugar and almond extract; mix well.

Unroll each can of crescent roll dough into 2 large rectangles; press firmly at edges and perforations to make one large rectangle.  Roll or pat into a 15- by 13-inch rectangle.

Spread cream cheese mixture over dough.  Roll up dough starting at long side of rectangle.  Place seam-side down on greased baking sheet.  Form into a ring, firmly pressing ends together.

Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Cakes
                Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  chopped figs
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2           cup  chopped pecans
  1 1/2           cups  2% milk
  2            packets  active dry yeast
  8 3/4           cups  flour -- divided
  1 1/2           cups  butter or margarine
  3                     eggs
     3/4      teaspoon  salt

Combine figs and water in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 3 minutes, or until thickened, stirring constantly.  Stir in chopped pecans and remove from heat; set aside to cool.

In another small saucepan, scald milk (bubbles should form just around the edges) then remove from heat and cool to 105 to 115 degrees.  Sprinkle yeast over milk and let stand for 5 minutes.  Add 1 cup flour, mix well, then let sit undisturbed for 1 hour.

In a large bowl, cream butter and 3/4 cups of flour with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.  Stir in yeast until well blended.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add salt and up to 7 cups of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.  Place in a lightly greased bowl, turning to grease both sides.  Let rise, covered, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.

Divide dough in half and roll each portion into a 12- by 16-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface.  Cut one of the rectangles into (4) 3- by 16-inch strips.  Spread fig filling on each strip and roll up, starting from one of the long sides, like a jelly roll; seal seam.  Braid 3 of the jelly rolls, then fashion into a wreath, pinching ends together; place on a cookie sheet.  Use remaining roll to fashion a bow and attach to wreath, over the spot where ends are pinched together.  Repeat with remaining rectangle.  Cover each wreath and let rise, covered, for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Bake wreaths for 30 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack.

This recipe yields 24 servings.

Tip:  For a shinier finish, brush each wreath with a mixture of beaten egg yolk thinned with a little water, right before baking.

Add salt and up to 7 cups of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.  Place in a lightly greased bowl, turning to grease both sides.  Let rise, covered, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide dough in half and roll each portion into a 12- by 16-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface.  Cut one of the rectangles into (4) 3- by 16-inch strips.  Spread fig filling on each strip and roll up, starting from one of the long sides, like a jelly roll; seal seam.  Braid 3 of the jelly rolls, then fashion into a wreath, pinching ends together; place on a cookie sheet.  Use remaining roll to fashion a bow and attach to wreath, over the spot where ends are pinched together.  Repeat with remaining rectangle.  Cover each wreath and let rise, covered, for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake wreaths for 30 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 24 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tip:  For a shinier finish, brush each wreath with a mixture of beaten egg yolk thinned with a little water, right before baking.

                        === CINNAMON SYRUP ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  dark corn syrup
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

  1                     egg
  2                     egg whites

For the French Toast:  In a medium bowl, whisk together egg, egg whites, milk, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and baking powder.  Place slices of white bread in a shallow bowl and pour egg mixture on top, covering evenly.

Heat oil and butter in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until butter is melted and foaming slightly.  Cook French toast 2 or 3 slices at a time until brown, 2 or 3 minutes, turning once to brown both sides.  Serve warm with Cinnamon Syrup.

                              Irish Oatmeal

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 3     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Cereal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  water
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  steel cut oats
     1/4           cup  millet
                        Golden raisins
                        Dried cranberries
                        Sliced almonds
                        Half-and-half or milk -- for accompaniment

In a medium saucepan, add water and salt.  Bring to a boil then stir in oats and millet.  Reduce heat to low.  Cover and allow to cook, simmering gently, for 15 to 20 minutes until grain is tender and water is absorbed.  It is not necessary to stir the oatmeal as it is cooking.

Spoon into serving bowls and top with raisins, dried cranberries and almonds and drizzle with half-and-half or milk.

Serves 3 to 4.

Comments:  Steel cut oats are the secret to the firmer, heartier texture of this cereal.  Steel cut oats are readily available through most health food stores.

                             Oatmeal Porridge

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 3     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Cereal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  water
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  steel-cut oats
                        = (also called Irish oatmeal and
                        Scotch oats)

Bring water and salt to a boil in medium saucepan.  Stir in oats and reduce heat to a simmer.  Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes or until the grains have absorbed most of the water.  Remove from heat and serve immediately, or if a thicker texture is desired, cover saucepan and let sit for a few minutes.

Serving suggestion:  Sweeten with a desired sweetner such as raw suger, granulated sugar, brown sugar or honey and drizzle with a small amount of milk, half-and-half or heavy cream.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Cook's Note:  To toast steel-cut oats, place them in a preheated 300 degree oven for approximately 20 minutes.  Cool and place any unused portion in a tightly covered container, storing in a cool place.  Toasted oats cook in half the time.

Description:
  "The cut grain of steel-cut oats means they take longer to cook than
  rolled oats -- but the distinctive texture makes it all worthwhile! 
  As an added treat, toss in some raisins, chopped dates or other dried
  or fresh fruits and nuts just before serving."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BUTTER CRUST PASTRY DOUGH ===
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/4" bits
  2        tablespoons  lard -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/4" bits
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3        tablespoons  ice water - (to 4)
                        === CREAM PUFF DOUGH ===
  2               cups  water
  1                cup  butter or margarine - (2 sticks)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  8                     eggs
                        === ICING ===
  1 1/2           cups  powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  3        tablespoons  orange juice
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice

Butter Crust Pastry Dough:  In a large, chilled bowl, combine the butter, lard, flour, salt and sugar.  With your fingertips rub the flour and fat together until they look like coarse meal.  Do not let the mixture become oily.  Pour 3 tablespoons of ice water over the mixture all at once, toss together lightly, and gather the dough into a ball.  If the dough crumbles, add up to 1 tablespoon more ice water by drops until the particles adhere.  Dust the pastry with a little flour and wrap it in wax paper.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before using.

When chilled, roll out onto floured board into a large rectangle square.  Cut into 3 strips approximately 3-inches wide.  Place on lightly greased cookie sheet or sponge cake pan.  Return to refrigerator while making second layer.

Cream Puff Dough:  Heat oven to 400 degrees.  In medium saucepan, heat water, butter and salt to rolling boil.  Add flour all at once; stir vigorously over low heat about 1 minute or until mixture leaves side of pan and forms a ball.

Remove from heat; add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition until smooth and velvety.  Spoon puff dough onto cut strips of pie dough.

Bake 30 to 40 minutes, until golden brown.  Be sure to watch pie dough that it does not burn.

Cool and frost with Icing.

Icing:  Mix ingredients together and frost bars.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.
