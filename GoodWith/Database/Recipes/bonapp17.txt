  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
  2               cups  frozen unsweetened boysenberries - (abt 8 
                        = (or blackberries
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  Passover brandy
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  4 1/2         pounds  Golden Delicious apples - (abt 9 med-lg) -- peeled, cored,
                        and each cut into 12 wedges
  1                     Passover sponge cake - (13 oz)
  2               cups  sliced almonds -- toasted
  12                    soft almond macaroons -- finely crumbled,
                        = (about 1 1/2 cups)
  6        tablespoons  unsalted margarine - (3/4 stick) -- melted, cooled
     1/2           cup  apricot preserves
  2        tablespoons  Passover brandy
  1 1/2           cups  chilled whipping cream
  3        tablespoons  sugar
                        Additional toasted sliced almonds

Combine first 5 ingredients in heavy large saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves and syrup comes to simmer.  Using slotted spoon, transfer berries to small bowl.

Add half of apple slices to simmering syrup and cook until tender and just translucent, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer apples to sieve set over large bowl.  Press apples to extract excess syrup.  Reserve syrup.  Transfer apples to another bowl.  Repeat cooking and draining with remaining apples.

Return berries and drained syrup to same saucepan.  Boil syrup until thickened and reduced to 1 2/3 cups, about 5 minutes.  Transfer boysenberry sauce to small bowl.  Cover and refrigerate.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Coat 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides with margarine.

Crumble cake onto large baking sheet.  Bake until crumbs are dry and just beginning to color, about 15 minutes.  Cool.  Maintain oven temperature.  Finely grind crumbled cake in processor.

Sprinkle 1/3 of cake crumbs in bottom of prepared pan.  Sprinkle 2/3 cup almonds over.  Sprinkle 1/3 of macaroons over.  Top with half of apple slices.  Mix apricot preserves and brandy in small bowl.  Spread half of apricot mixture over apples.  Repeat layering with half of remaining crumbs, almonds, macaroons and margarine.  Press top firmly to compact cake.

Place cake on baking sheet.  Bake until top is golden and cake just begins to shrink from sides of pan, covering loosely with foil for last 15 minutes if browning too quickly, about 45 minutes.  Transfer cake to rack.  Press top firmly to compact cake.  Cool cake in pan on rack.  Cover and chill overnight.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.)

Run small sharp knife around sides of pan to loosen cake.  Release pan sides.  Whip cream and 3 tablespoons sugar to firm peaks.  Spread cream over top and sides of cake.  Press additional almond slices onto sides of cake.  Refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.

Cut cake into wedges.  Spoon reserved boysenberry sauce over.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Loaded with fruit, this dessert is cut and served as you would a cake, but the texture is that of a pudding.  To keep the meal kosher when your menu includes meat, omit the whipped cream frosting and serve this with nondairy topping and the berry sauce.  Begin the cake a day ahead.

  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 3/4           cups  blue cornmeal
                        = (available at natural foods stores and
                        specialty foods stores or use yellow
                        cornmeal)
  1                cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  whole milk

     1/2           cup  buttermilk
  1 1/2           cups  frozen corn kernels -- thawed, drained

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.

Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, pine nuts, baking powder, baking soda and salt in large bowl to blend.  Whisk milk, vegetable oil, eggs and buttermilk in medium bowl to blend.  Add milk mixture to dry ingredients and whisk until just blended.  Fold in corn kernels.

Pour batter into prepared dish.  Bake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.  Cut bread into 2-inch squares and serve warm.

This recipe yields about 28 pieces.

Comments:  "Coyotes Deli & Grill in Banff makes the most amazing blue corn bread," writes Donna SanchÈ of Toronto, Ontario.  "My husband and I had dinner there not long ago, and enjoyed the entire meal -- but the corn bread was definitely the highlight.  I've told all of my friends about it, and now I'd like to make it for them."

This sweet corn bread is best served warm.  If you can't find blue cornmeal, don't worry: Yellow cornmeal works well, too.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  24                    fresh sage leaves

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add onion; cover and cook until soft, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes.  Add chopped sage; stir 1 minute.  Add squash and broth.  Increase heat to high and bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until squash is tender, about 25 minutes.  Cool slightly.

Puree soup in batches in blender until smooth.  Return soup to pot.  Mix in cheese.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly, then cover and refrigerate.)

Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add sage leaves and sautÈ until brown and toasted, about 2 minutes.  Bring soup to simmer.  Ladle into bowls.  Garnish with fried sage leaves.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Fried sage leaves make a crispy garnish.  Try them also crumbled on mashed potatoes and sautÈed vegetables.

                Thanksgiving

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onion
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  2 1/4      teaspoons  ground cardamom
  1              large  garlic clove
  1                     boneless pork rib roast - (4 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  mushrooms -- halved
  2               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  butter -- room temperature

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Puree 1/2 cup chopped onion, 2 tablespoons oil, 2 teaspoons cardamom, and garlic in processor.  Spread 1/2 cup chopped onion in center of large roasting pan; top with pork.  Sprinkle pork generously with salt and pepper; coat with onion puree.  Toss mushrooms, remaining 1/2 cup onion, and 3 tablespoons oil in bowl; sprinkle with salt and pepper; arrange around pork.

Roast pork 1 hour.  Spoon mushrooms into large saucepan.  Add 1 1/2 cups broth to roasting pan.  Roast pork until thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 145 degrees, about 20 minutes longer.  Transfer pork to platter; tent loosely with foil (temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees as roast stands).

Scrape juices from roasting pan into saucepan with mushrooms.  Add cream, remaining 1/2 cup broth, and 1/4 teaspoon cardamom to pan; bring to boil.  Blend flour and butter in small cup; mix into mushroom sauce.  Cook sauce, stirring often, until reduced enough to coat spoon, about 5 minutes.  Season sauce with salt and pepper; serve with pork.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  "I have a 'stragglers Thanksgiving' -- that's what I call it -- at my house every year," writes Frances Teasley of North Hollywood, California.  "I know a lot of people who, like me, don't have any family nearby.  Thirteen years ago I started inviting a few people for dinner.  And that small holiday gathering has become a big tradition among my friends.  For weekday meals, I look for shortcuts and do-aheads.  But for holiday meals, I like to do everything the same day because I love the smell of cooking that fills the house."

An impressive holiday entrÈe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  dried ancho chilies - (abt 1 oz)
                        = (available at Latin American markets,
                        specialty foods stores and some
                        supermarkets)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano
  1 1/4      teaspoons  coarse salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1              large  garlic clove -- pressed
  1           teaspoon  chopped canned chipotle chilies -- see * Note
  1           teaspoon  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  water -- more or less
  4                     salmon fillets with skin - (6 oz ea)
                        Lime wedges

* Note:  Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

Cut ancho chilies in half lengthwise; seed and stem.  Heat heavy large skillet over medium-high heat; add chilies and stir until chilies look dry and darken slightly in color, turning occasionally, about 2 1/2 minutes.  Cool completely.

Break chilies into 1/2-inch pieces.  Grind coarsely in spice mill or coffee mill.  Add oregano and grind to blend.  Transfer to small bowl.  Mix in salt and sugar.  Stir in garlic, chipotle chilies, and lime juice.  Whisk in oil.  Add enough water to thin to spreadable consistency (about 1 tablespoon).  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spread 2 generous teaspoons chili mixture over each salmon fillet.  Place on rimmed baking sheet.  Bake until salmon is opaque in center, about 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "About a year ago, I discovered a new restaurant in town called Babalu's," writes Richard Shipman of St. Louis, Missouri.  "It serves terrific Caribbean food, including a flavorful chili-coated salmon."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
                        Unsweetened cocoa powder
  1 1/2           cups  diced pitted prunes - (abt 8 oz)
  1                cup  prune juice
  1                cup  unsalted margarine - (2 sticks)
  8             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
     3/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped toasted walnuts -- (abt 4 oz)
  8              large  eggs -- room temperature
  2              large  egg yolks
  1 3/4           cups  sugar
  1            pinches  salt
                        === GLAZE ===
  1                cup  prune juice
     1/4           cup  unsalted margarine - (1/2 stick)
  10            ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  24                    walnut halves

For Cake:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Dust pan with cocoa powder.  Tap out excess.  Wrap outside of pan with heavy-duty foil.

Place prunes in small bowl.  Pour 1 cup prune juice over.  Set aside to macerate 15 minutes.

Melt margarine in heavy medium saucepan over low heat.  Add chocolate and whisk until smooth.  Remove from heat.  Add 3/4 cup cocoa powder and whisk until smooth.  Mix in walnuts and prune mixture.  Cool to lukewarm.

Using electric mixer, beat eggs, yolks, sugar and salt in large bowl at medium speed until well blended and just beginning to foam, about 1 minute.  Add chocolate mixture and stir until well blended.  Transfer batter to prepared springform pan.

Set springform pan into large baking pan.  Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of springform pan.  Set baking pan in oven and bake cake until top looks dry and crusty and tester inserted into center comes out with some moist crumbs attached, about 1 hour 5 minutes.  Cool cake in pan on rack 30 minutes.  Place in refrigerator uncovered and chill overnight.

For Glaze:  Bring juice and margarine to boil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and whisk until smooth.  Cool until thick but still pourable, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.

Line baking sheet with foil.  Dip walnuts halfway into glaze.  Arrange on prepared sheet and refrigerate until chocolate is set.

Meanwhile, using small sharp knife, cut around sides of cake to loosen.  Release pan sides.  Set cake on rack.  Pour glaze over cake and spread to coat completely.  Arrange walnuts, chocolate half at outer edge, around top cake.  Refrigerate until glaze is completely set, at least 3 hours.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Cover loosely with foil or cake dome and keep refrigerated.)  Cut cake into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  Because the torte is so rich, a small piece really satisfies.  Start preparing this the day before you plan to serve it.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === EGG SHELLS ===
  2 1/2         pounds  imported bittersweet chocolate -- chopped, see * Note
  3              large  plastic egg mold sets
                        = (total of six 4 1/4" by 3" half-cup egg

                        === CARAMEL FILLING ===
  3               cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  water

     1/3           cup  sour cream
                        === CHOCOLATE FILLING ===
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut into pieces
  1              pound  imported bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  6        tablespoons  sour cream
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
                        Reserved chocolate in double boiler
                        === TO DECORATE ===
  8                     yards of colorfast silk ribbons -- more or less

* Note:  Or imported white chocolate (such as Lindt or Callebaut) or 1 1/4 pounds of each chocolate.  Do not use unsweetened chocolate.

To make Egg Shells:  Line cookie sheet with aluminum foil.  Melt chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently until smooth and candy thermometer registers 115 degrees for bittersweet and 105 degrees for white chocolate.  (If making both bittersweet chocolate and white chocolate eggs, melt chocolates separately in two double boilers.)

Remove chocolate from over water.  Spoon chocolate into 1 set of large egg molds, filling molds completely (do not fill decorative base section of mold).  Turn mold over above prepared cookie sheet, allowing excess chocolate to spill out.  Shake mold to produce uniformly thick shell.  Turn mold right side up.  Run fingertip gently around edge of eggs to remove excess chocolate.  Refrigerate.

Tilt foil-lined sheet with melted chocolate over top of double boiler, scraping chocolate into double boiler.  Reheat to 115 degrees for bittersweet and 105 degrees for white chocolate, stirring frequently.  Repeat coating process with remaining 2 large egg mold sets and 2 small egg mold sets, removing chocolate from over water while working and reheating chocolate after each set of egg molds is coated.  Refrigerate molds.  (If using white chocolate, the molds will need a double coating.  Refrigerate molds after first coating is cold.  Refill with barely lukewarm chocolate, shake out excess and wipe edges clean, creating double-thick shell.)  Return remaining chocolate on foil to top of double boiler and set aside.  Refrigerate molds while making caramel filling.

To make Caramel Filling:  Stir sugar and water in heavy large saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, washing down sides of pan with pastry brush dipped into water and swirling pan occasionally.

Remove from heat.  Add whipping cream and butter (mixture will bubble vigorously) and whisk until smooth.  Whisk in sour cream.  Let caramel filling stand just until barely cool (mixture will be sticky), stirring occasionally, about 50 minutes.

Spoon 2 scant tablespoons caramel into each small egg half.  Spoon 1/4 cup caramel into each large egg half.  Refrigerate while making chocolate filling.

To make Chocolate Filling:  Bring whipping cream and butter to simmer in heavy medium saucepan, stirring until butter melts.  Add chocolate and whisk until smooth and melted.  Remove chocolate filling from heat.  Whisk in sour cream.  Let stand until cool but still pourable, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Spoon filling over caramel in all egg halves, filling to 1/16-inch below top edge.  Chill until set, about 40 minutes.

To Assemble:  Rewarm reserved melted chocolate in top of double boiler to 115 degrees for bittersweet and 105 degrees for white chocolate.  Remove chocolate from over water.  Working quickly, spread enough melted chocolate (use bittersweet for dark eggs and white chocolate for white eggs) atop 1 set of filled eggs just to cover.  Use icing spatula to scrape excess chocolate from eggs and clean sides.  Place mold in refrigerator.  Repeat with remaining egg molds.  Refrigerate all molds until chocolate is firm, about 1 hour.

Line cookie sheets with aluminum foil.  Remove 1 egg mold from refrigerator.  Turn mold over onto foil.  Gently bend and twist mold side to side several times to release halves of chocolate eggs.  Repeat unmolding process with remaining eggs.

Rewarm remaining melted chocolate in top of double boiler until warm to touch.  Turn bottom half of 1 egg over so flat sides face up.  Spread small amount of melted chocolate over flat side of egg, leaving 1/4-inch border.  Working quickly, cover bottom half of egg with corresponding top half of egg and press together gently.  Refrigerate whole egg.  Repeat with remaining egg halves and melted chocolate.  (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead.  Store in airtight container in refrigerator.)

To Decorate:  Wrap ribbons around seam of each egg and tie bow at top.  Refrigerate until ready to eat.  Serve eggs chilled.

This recipe yields 3 large eggs and 4 small eggs.

Comments:  It's important to use an imported chocolate, such as Lindt or Callebaut, for this recipe.  The high cocoa-butter content of the imported type produces chocolate eggs that are more flexible and easier to remove from the molds.  You can make all the eggs out of white chocolate, all out of bitter-sweet chocolate or a few from each.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  6             slices  bacon -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  12                    chicken thighs with skin and bones -- excess fat trimmed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  chopped shallots - (abt 4)
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  boiling onions -- peeled
  12            ounces  crimini mushrooms -- quartered (5 cups)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh marjoram
  1             bottle  red Zinfandel - (750 ml)
  2               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick) -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh chives

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place 1 cup flour in shallow dish.

Cook chopped bacon in heavy large pot over medium-high heat until crisp, about 4 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper-towel-lined plate to drain.  Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon drippings in pot.  Sprinkle chicken thighs with salt and pepper.  Working in batches, coat chicken thighs with flour and add to pot; sear until brown, about 4 minutes per side.  Arrange chicken thighs in 15- by 10- by 2-inch glass baking dish.

Pour off all but 3 tablespoons fat from pot.  Add shallots and garlic to pot and sautÈ 1 minute.  Add onions, crimini mushrooms, and marjoram and sautÈ until onions begin to brown, about 10 minutes.  Add red Zinfandel and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Add chicken stock and bacon; boil 5 minutes.  Pour wine mixture over chicken in baking dish.  Cover tightly with foil; bake until chicken is cooked through, about 1 hour.

Using tongs, transfer chicken thighs to platter.  Strain wine mixture from baking dish into heavy medium saucepan.  Transfer onion and mushroom mixture to platter with chicken; tent with foil to keep warm.

Mix 2 tablespoons flour and butter in small bowl to blend.  Bring wine mixture to boil.  Whisk in flour mixture and boil until sauce thickens and is reduced to 2 3/4 cups, about 8 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Ladle sauce over chicken and vegetables; sprinkle with chives.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "While traveling in the Northern California wine country with friends," writes Stephen Carkeet of Merced, California, "we ate dinner at Zin Restaurant & Wine Bar in Healdsburg and had one of the best meals I can remember.  Chef Jeff Mall prepared a wonderful chicken dish he called 'coq au Zin.' It was a winner."

A taste -- and word -- play on the classic French dish coq au vin, this time made with red Zinfandel.  At the restaurant, this is served with creamy mashed potatoes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  2                     loaves country-style white
                        sourdough bread - (14.5 oz ea) -- crusts trimmed,

  4          teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  4          teaspoons  dried oregano
     3/4           cup  raisins
     3/4           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil - (to 3/4)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              large  eggs -- beaten to blend
                        Canned low-salt chicken broth -- as needed

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spray 2 large rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray.

Place half of bread pieces in large bowl.  Add 3 tablespoons oil and toss to coat, then add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and toss.  Spread bread in single layer on 1 prepared sheet.  Repeat with remaining bread, 3 tablespoons oil, and 1/2 cup cheese; spread on second sheet.  Bake bread until golden, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Cool on sheets.  Transfer to very large bowl.

Melt 1/4 cup butter with remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onions, celery, and bell peppers; sautÈ until vegetables begin to brown and are almost tender, about 15 minutes.  Add chopped garlic, rosemary, and oregano; stir 1 minute.

Add enough broth to remaining stuffing to moisten slightly (1/4 to 3/4 cup, depending on amount of remaining stuffing).  Generously butter baking dish.  Spoon remaining stuffing into prepared dish.  Cover with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake stuffing in dish along side turkey until heated through, about 25 minutes.  Uncover stuffing.  Bake until top of stuffing is slightly crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer.

To bake all of stuffing in baking dish:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter 15- by 10- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Add enough extra broth to stuffing to moisten (3/4 cup to 1 1/4 cups).  Transfer stuffing to prepared dish.  Cover with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake until heated through, about 40 minutes.  Uncover and bake until top is slightly crisp and golden, about 20 minutes longer.

Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup basil over stuffing and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  onions -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     bacon slices -- coarsely chopped
  3 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  baking powder
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3               cups  chilled whipping cream
  1              large  egg -- beaten, for glaze

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Mix onions, herbs, and oil in bowl.  Spread on large rimmed baking sheet; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast until golden, stirring twice, about 30 minutes.  Cool.  Maintain oven temperature.

Cook bacon in medium skillet until crisp and brown.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.

Blend flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in large bowl.  Mix in bacon and half of roasted onion mixture.  Mix in cream, tossing just until dry ingredients are evenly moistened; do not overmix.

Turn dough out onto floured work surface.  Knead for 5 turns to combine well.  Shape into 18-inch-long log.  Cut crosswise into eighteen 1-inch-thick rounds.  Arrange rounds on baking sheet, spacing evenly apart.  Brush each with glaze; top each with some of remaining onion mixture, pressing to adhere.

Bake biscuits until golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 18 biscuits.

Comments:  Cream takes the place of butter in these irresistible biscuits.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOOD CAKE ===
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1                cup  buttermilk
     2/3           cup  vegetable oil
  2                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1 1/4      teaspoons  baking soda
                        === FROSTING ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
     1/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  2               cups  powdered sugar
     2/3           cup  sour cream -- more or less

For Food Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour two 8-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides.

Whisk first 5 ingredients in large bowl to blend.  Sift in flour, cocoa and baking soda.  Stir to combine.  Divide batter between prepared pans.  Bake until toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Cool in pans on racks 10 minutes.  Turn cakes out onto racks and cool completely.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Wrap cakes separately in plastic wrap and store at room temperature.)

Place 1 cake layer on plate.  Spread with 1/2 cup frosting.  Top with second cake layer.  Spread top and sides of cake with remaining frosting.  (Can be prepared up to 8 hours ahead.  Cover with cake dome and let stand at room temperature.)

For Frosting:  Melt unsalted butter and chocolate in heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly until smooth.  Transfer to large bowl.  Whisk in cocoa powder and vanilla.  Whisk in 1 cup sugar and 1/3 cup sour cream.  Whisk in remaining 1 cup sugar.  Gradually whisk in enough of remaining sour cream to form spreadable frosting.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A quick one-bowl cake perfect for a last-minute birthday celebration or part dessert.  Use the Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting recipe or your favorite purchased one.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GARLIC PASTE ===
  6              large  garlic heads -- unpeeled, and
                        top 1/3" cut off to expose garlic
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === TURKEY AND GRAVY ===
  1                     turkey - (18 to 19 lbs) neck -- gizzard,
                        and heart reserved
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2              large  celery stalks -- chopped
  1              large  carrot -- chopped
  2 1/2           cups  dry white wine
  7               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth -- more or less
  2             pounds  mushrooms -- thickly sliced
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For garlic paste:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Arrange garlic, cut-side up, in 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Drizzle with 6 tablespoons oil.  Cover dish with foil.  Bake until garlic is very tender but not yet brown, about 1 hour 20 minutes.  Uncover and cool 45 minutes.

Squeeze garlic cloves to remove from peel.  Place 1 cup garlic cloves in processor (reserve remainder for another use).  Add butter, rosemary, mustard, salt, and pepper.  Process until almost smooth.  Transfer paste to small bowl.  (Can be made 4 days ahead.  Cover; chill.)

For turkey and gravy:  Set rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry.  Starting at neck end, carefully slide hand between skin and breast meat to loosen skin.  Rub 1/2 cup garlic paste over breast meat under skin.

If stuffing turkey, spoon stuffing into neck and main cavities.  Tuck wings under; tie legs together loosely to hold shape.  Place turkey on small rack set in large roasting pan.  Rub 2/3 cup garlic paste all over outside of turkey; reserve remaining paste for gravy.  Place reserved turkey parts, onion, celery, and carrot in pan around turkey.  Boil wine in medium saucepan 2 minutes.  Pour 1 cup wine and 1 cup broth into pan.

Roast turkey 1 hour.  Pour 1 cup broth over turkey; cover turkey breast loosely with foil.  Roast 1 hour.  Pour 1 cup wine and 1 cup broth over turkey.  Cover breast and top of drumsticks loosely with foil.  Roast turkey 1 hour.  Pour 1/2 cup broth over turkey.  Roast uncovered until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, covering any exposed parts of turkey with foil as necessary if over-browning, about 1 hour 10 minutes longer for unstuffed turkey and 1 hour 45 minutes for stuffed.

Remove from oven.  Using bulb baster, transfer any juices from main cavity of unstuffed turkey to turkey roasting pan.  Transfer turkey to platter; let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase 5 to 10 degrees).

Pour turkey pan juices into medium bowl; scrape in any browned bits from pan.  Spoon off fat from top of juices, reserving 3 tablespoons fat.  Strain juices into large glass measuring cup, pressing hard on solids.  Add remaining 1/2 cup wine and enough chicken broth to turkey pan juices to measure 6 cups.

Heat reserved 3 tablespoons turkey fat in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms; sautÈ until brown and juices evaporate, about 18 minutes.  Mix in remaining garlic paste.  Sprinkle with flour and stir until flour begins to brown, about 2 minutes.  Gradually whisk in 6 cups broth mixture.  Bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Boil until gravy coats spoon lightly, about 8 minutes; season with salt and pepper.  Serve turkey with gravy.

This recipe yields 12 to 14 servings.

Comments:  A rich paste of roasted garlic and fresh rosemary is rubbed under the skin and over the bird.  It also gives a boost to the gravy.

For garlic paste:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Arrange garlic, cut-side up, in 8- by 8- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Drizzle with 6 tablespoons oil.  Cover dish with foil.  Bake until garlic is very tender but not yet brown, about 1 hour 20 minutes.  Uncover and cool 45 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Squeeze garlic cloves to remove from peel.  Place 1 cup garlic cloves in processor (reserve remainder for another use).  Add butter, rosemary, mustard, salt, and pepper.  Process until almost smooth.  Transfer paste to small bowl.  (Can be made 4 days ahead.  Cover; chill.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For turkey and gravy:  Set rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry.  Starting at neck end, carefully slide hand between skin and breast meat to loosen skin.  Rub 1/2 cup garlic paste over breast meat under skin.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If stuffing turkey, spoon stuffing into neck and main cavities.  Tuck wings under; tie legs together loosely to hold shape.  Place turkey on small rack set in large roasting pan.  Rub 2/3 cup garlic paste all over outside of turkey; reserve remaining paste for gravy.  Place reserved turkey parts, onion, celery, and carrot in pan around turkey.  Boil wine in medium saucepan 2 minutes.  Pour 1 cup wine and 1 cup broth into pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast turkey 1 hour.  Pour 1 cup broth over turkey; cover turkey breast loosely with foil.  Roast 1 hour.  Pour 1 cup wine and 1 cup broth over turkey.  Cover breast and top of drumsticks loosely with foil.  Roast turkey 1 hour.  Pour 1/2 cup broth over turkey.  Roast uncovered until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, covering any exposed parts of turkey with foil as necessary if over-browning, about 1 hour 10 minutes longer for unstuffed turkey and 1 hour 45 minutes for stuffed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from oven.  Using bulb baster, transfer any juices from main cavity of unstuffed turkey to turkey roasting pan.  Transfer turkey to platter; let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase 5 to 10 degrees).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour turkey pan juices into medium bowl; scrape in any browned bits from pan.  Spoon off fat from top of juices, reserving 3 tablespoons fat.  Strain juices into large glass measuring cup, pressing hard on solids.  Add remaining 1/2 cup wine and enough chicken broth to turkey pan juices to measure 6 cups.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat reserved 3 tablespoons turkey fat in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms; sautÈ until brown and juices evaporate, about 18 minutes.  Mix in remaining garlic paste.  Sprinkle with flour and stir until flour begins to brown, about 2 minutes.  Gradually whisk in 6 cups broth mixture.  Bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Boil until gravy coats spoon lightly, about 8 minutes; season with salt and pepper.  Serve turkey with gravy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 12 to 14 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  A rich paste of roasted garlic and fresh rosemary is rubbed under the skin and over the bird.  It also gives a boost to the gravy.

Scrape down sides of bowl and dough hook.  Continue to beat until very soft, slightly sticky dough forms, about 5 minutes longer.  Let stand 5 minutes.  Scrape dough into large oiled bowl; cover with plastic.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare Topping:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine grapes, 1 tablespoon oil, and 1 teaspoon thyme in medium bowl; toss to coat.  Turn mixture out onto small rimmed baking sheet.  Roast until grapes begin to burst, about 10 minutes.  Cool completely on sheet.

Sprinkle large baking sheet lightly with cornmeal.  Turn dough out onto prepared sheet.  Using floured fingertips, pull and spread dough to approximate 18- by 10-inch rectangle.  Press dough all over with fingertips to dimple.  Brush dough with additional oil.  Sprinkle with grapes, then remaining 1 teaspoon thyme, walnuts, rosemary, and lemon peel.  Sprinkle with raw sugar and lightly with coarsely cracked black pepper.  Cover loosely with towel; let rise until light and puffy, about 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake focaccia until golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Transfer to board; brush edges with oil.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  This bread uses a yeast starter that needs to be made at least one day ahead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1            package  cranberries - (12 oz)
  2               cans  apricot halves in light syrup - (15 oz ea) -- drained, chopped
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  orange juice
                        === CRUST ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  hazelnuts -- toasted
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/4           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2              large  egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  apricot jam
  1           teaspoon  water

For Filling:  Combine cranberries, apricots, sugar, and orange juice in heavy large saucepan.  Bring to boil over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring often, until filling is thick, beginning to stick to pan bottom and reduced to scant 3 cups, about 15 minutes.  Cool completely.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and chill.)

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine 1 cup flour and nuts in processor; blend until nuts are finely ground.  Add remaining 1 cup flour, sugar, baking powder, and cinnamon; blend 15 seconds.  Add butter and cut in, using on/off turns, until coarse meal forms.  Add egg yolks, orange peel, and vanilla and process until moist clumps form.

Gather dough into ball; divide in half.  Flatten half of dough into disk; wrap and freeze 10 minutes.  Press remaining half of dough over bottom and up sides of 10-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Spread filling evenly in crust.

Roll out chilled dough between sheets of parchment paper to 11-inch round.  Peel off paper.  Cut dough into 1-inch-wide strips.  Place 5 strips across top of tart, spacing 1 inch apart.  Top with 5 strips arranged in opposite direction, forming lattice.  Trim ends of strips; press to crust edge to seal.

Bake tart until golden brown, about 40 minutes.  Place tart on rack.  Stir jam and 1 teaspoon water in small saucepan over medium heat until mixture boils.  Brush hot glaze over lattice strips.  Cool tart completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover loosely with foil and let stand at room temperature.)  Push up pan bottom to release tart.  Cut tart into wedges.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  A classic Austrian tart gets an American update with this cranberry and apricot filling.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  2                     baskets strawberries - (12 oz ea) -- hulled, diced
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  Passover brandy
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1              pinch  ground cloves
                        === CRUST ===
                        Matzo cake meal
  2               cups  husked toasted hazelnuts
  1                cup  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  ground cloves
  1              large  egg
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
  3                     baskets strawberries - (1 pint ea) -- hulled, and
                        thinly sliced

For Filling:  Combine all ingredients in heavy large skillet.  Stir over high heat until sugar dissolves and mixture comes to boil.  Boil until very thick, stirring frequently, about 13 minutes.  Cool in pan.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Transfer to small bowl, cover and refrigerate.)

For Crust:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Line 11-inch tart pan with removable bottom with heavy-duty foil, pressing firmly into scalloped sides of pan.  Grease foil and dust with matzo cake meal.

Finely grind nuts, sugar, salt and cloves in processor.  Add egg and extract and process until mixture just holds together.  Reserve 1/2 cup dough for another use.  Using moistened fingertips, press remaining dough onto bottom and up sides of prepared pan.

Bake until crust is golden, crinkled and feels dry, about 13 minutes.  Cool crust completely in pan on rack.  Remove tart pan sides.  Carefully peel foil off crust.  Return crust to pan.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Wrap tightly and store at room temperature.)

Spread filling over crust.  Starting at edge of tart, cover tart with berry slices in overlapping concentric circles, with first circle leaning against crust edge.  (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead.  Chill.)

Remove tart from pan.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  The failure-proof cookie-like crust can be prepared ahead.  Use any leftover dough to make a few cookies.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  apple cider vinegar
  3        tablespoons  frozen apple juice concentrate -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  minced red onion
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  thinly sliced red onion
  2                     Gala apples - (abt 1 lb) -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/4" dice
  5                     hearts romaine lettuce -- halved lengthwise
     3/4           cup  pecans -- toasted, and
                        coarsely chopped

Whisk first 8 ingredients in small bowl for dressing.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Refrigerate.  Rewhisk before using.)

Place sliced onion in medium bowl.  Cover with cold water; let stand 30 minutes.  Drain well.  Place 1/3 cup dressing in another medium bowl.  Add apples; toss to coat.

Trim off tips of romaine halves, leaving 5-inch lengths.  Cut each romaine half lengthwise into 3 wedges.  Fan wedges on large platter.  Top with red onion slices.  Drizzle salad with dressing, then sprinkle with apples and pecans.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  For an especially elegant presentation, this salad can be arranged on individual plates instead of one large platter.  When trimming the base of the romaine hearts, be sure to leave a small part of each base attached to hold the leaves together.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  warm water -- (105 to 110 deg)
  1         tablespoon  dry yeast
     3/4           cup  quick-cooking oats
     1/3           cup  honey
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  5               cups  all-purpose flour - (abt)
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
                        Additional quick-cooking oats

Stir 1/4 cup warm water and yeast in large bowl.  Let stand 10 minutes to dissolve yeast.  Stir in remaining 1 1/2 cups water, 3/4 cup oats, honey, oil, and salt.  Stir in enough flour to form soft dough.  Coat another large bowl with oil.  Transfer dough to oiled bowl and turn to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap, then kitchen towel and let rise at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Oil two 8 1/2- by 4 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch loaf pans.  Punch down dough; shape into 2 loaves.  Place 1 loaf in each pan.  Cover and let rise in warm draft-free area until almost doubled in volume, about 20 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Brush tops of loaves with egg; sprinkle with additional oats.  Bake until brown on top and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.  Cool completely.  (Can be prepared up to 1 day ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 2 small loaves.

Comments;  "Never have I tried a homemade bread as light and delicious as the honey-oat loaf at The Green Mountain Inn in Stowe, Vermont," writes Rebecca Rothaug of Westbury, New York.  "With your help, I would like to share this bread with my family and friends."

Serve slices of this tender, slightly sweet bread with plenty of butter and honey.

                Thanksgiving                    Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MAPLE BUTTER ===
     3/4           cup  pure maple syrup
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh marjoram
     1/4           cup  coriander seeds -- coarsely cracked in
                        resealable plastic bag
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  cracked black pepper
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
                        === TURKEY ===
  1                     turkey - (16 to 18 lbs) -- neck, gizzard,
                        and heart reserved
  2               cups  chopped onions
  2               cups  chopped celery with leaves
  2               cups  sliced peeled parsnips - (abt 5 med)
  3               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth -- more or less
                        === GRAVY ===
  2 1/2           cups  canned low-salt chicken broth -- more or less
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  1              small  bay leaf
  2        tablespoons  Madeira
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard - (to 2)
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh marjoram
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For Maple Butter:  Boil maple syrup and 2 tablespoons marjoram in heavy medium saucepan until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 4 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Mix in 1 tablespoon marjoram, coriander, lemon peel, and pepper.  Add butter and whisk until well blended.  Freeze until butter is firm but still spreadable, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For Turkey:  Set rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry with paper towels.  Place turkey on small rack set in large roasting pan.  Starting at neck end, carefully slide hand between skin and breast meat to loosen skin.  Rub 1/2 cup maple butter over breast meat under skin.

If stuffing turkey, spoon stuffing into neck and main cavities.  Tie legs together loosely to hold shape.  Rub 1/4 cup maple butter over outside of turkey.  Reserve remaining maple butter for gravy.  Arrange onions, celery, parsnips, and reserved turkey parts around turkey in pan.  Sprinkle vegetables with remaining 1 tablespoon marjoram.

Roast turkey 30 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Cover entire turkey (not pan) with foil and roast 1 1/2 hours.  Add 2 cups broth to pan; roast turkey 1 1/2 hours.  Remove foil.  Add 1 cup broth to pan and roast turkey until meat thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, basting occasionally with pan juices, about 30 minutes longer if unstuffed or 1 hour longer if stuffed.  Transfer turkey to platter; tent with foil and let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase 5 to 10 degrees).  Reserve mixture in pan for gravy.

For Gravy:  Strain pan juices into large measuring cup, pressing on solids; discard solids in strainer.  Spoon fat from top of pan juices; discard fat.  Add enough chicken broth to pan juices in cup to measure 4 1/2 cups.

Melt 1/4 cup maple butter and 3 tablespoons butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add flour; whisk constantly until mixture is deep brown, about 8 minutes (mixture will resemble lumpy oatmeal-like paste).  Gradually whisk in broth mixture; bring to boil.  Add bay leaf and boil until thickened to sauce consistency, whisking occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Whisk in Madeira, 1 tablespoon mustard, and marjoram.  Simmer 2 minutes.  Taste, adding more mustard if desired.  Season gravy with salt and pepper.  Brush turkey with maple butter.  Serve turkey with gravy.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Maple syrup, marjoram, coriander seeds, and lemon peel flavor a do-ahead butter that is spread on the turkey before baking.  That same butter is also added to the Madeira-laced gravy.  Grape clusters or steamed baby vegetables, such as carrots and squash, make a pretty garnish for the platter.

Comments:  "I have a 'stragglers Thanksgiving' -- that's what I call it -- at my house every year," writes Frances Teasley of North Hollywood, California.  "I know a lot of people who, like me, don't have any family nearby.  Thirteen years ago I started inviting a few people for dinner.  And that small holiday gathering has become a big tradition among my friends.  For weekday meals, I look for shortcuts and do-aheads.  But for holiday meals, I like to do everything the same day because I love the smell of cooking that fills the house."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method

  10       tablespoons  butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- room temperature
  4          teaspoons  minced fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  minced lemon peel -- (yellow part only)
                        Salt -- to taste

Mix butter, thyme, and lemon in small bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Butter can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and chill.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

Place potatoes in large pot.  Add enough cold water to cover.  Bring to boil.  Cover partially and cook until potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Return potatoes to same pot and mash.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  breakfast-style bulk sausage
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1 3/4         pounds  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
  1              pound  onions -- chopped
  4              large  celery stalks -- chopped
  1                cup  chopped celery leaves
  9               cups  coarsely-crumbled day-old Maple Corn Bread -- (see recipe)
  4              large  eggs
     2/3           cup  frozen apple juice concentrate -- thawed
     1/3           cup  canned low-salt chicken broth
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  crumbled dried sage leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg

SautÈ sausage in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until cooked through, breaking up finely with back of fork, about 10 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage to very large bowl.

Melt butter in same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add apples, onions, and celery stalks; sautÈ until very tender, about 12 minutes.  Add celery leaves and stir 30 seconds to wilt.  Add mixture to bowl with sausage.  Stir corn bread into sausage mixture.  Whisk eggs and all remaining ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Mix into stuffing.

To bake stuffing in turkey:  Loosely fill neck and main cavities of turkey with stuffing.  Generously butter baking dish.  Spoon remaining stuffing into prepared dish.  Cover with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake stuffing in dish along side turkey until heated through, about 25 minutes.  Uncover stuffing.  Bake until top of stuffing is slightly crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer.

To bake all of stuffing in baking dish:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter 15- by 10- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Transfer stuffing to prepared dish.  Cover with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake until heated through, about 40 minutes.  Uncover and bake until top is slightly crisp and golden, about 20 minutes longer.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  Maple syrup in the corn bread adds a touch of New England to this traditional stuffing.  The leftover bread is also nice with scrambled eggs or omelets.

                        === CRUST ===
     3/4           cup  all purpose flour
     2/3           cup  yellow cornmeal
     2/3           cup  powdered sugar
  2          teaspoons  minced orange peel -- (orange part only)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  7        tablespoons  butter -- room temperature
  1              large  egg yolk
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  fresh orange juice
  5              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
  1         tablespoon  minced orange peel -- (orange part only)
  3                     oranges -- peeled, and
                        white pith removed
  2                     boxes raspberries - (1/2 pint ea)

For Crust:  Combine first 5 ingredients in large bowl.  Add butter, egg yolk and vanilla.  Using electric mixer, blend until coarse crumbs form.  Knead into ball.  (Dough will be very soft.)

Pat dough onto bottom and up sides of 13 1/2- by 4 1/4-inch rectangular tart pan or four 4-inch-diameter tartlet pans with removable bottom.  Press into place; trim excess dough.  Freeze 20 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line crust with foil and fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake 15 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Press crust up sides of pan if necessary.  Bake 10 minutes longer.  Cool.

For Filling:  Mix first 6 ingredients in medium bowl.  Pour filling into crust.  Bake until barely set, about 30 minutes.  Cool 20 minutes.  Refrigerate until custard is firm, about 3 hours.  (Can be prepared 8 hour ahead.)

Using small sharp knife, cut between membranes of oranges to release segments.  Drain well on paper towels.  Arrange alternating rows of orange segments and raspberries atop tart.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Cornmeal in the crust gives a nice contrast to the creamy filling in this dessert.

                        Margarine
  1            package  pecans - (10 oz)
     1/2       package  Marble or Plain Mandel Cuts - (6 oz)
                        = (Passover cookies)

  5          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  7              large  egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  7              large  egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  finely-grated orange peel -- (3 to 4 oranges)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1                cup  whole milk
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  ground mace or nutmeg
     3/4           cup  gingersnap cookie crumbs
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/2           cup  diced dried pears - (abt 3 oz)
     1/4           cup  Poire Williams (clear pear brandy)
                        = (or regular brandy)
  6                     ripe Bartlett or Anjou pears - (3 3/4 lbs) -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2" cubes
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  16                    sheets fresh phyllo pastry or frozen -- thawed
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- melted

For Sauce:  Bring cream, milk, and ginger to simmer in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Remove pan from heat; steep 15 minutes.

Whisk yolks and sugar in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in warm cream mixture; return mixture to saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until custard thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 8 minutes; do not boil.  Strain sauce into medium bowl; mix in vanilla.  Cover; chill until cold, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

For Filling:  Whisk 1 cup sugar, cornstarch, and mace to blend in small bowl.  Whisk cookie crumbs and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in another small bowl to blend.  Set both mixtures aside.

Melt 1/4 cup butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add dried pears and pear brandy.  Cover and simmer until brandy is absorbed, about 5 minutes.  Mix in fresh pears and lemon peel.  SautÈ until pears are just tender, about 10 minutes.  Add cornstarch mixture.  Bring to boil and cook until filling thickens, stirring constantly, about 3 minutes; cool completely.

Line large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Place 1 phyllo sheet on work surface (keep remaining phyllo covered with damp towel).  Brush phyllo with melted butter.  Top with second phyllo sheet; brush with butter and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon gingersnap crumb mixture.  Repeat with 5 more phyllo sheets, butter and crumb mixture.  Top with phyllo (8 sheets total); brush with butter.

Starting 2 inches in from 1 long side and 2 1/2 inches in from 1 short side, spoon half of filling in 3-inch-wide by 12-inch-long log parallel to long side.  Fold short sides over ends of filling; butter folded edges.  Fold nearest long side of phyllo over filling and roll up strudel, enclosing filling.

Transfer strudel to prepared sheet, seam-side down.  Brush with butter.  Repeat with remaining ingredients to make second strudel.  Place on same sheet, spacing 3 inches from first strudel.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover with plastic and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake strudels until golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Cut each on diagonal into 6 slices and serve warm or at room temperature with cold ginger sauce.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Purchased phyllo makes this pear strudel quick and easy to prepare.  For best results, let the thawed frozen phyllo stand in its box at room temperature a few hours before starting.  Be sure to use ripe fresh pears for the filling.

                        partially thawed)
  4               cups  diced peeled cored pears - (abt 3 med)
  2 1/3           cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour
                        Grated peel of 2 oranges

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  Italian parsley -- large stems trimmed
                        = (abt 2 cups packed)
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh marjoram
     1/2      teaspoon  minced lemon peel
  1              pinch  ground nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     sea bass fillets, abt 1"-thk - (6 oz ea)
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        Additional ground nutmeg
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Additional minced lemon peel -- (optional)

Fill medium bowl with ice water.  Cook parsley in pot of lightly salted boiling water just until bright green, about 5 seconds.  Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid.  Transfer parsley to ice water.  Drain well.  Coarsely chop parsley.

Combine parsley, reserved 1/2 cup cooking liquid, 2 tablespoons olive oil, marjoram, 1/2 teaspoon lemon peel, and pinch of nutmeg in blender; puree until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Parsley puree can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Stir over medium heat until heated through before serving.)  Cover to keep warm.

Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle sea bass with salt and pepper.  Add to skillet and sautÈ until golden on bottom, about 5 minutes.  Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon sugar and pinch of nutmeg over top of each fish fillet.  Turn fish over and cook until golden on second side and opaque in center, about 4 minutes longer.

Transfer 1 sea bass fillet to each of 4 plates.  Drizzle 1 teaspoon pan drippings over each.  Spoon warm parsley puree around each fillet.  Drizzle 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice around each fillet.  Garnish with additional lemon peel, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "I was in Boston on a business trip when I discovered the city's North End and its many old Italian restaurants," writes Jennifer Fassman of Westport, Connecticut.  "After wandering around the small, quaint streets, I was surprised to find a bright, modern restaurant -- Marcuccio's.  I took the waiter's advice and ordered the sea bass with parsley sauce.  It was incredible."

At the restaurant, this entrÈe is served with sautÈed broccoli rabe (also known as rapini).  It would be great with spinach, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Buttermilk Corn Bread, 1 day old -- (see recipe)
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  1 1/4         pounds  Black Forest ham -- finely chopped
  3            bunches  green onions -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped red bell peppers
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh marjoram
  2 1/2         pounds  red-skinned sweet potatoes (yams) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" pieces
  3              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
                        Canned low-salt chicken broth -- as needed

Coarsely crumble Buttermilk Corn Bread into very large bowl.

Melt 4 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add ham and sautÈ 4 minutes.  Add green onions and bell peppers; sautÈ 4 minutes.  Mix in marjoram.  Add to corn bread.

Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add yams; cover and cook until crisp-tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Add to corn bread and toss to combine.  Whisk eggs, mustard, and allspice in bowl to blend.  Add to stuffing; toss to combine.

To bake stuffing in turkey:  Loosely fill neck and main cavities of turkey with stuffing.  Add enough broth to remaining stuffing to moisten slightly (1/4 to 3/4 cup, depending on amount of remaining stuffing).  Generously butter baking dish.  Spoon remaining stuffing into prepared dish.  Cover with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake stuffing in dish along side turkey until heated through, about 25 minutes.  Uncover stuffing.  Bake until top of stuffing is slightly crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer.

To bake all of stuffing in baking dish:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter 15- by 10- by 2-inch glass baking dish, depending on recipe.  Add enough extra broth to stuffing to moisten (3/4 cup to 1 1/4 cups).  Transfer stuffing to prepared dish.  Cover with buttered foil, buttered-side down.  Bake until heated through, about 40 minutes.  Uncover and bake until top is slightly crisp and golden, about 20 minutes longer.

This recipe yields 12 to 14 servings.

Comments:  Whether cooked in the pan or in the bird, this stuffing has great down-home flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bag frozen lima beans - (16 oz)
  1                     bag frozen sweet white corn - (16 oz)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  cumin seeds
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     red bell peppers -- chopped
  2                     poblano chilies -- seeded, chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano
  1                can  low-salt chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz)
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     2/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook lima beans in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 6 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in white corn.  Drain well.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add cumin seeds and stir until toasted, about 3 minutes.  Add onion and sautÈ until translucent, about 8 minutes.

Add bell peppers, chilies, garlic, and oregano; sautÈ until peppers are almost tender, about 4 minutes.  Stir in lima beans and corn, then broth and cream.  Simmer until vegetables are tender and coated with cream, about 20 minutes.

Stir in 1/3 cup cilantro.  Season succotash to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Stir over medium heat to rewarm.)

Transfer succotash to serving bowl; sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup cilantro.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  A spicy spin on the classic side dish.  Any leftovers make an excellent omelet filling when paired with turkey and Monterey Jack cheese.  Poblanos, fresh green chilies, often called pasillas, are available at Latin American markets and some supermarkets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2                 bags gingersnap cookies - (8 oz ea) -- ground
                        = (abt 3 cups)
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced orange peel - (generous) -- orange part only
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2           cups  fresh orange juice
  1              piece  unpeeled fresh ginger - (3" long) -- thinly sliced
                        = (about 1/3 cup)
  4           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  minced orange peel -- orange part only
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  8             ounces  imported white chocolate -- melted
                        = (such as Lindt)
  4              large  eggs
                        === CANDIED ORANGES ===
  4               cups  water
  2               cups  sugar
  3                     seedless oranges -- unpeeled, and
                        cut into paper-thin slices
                        Fresh mint leaves

For Crust:  Stir all ingredients in medium bowl until crumbs are moist.  Press crumbs onto bottom and 2 inches up sides of 9- by 2 3/4-inch springform pan.

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Boil orange juice and ginger in heavy medium saucepan until reduced to 3 tablespoons, about 12 minutes.

Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, sugar, orange peel and vanilla in large bowl until smooth.  Strain reduced orange juice and add to bowl.  With mixer running, add chocolate and beat until combined.  Reduced speed to low.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating until just combined.

Pour batter into crust.  Bake cheesecake until top is dry and sides puff slightly (most of cheesecake will jiggle when shaken), about 50 minutes.  Transfer to rack and cool.  Cover and chill overnight.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.)

For Candied Oranges:  Cover rack with waxed paper.  Combine water and sugar in heavy wide shallow pot.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Simmer 5 minutes.  Add orange slices 1 at a time.  Adjust heat so syrup bubbles only around edges of pan.  Cook oranges 1 hour.  Turn over top layer of oranges and cook until oranges are translucent and orange peels are tender, about 1 hour longer.  Arrange oranges in single layer on prepared rack.  Let dry 1 hour.  Boil sugar syrup until thick, about 6 minutes.  (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.)

Run small knife around edges of cheesecake.  Loosen pan sides and remove.  Overlap orange slices and atop cheesecake.  Reheat orange syrup over low heat if necessary.  Brush over orange slices.  Garnish with mint and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  This treat is topped with slices of bright oranges.  The slices must be cooked very slowly, or the pulp will fall away.  Begin preparing the cheesecake one day before you plan to serve it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  whole coriander seeds
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  frozen apple juice concentrate -- thawed
     1/2           cup  apple cider vinegar
  1                     strip orange peel, 3" by 1"
  1         tablespoon  whole mustard seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
  1                     bag fresh cranberries -- (12 ounce)

Toast coriander in heavy small skillet over medium heat until fragrant, stirring often, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Cool.  Coarsely crush coriander in mortar with pestle.

Transfer coriander to medium saucepan.  Add all remaining ingredients except cranberries and bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Reduce heat to low and simmer until mixture is reduced to 2 cups, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.

Add cranberries and simmer until half of berries burst, about 5 minutes.  Transfer mixture to bowl and cool.  Remove orange peel.  Cover compote and refrigerate overnight to allow flavors to develop.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

Using slotted spoon, transfer cranberries to another bowl; add some of syrup and serve.

This recipe yields about 3 cups.

Comments:  A unique combination of ingredients gives this compote a sweet and tangy pickled taste.  If you don't have a mortar and pestle, place the toasted coriander seeds in a plastic bag and crush them using a rolling pin.

Comments:  "I have a 'stragglers Thanksgiving' -- that's what I call it -- at my house every year," writes Frances Teasley of North Hollywood, California.  "I know a lot of people who, like me, don't have any family nearby.  Thirteen years ago I started inviting a few people for dinner.  And that small holiday gathering has become a big tradition among my friends.  For weekday meals, I look for shortcuts and do-aheads.  But for holiday meals, I like to do everything the same day because I love the smell of cooking that fills the house."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === THYME BUTTER ===
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        === TURKEY ===
  1                     turkey - (15 to 16 lbs) -- neck, gizzard,
                        and heart reserved
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     fresh thyme sprigs -- (optional)
  2 1/2           cups  very coarsely-chopped onions - (to 3)
  5               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth -- more or less
                        === GRAVY ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
  5              large  shallots -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
     3/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  4 1/2           cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
  9                     gingersnap cookies - (2 oz) -- crumbled (3/4 cup)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For thyme butter:  Mix first 5 ingredients in small bowl to blend.  (Thyme butter can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and chill.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

For turkey:  Set rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry with paper towels.  Discard any pieces of fat from cavities.  Sprinkle main cavity of turkey with salt and pepper.  Starting at neck end, carefully slide hand between skin and breast meat to loosen skin.  Spread 3 tablespoons thyme butter over breast meat under skin.

If stuffing turkey, spoon stuffing into neck and main cavities.  If not stuffing, place 6 thyme sprigs and 1/2 cup onions in main cavity.  Tuck wing tips under; tie legs together to hold shape.  Place turkey on rack set in large roasting pan.  Rub 4 tablespoons thyme butter over outside of turkey.  Cover turkey breast loosely with foil.  Scatter 2 1/2 cups onions and reserved turkey parts in pan around turkey.  Pour 2 cups broth into pan.

Roast turkey 1 1/2 hours, lifting foil to baste with pan juices every 30 minutes.  Add 1 1/2 cups broth to roasting pan.  Roast turkey 30 minutes; baste with pan juices.  Add 1 cup broth to pan.  Remove foil.  Continue to roast turkey until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, basting turkey with pan juices every 30 minutes and adding 1/2 cup broth to pan if juices evaporate, about 1 hour longer for unstuffed turkey and 1 hour 30 minutes longer for stuffed.

Transfer turkey to platter.  Brush turkey with remaining thyme butter.  Tent turkey loosely with foil; let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase 5 to 10 degrees).  Discard neck, gizzard, and heart from roasting pan.  Strain turkey pan juices into large measuring cup.  Spoon fat from top of pan juices; discard fat.

Meanwhile, prepare gravy:  Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add shallots; sautÈ until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon chopped thyme, ginger, and cayenne; stir 1 minute.  Add broth; increase heat to high and boil until liquid is reduced to 3 cups, about 12 minutes.

Add turkey pan juices, gingersnap cookies, and any accumulated juices from turkey platter to gravy base in saucepan.  Boil until gravy is thick enough to coat spoon, whisking to dissolve gingersnaps, about 2 minutes.  Mix in remaining 1 tablespoon chopped thyme.  Season gravy to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve turkey with gravy.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Gingersnaps thicken the gravy and add nice sweetness and spice.  Start the gravy while the turkey roasts, then add the pan juices when it's done and waiting to be carved.

                Turkey-Tomato Stew With Onions And Raisins

Categories    : Poultry                         Soups/Stews
                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  4               cups  chopped onions
  3               cups  cooked turkey in 1/2" pieces
                        = (preferably dark meat)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  pumpkin pie spice
  2               cans  diced tomatoes with green peppers -- (14 1/2 oz ea)
  1                cup  water
     2/3           cup  raisins
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onions and sautÈ until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes.  Add turkey, chili powder, and pumpkin pie spice.  SautÈ 3 minutes.  Add tomatoes with juices, 1 cup water, raisins, and vinegar.

Increase heat to high and bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until flavors blend, about 15 minutes.  Uncover and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a kind of picadillo, a typical Spanish stew.  It's also a great way to use up the (usually) less popular dark meat from the turkey.  Readily available pumpkin pie spice introduces a touch of sweetness -- and makes a nice addition to the spice shelf.  Accompany this dish with steamed rice, a basket of warm tortillas, and an arugula and red onion salad.  For a Latin-style dessert, drizzle warm caramel sauce over caramel ice cream and top with some sliced bananas.

     1/4           cup  pure maple syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8              small  red-skinned sweet potatoes (yams)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  whipping cream
  2              large  shallots -- chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  assorted wild mushrooms -- dark gills removed,
                        cut into 3/4" pieces
                        = (such as stemmed shiitake, crimini, and
                        portobellini)
     1/2           cup  dry Marsala
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme -- plus
                        Salt -- to taste

                        Fresh thyme sprigs -- for garnish

Boil cream and shallots in heavy large pot over medium-high heat 2 minutes.  Add mushrooms and 1/4 cup Marsala.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until mushrooms are evenly coated, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes.  Add remaining 1/4 cup Marsala to mushrooms.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Rich, flavorful and perfect for the Thanksgiving table.  This side dish is great for the cook, too, as it can be made one day ahead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz)
     1/2           cup  wild rice
  1              ounce  dried shiitake mushrooms
  1 1/2           cups  hot water
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  dried rosemary -- crumbled
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme -- crumbled
  1                     russet potato - (8 oz) -- peeled, diced
  2               cups  beef stock or canned beef broth
     3/4           cup  milk -- more or less
  2        tablespoons  Madeira
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine chicken broth and rice in small saucepan.  Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 50 minutes.

Meanwhile, soak mushrooms in 1 1/2 cups hot water until soft, about 20 minutes.  Drain mushrooms, reserving soaking liquid.  Cut off mushroom stems and discard.  Thinly slice mushrooms.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms and saute until tender and golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to small bowl.

Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in same pan.  Add onion, garlic, rosemary and thyme and saute until onion is very tender, about 10 minutes.  Mix in potato, beef stock and reserved mushroom soaking liquid.  Cover and simmer until potato is very tender, about 15 minutes.

Transfer soup to blender in batches and puree until smooth.  Return to saucepan.  Stir in wild rice, mushrooms, 3/4 cup milk and Madeira.  Cover and simmer 15 minutes to blend flavors.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Return soup to simmer.)  Thin with additional milk if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "I have a 'stragglers Thanksgiving' -- that's what I call it -- at my house every year," writes Frances Teasley of North Hollywood, California.  "I know a lot of people who, like me, don't have any family nearby.  Thirteen years ago I started inviting a few people for dinner.  And that small holiday gathering has become a big tradition among my friends.  For weekday meals, I look for shortcuts and do-aheads.  But for holiday meals, I like to do everything the same day because I love the smell of cooking that fills the house."

Nice, fresh flavors for a side dish or salad.
