                            Artichoke Frittata

Recipe By     :Julia Della Croce
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Brunch                          Egg Dishes
                Omelets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice or vinegar
  3                     artichokes - (abt 1/2 lb ea)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  6        extra-large  eggs
                        Freshly-milled black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  freshly-grated parmigiano
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh marjoram
                        (or 1 tspn dried marjoram)
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped fresh Italian parsley

Preheat a broiler.  Have ready a large ceramic bowl (do not use metal) filled with cold water to which you have added the lemon juice or vinegar. 
Trim only a thin slice from the bottom of the stem of each artichoke to remove the dark skin.  Pare off all the green skin.  The flesh of the stem is good.  With your hand, pull off the tough outer leaves until you reach leaves that have tender, white areas at their base.  (Cut off only the upper part of the inner leaves that are dark green at the top and light greenish yellow at the base.)  The inner rows of leaves are the tender part you want, so be careful not to cut away too much.  Cut the artichoke in half lengthwise and, with a small knife, cut out the hairy choke and any other tough inner purple leaves.  Immediately put the cleaned artichokes into the acidulated water to prevent them from turning brown.  When all of the artichokes have been cleaned, drain them. 
Place each artichoke half cut-side down on a surface and cut lengthwise into 1 /4-inch-thick slices. 
Bring a large saucepan filled with water to a boil.  Add the artichokes and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and boil until tender but not mushy.  Fresh, young artichokes will be ready in approximately 5 minutes; old, tough artichokes may take up to 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain and allow to cool. 
In a small skillet over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Add the onion and saute until golden, 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. 
Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the eggs lightly with a fork.  Beat in the Parmigiano, marjoram and parsley.  Add artichokes to the onion in the pan and add beaten egg mixture.  Cook over low to medium heat until eggs are set and fritata is cooked through. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Place each artichoke half cut-side down on a surface and cut lengthwise into 1 /4-inch-thick slices. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring a large saucepan filled with water to a boil.  Add the artichokes and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and boil until tender but not mushy.  Fresh, young artichokes will be ready in approximately 5 minutes; old, tough artichokes may take up to 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain and allow to cool.

<DirT>
In a small skillet over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Add the onion and saute until golden, 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the eggs lightly with a fork.  Beat in the Parmigiano, marjoram and parsley.  Add artichokes to the onion in the pan and add beaten egg mixture.  Cook over low to medium heat until eggs are set and fritata is cooked through.

  2                     bananas -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" slices
                        === CRUST ===
  4               cups  crushed vanilla wafers
     1/2           cup  butter - (to 3/4 cup) -- melted
                        === VANILLA PUDDING ===
  6                     egg yolks
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
  1                     vanilla bean
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  vanilla extract
                        === MERINGUE ===
  6                     egg whites
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar

Mix together the two crust ingredients in a bowl, then press the mixture into a 9-inch pie tin.  Refrigerate 5 to 10 minutes, place into 350 degrees oven, and bake 10 minutes or until golden. 
Vanilla Pudding:  In a medium bowl, combine yolks, sugar and cornstarch.  With the tip of a paring knife split the vanilla bean and scrape the inside and whisk into egg mixture.  Add the cream and milk.  Place the bowl over a pot of boiling water (a double boiler) and stir the mixture occasionally until it thickens, about 10 minutes.  Remove bowl from heat and stir in vanilla extract.  Set aside. 
Meringue:  In a bowl, beat egg whites until foamy.  Add cream of tartar and continue to beat until soft peaks form.  Add the granulated sugar and whip on high speed until the whites become stiff and glossy. 
To assemble:  Arrange banana slices in an even layer on the bottom of the pie shell.  Pour 1/2 of the vanilla pudding over the bananas.  Arrange approximately 1 cup whole vanilla wafers over the bananas and then top with remaining pudding.  Chill in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes. 
Remove pie from refrigerator, and with a spoon, dollop the meringue on top to form peaks over the entire pie, covering all of the pudding.  Bake pie at 400 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes or until peaks are golden. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  water
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  coarse yellow cornmeal
  1                     bay leaf
  2        tablespoons  coarse salt

In a medium cast-iron saucepan or other heavy pot, bring all ingredients except cornmeal to simmer over medium heat.  Very slowly, begin to sift cornmeal into the pan through the fingers of one hand, stirring constantly with wooden spoon or whisk.  Gradually sift remaining meal into the pan, continue to stir and reduce heat to medium-low.  Continue to stir until the polenta is smooth and thick and pulls away from the sides of the pan as it is stirred, about 30 minutes.  Discard bay leaf, pour polenta into a serving bowl or onto a wooden board, and allow it to rest 10 minutes. 
To serve from the bowl, dip a large spoon into water and scoop polenta onto individual dishes, dipping the spoon into the water between scoops.  To serve from the board, cut polenta into segments with a thin, taut string or knife and transfer to plates with a spatula or cake knife. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  minced onion
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2               cups  Arborio or Carnaroli rice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  6               cups  hot chicken or beef stock
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cut into bits
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a heavy, non-reactive skillet, heat olive oil and saute onion and shallots until golden.  Add rice and stir, to coat with oil.  Add wine, stir well and add 1/2 cup hot stock and salt.  Cook, stirring constantly, until all liquid has been absorbed.  Continue to add hot stock in small batches (just enough to completely moisten rice) and cook until each successive batch has been absorbed, stirring constantly until rice mixture is creamy and al dente. 
Remove from heat, whip in butter and half of the grated cheese.  Season with salt and freshly-ground pepper.  Top each serving with additional grated cheese to taste; serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                   Beet Salad With Orange And Tarragon

Recipe By     :Julia Della Croce
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              small  to medium beets - (to 8)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed orange juice,
                        preferably from a blood orange
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated orange zest
  1         tablespoon  finely-snipped fresh tarragon
                        (or 2 tspns dried tarragon)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-milled black pepper -- to taste

Trim the leaves off the beets, but do not remove the tops or pierce the beets themselves, or their juice will bleed into the water and flavor and color will be lost.  Fill a saucepan with enough water to cover the beets generously and bring to a rapid boil.  Add the beets and reduce the heat so that the beets boil gently until tender, 20 to 30 minutes.  When you can pierce them easily with a sharp knife, thin skewer, or, better yet, a cake tester, they are done.  (Try to use something as thin as possible to prevent the beets from bleeding excessively when they are pierced.)  They should be tender but not mushy. 
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine all the dressing ingredients, including salt and pepper to taste.  Whisk to blend.  When the beets are cooked, drain them and place into cold water to cool so they can be handled.  Drain again and cut off the tops and slip off the skins.  Cut into 1/4-inch thick slices and place in a salad bowl.  Pour over the dressing, toss well, and serve.  The beets can also be left to marinate at room temperature for several hours. 
Ahead-of-time note:  This entire dish can be prepared a day in advance, covered, and refrigerated.  Bring to room temperature before serving. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  white beans -- drained
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1             bottle  Italian vinaigrette,
                        or any salad dressing in your refrigerator
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1               loaf  bread, either white baguette,
                        or loaf of sliced white bread
                        Olive oil
                        Chopped scallions -- for garnish

In a medium saucepan, heat the beans with the butter just to cook slightly and soften.  Add approximately 2 to 3 tablespoons of Italian vinaigrette and salt and pepper to taste.  Either mash by hand or in a food processor, pulse until mashed and well blended.  Set aside. 
If you are using a plain white loaf of bread, trim the crusts off, cut into triangles.  Then brush with olive oil, sprinkle a little salt and pepper on top.  Then place on a cookie sheet, and place in a 275 degree oven, under the broiler and toast until just golden. 
If you're using a free form white loaf of bread, slice it approximately 1/4-inch thick and into approximately 3-inch rounds and follow the instructions for the plain white loaf above. 
Apply 1 to 2 tablespoons of Bean Tapenade.  Optional garnish, chopped scallions. 
This recipe yields 4 servings as an accompaniment.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === NICOISE VINAIGRETTE ===
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/3           cup  eggplant in 1/16" dice
     1/3           cup  zucchini in 1/16" dice
     1/3           cup  fennel bulb in 1/16" dice
     1/3           cup  peeled, seeded 1/16" dice ripe tomato
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped pitted Nicoise olives
  4          teaspoons  high-quality red wine vinegar,
                        preferably Chianti
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/8      teaspoon  minced garlic
     3/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === TUNA ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- or more as needed
  4             slices  sushi-grade tuna fillet - (2 1/2 oz ea)
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt

In a medium nonstick skillet, heat 2 teaspoons oil over medium-high heat.  Add the eggplant and cook until tender, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to a bowl.  Repeat the procedure with the zucchini, using an additional 2 teaspoons oil, and cooking for 2 minutes.  Repeat with the fennel, using another 2 teaspoons oil, and cooking for 2 minutes.  Cool the vegetables completely.  Add the tomatoes, olives, remaining 4 tablespoons oil, the vinegar, thyme, garlic, salt, and pepper and mix well.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 8 hours. 
For each serving, brush the inside of a large dinner plate with some of the oil.  Place 1 tuna slice on the plate and cover with a large piece of strong plastic wrap.  Using the flat side of a meat pounder, pound the tuna until it is so thin it covers the inside of the plate.  Leaving the plastic wrap intact, refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 8 hours. 
When ready to serve, carefully peel off the plastic wrap.  Brush the tuna with the remaining olive oil and sprinkle with the salt.  Spoon the vinaigrette over the tuna, spreading it evenly over the surface.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a medium nonstick skillet, heat 2 teaspoons oil over medium-high heat.  Add the eggplant and cook until tender, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to a bowl.  Repeat the procedure with the zucchini, using an additional 2 teaspoons oil, and cooking for 2 minutes.  Repeat with the fennel, using another 2 teaspoons oil, and cooking for 2 minutes.  Cool the vegetables completely.  Add the tomatoes, olives, remaining 4 tablespoons oil, the vinegar, thyme, garlic, salt, and pepper and mix well.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 8 hours. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For each serving, brush the inside of a large dinner plate with some of the oil.  Place 1 tuna slice on the plate and cover with a large piece of strong plastic wrap.  Using the flat side of a meat pounder, pound the tuna until it is so thin it covers the inside of the plate.  Leaving the plastic wrap intact, refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 8 hours. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, carefully peel off the plastic wrap.  Brush the tuna with the remaining olive oil and sprinkle with the salt.  Spoon the vinaigrette over the tuna, spreading it evenly over the surface.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MILK CHOCOLATE LAYER ===
  7             ounces  milk chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  6             ounces  creamy peanut butter
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1 1/4           cups  (abt 3 oz) purchased rolled cigarette
                        or gaufrette cookies -- coarsely crushed with
                        hands or rolling pin
                        === BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE LAYER ===
  5             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  1 1/4           cups  heavy cream
                        Cocoa powder

For the milk chocolate layer, line an 8-inch square pan with plastic wrap, leaving an overhang.  Melt milk chocolate in the top of a double boiler above gently simmering water and whisk until smooth. 
Beat the peanut butter and oil using an electric mixer until smooth.  Mix in the milk chocolate and cookies until well blended.  Pour into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a spatula.  Bang the pan on a work surface to even contents.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, for about 2 hours. 
For the bittersweet chocolate layer, melt the bittersweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler above gently simmering water and whisk until smooth.  Cool to tepid. 
Meanwhile, whip cream to soft peaks.  Quickly fold 1/2 of whipped cream into the chocolate, then fold in the remainder.  Pour over the firm, chilled milk chocolate layer.  Spread with spatula until smooth.  Bang on a work surface to eliminate air bubbles.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, for about 4 to 6 hours.  (This can be prepared several days ahead.) 
To serve, remove from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before serving.  Immediately lift the chocolate dessert out of the pan.  Cut lengthwise into 1-inch wide strips using a knife rinsed in hot water and dried, then cut each strip in half crosswise to form two 4- by 1-inch bars.  Sieve cocoa powder over the tops of the bars. 
Place 2 bars on 8 plates, resting 1 edge of 1 bar dramatically atop the second bar.  Let sit at room temperature about 1 hour before serving. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRISPY LAYERS ===
  1            package  frozen fillo dough -- defrosted
  8             ounces  melted butter
  1         tablespoon  honey
  2               cups  ground natural pistachios
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2                     slightly damp kitchen towels
  1                     pastry brush
  2                     cookie sheets lined with parchment paper
                        === COUSCOUS CUSTARD ===
  6        tablespoons  milk
     3/4           cup  couscous
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
  3               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2                vanilla bean
  8                     egg yolks
                        === QUINCE COMPOTE ===
  2               cups  sugar
  2               cups  water
  1              pound  quince -- cored, peeled,
                        and cut into small cubes (1/4")
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1                     clove
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice

Have all ingredients ready before you begin. 
For Crispy Layers:  Lay out one of the kitchen towels, open the filo package, unroll and place on the towel.  Cover with the second towel. 
Place a whole sheet of filo onto one of the sheet pans, brush with melted butter mixed with honey and sprinkle with pistachios.  Repeat two more times, but on last layer sprinkle with sugar. 
Cut into six equal squares.  Place a square into a greased muffin tin, pressing gently down to fit form, leave tips sticking up or slightly laying over. 
Bake at 375 degrees until golden and crispy, approximately 10 minutes. 
Couscous custard:  Bring the milk to a boil.  Mix couscous, cinnamon, ginger, butter and salt together.  Pour milk over the couscous mixture and mix to break up any lumps. 
Bring cream, sugar and vanilla to a boil.  Combine egg yolks in a small bowl, add half of boiled cream to egg yolk mix.  Return egg yolks to boiling cream and whisk until thickened, do not boil.  Strain and pour into couscous mixture, stir and cool. 
Return to pot and cook to boil, remove from heat.  Place mixture in bowl, cover with plastic and refrigerate overnight. 
Quince Compote:  In a medium nonreactive saucepan, combine sugar and water, bring to a boil.  Add quince, cinnamon, cloves and lemon juice, reduce the heat to low.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, until fruit is tender and translucent, remove from heat, pour into bowl to cool. 
Strain quince from liquid and puree 1/4 of the quince.  Add the puree to the left over quince and add additional poaching liquid to moisten slightly (to make it a spoonable sauce). 
To Assemble:  Place filo dough on plate, spoon some couscous custard into the cup.  Spoon some quince compote onto the plate, garnish with whipped cream, mint and a few berries. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

  6             medium  Yukon gold potatoes - (1 1/2 lbs) -- scrubbed
  3        tablespoons  fine sea salt -- plus more to taste
  6             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  peeled, grated fresh horseradish
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- (optional)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Short Ribs:  In a large non-reactive pot, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the onion, carrot, and celery and cook until the vegetables are softened, about 6 minutes.  Stir in the garlic, rosemary, thyme, peppercorns and orange zest.  Add the wine and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.  Cool the marinade completely. 
Place the short ribs in a large non-reactive bowl and add the cooled marinade.  Cover and refrigerate at least overnight, preferably 24 hours. 
Strain the marinade into a large non-reactive pot and discard the solids.  Bring the marinade to a boil over high heat.  Boil until reduced by one-fourth, 20 to 30 minutes. 
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Place the short ribs in a large, flameproof non-reactive casserole (such as enameled cast-iron).  Add the reduced marinade and the veal stock.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Cover and bake until the beef is very tender and pulling from the bones, 3 1/2 to 4 hours.  Transfer the beef to a platter and cool.  Discard the bones, trim away any excess fat, and return the beef to the casserole. 
Meanwhile, skim off and discard the fat on the surface of the cooking liquid.  Strain the sauce into a large non-reactive pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Add the olives and anchovies.  Cook, skimming often, until the sauce reduces and is thick enough to coat a wooden spoon, about 30 minutes.  Pour the sauce over the short ribs.  (The short ribs can be prepared up to 1 day in advance, cooled, covered, and refrigerated.) 
Horseradish Potato Puree:  Place the potatoes in a large pot, add enough cold water to cover by 2 inches, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Add the 3 tablespoons of salt and cook until the potatoes are tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife.  Drain and rinse under cold water until easy to handle. 
Peel the warm potatoes.  Pass the potatoes through a potato ricer into a large bowl.  Beat in the butter, olive oil, horseradish, and optional cheese.  Season with salt and pepper.  (The potato pure can be made about 20 minutes ahead, placed in a heatproof bowl, loosely covered, and kept warm over a pot of simmering water.) 
Assembly:  Bring the short ribs and sauce to a simmer over medium heat and cook until the short ribs are heated through, about 10 minutes.  Spoon a portion of the potato pure onto the centers of 8 warmed dinner plates, and top each with the short ribs.  Spoon the sauce around the potatoes. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               pint  fresh raspberries
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
  6                     square wonton skins
     1/2           cup  chocolate chips
                        Canola oil -- for frying
  3             ounces  semi-sweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Grand Marnier -- to taste

Add berries, sugar and water to a hot saucepan.  Allow mixture to come to a boil and then cook for approximately 3 minutes or until berries can be mashed.  Remove from heat. 
Strain the berry mixture into a bowl, pushing with a wooden spoon.  Allow to cool.  Can be stored in a squeeze bottle in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. 
Stuff one wonton wrapper with 1/6 of the chocolate chips.  Paint water on the edges, seal in a triangle shape, crimp lightly with a fork to ensure seal.  Repeat with all six wonton skins. 
In a large pot (or in a deep fat fryer) heat 3 inches of canola oil to 350 degrees.  Using a spider or a slotted spoon, add the stuffed wontons to the oil and fry until golden on both sides.  Remove to drain on paper towels. 
Place the chopped chocolate in a small bowl.  Heat heavy cream to a simmer and add to the chocolate stirring until the chocolate melts.  Add Grand Marnier to taste. 
Arrange wontons on a plate.  Top with the coulis and chocolate. 
This recipe yields 2 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  pitted dates
     1/2           cup  water
  5          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  6                     egg whites
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/2           cup  chocolate chips

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and coat a 9- by 13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. 
Combine the dates and water and cook in the microwave on high, covered, until dates are very soft (about 5 minutes; check and stir every minute).  Drain, reserving the cooking liquid, and puree the dates with the vanilla in a food processor, adding cooking liquid if necessary to make a smooth paste. 
Turn the date puree into a large mixing bowl and cream in the sugar with an electric mixer.  Blend in the egg whites 1/3 at a time. 
In a small bowl, stir together the flour and cocoa powder.  Add to the puree and mix well by hand.  Stir in chips. 
Spread the batter in the prepared pan and bake on the middle rack until a pick inserted in the center comes out with a bit of chocolate clinging to it, approximately 15 minutes.  Cool on a wire rack, chill for several hours or overnight, and cut into 18 bars. 
This recipe yields 18 brownies. 
Variation:  Add 1/2 cup butterscotch, white chocolate, or peanut butter chips.

  Farfalle Alla Ligure - Fresh "Butterflies" With Pine Nuts And Marjoram

Recipe By     :Julia Della Croce
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTA DOUGH ===
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2                     jumbo eggs or 4 large eggs
  1         tablespoon  olive oil or oil without flavor,
                        such as safflower or corn oil
                        === FOR COOKING PASTA ===
  5             quarts  water
  2        tablespoons  salt
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  pine nuts -- lightly toasted,
                        and roughly chopped
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated parmigiano -- plus additional
                        parmigiano for the table
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh marjoram leaves
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

To prepare the pasta, measure the flour and salt directly onto a large pastry board or kitchen work surface.  Make a well in the center of the flour.  In a small bowl, lightly beat the eggs with the oil.  Pour the wet ingredients into the well.  Using a fork, beat the egg mixture to combine the ingredients and then gradually draw in the flour from the inside of the well.  Always gently beat with the fork in the same direction to prevent air pockets from forming holes in the dough later.  Do not let the egg mixture run out of the well.  Protect the outside wall with the hand not holding the fork until the wet mixture is well enough integrated with the flour not to stream out.  When the mixture is too stiff to use the fork any longer, scrape the dough from the fork into the well and continue forming the dough with your hands. 
When you have formed a very soft ball of dough, use a pastry scraper to sweep up the flour left on the board.  Sift it, discarding all the dried-out dough bits.  The object is to form a uniform, smooth, soft ball of dough.  Add only enough of the sifted flour to form a firm yet very pliable dough; the dough should not be hard.  The perfect consistency is soft but not sticky, and responsive to being worked with.  The amount of flour will depend on how much the eggs absorb and on the humidity in the room, so more or less flour may be required. 
Flatten the ball of dough on the board and, using the heels of your hands, knead it from the middle of the disk outward, folding it in half after you work it each time.  Do this for about 10 minutes, or until a smooth, elastic dough is formed.  Be sure to knead the dough on both sides, working it through and through while keeping it basically round.  Well-kneaded dough makes rolling and cutting easy, and produces a noodle that is tender but firm.  Work quickly and do not let the dough rest unnecessarily.  Cover the dough ball with an inverted bowl or slightly damp kitchen towel to prevent a crust from forming on its surface. 
Set up your pasta machine so that everything on your work surface is within easy reach.  Divide the dough into 6 equal portions.  With your hands or a standard rolling pin, flatten the piece you are working with; keep the others covered.  Dust it lightly with flour.  Set the machine at the widest possible setting for rolling.  Feed the dough through the roller without pulling it or stretching it.  Drape it over your hand with your thumb up in the air to avoid sticking your fingers through it.  Fold it in thirds as you would a letter, overlapping the top third, and then the bottom third, over the middle third.  (This will keep the piece of dough in a uniform rectangular shape, which is important as you roll it out thinner and longer.)  Press the dough flat with your hands and fingertips to get all the air out and lightly flour one side only (the other side remains unfloured so that it will adhere to itself when you fold it in thirds again).  Set the rollers one notch past the previous one.  Pass the dough through again, collecting it at the other end.  Repeat the process of folding the strip of dough in thirds and pressing out the air, flouring it lightly on one side, then putting it through the second notch, for a total of 3 times (more, up to 8 times, if you did not knead the dough for at least 10 minutes).  Then feed the flattened piece of dough, narrow end first, through the machine's rollers at each remaining setting.  Dust the sheet of dough with flour on both sides as necessary to prevent sticking. 
For farfalle, the dough must be as thin as possible, so it must pass through the last setting on the machine.  When the whole length of the sheet has passed through the rollers for the last time, collect it carefully with your hands and pull it to its full length, freeing it of folds.  Set the strip aside and cover with clean kitchen towels.  Roll out each portion completely in this same manner, covering them well until all the dough is passed through the machine. 
To form the farfalle, using a fluted pastry wheel, cut each sheet of pasta in half lengthwise.  Then cut every 2 inches across the width of each strip to form rectangles about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide.  Using your thumb and forefinger, press two opposite long sides together, pinching firmly in the middle so that a bow is formed.  Line several baking sheets with clean kitchen towels.  Place the farfalle on the towels and allow them to dry for 10 minutes.  At this point, they can be covered with dry kitchen towels and set aside for up to several hours before cooking, if desired.  (Yields 1 pound) 
To cook the pasta, bring the water to a rolling boil in a large pot.  Pick up each of the towels holding the farfalle by two opposite corners, so the contents can be easily and quickly dumped into the boiling water.  Dump all of the farfalle into the boiling water as quickly as possible so all the pasta begins cooking at the same time.  Stir immediately and add the salt to the water.  Stir well again and cover.  When the pasta rises to the surface, it is cooked, about 1 minute from the time the water returns to the boil.  Be certain not to overcook; the entire cooking process should take no longer than 3 to 4 minutes. 
Meanwhile, to make the sauce, melt the butter in a skillet large enough to accommodate the pasta later.  Drain the farfalle, transfer them to the skillet, and toss with the butter.  Using two large forks and keeping the gentlest possible flame under the skillet, distribute the sauce well through the pasta.  Add the pine nuts, the 1/2 cup cheese, the marjoram, and pepper to taste and serve immediately.  Pass additional parmigiano at the table. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  baking potatoes
     3/4         pound  Montasio cheese
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In water to cover, boil the potatoes in their skins for 25 to 30 minutes, keeping them on the firm side.  While the potatoes cook, remove rind from the Montasio and cut the cheese in small dice. 
When the potatoes are cool enough to handle but still warm, peel and slice them 1/4-inch thick.  Melt the butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet.  Turn off the heat, arrange the potatoes, slightly overlapping the slices, in concentric circles, working from the center outward and covering the bottom of the pan.  Season with salt and pepper, sprinkle evenly with cheese, and cook, covered, over moderate heat until browned on the bottom, about 8 minutes. 
Invert a large plate over the uncovered pan and then invert the potato cake onto the plate.  Slide potato cake back into pan and cook uncovered until the cheese browns, about 8 minutes longer.  Once again invert the potato cake onto the plate and pat it with paper towels to remove any excess grease.  Cut into 4 wedges and serve. 
For a more appealing presentation, the ingredients can be divided into four parts, cooked separately in 5-inch pans, and served as individual cakes. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                       Gnocchi - (Potato Dumplings)

Recipe By     :Lidia Bastianich
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta
                Potatoes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  Idaho or russet potatoes
  2        tablespoons  salt -- plus
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground white pepper
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  4               cups  unbleached flour
                        Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- for serving

Boil the potatoes in their skins about 40 minutes, until easily pierced with a skewer.  When cool enough to handle, peel and rice the potatoes, and set aside to cool completely, spreading them loosely to expose as much surface as possible to air.  (The reason for this is to allow as much evaporation of moisture as possible to avoid the need of additional flour, therefore keeping the gnocchi light). 
Before proceeding further, bring 6 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons of the salt to a boil. 
On a cool, preferably marble work surface, gather the cold riced potatoes into a mound, forming a well in the center.  Stir the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and the white pepper into the beaten eggs and pour the mixture into the well.  Work the potatoes and eggs together with both hands, gradually adding 3 cups of the flour and scraping the dough up from the work surface with a knife as often as necessary.  (Incorporation of the ingredients should take no longer than 10 minutes.  The longer the dough is worked, the more flour it will require and the heavier it will become). 
Dust the dough, your hands, and the work surface lightly with flour and cut the dough into six equal parts.  Continue to dust dough, hands, and surface as long as the dough feels sticky. 
Using both hands, roll each piece of dough into a rope 1/2-inch thick, then slice the ropes at 1/2-inch intervals.  Indent each dumpling with a thumb, or use the tines of a fork to produce a ribbed effect.  (This facilitates adhesion of the sauce). 
Drop the gnocchi into boiling water a few at a time, stirring gently and continuously with a wooden spoon, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until they rise to the surface.  Remove the gnocchi from the water with a slotted spoon or skimmer, transfer them to a warm platter, adding a little sauce of choice, and boil the remaining pieces in batches until all are done. 
Sauce as desired, add freshly ground white pepper to taste and, if appropriate, grated cheese, and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    lamb rib chops -- well-trimmed of
                        excess fat
  2 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened
  2 1/2         pounds  Idaho or russet potatoes - (3 med) -- peeled, and
                        sliced into 1/8"-thick rounds
  1                cup  julienned onion -- rinsed in cold water
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2 1/4           cups  lamb or veal stock
  2 1/4           cups  chicken stock

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Coat the inside of a flameproof (such as enameled cast-iron) 9 1/2- by 12- by 4-inch baking dish with the butter. 
Season the lamb chops with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.  In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat.  In batches, cook the lamb chops, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 4 minutes. Set aside. 
In a large bowl, mix the potatoes, onion, thyme, garlic, pepper, and the remaining 2 teaspoons salt.  Spread half of the potatoes in the dish.  Arrange the lamb chops on top, then cover with the remaining potatoes.  Pour the lamb stock and chicken stock into the dish.  Bring to a boil over medium heat. 
Cover tightly with aluminum foil.  Bake until the potatoes are very tender, about 3 1/2 hours.  During the last 30 minutes, remove the foil so the potatoes can brown lightly. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              pints  strawberries
                        === BISCUITS ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder -- plus
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  chopped lavender
     1/4           cup  shortening
  1                cup  buttermilk
                        Granulated sugar -- for sprinkling
                        === FOR THE CREAM ===
  1               pint  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar
  1            vanilla  bean

Wash and slice in half the strawberries, set aside. 
Place the dry biscuit ingredients and lavender in a bowl, mix until blended.  Cut in the shortening with pastry cutter, 2 knives or your fingers until the mixture looks like coarse meal.  Pour in the buttermilk, just mix until blended. 
On a floured surface roll the dough out to 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick and cut out with a large-sized cutter.  Place rounds on a cookie sheet or sheet pan lined with baking paper or coated with a baking spray.  Scrape the dough scraps up and repeat the rolling process.  Sprinkle rounds with granulated sugar. 
Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes to 25 minutes or until golden brown. 
Put cream in mixing bowl with whip.  Whip until it begins to thicken, then add the remaining ingredients.  With a knife, split the vanilla bean down the center and scrape out the seeds.  Pour in bowl and continue mixing. 
To Assemble:  Slice the biscuit in half, place the sliced strawberries and then the cream on bottom half of biscuit, and then top with the other half.  Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar, and garnish with whole strawberries. 
This recipe yields 10 to 12 short cakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1               dash  salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper

          Lobster In Brodetto - (Lobster Stew With Soft Polenta)

Recipe By     :Lidia Bastianich
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lobster                         Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              small  lobsters
                        Unbleached flour -- for dredging
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
  3               cups  diced onions
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  6        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
  5               cups  hot water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4               cups  crushed Italian plum tomatoes

Cut off lobster tails at body junctures and dredge exposed meat lightly in flour, shaking off excess.  In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil just short of smoking point, add lobster tails, meat-side down, and saute about 2 minutes, until golden brown.  Set tails aside. 
In a large non reactive saucepan or small stockpot, saute onions in 1/3 cup of the olive oil until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add lobster shells, stir and cook 5 minutes.  Stir in tomato paste and cook over medium heat additional 5 minutes.  Blend vinegar with hot water, add to pan and bring to a full boil.  Add salt and tomatoes, bring to boil and cook 3 minutes. 
Remove lobster bodies with tongs, allowing all interior juices to drain back into sauce.  (Bodies should be reserved for other uses, or, if the meal is to be informal, may be served on a communal platter in the center of the table.  The most delicate meat is in those bodies and should not be wasted.). 
Add claws, cook 7 minutes and add reserved tails and remaining olive oil.  (If the brodetto is to be served with spaghetti, the pasta should be added to the boiling water at this point).  Cook 3 to 5 minutes longer over high heat, skimming off all surface foam.  Remove tails and claws, and keep warm under aluminum foil.  Boil sauce briefly to affect a slight reduction and concentration of the flavors.  Add hot pepper flakes if desired. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Olive oil -- for baking sheet
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     boneless, trimmed lamb loins - (14 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
     1/2        recipe  Salt Crust Dough -- (see recipe)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Lightly oil a large baking sheet. 
In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat.  Add the lamb loins and cook, turning occasionally, until seared on all sides.  Transfer to a platter and refrigerate until completely cooled. 
Brush each lamb loin with the mustard.  Combine the thyme, tarragon, and parsley on a plate, and roll each loin in the herbs to coat. 
Divide the dough in half.  According to the directions in the Salt Crust Dough recipe, roll out each portion as thinly as possible.  Wrap each loin completely with dough. 
Place on the prepared baking sheet.  Bake for 10 minutes for rare meat, or longer, if desired.  Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes. 
Using a hammer or the back of a heavy knife, crack the crust, brushing off any clinging crust with a clean kitchen towel.  Carve the lamb crosswise into thin slices, season with the pepper, and serve immediately on warmed plates. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  3        tablespoons  virgin olive oil

Slice all the vegetables thinly with a very sharp mandoline and put them in icy water for about an hour. 
Combine marinade ingredients.  Cut the tuna in long thin slices about 1/2-inch thick and let sit in the marinade for about 20 minutes. 
In a medium-size skillet over high heat sear the tuna briefly, until rare.  Reserve on the side once done. 
Drain all the vegetables, dry them and season with a little bit of lemon and olive oil to taste.  Place a small amount in the middle of the plate and add the thin slice of tuna on top of it.  Combine tapenade dressing and drizzle vinaigrette on tuna. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  monkfish fillets
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Flour -- for dredging
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary
  4                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  white wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  chicken stock

Remove membranes and any dark red portions from the fillets.  Slice the fish in 1/2-inch thick medallions.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then dredge medallions in flour.  Shake off excess flour. 
In a large nonreactive skillet, heat vegetable oil and fry fish in batches, turning once, until lightly browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes.  Drain on paper towels. 
In a second skillet, saute onions in olive oil until pale golden but not browned.  Add rosemary, bay leaves, salt and pepper to taste as onions cook, about 12 minutes over moderate heat.  Add vinegar, wine, and stock.  Let simmer for 10 minutes. 
In a walled serving dish, arrange medallions in 2 layers, distributing half of the onion mixture over each layer.  Allow fish to marinate at least 2 hours and serve warm at room temperature. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

 Melanzane Ripiene Alla Basilicata - (Stuffed Eggplant, Basilicata Style)

Recipe By     :Julia Della Croce
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              small  eggplants - (abt 1/2 lb ea)
                        Salt -- for sprinkling eggplant
  1              large  garlic clove -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  fine dried bread crumbs
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh oregano
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried oregano)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus additional
                        oil for drizzling on eggplants
  1 1/2    tablespoons  finely-chopped, imported green olives

Leave the skins on the eggplants, but trim off and discard the stems and navels.  Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise.  Make slashes about 1 inch deep in their flesh on the cut sides and sprinkle them with salt.  Place the halves cut-sides down in a colander.  Place the colander in the sink or over a dish and let stand so the bitter liquid drains out of the seeds, about 40 minutes. 
Meanwhile, preheat an oven to 375 degrees.  Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil. 
Rinse the eggplant under cold water and pat dry thoroughly with a clean kitchen towel.  In a small bowl, mix together the garlic, bread crumbs, oregano, parsley, the 1 tablespoon olive oil, and olives.  Using your fingers, work as much of the mixture as you can into the slashes in the eggplant halves.  Spread any remaining mixture on top of the eggplants. 
Place the eggplant halves cut-sides up on the foil-lined sheet and drizzle generously with olive oil.  Bake on the middle rack of the oven until completely tender when pierced with a knife, about 40 minutes.  Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley and then with salt and freshly-milled black pepper.  Serve warm or at room temperature. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Condiments                      Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16            ounces  semisweet chocolate (use chips
                        or break blocks into small pieces)
  5             ounces  light corn syrup

Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a sauce pan of hot but not boiling water.  Stir in the corn syrup; the chocolate will start to stiffen almost immediately.  Stir until the ingredients are completely combined.  Wrap in plastic until cool. 
The paste will seem hard, but it will soften from the warmth of your hands when you start to work with it.  Roll it out with a rolling pin, or run it through a pasta machine starting at the widest opening, then through smaller openings until it reaches the thickness you want.

Categories    : Muffins

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  wheat bran
  12            ounces  seedless raisins
     3/4           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2           cup  lowfat buttermilk
     1/2           cup  frozen orange juice concentrate -- thawed
     1/3           cup  powdered fructose
                        (or 1/2 cup light brown sugar)
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  whole-wheat pastry flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  6                     egg whites -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line 24 mini-muffin or 12 regular muffin tins with muffin papers.  Spread the bran on a cookie sheet and toast until golden brown, about 8 minutes. 
Combine the raisins and water in a microwave-safe dish and cook on high, covered, until raisins are very soft (2 to 3 minutes; check and stir every minute).  Reserve 1 tablespoon liquid and drain off the rest.  Put the raisins, reserved liquid, and vanilla in the food processor and puree until very smooth.  Set aside. 
In a large mixing bowl, combine the toasted bran, buttermilk, orange juice concentrate, and fructose.  Stir in the raisin puree and let stand for 20 minutes (or leave overnight in the refrigerator; return to room temperature before proceeding). 
In a separate bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder, and baking soda.  Stir the egg whites and orange zest into the bran mixture, then add the flour mixture.  Stir just until combined. 
Spoon the batter into the muffin tins, mounding slightly.  Bake for 28 minutes, or until crusty on top.  Cool the muffins for 5 minutes in the pan before removing to a rack. 
This recipe yields 12 large muffins or 24 mini-muffins.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  1              ounce  dried porcini
     3/4           cup  hot water
     1/2         pound  fresh cultivated white mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  onion -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-milled white pepper
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Olive oil or vegetable oil -- for oiling boards
                        and baking dish
                        === BASIC POLENTA ===
  1 1/2           cups  cornmeal
  6               cups  water
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
     1/2         pound  shredded fontina - (2 cups)
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated parmigiano

Recipe title translation:  Baked Polenta Casserole With Creamy Mushroom Sauce And Fontina
To begin to prepare the sauce, in a small bowl combine the dried porcini and hot water and let stand for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Remove the porcini and squeeze out excess water.  Using scissors, cut them into pieces about the size of your thumbnail.  Set aside.  Strain the mushroom liquor through a paper towel or a fine sieve; reserve. 
Lightly oil an 8- by 11-inch baking pan and set it aside.  Lightly oil two large pastry boards or baking sheets, or a very large scratchproof counter surface. 
Make the polenta and when it is cooked, turn it directly out onto the boards, counter, or baking sheets.  Use a large knife or rubber spatula, first dipped in cold water, to spread out the polenta to a thickness of about 1/2 inch.  Allow it to cool and harden, about 20 minutes.  Cut it into approximate 3-inch squares. 
Meanwhile, preheat an oven to 400 degrees.  Continue to make the sauce.  Using a soft brush or clean kitchen towel, remove any dirt from the fresh mushrooms.  Don't wash them because water will alter their texture.  Separate the stems from the caps, discarding the stems if they are tough.  Slice the mushroom caps and tender stems thinly. 
In a skillet over medium-low heat, melt the butter with the oil.  Add the onion and saute until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add the porcini and saute for another 5 or 6 minutes to marry the flavors.  Add the cultivated mushrooms and continue to saute until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the mushroom soaking liquid, salt, and pepper.  Allow to simmer gently for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Then stir in the cream, and allow the mixture barely to reach a simmer.  Immediately remove the skillet from the heat. 
Place half of the polenta squares in a layer on the bottom of the prepared dish.  Spread half of the sauce in a layer over them, then sprinkle with half of the cheeses.  Place another layer of polenta squares over the cheeses.  Spoon the remaining sauce on top and sprinkle with the remaining cheeses. 
Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and golden and the pasticcio is bubbling, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let settle for 10 minutes before cutting into squares.  Serve hot. 
Ahead-of-time note:  This pasticcio can be assembled up to 3 days in advance, covered, and refrigerated, and then baked just before serving.  Leftover pasticcio reheats well:  Cover with aluminum foil and place in a preheated 375 degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on whether it is chilled or at room temperature. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe title translation:  Baked Polenta Casserole With Creamy Mushroom Sauce And Fontina
</DirT>
<DirT>
To begin to prepare the sauce, in a small bowl combine the dried porcini and hot water and let stand for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Remove the porcini and squeeze out excess water.  Using scissors, cut them into pieces about the size of your thumbnail.  Set aside.  Strain the mushroom liquor through a paper towel or a fine sieve; reserve. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly oil an 8- by 11-inch baking pan and set it aside.  Lightly oil two large pastry boards or baking sheets, or a very large scratchproof counter surface. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the polenta and when it is cooked, turn it directly out onto the boards, counter, or baking sheets.  Use a large knife or rubber spatula, first dipped in cold water, to spread out the polenta to a thickness of about 1/2 inch.  Allow it to cool and harden, about 20 minutes.  Cut it into approximate 3-inch squares. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, preheat an oven to 400 degrees.  Continue to make the sauce.  Using a soft brush or clean kitchen towel, remove any dirt from the fresh mushrooms.  Don&apos;t wash them because water will alter their texture.  Separate the stems from the caps, discarding the stems if they are tough.  Slice the mushroom caps and tender stems thinly. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a skillet over medium-low heat, melt the butter with the oil.  Add the onion and saute until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add the porcini and saute for another 5 or 6 minutes to marry the flavors.  Add the cultivated mushrooms and continue to saute until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the mushroom soaking liquid, salt, and pepper.  Allow to simmer gently for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Then stir in the cream, and allow the mixture barely to reach a simmer.  Immediately remove the skillet from the heat. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place half of the polenta squares in a layer on the bottom of the prepared dish.  Spread half of the sauce in a layer over them, then sprinkle with half of the cheeses.  Place another layer of polenta squares over the cheeses.  Spoon the remaining sauce on top and sprinkle with the remaining cheeses. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and golden and the pasticcio is bubbling, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let settle for 10 minutes before cutting into squares.  Serve hot. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Ahead-of-time note:  This pasticcio can be assembled up to 3 days in advance, covered, and refrigerated, and then baked just before serving.  Leftover pasticcio reheats well:  Cover with aluminum foil and place in a preheated 375 degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on whether it is chilled or at room temperature. 
</DirT>

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
  2               cups  milk
     1/3           cup  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/3            cup  white polenta
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  cream
  6               cups  fontina cheese
  2               cups  grated Parmigiano Reggiano
  4               cups  mixed mushrooms (porcini, chanterelles,
                        morels, champignon)
  2                     garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley

Bring to a boil the water, milk, a pinch of salt and butter.  When the mixture reaches boil, pour in the polenta flour in a stream, mixing continuously.  Cook for approximately 45 minutes.  (The polenta will be cooked when it pulls off the sides).  When the polenta is cooked, pour it into 4 shallow, lightly-buttered baking dishes into layers of approximately 1/2-inch high.  Shake to set, and let cool in refrigerator covered with clear plastic wrap. 
In a deep pan, heat the cream.  Add the 4 cups of fontina cheese and stir until the cheese is melted.  In a deep buttered baking dish, set one layer of polenta.  Then pour 1/3 of the fontina cheese mixture, sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Follow with another layer of polenta, another layer of fontina cheese and so on until finished.  Top off with remaining shavings of fontina and Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Bake in a preheated oven at 425 degrees for 20 minutes. 
While the polenta is baking, clean, wash and drain the mushrooms well.  Slice the garlic and cook until golden in 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Add the cleaned mushrooms, stir until all water evaporates (approximately 10 minutes).  Add the wine; allow it to evaporate and then add the chicken stock.  Let cook for 5 minutes, add parsley and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes.  Salt and pepper to taste. 
To serve, cut the polenta into rectangles with a spatula and pour the mushroom sauce over it.  Sprinkle with parsley. 
this recipe yields 10 servings.

Pomarola (Pummarola) - Neapolitan Tomato Sauce With Carrot, Celery, Onion, Garlic, And Herbs

Recipe By     :Julia Della Croce
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  canned, peeled plum tomatoes in juice,
                        or 2 1/2 lbs fresh, sweet, mature
                        vine-ripened
                        plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- bruised
  1              small  red onion -- finely chopped
  1             medium  celery stalk, including leaves -- finely chopped
  1              small  carrot -- scraped, chopped fine
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh Italian parsley
                        Small handful chopped fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/2      teaspoon  salt - (scant) -- or to taste
                        Freshly-milled black or white pepper -- to taste

If using canned tomatoes, drain the tomatoes in a colander, reserving their juice.  Strain the captured tomato juice to hold back the seeds.  Using your fingers, push out excess seeds from each tomato.  Chop the tomatoes and set aside. 
If using fresh tomatoes, bring a large saucepan three-fourths full of water to a boil.  Slip in the tomatoes and blanch for 30 to 45 seconds.  Drain the tomatoes and immediately plunge them into cold water.  Using a paring knife, lift off the skins and cut out the tough area around the core of each tomato.  Cut the tomatoes into quarters lengthwise and, using your fingers, push out the excess seeds.  Chop the tomatoes. 
In a saucepan over medium-low heat, warm 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, the garlic, and onion together, and saute until the garlic is golden and the onion is translucent, 4 to 5 minutes.  Then add the celery, carrot, parsley, and basil, and saute until the vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes.  Press down on the vegetables with the back of a wooden spoon to release their flavors.  Add the tomato paste and continue to saute for 3 minutes.  Then add the tomatoes and their juice, cover partially, and simmer gently until thickened, about 45 minutes.  Remove and discard the garlic cloves and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. 
If a smooth sauce is desired, allow it to cool somewhat.  Position a food mill over a clean saucepan and pass the sauce through it, being sure to press out as much of the pulp as possible.  Place over medium heat just long enough for the sauce to heat through, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. 
This recipe yields approximately 2 cups, sufficient for saucing 1 pound of pasta. 
Ahead of time note:  The sauce can be made 4 to 5 days in advance of using and stored tightly covered in the refrigerator, or it can be frozen for up to 3 months.  Whether storing it in the refrigerator or freezer, leave out the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Stir it into the sauce after reheating.

  6                     egg yolks -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        === HOT BUTTERED RUM SAUCE ===
  1                cup  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  dark rum
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2             ounces  chilled unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- chopped
                        === BASIC TART CRUST ===
  4             ounces  room temperature unsalted butter - (1
                        stick) -- chopped
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  heavy cream, half-and-half or milk
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                     egg -- blended with fork

For the Raisin Custard, soak the raisins in the rum in a small bowl at room temperature for at least 4 hours or overnight, stirring occasionally. 
Place the milk, salt and 1/4 cup sugar in a heavy, large saucepan.  Scrape the seeds from the vanilla beans into the mixture, add the beans and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Remove from the heat and let the vanilla beans steep for at least 1 hour or until the mixture cools to room temperature.  Discard the beans (or wash, dry and reserve them for another use). 
Beat the yolks and 1/2 cup sugar using an electric mixer until thick and pale lemon in color.  Mix in the flour.  Reheat the milk mixture and gradually beat it into the yolks.  Return the mixture to the saucepan.  Whisk over medium-high heat until the mixture comes to a boil and becomes very thick.  Reduce heat to medium-low and whisk until smooth, for about 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the raisins with the rum.  Press a sheet of plastic wrap onto the custard so a crust doesn't form.  (This can be prepared ahead, cooled, covered and set aside at cool room temperature for several hours or refrigerated overnight.  Bring to room temperature before filling tart.) 
For the Hot Buttered Rum Sauce, stir the brown sugar in a heavy small saucepan over medium heat until melted and smooth.  Pour in the rum and cream and simmer, stirring until the sauce is smooth, thickened and reduced to about 3/4 cup.  Whisk in the butter until melted.  (This can be prepared ahead, cooled, covered and set aside at cool room temperature for several hours or refrigerated overnight.) 
For the Basic Tart Crust dough, cream the butter using an electric mixer.  Beat in the salt and sugar.  Stir in the cream and 1/5 of the flour.  Add the remaining flour, mixing with your fingertips or a fork until the ingredients are combined.  Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap and shape into a flat disk.  Wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.  (This can be prepared 1 day ahead.) 
To form the crust, butter a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Roll the dough out between 2 large sheets of plastic wrap into an 11-inch circle.  Remove the top sheet of plastic.  Invert into the prepared pan.  Trim and finish the edges.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. 
To bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line the tart with parchment paper or aluminum foil and fill with beans or pie weights.  Bake until the crust is firm and set, for about 15 minutes.  Remove the beans and paper.  Prick the bottom of the crust so it does not puff.  Continue baking until well browned, for 10 to 15 minutes. 
Fill the tart with the custard and smooth the top with a spatula.  Brush with the egg.  Return to the oven and bake until the custard is well browned, for 20 to 25 minutes.  Cool in the tart pan on a rack for 3 to 4 hours. 
To serve, remove the outer ring of the tart pan.  Cut 6 to 8 wedges and transfer them to dessert plates.  Stir the rum sauce over medium-high heat to rewarm.  Ladle over tarts.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  2                     live lobsters - (1 lb ea)
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh tarragon
                        === STOCK ===
                        Lobster shells from above
  1                     carrot
  1                     celery stalk
  1              small  onion -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled
                        Water -- to cover
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1                cup  chicken stock
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2             ounces  white truffle butter
  1               dash  lemon juice
  1               dash  hot pepper sauce
  1               dash  Worcestershire sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === EGG WASH ===
  1                     egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  milk
                        === PASTA ===
  4                     fresh pasta sheets, 18" by 24"
                        === GARNISH ===
  2        tablespoons  caviar or flying fish roe
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives

Boil lobsters in lightly salted boiling water for 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove and cool in cold water.  Remove meat from shells and chop into small diced pieces, set aside. 
Rinse the lobster bodies (from above) under running water to remove the green tomalley.  Combine with the vegetables, tomato paste, and garlic in a small stock pot.  Cover with cold water (just enough to cover shells and vegetables).  Bring to a boil, then simmer for 2 hours.  When done, strain, then reduce over medium-high heat until thick and dark (watch it carefully, as you get near the end).  You should have about 1/2 cup liquid.  Set aside. 
While the stock is cooking, prepare the sauce.  Heat the wine and chicken stock together.  Bring to a boil, then reduce until almost dry (about 1/4 cup).  Add heavy cream, reduce by 1/2 then add the truffle butter with a whisk until well incorporated.  Finish with a dash of lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce and salt and pepper.  Keep warm until ready to use. 
Combine the chopped lobster meat, the tarragon and the lobster stock.  Mix well, add salt and pepper to taste. 
Whisk together the egg yolk and milk for the eggwash.  Lay out the pasta sheets and brush with the egg wash.  Divide the lobster filling evenly into 32 parts and place it onto the sheets in rows 6 inches long by 3 inches wide, to make 32 pieces.  Cut with a round or scalloped edge cutter and place on a tray covered with parchment paper and dusted with cornmeal.  Pinch the edges of the ravioli together to seal them well or you can use a ravioli tray to make them.  You can make the raviolis ahead of time and freeze them, or use them fresh. 
Cook the raviolis in boiling, lightly-salted water, about 5 to 10 minutes, until pasta is al dente.  Drain.  Toss with the truffle sauce, serve in bowls, and garnish with a sprinkle of caviar and chopped chives.  Parmesan cheese is not recommended for this dish as it interferes with the flavor of the sauce. 
This recipe yields 4 servings as a main course, 8 servings as an appetizer.

  12            ounces  fresh porcini mushrooms -- sliced

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     baby monkfish tails
  8             slices  bacon
  1                     salsify
  1                     celery root
  2                     parsnips
                        Sherry vinegar -- to taste
  1              bunch  Italian parsley -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste

Clean the skin of the monkfish and remove the central bone.  Tie up the tails with the slice of bacon that you have slightly pounded.  Clean all the vegetables and cut them in large chunks. 
In a saute pan over medium heat, sear the monkfish to give a little color to the bacon, reserve.  In the same pan saute the vegetables in the residual fat from the bacon, for 6 to 8 minutes or until they start to caramelize add a little bit of sherry vinegar and reduce it by half. 
Place the monkfish tails on top of the vegetables and cover, let the tails cook in their own steam.  Add a little bit of fresh chopped parsley on top and serve as is.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  confectioners' sugar
     1/4           cup  cold water
  1         tablespoon  unflavored gelatin
     1/2           cup  glucose (found in cake-decorating stores)
                        or white corn syrup
  1 1/2    tablespoons  glycerine (found in cake-decorating
                        stores)
  1           teaspoon  flavoring (vanilla will give the fondant
                        an off-white color)

In a large bowl, sift sugar and make a well in the center.  Pour the water into a small saucepan and sprinkle the gelatin on top to soften for about 5 minutes.  Heat the gelatin and stir until dissolved and clear.  Do not boil. 
Turn off the heat and add the glucose or syrup and glycerine, stirring until well blended.  Add flavoring.  Pour into well of sugar and mix until all of the sugar is blended.  Knead the icing with your hands until it becomes stiff.  If the mixture is sticky, add small amounts of confectioners' sugar. 
Shape the mixture into a ball, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in an airtight container.  This will keep for two weeks. 
This recipe yields 2 pounds, enough to cover a 9-inch cake, 4 inches high.

     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     3/4           cup  Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise -- at room temperature

In a large, wide Dutch oven or large, deep skillet, saute the butter, chopped onion, celery, and carrot until they are soft but not browned.  Add the ground meats and prosciutto, turning the flame very low.  It is very important that the meat heat very gently, only enough to color it on the outside.  Not searing the meat allows it to absorb the other flavors of the sauce, and will also make it more delicate and creamy.  Break up and stir the meat as you heat it.  You should get it to a uniform pink, not brown color. 
Add the salt, pepper and wine.  Simmer very gently for several minutes until the alcohol evaporates and the liquid begins to be absorbed by the meat and vegetables.  Stir in milk and nutmeg.  It is important to add the milk before adding the tomatoes for it to be absorbed directly by the meat.  Cook gently for 10 minutes.  Add the tomatoes.  When the sauce begins to simmer, turn the flame down as low as you can.  If your burner cannot be regulated low enough, insert a "flame tamer."  Simmer in this way, partially covered, for about 4 hours, stirring it gently now and then. 
Check for seasonings and add an additional pinch of nutmeg if necessary.  If the sauce is being used on fresh noodles (not lasagne), and you have a mind to be extravagant, add the cream and the finely sliced truffle when it is finished.  Stir and pour over cooked fresh pasta. 
This recipe yields sauce for 1 pound of pasta.

Salsa Di Pomodoro A Crudo Di Flavia - Flavia's Uncooked Tomato And Avocado Sauce

Recipe By     :Julia Della Croce
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh, sweet, mature vine-ripened tomatoes
                        or sweet, ripe cherry tomatoes
  4              large  fresh basil leaves -- torn very small
                        pieces, or chopped
  1              large  garlic clove -- finely chopped,
                        or passed through a garlic press
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt - (generous) -- or to taste
                        Freshly-milled black or white pepper -- to taste
  1              large  ripe (but not spotted) Hass avocado

Cut out the tough area around the core of each tomato and cut the tomatoes into quarters lengthwise.  Using your fingers, push out excess seeds.  Cut the tomatoes into rough dice or chop them coarsely.  Place the tomatoes in the bowl in which you will serve the pasta, or in a sauce dish if using with fish.  Add the basil, garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper. 
Insert a knife into the avocado at the top, where the navel is.  Cut into the avocado until you reach the seed, then make a clean incision all the way around the length of the fruit.  Grasping one half in one hand and the other half in your other hand, twist the halves in opposite directions to open the avocado.  The seed should fall right out. 
Peel and thinly slice each half crosswise; then cut the slices further into small strips or dice.  Add the avocado to the bowl with the other ingredients.  Toss to mix and allow to stand at room temperature while the pasta or fish cooks. 
This recipe yields approximately 2 1/2 cups, sufficient for saucing 1 pound of pasta. 
Ahead of time note:  Make the sauce up to 2 hours in advance.  Cover and leave at room temperature until ready to serve.

                              Salt Cod Salad

Recipe By     :Julia Della Croce
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Salted Cod


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  skinless, boneless baccala
  1              thick  apple slice or 1/2 potato
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1              small  garlic clove -- finely chopped
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh Italian parsley

To prepare the salt cod, place it in a bowl and add cold water to cover and the apple or potato, which helps to draw out the salt.  Refrigerate overnight, changing the water several times during the soaking.  Drain the salt cod and rinse in fresh cool water. 
Place the cod in a pan with cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook gently until the fish is tender but not falling apart, 15 to 20 minutes.  Taste it before draining to make sure it is cooked.  If it is still too hard, continue cooking it gently.  If you find it still too salty at this point, cover with fresh cold water, bring to a boil again, and drain and rinse. 
When the fish is tender, drain and rinse under cold water.  Drain well and pat dry with a cotton kitchen towel.  Check for any skin and bones that may have been missed. 
Break up the fish into large flakes and transfer to a serving plate.  In a small bowl stir together the oil, lemon juice, garlic and pepper to taste.  Drizzle over the fish.  Sprinkle with the parsley.  Serve at room temperature. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Deborah Stanton

Categories    : Biscuits                        Breakfast


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE BISCUITS ===
  1              pound  all-purpose flour -- plus
  6             ounces  all-purpose flour
     1/2         ounce  salt
  1 1/2         ounces  baking powder
  4             ounces  sugar
     3/4         quart  heavy cream
     1/3           cup  finely-sliced scallions
                        === FOR THE GRAVY ===
  4             pieces  favorite sausage (links or patties)
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
     1/2                Spanish onion -- cut small dice
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2          cups  water - (to 3/4 cups)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Red pepper flakes -- to taste

For the biscuits:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine all dry ingredients in the bowl of a mixer.  On medium speed add heavy cream and scallions, mix just until it pulls together, not wet.  On a lightly floured work surface roll out 1/4-inch thick.  Cut 3-inch rounds and place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper, bake for 8 minutes.  Cool.  (Yields about 24 biscuits) 
For the gravy:  In a saute pan over medium heat cook the sausage in the peanut oil.  Remove from pan when thoroughly cooked.  In sausage drippings saute onions until translucent and tender sprinkle with the flour and stir with wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add water and stir to combine and eliminate any lumps.  Bring to a boil.  Add salt, pepper and red pepper flakes to taste.  Reduce to a simmer until desired flavor develops. 
To assemble:  Slice biscuits in half lengthwise.  Layer sausage on bottom slice, spoon gravy over top of sausage and place lid on.  Serve with your favorite eggs. 
This recipe yields 4 sausage and gravy biscuit servings.

For the biscuits:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine all dry ingredients in the bowl of a mixer.  On medium speed add heavy cream and scallions, mix just until it pulls together, not wet.  On a lightly floured work surface roll out 1/4-inch thick.  Cut 3-inch rounds and place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper, bake for 8 minutes.  Cool.  (Yields about 24 biscuits) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the gravy:  In a saute pan over medium heat cook the sausage in the peanut oil.  Remove from pan when thoroughly cooked.  In sausage drippings saute onions until translucent and tender sprinkle with the flour and stir with wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add water and stir to combine and eliminate any lumps.  Bring to a boil.  Add salt, pepper and red pepper flakes to taste.  Reduce to a simmer until desired flavor develops. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble:  Slice biscuits in half lengthwise.  Layer sausage on bottom slice, spoon gravy over top of sausage and place lid on.  Serve with your favorite eggs.

This recipe yields 4 sausage and gravy biscuit servings.

  8                     jumbo sea scallops
  1                     celery root -- thinly julienned

            Seared Sea Scallops With Black Truffle Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Matthew Tivy

Categories    : Appetizers                      Main Dish
                Scallops                        Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  homemade chicken stock,
                        or unsalted canned stock
  2        tablespoons  sherry vinegar
     1/4           cup  vegetable or corn oil
  1         tablespoon  white truffle oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         ounce  black truffle peelings -- canned is fine
                        Vegetable oil -- for sauteeing
  2              dozen  fresh dry sea scallops (not processed),
                        as large as possible
                        Chopped chives -- for garnish

In a small saucepan, over medium-high heat, boil the chicken stock and reduce until only 1/4 cup remains.  Remove from heat and let cool.  Transfer to blender and over medium speed add the sherry vinegar, then the vegetable oil and the truffle oil.  The vinaigrette should be lightly emulsified with a texture like a very light mayonnaise.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Add the truffle peelings, remove from blender and heat in the small saucepan until hot but not boiling.  Set aside in a warm place until ready to serve. 
Scallops should be sauteed at the last minute before serving.  Heat 2 medium saute pans over high heat.  Add enough oil to evenly cover bottom of saute pans (1/8-inch).  When the oil just begins to smoke add the scallops (pull pans off the stove when you add the scallops, be careful not to splash the hot oil).  Cook the scallops until nicely browned on one side, then and only then, turn them over to the other side.  Scallops should have a nicely caramelized color to best bring out their natural sweetness.  If the scallops are large, brown the sides also.  Cook for a total of 8 minutes, then remove from stove and let sit in the pan for about 1 minute. 
The juices of the scallops will begin to gather at the bottom of the pan.  Now toss the scallops lightly in their own juices (off the heat) and deglaze the pan in this manner.  The juices of the scallops will blend with the brown layer stuck to the saute pan, then they will coat the scallops with a shiny, rich glaze. 
Divide the scallops onto 4 plates and drizzle them with the truffle vinaigrette.  Garnish with chopped chives.  If serving as a main course, suggested accompaniments include boiled red potatoes or new potatoes, sauteed greens such as spinach, escarole or broccoli rabe with a touch of garlic and extra-virgin olive oil. 
This recipe yields 4 servings as main course, 6 servings as an appetizer.

                        === TOMATO CONFIT ===
  1              pound  ripe plum tomatoes -- peeled, halved,
                        and squeezed to remove seeds
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary - (3" long)

  1                cup  whole, peeled garlic cloves
  1                cup  olive oil -- plus more as needed
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  Tomato Confit -- (see above)
     1/3           cup  Garlic Confit -- (see above)
     1/3           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        === VEGETABLE TIAN ===
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  minced garlic
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pound  red bell peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        seeded, and sliced into 1"-wide strips
  12            ounces  fresh plum tomatoes -- cut 1/8"-thick rounds
  8             ounces  zucchini -- cut 1/8"-thick rounds
  8             ounces  Japanese eggplant -- cut 1/8"-thick rounds
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  6                     fresh tuna steaks, 2 1/2" thick - (6 oz
                        ea)
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil

Tomato Confit:  Place the tomatoes in a colander and toss with the salt.  Let drain at room temperature for 2 hours.  Pat the tomatoes dry with paper towels. 
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.  Place the tomatoes, garlic, and rosemary in a nonreactive 2-quart saucepan.  Add enough oil to cover the tomatoes.  Cover the saucepan and bake until the tomatoes are very tender, but not falling apart, about 3 hours.  Drain, discard the garlic and rosemary, and set the tomato confit aside for the sauce.  (The tomato confit can be prepared up to 3 days in advance, covered and refrigerated.) 
Garlic Confit:  Place the garlic cloves and 2 cups cold water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.  Drain.  Repeat the procedure 2 more times. 
Return the drained garlic cloves to the saucepan and add the oil.  Bring to a bare simmer over very low heat.  Cook until the garlic is tender, about 40 minutes.  Cool completely.  Transfer to a 1-pint canning jar, add enough oil to cover the garlic, and seal.  (The garlic confit can be prepared up to 3 weeks in advance, covered and refrigerated.) 
Sauce:  Place the tomato confit, garlic confit, water, salt and pepper in a blender and process on high speed.  With the machine running, drizzle in the oil and blend until the sauce is emulsified, about 1 minute.  Transfer to a medium bowl and stir in the parsley and thyme.  Set aside at room temperature. 
Vegetable Tian:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil a 9- by 13-inch ceramic or glass baking dish.  In a small bowl, combine the oil with the thyme, garlic, salt, and pepper. 
Arrange half of the vegetables in rows in the dish, interspersing the different types until the bottom of the dish is covered.  Drizzle with half of the oil mixture.  Make a final layer of mixed vegetables, and drizzle with the remaining oil mixture.  Cover the top of the vegetables with lightly oiled parchment paper.  Bake until the vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes. 
Assembly:  Remove the vegetable tian from the oven, keep warm in a warm place, and increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees. 
Season the tuna with the salt and pepper.  Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add the tuna and cook, turning once, until seared on both sides, about 2 minutes.  Uncover the tian and place the seared tuna fillets on top of the vegetables, spacing them evenly.  Bake, uncovered, until the tuna is rare to medium-rare, about 5 minutes. 
Spoon equal amounts of the sauce in the centers of 6 warmed plates.  Using a wide spatula, lift portions of the tuna and vegetables and transfer to the plates. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

<DirT>
Tomato Confit:  Place the tomatoes in a colander and toss with the salt.  Let drain at room temperature for 2 hours.  Pat the tomatoes dry with paper towels. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.  Place the tomatoes, garlic, and rosemary in a nonreactive 2-quart saucepan.  Add enough oil to cover the tomatoes.  Cover the saucepan and bake until the tomatoes are very tender, but not falling apart, about 3 hours.  Drain, discard the garlic and rosemary, and set the tomato confit aside for the sauce.  (The tomato confit can be prepared up to 3 days in advance, covered and refrigerated.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Garlic Confit:  Place the garlic cloves and 2 cups cold water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.  Drain.  Repeat the procedure 2 more times. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the drained garlic cloves to the saucepan and add the oil.  Bring to a bare simmer over very low heat.  Cook until the garlic is tender, about 40 minutes.  Cool completely.  Transfer to a 1-pint canning jar, add enough oil to cover the garlic, and seal.  (The garlic confit can be prepared up to 3 weeks in advance, covered and refrigerated.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sauce:  Place the tomato confit, garlic confit, water, salt and pepper in a blender and process on high speed.  With the machine running, drizzle in the oil and blend until the sauce is emulsified, about 1 minute.  Transfer to a medium bowl and stir in the parsley and thyme.  Set aside at room temperature. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Vegetable Tian:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil a 9- by 13-inch ceramic or glass baking dish.  In a small bowl, combine the oil with the thyme, garlic, salt, and pepper. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange half of the vegetables in rows in the dish, interspersing the different types until the bottom of the dish is covered.  Drizzle with half of the oil mixture.  Make a final layer of mixed vegetables, and drizzle with the remaining oil mixture.  Cover the top of the vegetables with lightly oiled parchment paper.  Bake until the vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Assembly:  Remove the vegetable tian from the oven, keep warm in a warm place, and increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the tuna with the salt and pepper.  Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add the tuna and cook, turning once, until seared on both sides, about 2 minutes.  Uncover the tian and place the seared tuna fillets on top of the vegetables, spacing them evenly.  Bake, uncovered, until the tuna is rare to medium-rare, about 5 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon equal amounts of the sauce in the centers of 6 warmed plates.  Using a wide spatula, lift portions of the tuna and vegetables and transfer to the plates. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOFT CHOCOLATE MOUSSE ===
  10            ounces  extra-bittersweet chocolate
  4                     eggs -- separated
     2/3           cup  powdered sugar
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
  1                cup  extra-heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  blackberry brandy or rum
                        === SOLID CHOCOLATE MOUSSE ===
  10            ounces  extra-bittersweet chocolate
  12            ounces  extra-heavy cream

Soft chocolate mousse:  Melt chocolate over simmering water of a water bath. 
Whip egg yolks with 1/3 cup powdered sugar until pale and airy, place whipped yolks in medium sized bowl.  Add warm melted chocolate and fold until just mixed.  Wash bowl and wipe thoroughly. 
Dissolve 1/3 cup granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water in small pot, bring to a boil, cook to 230 degrees on a candy thermometer. 
While sugar is boiling slowly whip whites to soft peak. 
When sugar is ready, slowly pour into whites while beating at a medium speed in a steady stream.  Continue to whip until stiff peaks form.  Remove whites, spoon whites on top of yolks but do not fold in. 
Whip cream and 1/3 cup powdered sugar until medium stiff peak, now fold in whites until just mixed.  Add cream and fold until incorporated, do not over fold. 
Store in refrigerator until ready to use (should be used as soon as possible). 
Solid chocolate mousse:  Melt chocolate hot, over double broiler (do not burn chocolate), heat until it is warm to the touch. 
Whip cream until very soft peaks form (lines show in slightly whipped cream). 
Very, very quickly add chocolate to cream and fold in, mixture may look broken but keep folding until everything is smooth, but do not overmix.  Place in bowl, cover and refrigerate until set. 
To serve, place the two mousses in composition to contrast each other.  Garnish with berries and crisp a cookie, if desired 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

Separately rinse the grains, then cook barley, wheat berries and rices, each in a separate pot, starting in clean, cold water with aromatic herbs in each.  Just prior to each grain becoming tender, season with salt and pepper. 
When just fully cooked pour any excess water from each pot and spread grains out on a shallow baking pan and cool quickly. 
Season and steep couscous in an equal volume of cold water or even better a combination of orange juice and water.  Allow to rehydrate then rub grains between your hands to fluff them. 
Heat butter in large saute pan (preferably nonstick), and saute vegetables and garlic until tender.  Season, add thyme, nuts and all the prepared grains and saute them together.  Adjust seasoning. 
Meanwhile reduce vegetable stock and wine by 2/3.  Add cream and bring to boil, reduce slightly.  Add cheese and melt to thicken.  Season and add thyme.  Season (you may not need any salt depending on the feta you are using, but freshly cracked pepper in the sauce is a must). 
Shape the hot grains in a timbale mold.  Pour the sauce around.  Accompany with a saute of asparagus spears (start with approximately 1 pound, trimmed and blanched) and mixed wild mushrooms (again, start with a scant pound, trimmed and cut into different shapes).  Garnish with herb sprigs. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ANCHOVY BUTTER ===
  6              whole  salted anchovies - (abt 1 1/2 oz),
                        available at Italian or Greek food stores
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  1           teaspoon  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/8      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === TOMATO CONFIT ===
  1              pound  ripe plum tomatoes -- peeled, halved,
                        and squeezed to remove seeds
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary - (3" long)
  1 1/2           cups  olive oil -- or as needed
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  1                cup  julienned fennel bulb
     1/3           cup  coarsely-chopped Tomato Confit -- (see above)
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped pitted Nicoise olives
  2          teaspoons  bottled capers -- rinsed
  1              large  egg -- separated
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream
  4             pieces  parchment paper - (12" square)
  4                     turbot fillets - (6 oz ea) -- skin removed
     1/2           cup  dry vermouth
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt -- mixed with
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil

Anchovy Butter:  Rinse the anchovies well to remove their salt.  Run your thumbnail along the backbone of each anchovy to remove the fillets.  Discard the bones and mince the fillets into a paste.  Transfer the paste to a small bowl and mix in the remaining ingredients.  (The anchovy butter can be prepared up to 1 day in advance, covered and refrigerated.  Remove from the refrigerator and let stand until softened before using.) 
Tomato Confit:  Place the tomatoes in a colander and toss with the salt.  Let drain at room temperature for 2 hours.  Pat the tomatoes dry with paper towels. 
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.  Place the tomatoes, garlic, and rosemary in a nonreactive 2-quart saucepan.  Add enough oil to cover the tomatoes.  Cover the saucepan and bake until the tomatoes are very tender, but not falling apart, about 3 hours.  Drain, discard the garlic and rosemary, and set the tomato confit aside for the sauce.  (The tomato confit can be prepared up to 3 days in advance, covered and refrigerated.) 
Assembly:  Bring a medium saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil and add the fennel.  Cook for 1 minute.  Drain, rinse under cold water, and drain again.  Place in a bowl and add the Tomato Confit, olives, and capers.  Mix well and set aside. 
In a small bowl, beat the egg white until foamy.  In another small bowl, beat the egg yolk and heavy cream.  Set the two bowls aside. 
Fold each piece of parchment paper in half.  Using scissors, cut each folded piece of paper into a wide, plump heart shape (each opened heart should be about 12 inches across its widest point).  Place an opened parchment heart on your work surface, with the fold running vertically.  Leaving a 1-inch border, spread one side of the heart with 1 tablespoon anchovy butter.  Top with 1 turbot fillet, one-fourth of the fennel mixture, 2 tablespoons vermouth, and 1 additional tablespoon of anchovy butter.  Season with the salt and pepper mixture.  Brush the outside edge of the heart with the beaten egg white.  Fold the unbuttered side of the parchment heart over to cover the fish.  Using tight interlocking folds, close the edges of the paper heart.  Place on a baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.  Brush the tops of the papillotes with the egg yolk mixture.  Refrigerate for 1 hour. 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  You will need 1 large skillet for each papillote.  Place 1 tablespoon of oil in each skillet, and heat over medium heat.  Add 1 papillote to each skillet and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the undersides are deeply browned.  Transfer the skillets to the oven and bake until the top of the papillate is browned, about 5 minutes. 
To serve, cut open each papillate and transfer the contents, including all the juices, to warmed dinner plates.

Anchovy Butter:  Rinse the anchovies well to remove their salt.  Run your thumbnail along the backbone of each anchovy to remove the fillets.  Discard the bones and mince the fillets into a paste.  Transfer the paste to a small bowl and mix in the remaining ingredients.  (The anchovy butter can be prepared up to 1 day in advance, covered and refrigerated.  Remove from the refrigerator and let stand until softened before using.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tomato Confit:  Place the tomatoes in a colander and toss with the salt.  Let drain at room temperature for 2 hours.  Pat the tomatoes dry with paper towels. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.  Place the tomatoes, garlic, and rosemary in a nonreactive 2-quart saucepan.  Add enough oil to cover the tomatoes.  Cover the saucepan and bake until the tomatoes are very tender, but not falling apart, about 3 hours.  Drain, discard the garlic and rosemary, and set the tomato confit aside for the sauce.  (The tomato confit can be prepared up to 3 days in advance, covered and refrigerated.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Assembly:  Bring a medium saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil and add the fennel.  Cook for 1 minute.  Drain, rinse under cold water, and drain again.  Place in a bowl and add the Tomato Confit, olives, and capers.  Mix well and set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, beat the egg white until foamy.  In another small bowl, beat the egg yolk and heavy cream.  Set the two bowls aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fold each piece of parchment paper in half.  Using scissors, cut each folded piece of paper into a wide, plump heart shape (each opened heart should be about 12 inches across its widest point).  Place an opened parchment heart on your work surface, with the fold running vertically.  Leaving a 1-inch border, spread one side of the heart with 1 tablespoon anchovy butter.  Top with 1 turbot fillet, one-fourth of the fennel mixture, 2 tablespoons vermouth, and 1 additional tablespoon of anchovy butter.  Season with the salt and pepper mixture.  Brush the outside edge of the heart with the beaten egg white.  Fold the unbuttered side of the parchment heart over to cover the fish.  Using tight interlocking folds, close the edges of the paper heart.  Place on a baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.  Brush the tops of the papillotes with the egg yolk mixture.  Refrigerate for 1 hour. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  You will need 1 large skillet for each papillote.  Place 1 tablespoon of oil in each skillet, and heat over medium heat.  Add 1 papillote to each skillet and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the undersides are deeply browned.  Transfer the skillets to the oven and bake until the top of the papillate is browned, about 5 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  skinless turkey breast
  1               dash  Paul Prudhomme Poultry Seasoning
     1/2           cup  sun-dried tomatoes
  4             ounces  light cream cheese (Neufchatel) -- softened
  16                    fresh basil leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8                     lavosh rectangles, 6" by 8" (Armenian
                        flat bread) or 8 whole-wheat tortillas

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Wrap the turkey breast tightly in microwaveable plastic wrap, then loosely in aluminum foil.  Place in a roasting dish and bake until the juices run clear, about 1 hour.  Season to taste with Paul Prudhomme poultry seasoning.  Set aside to cool. 
Soak the sun-dried tomatoes in boiling water to cover until soft, about 10 minutes.  Drain, reserving liquid.  Cut the tomatoes into julienne strips.  Put half in the bowl of a food processor and reserve the remainder. 
Pulse the tomatoes, adding just enough of the reserved soaking liquid to form a smooth paste.  Add the cream cheese, salt, and pepper and process until smooth. 
To assemble, thinly slice the cooled turkey breast.  Spread each lavosh rectangle with 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture, then top with 3 ounces sliced turkey, 2 to 3 sun-dried tomato strips, and 2 leaves of basil.  Roll up tightly.  If desired, slice rolls into pieces on the diagonal to serve. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     garlic cloves -- crushed
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2               cups  peeled, crushed tomatoes
  1          teaspoons  pepperoncini
  18                    littleneck clams -- scrubbed, rinsed
  1              pound  vermicelli
     1/2         pound  sea scallops -- quartered
  1         tablespoon  chopped Italian parsley

In a medium skillet, cook the garlic in 2 tablespoons of the oil until lightly browned.  Add the tomatoes and pepperoncini and simmer over moderate heat for 15 minutes.  Discard the garlic.  Shuck the clams and chop, reserve liquid. 
Another option is to place the clams in a medium saucepan with 1/2-inch of water.  Cover and steam over moderately-high heat until the clams open.  (Discard any that do not open).  Remove and chop the clams.  Strain the liquid from the saucepan and reserve. 
Cook the vermicelli in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente.  Drain well. 
Meanwhile, in a large non-reactive skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over high heat.  Add the scallops and saute for 2 minutes.  Add the chopped clams with their liquid, the tomato sauce and cook until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the parsley over medium heat. 
Toss the pasta with half the sauce, serve, and spoon remaining sauce on top. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Olive oil -- for baking sheet
  1              whole  red snapper - (2 lbs) -- cleaned, scaled
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary - (3" long)
  1              sprig  fresh thyme - (3" long)
  1           teaspoon  coriander seeds
  2                     dried bay leaves
  2 1/2         pounds  Kosher salt
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for serving
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Lightly oil a baking sheet large enough to hold the snapper. 
Rinse the snapper thoroughly, inside and out, and pat dry with paper towels.  Stuff the cavity with the rosemary, thyme, coriander seeds, and bay leaves. 
On the baking sheet, spread about 1/2 pound of the salt in an even layer that is slightly longer and wider than the snapper.  Place the fish on the salt layer and cover completely with the remaining salt. 
Bake until a instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the fish reads 130 degrees, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Brush away as much salt as possible. 
Using two dessert spoons, remove the top fillets and transfer to a warm plate.  Lift off the bones, then transfer the bottom fillets to another plate. 
Serve immediately, with the extra-virgin olive oil and lemon wedges passed on the side so each diner can season their fish as desired. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.
