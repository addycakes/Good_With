                            Angel Food Cake II

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  cake flour
  1 1/4           cups  granulated sugar
  1 1/2           cups  egg whites
                        = (from about 12 large eggs)
  1              pinch  salt
  1           teaspoon  cream of tartar
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice -- plus
  2 1/2    tablespoons  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  cold water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
  1 1/4           cups  sifted confectioners' sugar
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut a sheet of parchment paper or waxed paper to fit the bottom of a 10-inch tube pan.  Fit the paper into the bottom of the pan and set aside.  (Important: do not grease pan!)

Place 2 large sheets of waxed paper over a work surface.  Working over 1 large piece of waxed paper, sift the cake flour together with 1/4 cup of the sugar.  Sift the mixture 4 more times, working back and forth between the 2 sheets of waxed paper.  Set aside.  Sift the remaining 1 cup of granulated sugar onto another sheet of waxed paper and set aside.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites on medium-low speed until foamy.  Add the salt, cream of tartar, 2 teaspoons lemon juice, water, vanilla and almond extracts and increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the whites are nearly stiff.  Lower the speed to medium-low and beat in the 1 cup of sifted sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, until the mixture forms stiff peaks yet is not dry.

Remove the bowl from the electric mixer and sift about 1/4 of the flour mixture onto the top of the beaten egg whites.  Using a large rubber spatula, gently fold together.  Repeat this motion 3 more times with the remaining flour mixture, each time folding very gently together.  Gently transfer the batter to the prepared cake pan and run a knife through the mixture to eliminate any large air bubbles.  Smooth the top if necessary.

Bake the cake until the top is lightly golden and the cake springs back when touched lightly, about 45 to 50 minutes.

Remove the cake from the oven and invert the pan onto its legs (alternately, if the tube pan has no legs, simply hang the pan upside down over the neck of a sturdy bottle) and let sit until completely cooled.

When ready to serve, run the tip of a knife around the inner and outer edges of the cake pan to loosen it from the sides.  Unmold the cake and set aside.

In a small bowl combine the confectioners' sugar, remaining lemon juice, and lemon zest and stir until smooth.  Adjust the consistency, if necessary -- the glaze should be thick enough to cling to the sides of the cake yet still fluid.  If the glaze is too thin, add a bit more confectioners' sugar.  If too thick, add more citrus juice.  Spread the glaze over the top of the cake, allowing some to drip down the sides.  Let the glaze set before serving the cake.  Serve with macerated berries, if desired.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  milk
  4          teaspoons  active dry yeast - (1/2 oz)
  2               cups  bread flour
  3              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  4             ounces  butter - (1 stick) -- melted
                        === RUM SYRUP ===
  1                     vanilla bean -- split, seeds scraped
  3 3/4           cups  water
  2 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  2                     lemons -- zested (4 tspns)
  2                     oranges -- zested (2 tbspns)
     3/4           cup  dark rum

Scald the milk and cool to lukewarm.  Bloom the yeast in the milk with 1/2 cup of the bread flour in the bowl of an electric mixer.  Stir to form a sponge and allow to rise until doubled.

Gradually add the eggs, followed by the remaining 1 1/2 cups of bread flour, the sugar and the salt.  When you have a soft dough formed, slowly beat in the butter until a smooth dough is formed.

Let the dough rest for about 20 minutes while you butter and flour a large baba mold or bundt pan.  Once the dough has rested, place the dough in the prepared baba mold or cake pan.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to proof in a warm, draft-free place until they have nearly reached the tops of the mold, about 40 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place the mold on a sheet pan and bake in the oven on the middle rack for 30 minutes, or until the top of the baba is golden brown and the sides have begun to pull away from the sides of the pan slightly.  Prepare the soaking liquid while the babas are baking.  Remove the babas from the oven and cool on wire racks for 5 to 10 minutes.

For the Rum Syrup:  In a 1-quart saucepan, combine the vanilla bean and seeds, water, sugar, lemon and orange zests.  Bring the contents to a boil and stir with a wooden spoon to ensure that the sugar will dissolve.  Remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool for 30 minutes.  Once cooled, add all but 2 tablespoons of the rum to the syrup.  Reserve the remaining 2 tablespoons on the side.  Strain the syrup through a fine meshed sieve and discard the solids.

Set the wire rack that the baba is cooling on over a sheet pan.  Using a toothpick, poke holes all over the top of the baba and, when the baba is just warm, pour the just warm syrup over the baba and allow to sit until the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.  Turn the baba out onto the cooling rack and allow to drain over the sheet pan for 1/2 hour.

Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of rum over the top of the baba and serve, with whipped cream and seasonal fresh fruits.  You can also pour more rum over the babas, if you so desire.

The baba can be stored, loosely covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator for a day, if necessary.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch baba) 10 to 12 servings.

Scald the milk and cool to lukewarm.  Bloom the yeast in the milk with 1/2 cup of the bread flour in the bowl of an electric mixer.  Stir to form a sponge and allow to rise until doubled.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Gradually add the eggs, followed by the remaining 1 1/2 cups of bread flour, the sugar and the salt.  When you have a soft dough formed, slowly beat in the butter until a smooth dough is formed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Let the dough rest for about 20 minutes while you butter and flour a large baba mold or bundt pan.  Once the dough has rested, place the dough in the prepared baba mold or cake pan.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to proof in a warm, draft-free place until they have nearly reached the tops of the mold, about 40 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the mold on a sheet pan and bake in the oven on the middle rack for 30 minutes, or until the top of the baba is golden brown and the sides have begun to pull away from the sides of the pan slightly.  Prepare the soaking liquid while the babas are baking.  Remove the babas from the oven and cool on wire racks for 5 to 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Rum Syrup:  In a 1-quart saucepan, combine the vanilla bean and seeds, water, sugar, lemon and orange zests.  Bring the contents to a boil and stir with a wooden spoon to ensure that the sugar will dissolve.  Remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool for 30 minutes.  Once cooled, add all but 2 tablespoons of the rum to the syrup.  Reserve the remaining 2 tablespoons on the side.  Strain the syrup through a fine meshed sieve and discard the solids.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set the wire rack that the baba is cooling on over a sheet pan.  Using a toothpick, poke holes all over the top of the baba and, when the baba is just warm, pour the just warm syrup over the baba and allow to sit until the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.  Turn the baba out onto the cooling rack and allow to drain over the sheet pan for 1/2 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of rum over the top of the baba and serve, with whipped cream and seasonal fresh fruits.  You can also pour more rum over the babas, if you so desire.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The baba can be stored, loosely covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator for a day, if necessary.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 (9-inch baba) 10 to 12 servings.

  1 1/2           cups  plain bread crumbs
  2             ounces  Gorgonzola cheese -- crumbled
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Dijon mustard
                        Rosemary Creamed Potatoes -- (see recipe)

Season the shanks generously on all sides with the salt and black pepper.

Place the flour on a large plate.  Dredge the shanks in the flour and shake to remove any excess.

Heat a Dutch oven or large, heavy saute pan over high heat.  Add the shanks and sear until well-browned on all sides, about 8 minutes.  Remove the shanks.  Add the onions, carrots, and celery, and cook, stirring, for 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the wine and cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan.  Cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.  Return the shanks to the pot and add the stock, bay leaves, and rosemary, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover with the lid slightly ajar, and simmer until the shanks are tender, about 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours, skimming to remove any scum that forms on top.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Remove from the heat and discard the bay leaves.  Transfer the shanks to a large plate and let rest until cool enough to handle.  Transfer the braising liquid and vegetables to a medium pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced by 1/3 in volume, about 30 minutes, skimming the top occasionally to remove any scum.  Remove from the heat.

To make the Gorgonzola Crust, combine the bread crumbs, Gorgonzola cheese, egg, thyme, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in the bowl of a food processor.  Pulse several times until the mixture resembles wet sand.  Transfer to a medium bowl.

Line a baking dish with foil.

When the shanks are cool, coat evenly with the Dijon mustard.  Dredge 1 at a time in the Gorgonzola crust, pressing down to adhere about 1/3 cup of the crust to the meat.  Reserve the remaining crust mixture.  Place the shanks in the prepared baking dish and bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.

Add the remaining crust mixture to the reduced braising liquid and simmer over medium heat for 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  With a hand-held immersion blender or in batches in a food processor, puree the liquid on high speed.  Cover to keep warm until ready to serve, then transfer to a gravy boat or decorative bowl.

Remove the shanks from the oven.  Drizzle with the sauce, and pass the remaining sauce at the table.  Serve with Rosemary Creamed Potatoes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  leeks -- tough outer leaves
                        discarded, leeks trimmed to abt 7" long
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  2          teaspoons  chopped thyme leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper

Using a sharp knife, trim most of the roots off the end of the leek, leaving enough so that the leek remains attached at the bottom.  Cut each leek lengthwise into halves or quarters, as desired.  Run leeks under cold running water, using fingers to loosen and remove any dirt or sand from between the leaves.

In a heavy skillet or saute pan that has a tight fitting lid, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the leeks to the skillet with any water that is clinging to the leaves from washing them.  Cook the leeks, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Add the stock and thyme and lower the heat to medium-low.  Braise the leeks, covered, for about 10 minutes, or until the leeks are very tender.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped red bell pepper
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped green bell pepper
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  12            ounces  sharp yellow cheddar cheese -- grated
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
                        Crumbled bacon
                        Salsa or creme fraiche
                        Chopped parsley leaves

In a large, heavy saucepan melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the chopped onion and peppers and saute until vegetables are soft, about 4 minutes.  Add garlic and saute for 2 minutes.  Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.

Slowly whisk in the stock, milk and heavy cream.  Bring soup to a low boil and reduce heat so that the soup barely simmers.  Cook, stirring frequently, until the soup is very thick and flavorful, about 20 minutes.

Add the grated cheese in 1/2 cup increments, stirring after each addition until completely melted and smooth.  Do not allow soup to boil.  Season with salt and cayenne pepper, to taste.

Serve in shallow bowls, topped with some crumbled crispy bacon bits, a dollop of salsa or creme fraiche, and chopped parsley, as desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4             ounces  fresh mushrooms -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1                cup  dry white wine
     3/4         pound  Fontina d'Aosta - (to 1) -- rind removed,
                        and cut into small cubes - (abt 3 cups)
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  2             ounces  Truffled Pecorino Romano - (to 4) -- grated
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === POSSIBLE DIPPING ITEMS ===
                        Crusty French or Italian bread -- cut into cubes
                        Cooked shrimp -- peeled, deveined
                        Cooked lobster -- cut bite size
                        Cooked baby artichokes
                        Blanched asparagus spears
                        Raw fennel batons
                        Whole button mushrooms -- raw or sauteed
                        Boiled new potatoes
                        Boiled ziti, rotini, or fusilli

In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until golden brown and most of their liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes.  Add the shallots and cook until softened, about 1 minute.  Add the wine and bring to a simmer.

Reduce the heat to medium-low.  In a medium bowl, combine the cubed fontina with the cornstarch and toss to mix well.  Add the cheese-cornstarch mixture to the saucepan in 3 additions, stirring constantly and adding more cheese only as the previous batch has completely melted.  Stir in the grated Truffled Pecorino Romano and allow the fondue to come to a bare simmer but do not allow to boil.  Season with pepper and transfer to a fondue pot for serving.

Serve, with dipping items of choice, attractively arranged in separate bowls.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2                     boned skinned chicken breasts 6 to 8 oz ea -- cut in halves,
                        and pounded thin
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  4        tablespoons  butter
  3               cups  sliced mushrooms
                        = (cremini, oyster, shiitake)
     3/4           cup  Marsala
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped chives -- for garnish

In a shallow bowl or plate combine the flour and Essence and stir to combine thoroughly.  Quickly dredge the chicken breast halves in the seasoned flour mixture, shaking to remove any excess flour.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until very hot but not smoking.  Add 1 tablespoon of the butter and cook the chicken breasts until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to a plate and set aside.

Add 1 tablespoon of the remaining butter to the pan and add the mushrooms.  Cook, stirring frequently, until mushrooms are golden brown around the edges and have given off their liquid.  Add the Marsala wine and bring to a boil, scraping to remove any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  When the wine has reduced by half, add the chicken stock and cook for 3 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.

Lower the heat to medium and return the chicken breasts to the pan and continue to cook until they are cooked through and the sauce has thickened, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, add salt and pepper, to taste.  Garnish with chopped chives and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1         tablespoon  dark corn syrup
  2        tablespoons  warm water
  5             ounces  hazelnuts -- lightly toasted,
                        and cooled
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  3              large  egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  sweet Marsala wine
  2        tablespoons  Frangelico liqueur
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
                        Cocoa powder or powdered sugar -- for serving

Prepare an ice bath and set aside.  Gather 4 large or 6 small martini glasses (or ramekins if you do not have martini glasses).  Set aside.

Combine the corn syrup and water in a small bowl and whisk until smooth.

Blend the hazelnuts and powdered sugar into a paste in a food processor or blender.  Set aside.

Beat the cream and granulated sugar until soft peaks form.  Set aside.

Combine the sugar syrup, egg yolks, Marsala, and Frangelico in a metal bowl.  Place over a pot of boiling water and whip with an electric mixer until the sauce is very thick and forms thick ribbons when you turn off the mixer and lift the beaters out of the mixture.  Remove from the heat and continue to whip until the mixture has cooled.  Carefully fold in the vanilla and whipped cream until just combined.  Fold in the hazelnut paste until evenly incorporated.  Do not overmix.

Divide the mixture among the martini glasses, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for at least 3 hours or overnight.

Thirty minutes before serving, transfer the glacees to the refrigerator to soften.  Dust with cocoa powder or powdered sugar, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  water

  2        tablespoons  honey
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     3/4           cup  soy sauce

* Note:  The success of this dish depends on starting with a full-flavored stock or broth.

Place the stock, ginger, garlic and green onions in a large pot; bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.

Soak the noodles in warm water until softened; drain.  Cut into bite-size lengths.  Cut the greens into bite-size pieces.  Cut the scallops into thin slices.  Cut the squid into rings.  Cut the tofu into cubes.  Arrange the noodles, seafood, vegetables and tofu on a large platter.  Cover and chill until ready to cook.

Reheat the broth to simmering.  Set a Mongolian hot pot or electric wok in the center of a table.  Pour the broth into the pot and adjust heat to a gentle simmer.  The guests use chopsticks or Chinese wire strainers to cook the seafood, vegetables and tofu slices in the boiling water and then dip into the sauce of their choice.  Any remaining greens can be added at the end with the noodles to make the soup.

For the Garlic Mustard:  Place garlic in a mortar.  Mash with the heel of a cleaver or pestle.  Add sugar and stir until it dissolves.  Add water, mustard powder, oils and vinegar stirring between each addition.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

For the Ginger Soy Sauce:  In a small mixing bowl combine ginger and honey and stir until combined.  Add the sesame oil and soy sauce, stirring between each addition.  (Makes about 1 cup)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

* Note:  The success of this dish depends on starting with a full-flavored stock or broth.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the stock, ginger, garlic and green onions in a large pot; bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Soak the noodles in warm water until softened; drain.  Cut into bite-size lengths.  Cut the greens into bite-size pieces.  Cut the scallops into thin slices.  Cut the squid into rings.  Cut the tofu into cubes.  Arrange the noodles, seafood, vegetables and tofu on a large platter.  Cover and chill until ready to cook.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reheat the broth to simmering.  Set a Mongolian hot pot or electric wok in the center of a table.  Pour the broth into the pot and adjust heat to a gentle simmer.  The guests use chopsticks or Chinese wire strainers to cook the seafood, vegetables and tofu slices in the boiling water and then dip into the sauce of their choice.  Any remaining greens can be added at the end with the noodles to make the soup.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Garlic Mustard:  Place garlic in a mortar.  Mash with the heel of a cleaver or pestle.  Add sugar and stir until it dissolves.  Add water, mustard powder, oils and vinegar stirring between each addition.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Ginger Soy Sauce:  In a small mixing bowl combine ginger and honey and stir until combined.  Add the sesame oil and soy sauce, stirring between each addition.  (Makes about 1 cup)

           Chipotle Barbecue Oysters With Homemade Salsa Fresca

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHIPOTLE BARBECUE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  molasses
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  chipotle peppers packed in adobe sauce
                        === SALSA FRESCA ===
  1                cup  chopped peeled tomatillos
                        = (or chopped seeded tomatoes)
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  red onion -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced jalapeÒo
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  48                    oysters in their shells

To make the Chipotle Barbecue Sauce:  Combine the sugar, vinegar, tomato paste, sesame oil, molasses, soy sauce, and chile peppers in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until it starts to become syrupy and dime-sized bubbles form, 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes.  Transfer sauce to a blender or food processor, fill it no more than halfway, and place a towel over the top of the machine (when processed or blended, very hot liquids can explode.)  Pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.

Salsa Fresca:  In a mixing bowl combine the tomatillos, lime juice, red onion, cilantro, jalapeÒo, salt, and pepper, and mix thoroughly.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Preheat a grill.  Place the unopened oysters directly on the grill, and cook until they've opened their shells, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Carefully spoon about a teaspoon of the Barbecue Glaze over the top of each oyster, and continue to grill for another 2 minutes, or until the shells are completely opened and the oysters are just cooked through.  Spoon a teaspoon of the Salsa Fresca over the top of each oyster and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  2               cups  cake flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4              large  eggs -- separated

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            slices  bacon -- sliced 1/2" pieces
  2                     chickens - (abt 3 1/2 to 4 lbs) -- quartered, rinsed,
                        and patted dry
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  20             small  pearl onions -- peeled
     1/2           cup  minced shallots - (2 large shallots)
  1                     garlic head -- cloves separated,
                        and peeled
  1              pound  button mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and halved or quartered if large
                        = (should match size of onions)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  tomato paste
  3               cups  full-bodied dry red wine
                        = (such as Pinot Noir or Cotes-du-Rhone)
  1 1/2           cups  rich chicken stock
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme
                        = (or 1 tspn dried thyme)
  1                     bay leaf
                        Braised Leeks -- (see recipe)
                        Egg noodles -- accompaniment
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a large, heavy Dutch oven over high heat fry the bacon until crisp and all of the fat is rendered.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the crisp bacon bits to paper towels to drain.  Reserve.

Season the chicken pieces with the salt and pepper.  Brown the chicken pieces in the hot bacon fat, working in batches, if necessary, and turning to ensure even cooking.  Transfer the chicken pieces to a large plate or bowl and set aside.

Remove some of the bacon fat, leaving about 4 tablespoons in the Dutch oven.  Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the chopped onion, pearl onions, shallots and garlic cloves to the Dutch oven and cook until soft, about 4 minutes.

Add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes longer, or until they've released most of their liquid and have begun to brown.  Add the flour and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.  Slowly add the wine and stock, stirring constantly.  Add the thyme, bay leaf, reserved bacon and chicken.  Bring liquid to a boil.  Cover the pot, place in the oven and cook for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the chicken is very tender.

Transfer the chicken pieces to a serving dish and cover loosely to keep warm.  Return pot to medium-low heat.  Skim any fat from the surface of the cooking liquid and increase the heat to medium-high.  Cook until the sauce has thickened slightly and coats the back of a spoon, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.  Return the chicken to the Dutch oven and cook for a few minutes to heat through, then serve.

Serve with egg noodles and Braised Leeks.  Garnish with the chopped parsley.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This dish may be prepared 1 or 2 days in advance and then reheated slowly just before serving.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large, heavy Dutch oven over high heat fry the bacon until crisp and all of the fat is rendered.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the crisp bacon bits to paper towels to drain.  Reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the chicken pieces with the salt and pepper.  Brown the chicken pieces in the hot bacon fat, working in batches, if necessary, and turning to ensure even cooking.  Transfer the chicken pieces to a large plate or bowl and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove some of the bacon fat, leaving about 4 tablespoons in the Dutch oven.  Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the chopped onion, pearl onions, shallots and garlic cloves to the Dutch oven and cook until soft, about 4 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes longer, or until they&apos;ve released most of their liquid and have begun to brown.  Add the flour and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.  Slowly add the wine and stock, stirring constantly.  Add the thyme, bay leaf, reserved bacon and chicken.  Bring liquid to a boil.  Cover the pot, place in the oven and cook for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the chicken is very tender.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the chicken pieces to a serving dish and cover loosely to keep warm.  Return pot to medium-low heat.  Skim any fat from the surface of the cooking liquid and increase the heat to medium-high.  Cook until the sauce has thickened slightly and coats the back of a spoon, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.  Return the chicken to the Dutch oven and cook for a few minutes to heat through, then serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve with egg noodles and Braised Leeks.  Garnish with the chopped parsley.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  warmed milk
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg -- (optional)
  2             ounces  grated cheese
                        = (such as Gruyere)
                        Steamed vegetables -- for accompaniment
                        = (such as broccoli, cauliflower or
                        baby carrots)

In a medium saucepan melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the roux is pale yellow and frothy, about 1 minute.  Do not allow the roux to brown.

Slowly whisk in the milk and continue to whisk until the sauce thickens and comes to a boil, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and season with the salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Allow to simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.  This is now called a bechamel sauce, and may be used as is to top any number of dishes.

Stir in the cheese and whisk until melted.  If the sauce seems to thick, thin with a little milk.

The sauce is now called a Mornay Sauce.  Pour over steamed vegetables and serve immediately.  If not using right away, cool, cover surface with plastic wrap and refrigerate for several days.

This recipe yields about 2 cups of sauce.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2               cups  whole milk
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar

  6                     egg yolks
                        Chocolate curls -- for garnish

Combine the cream, milk, sugar, and coffee in a medium, heavy saucepan.  Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Remove from the heat.

Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl.  Whisk 1 cup of the hot cream into the egg yolks.  Gradually add the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream, to the hot cream.  Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to keep a skin from forming.  Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.

Remove from the refrigerator and pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine.  Freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.  After the ice cream is made, transfer to an airtight container.  Cover tightly and freeze until ready to serve.  Garnish with chocolate curls.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

     1/2           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  chopped toasted pecans or walnuts
                        === POSSIBLE DIPPING ITEMS ===
                        Cubed pound cake
                        Soft ladyfingers
                        Cubed brownies
                        Banana chunks
                        Fresh strawberries
                        Orange segments
                        Sliced pears or apples
                        Dried fruits
                        Chocolate chunks
                        Chocolate chip cookies

In a medium saucepan combine the sugar and water and cook over medium-high heat until the sugar is dissolved.  Use a pastry brush dipped in hot water to brush down any crystals from the sides of the pan.  Increase the heat to high and continue to cook until the sugar is a medium-dark amber color, about 8 minutes.  (The length of time will vary depending on the stovetop as well as on the saucepan you are using.)

Remove from the heat and carefully add the butter.  Using caution, slowly add the heavy cream -- the mixture will splatter and bubble up.  Swirl the pan until the sauce is smooth and the heavy cream is thoroughly combined.  Remove from the heat and stir in the nuts.  Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then transfer to a fondue pot over a low flame and serve warm, with dipping items of choice.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SIMPLE SYRUP ===
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  1                cup  water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  lemon zest -- cut in strips
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
     1/2         pound  mixed dried fruits
                        = (such as blueberries, cranberries,
                        cherries, raisins, and chopped apricots)
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1                cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  2             ounces  almond paste
  4              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  Grand Marnier
                        = (or other orange-flavored liqueur)
  2               cups  bleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/2           cup  slivered almonds -- toasted
     1/2           cup  pecan pieces
     1/2           cup  walnut pieces
     1/4           cup  bourbon
                        === FOR THE WHISKEY SAUCE ===
  3               cups  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  bourbon
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  cornstarch -- plus
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch

Make a simple-syrup by combining the sugar and water in a medium-size heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the lemon zest and juice and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Boil for 2 minutes and remove from the heat.

Combine the dried fruits in a large mixing bowl.  Pour the simple-syrup over them, toss to coat and let steep for 5 minutes.  Strain and reserve the syrup.

Cream the butter, sugar and almond paste together in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle at low speed, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.  Beat until the mixture is fluffy and smooth, about 2 minutes.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, mixing in between each addition on low speed and scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.  Add 1/4 cup of the Grand Marnier and mix to incorporate.

Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg in a medium-size mixing bowl and blend well.  Add this mixture 1/2 cup at a time to the butter mixture with the mixer on low speed, each time mixing until smooth, about 2 minutes.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary.  The batter will be thick.

Add the warm fruit and all of the nuts a little at a time, mixing well.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Lightly grease a bundt pan with butter or non-stick baking spray.  Pour the batter into the pan and bake until golden brown and the top springs back when touched, about 45 to 50 minutes (turning the pan to ensure even browning after 30 minutes.)

Cool the cake for 20 minutes in the pan, then remove and continue to cool upside-down on wire racks.

Make tiny holes with a toothpick randomly on the rounded end of the cake.  Combine the remaining simple syrup with the remaining 1/4 cup of Grand Marnier and the bourbon.  Wrap the cake in a layer of cheesecloth and pour 1/4 cup of the syrup over the top of each cake.  Store in a plastic zip bag for 3 or 4 days until the cake is slightly stale.  Sprinkle syrup over cakes once every 2 to 3 days until all of the syrup is used.  Let the cakes age for up to 3 weeks before eating.

For the Whiskey Sauce:  Combine 2 3/4 cups of the cream with the bourbon and sugar in a medium-size nonstick saucepan over medium-heat.  Stir to dissolve the sugar.

In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the remaining 1/4 cup cream.  Add this to the cream-and-bourbon mixture and simmer stirring often, until the mixture thickens, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and serve warm with the fruitcake.

The sauce may be stored, after it has cooled, in an airtight container for 24 hours.  When ready to serve, warm over low heat.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CREPE BATTER ===
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  melted unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  whole milk
                        === FOR THE BECHAMEL ===
  4        tablespoons  butter
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2           cups  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        === FOR THE FILLING AND ASSEMBLING ===
  1               pint  lump crabmeat -- picked over
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
  1         tablespoon  chopped chervil leaves
  1         tablespoon  truffle oil
     1/4           cup  panko or bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  melted butter

For the Crepes:  In a blender combine all the ingredients and process to form a smooth, thin batter.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before proceeding.

Heat a small skillet or crepe pan and when hot, brush lightly with butter.  Ladle about 2 tablespoons of the crepe batter into the pan, tilting the skillet to evenly coat the pan.  Cook until golden brown on the bottom and the top begins to look dry, about 1 minute.  Using a spatula, carefully turn the crepe and cook the second side until the bottom colors slightly, about 30 seconds.  Transfer to a plate and cover loosely to keep warm.  Repeat with remaining batter.  (Makes 8 to 10 crepes)

For The Bechamel Sauce:  In a saucepan melt the butter.  Whisk in the flour until smooth and continue to cook for 3 minutes, being careful not to brown.  Slowly whisk in the cold milk, and cook, stirring, until the sauce comes to a boil and thickens, about 2 minutes.  Continue cooking until the floury taste is gone, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.  (Makes about 2 1/2 cups)

To finish:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a small bowl combine the crabmeat, salt, white pepper, parsley, chives, chervil and truffle oil and toss gently to combine.  Divide the filling evenly among the crepes, about 2 to 3 tablespoons per crepe.  Roll up crepes and place in a shallow casserole dish.  Pour the bechamel over the crepes and sprinkle the panko over the top of the sauce.  Drizzle the melted butter over the top and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until lightly browned on top.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 first-course servings.

Pour the bechamel over the crepes and sprinkle the panko over the top of the sauce.  Drizzle the melted butter over the top and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until lightly browned on top.  Serve hot.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1              pound  linguine
  6        tablespoons  good-quality extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  good-quality freshly-grated Parmesan

                        Chopped fresh parsley leaves, chives or
                        thyme leaves -- for garnish

Bring 1 gallon of water and salt to boil in a large pot over high heat.  Add the linguine and cook, stirring occasionally to separate the noodles, until al dente, 4 to 5 minutes for fresh, or about 10 minutes for dried.  Drain the pasta and reserve 3 tablespoons of the cooking water.

Place the pasta in a large warm serving bowl and toss with the olive oil, 1/2 the parmesan and salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste.  If pasta is too dry add some of reserved cooking water.  Garnish with chopped parsley, chives or thyme and serve with remaining Parmesan.

  4                     lemon wedges for garnish
     1/4           cup  white wine
  4               cups  water
  2                     bay leaves
  1              pound  medium shrimp - (abt 30) -- peeled, deveined,
                        tail segment left intact
                        === COCKTAIL SAUCE ===
  1                cup  ketchup
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  prepared horseradish
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3              drops  hot pepper sauce -- (optional)

In a large saucepan, combine the peppercorns, coriander seeds, celery, tarragon, thyme, parsley, Essence, salt, cayenne pepper, lemon juice, white wine, water and bay leaves and bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the shrimp to the boiling water, stir, cover and remove from the heat.  Let stand for 8 to 10 minutes, or until shrimp are just cooked through.

Strain in a colander and transfer the shrimp to a large bowl.  Discard the cooking liquid and seasonings.  Refrigerate the shrimp until well chilled, about 1 hour.  While the shrimp are chilling, make the Cocktail Sauce.

When ready to serve, divide the shrimp among 4 small bowls, and hang them on the rim of each bowl.  Divide the cocktail sauce into 4 equal portions and place in the bottom of each bowl.  Garnish each bowl with a lemon wedge.  Alternatively, you can arrange a layer of crushed ice in the bottom of 4 bowls, put a small ramekin of the cocktail sauce in the ice and arrange the shrimp on the ice around the sauce.

For the Cocktail Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in a small non-reactive bowl and stir until thoroughly combined. Refrigerate until ready to serve.  (Makes about 1 cup)

This recipe yields 2 to 4 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/2           cup  superfine granulated sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  superfine granulated sugar -- sifted
  1                cup  powdered sugar -- sifted, plus
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped lightly-toasted
                        walnuts and hazelnuts -- plus
     1/3           cup  coarsely-chopped lightly-toasted
                        walnuts and hazelnuts -- for garnish
  3               cups  cubed leftover pound or sponge cake
     1/3           cup  Frangelico -- plus
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Frangelico
                        = (or other nut-flavored liqueur such as
                        Nocello)
  3               cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar
                        Raspberries -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.

Line 2 large baking sheets with aluminum foil.  Using a plate or other round object, trace three 8-inch circles onto the foil to use as templates for piping meringue.  Set aside.

Place the egg whites in a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until foamy.  While continuing to beat, add the granulated sugar 1 tablespoon at a time.  Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and whip until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 5 minutes.  Using a large rubber spatula, gently fold in 1 cup sifted powdered sugar, the toasted walnuts and hazelnuts.

Place the meringue in a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip and pipe the meringue onto the foil in a spiraling pattern so that the entire circle is covered with meringue.  Repeat with remaining meringue so that you have 3 piped meringue circles.

Bake the piped meringue circles for 3 hours, or until crispy but not colored.  If the meringue begins to color and seems crisp, turn off the oven and leave the meringue layers in the oven to continue drying out as the oven cools.  Once the oven is cool, remove the baking sheets from the oven and carefully remove the meringue circles from the foil.  Set aside until ready to assemble the cake.  (Alternately, you can bake the meringues until almost totally crispy, turn off the oven and leave them to dry as the oven cools.)

In a mixing bowl combine the cubed pound or sponge cake with 1/3 cup of the Frangelico and toss to evenly distribute the liqueur.  Set aside.

In a chilled, large mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream to soft peaks.  Add the 2 tablespoons powdered sugar and remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons Frangelico and continue beating until the cream almost forms stiff peaks.  Remove 1/3 of the whipped cream and set aside.  Add the sponge cake cubes to the remaining whipped cream and, using a large spatula, gently fold together.  Be careful not to over whip or over fold the cream -- it will get stiff and begin to turn to butter.

When ready to assemble the cake, place a small amount of the whipped cream on the center of a cake plate and use this to anchor 1 of the crisp baked meringue circles.  Place 1/2 of the cake-whipped cream mixture on the top of this meringue circle and spread evenly over the meringue.  Top with a second meringue circle and repeat with the remaining cake-whipped cream mixture.  Finally, top with the remaining meringue circle and press lightly.

Place the whipped cream in a pastry bag fitted with a star tip and pipe stars or rosettes decoratively over the entire surface of the meringue circle.  Spread the coarsely chopped walnuts and hazelnuts evenly over the top of the cake, and refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  cayenne
  4          teaspoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  chopped ham
     1/4           cup  minced cheddar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  minced cheddar
  2        tablespoons  chopped yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped green bell peppers
  1         tablespoon  chopped red bell peppers
  1         tablespoon  chopped green chiles
  1         tablespoon  sour cream
  2          teaspoons  chopped green onions
                        Home Fries -- (see recipe)

In a bowl, whisk the eggs with the Essence, salt, pepper, and cayenne until frothy.

In an 8-inch non-stick skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the eggs and stir lightly until just set on the bottom.  Sprinkle the ham, 1/4 cup cheese, onions, green and red bell peppers, green chiles, and sour cream across the omelet, and shake the pan to loosen the eggs around the edges.

When the eggs are nearly completely set but still slightly soft, hold the pan in one hand, and with a flick of the wrist, flip, and fold one-third of the omelet toward the center.  Turn out onto a plate, folding the omelet onto itself into thirds.  Sprinkle the remaining tablespoon of cheese and green onions over the top and serve with Home Fries.  Serve immediately.

       Flambeed Golden Raisins And Pineapples With Coconut Ice Crea

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1 1/2           cups  unsweetened coconut milk
  1                cup  whole milk
     1/2           cup  coconut flavored rum
                        = (Malibu recommended)
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2               cups  small-diced fresh pineapple
     1/4           cup  golden raisins
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
     1/2           cup  dark rum
     1/4           cup  toasted shredded coconut
  4                     round slices orange -- for garnish
  4                     maraschino cherries
  4                     cocktail umbrellas

Heat the heavy cream, coconut milk, whole milk and rum in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.

Place the eggs and sugar in a heatproof mixing bowl and beat until pale yellow in color and all of the sugar has dissolved.  Temper about 1/2 cup of the cream mixture into the egg mixture and whisk vigorously to incorporate well.

Add the egg mixture to the saucepan with the cream mixture and cook, stirring constantly with a whisk, or wooden spoon.  Be sure to stir the corners of the pot and lower the heat slightly.  Stir the custard for 4 to 5 minutes or until it has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon.

Remove from the stove and strain the custard through a fine mesh sieve into a clean bowl.  Place the bowl in another bowl half-filled with ice and ice and water to cool the custard.  To cool the custard faster, stir it occasionally with a spoon.

Pour the chilled custard into an ice cream machine.  Churn according to the manufacturer's instructions until the custard is frozen.  Pack the ice cream into an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.

For the Flambeed Raisins and Pineapples:  Place 2 scoops of coconut ice cream in 4 frosted martini glasses.  Set aside until the pineapples are cooked.

Place a 10-inch saute pan over medium-high heat.  Once hot, add the butter to the pan.  Place the pineapples and the raisins in the pan and cook, stirring often for 3 minutes.  Sprinkle the sugar over the pineapples and raisins and continue to cook until the sugar has completely dissolved and the mixture starts to bubble, about 1 minute.  Pull the pan off the stove and pour the rum in the pan.

Immediately return the pan to the stove and tip the edge of the pan so that the flame will ignite the alcohol.

Pour 1/2 cup of the pineapples and raisins over each of the 4 martini glasses and divide the glaze among the four glasses as well.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the toasted coconut over each glass, and garnish with an orange wedge, maraschino cherry and umbrellas.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Pickles/Relishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  red wine vinegar
     1/2         pound  light brown sugar
  1                     onion -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  yellow mustard seeds
     1/4                lemon -- zested
     1/2                cinnamon stick
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1 1/4         pounds  firm slightly underripe fresh figs -- rinsed, stemmed,
                        and halved

In a large saucepan combine the vinegar, sugar, onion, ginger, mustard seeds, lemon zest, cinnamon stick, salt, allspice, and cloves and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until mixture is thickened and reduced by 2/3, forming a thick syrup.  Add the figs and cook gently until the figs are very soft and beginning to fall apart and most of the liquid they've given off has evaporated, about 30 minutes.

Transfer the chutney to a non-reactive container and allow to come to room temperature before serving.  The chutney may be made up to 3 weeks in advance and stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container.  (Alternately, hot chutney may be ladled into hot sterilized canning jars and processed in a hot-water bath according to manufacturer's directions.)

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 pints.

Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until mixture is thickened and reduced by 2/3, forming a thick syrup.  Add the figs and cook gently until the figs are very soft and beginning to fall apart and most of the liquid they&apos;ve given off has evaporated, about 30 minutes.

Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     catfish filets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  Creole mustard
  1           teaspoon  hot sauce
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/4           cup  yellow cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  4                     vegetable oil for deep-frying - (to 6)
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped chipotle pepper in adobo
                        = (wear gloves please!)
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
     1/4         pound  shredded white cabbage - (abt 1 cup)
     1/4         pound  shredded red cabbage - (abt 1 cup)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped red onions
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  8                     crispy corn tortillas

Using a sharp knife, cut the catfish filets into 1-inch thick strips on the diagonal.  Place fish in a medium mixing bowl along with the milk, Creole mustard, hot sauce, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and cayenne pepper and stir to thoroughly combine.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, make the Chipotle Slaw by combining the chipotle pepper, mayonnaise, honey and lime juice in a large mixing bowl.  Stir well, then add the shredded cabbage, red onions, green onions and stir to thoroughly combine.  Season with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and refrigerate until ready to assemble the tacos.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large cast-iron skillet or a deep fryer until a thermometer registers 350 degrees.

In a shallow plate or bowl combine the flour, cornmeal, and Essence.  Dredge each piece of fish in the flour mixture until well coated on all sides.  When the oil is hot, gently place the fish in the hot oil and deep fry until the fish is golden-brown on all sides, about 2 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fish to a paper-lined plate to drain.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Using tongs, quickly dip the corn tortillas in the hot oil until they begin to sizzle.  Transfer to paper-lined plates to drain briefly, then serve, with the catfish and slaw divided among the hot taco shells.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying
  1         tablespoon  Essence -- plus
                        more for sprinkling
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8                     soft-shell crabs -- cleaned, and
                        rinsed gently under cold running water
  4             pieces  French bread - (ea abt 8" to 10" long) -- halved lengthwise
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  2               cups  shredded romaine lettuce -- very thinly sliced
  1                     creole tomato
                        = (or other very ripe flavorful tomato)
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        Hot sauce -- for serving
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

Preheat the oil in a large saucepan or deep fryer to 360 degrees.

Rinse crabs and pat dry.  Combine the flour with the Essence, salt and ground black pepper and stir to combine well.  Lightly dredge each crab in the seasoned flour, making sure that the crabs are completely coated.

Using tongs, gently lower the crabs (in batches if necessary) completely into the oil and fry until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn the crabs over and fry an additional 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy all over.  Be careful -- crabs will splatter as they are cooking!  Carefully transfer crabs to paper-lined plates to drain briefly before assembling poboys.  Sprinkle with Essence when still hot.

Using a spatula, lightly coat both of the cut sides of the French bread with some of the mayonnaise.  Place two of the fried soft shell crabs onto one side of the bread, and top with shredded lettuce and tomato slices.  Top with the other half of the bread and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 poboys.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying
  8                     soft-shell crabs -- cleaned, and
                        rinsed gently under cold running water
  4        tablespoons  Essence -- plus
  1           teaspoon  Essence -- plus
                        more for sprinkling
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- or more if needed
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     egg
  2               cups  bread crumbs
  6        tablespoons  butter
     1/3           cup  minced shallots
     1/2         pound  raw shrimp -- peeled, deveined
     3/4           cup  shrimp or seafood stock
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2         pound  cooked crawfish tails -- peeled, and
                        seasoned with Essence
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
                        Snipped chives

Preheat the oil in a large saucepan or deep fryer to 360 degrees.

Rinse crabs in water, then pat dry with paper towel.  Season each crab with 1 teaspoon of the Essence and set aside.

Combine flour with 4 teaspoons of the remaining Essence, salt and ground black pepper and stir to combine well.  Beat the egg with a splash of water in a shallow dish.  Lay out the breadcrumbs in a separate shallow dish.

Lightly dredge each crab in the seasoned flour, making sure that the crabs are completely coated.  Dip each crab in eggwash to cover, then coat in bread crumbs.

Holding the crabs by long tongs or balanced on a small skimmer, hold them so that the legs dangle down into the hot oil and fry for 1 minute, or until the legs are stiff.  Lower the crab completely into the oil and fry until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn crab over and allow to fry an additional 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy all over.  Carefully transfer crabs to paper-lined plates to drain briefly before serving.  Sprinkle with Essence when still hot.

In a large skillet over medium-high heat melt 2 tablespoons of the butter and saute the shallots until soft, about 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Add the shrimp and the remaining teaspoon of Essence and saute for 1 minute, or until the shrimp turn pink around the edges.  Add the shrimp stock, bring to a boil and cook over high heat until the stock is reduced by half.  Add the heavy cream and cook until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes.  Add the crawfish tails, fresh thyme and snipped chives and cook until heated through.  Whisk in the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter and remove sauce from the heat.  Taste, adjust seasoning if necessary, and serve the ragu ladled over the fried softshell crabs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Lightly dredge each crab in the seasoned flour, making sure that the crabs are completely coated.  Dip each crab in eggwash to cover, then coat in bread crumbs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Holding the crabs by long tongs or balanced on a small skimmer, hold them so that the legs dangle down into the hot oil and fry for 1 minute, or until the legs are stiff.  Lower the crab completely into the oil and fry until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn crab over and allow to fry an additional 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy all over.  Carefully transfer crabs to paper-lined plates to drain briefly before serving.  Sprinkle with Essence when still hot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large skillet over medium-high heat melt 2 tablespoons of the butter and saute the shallots until soft, about 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Add the shrimp and the remaining teaspoon of Essence and saute for 1 minute, or until the shrimp turn pink around the edges.  Add the shrimp stock, bring to a boil and cook over high heat until the stock is reduced by half.  Add the heavy cream and cook until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes.  Add the crawfish tails, fresh thyme and snipped chives and cook until heated through.  Whisk in the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter and remove sauce from the heat.  Taste, adjust seasoning if necessary, and serve the ragu ladled over the fried softshell crabs.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     boneless beef chuck roast - (3 to 4 lbs)
  10             large  garlic cloves - (to 12) -- peeled, and
                        cut in half lengthwise
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  water -- plus
                        more if necessary
                        Chopped fresh thyme leaves and parsley -- for garnish
                        === ROASTED VEGETABLES ===
  2                     turnips -- cut 1" pieces
  2                     carrots -- cut 1" pieces
  12                    red pearl onions
  2                     beets -- cut 1" pieces
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Using the tip of a sharp paring knife, make 20 to 24 evenly spaced small slits about 1 1/2-inches deep all over the pot roast.  Using your fingers, insert the garlic cloves as deep into the meat as possible.  Season the roast evenly on all sides with the salt and pepper.

Heat a Dutch oven over high heat.  Add the oil and, when very hot, use the meat fork to add the roast.  Sear on all sides until very well browned, about 4 to 6 minutes per side.  Don't be afraid to let the roast get very brown -- this is where a lot of the flavor comes from.  When the roast is evenly browned on all sides, add the water and stir to loosen the browned bits on the bottom of the pan.  Cover the Dutch oven, reduce the heat to low/medium-low and cook the roast until it is very tender, about 3 hours, turning two or three times during the entire cooking time.  Check occasionally to make sure that you always have 1-inch or so of liquid on the bottom of the pan.  If necessary, add more water.

When the roast is very tender, transfer to a serving platter and slice or pull meat apart into serving pieces.  Reduce the pan juices slightly, if desired, and serve drizzled over the top of the roast.  Garnish with fresh thyme and parsley.

For the Roasted Vegetables:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Place all vegetables except the beets in a roasting pan.  Place beets in a separate roasting pan.  Drizzle all vegetables with extra-virgin olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Place in oven and roast for about 30 to 40 minutes, or until vegetables are tender and carmelized.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  French bread, abt 1/2" thick
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  4          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  honey
  4                     thin slices good quality ham
                        = (such as Black Forest)
  4             ounces  sliced Gruyere, Swiss or Monterey jack

Place all of the bread slices on a flat work surface.  Using a butter knife or small rubber spatula, spread 1 side of each slice with some of the softened butter.  Use 1/2 of the butter for this -- you'll need the rest later.

Turn over 4 slices of the bread and spread the unbuttered sides of 2 of the bread slices with the mustard, and the other 2 slices with the honey.

For each sandwich, fold 1 ham slice on top of the mustard spread and top with 1/4 of the sliced Gruyere cheese.  Cover with the remaining 4 bread slices, making sure that the buttered sides face out.  You will have 4 sandwiches.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in the skillet.  Transfer the sandwiches to the skillet and cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes.  Turn and add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the skillet.  Cook the sandwiches until the cheese has melted and the second side is golden brown, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Remove the sandwiches from the pan and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 small sandwiches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  chorizo -- sliced on the
                        diagonal into 1/2"-thk pieces
  8                     corn tortillas
  4                     roasted poblano peppers -- seeds, stem and
                        skin removed, and cut into thin strips
  4             ounces  pepper Jack -- grated
                        === ROASTED TOMATO SALSA ===
  1 1/4         pounds  plum tomatoes - (4 to 6) -- cored and halved
  1              large  jalapeÒo -- stem removed
  1              large  onion -- peeled, and
                        cut into 8 equal pieces
  2                     garlic cloves -- unpeeled
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1           teaspoon  Sherry vinegar
  3        tablespoons  water

Prepare a fire for grilling.

Using tongs, place sausage slices on the grill and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes per side, until slightly charred on both sides.  Transfer to a plate and cover with aluminum foil until ready to assemble the tacos.

Bring a small amount of water to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Place a steamer insert inside the pot.  Wrap the corn tortillas in a damp kitchen towel and place inside the steamer insert.  Cover the saucepan and steam the tortillas until they are very soft and pliable, about 4 minutes.  Carefully remove the tortillas from the steamer and serve, with the grilled chorizo, roasted poblano peppers and grated cheese divided evenly among the tacos.  Top with Roasted Tomato Salsa, to taste.

Roasted Tomato Salsa:  Preheat the broiler to 500 degrees.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the tomatoes and jalapeÒo pepper along 1 end of the baking sheet.  Place the onion and garlic along the other side of the baking sheet and broil close to the heat source until the onions and garlic are blistered and beginning to char, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and, using tongs, transfer the onions and garlic to a small bowl to cool.  Return the tomatoes and pepper to the oven and continue to broil until the tomatoes are charred around the edges, and very soft and bubbly, about 10 more minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool.

When cooled, slip the garlic cloves out of their skins and transfer to the bowl of a food processor along with the onions, tomatoes, jalapeÒo pepper, and any accumulated juices from the baking sheet.  Process in short pulses until salsa is thoroughly combined but still slightly chunky.  Add salt, cilantro, and lime juice, Sherry vinegar and water and stir to combine.  Transfer to a bowl and set aside until ready to assemble the tacos.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro leaves
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  4          teaspoons  soy sauce

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     hen - (abt 6 lbs)
  8               cups  water
  2             medium  yellow onions -- quartered
  2                     celery ribs -- each cut 6 pieces
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  bleached all-purpose flour
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions
  1                cup  chopped green bell peppers
  1                cup  chopped celery
     1/2         pound  andouille or other smoked sausage -- finely chopped, plus
  1              pound  smoked sausage -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/4" thick slices
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions or scallions
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
                        Cooked white rice -- for serving

In a large, heavy pot place the hen, water, quartered onions, celery pieces, bay leaves, 1 tablespoon of the salt, and 1 teaspoon of the cayenne pepper and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook, partially covered, until the hen is tender, about 2 hours.  Remove the hen and set aside.  Strain and reserve the broth.

In a large, heavy pot or a Dutch oven over medium heat, combine the oil and flour.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the roux is a dark, chocolate brown color, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Add the chopped onions, bell peppers, celery and chopped sausage.  Cook, stirring, until the vegetables are very soft, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the reserved chicken broth and stir until the roux mixture and broth are well combined.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/2 hours.

Meanwhile, remove the skin from the hen and pick the meat off the bones, discarding the skin and bones.  Coarsely chop or tear the meat into bite-size pieces.  Add the chicken and the sliced sausage to the gumbo.  Cook for 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let sit for 5 minutes before skimming any fat that has risen to the surface.

Stir in the green onions and parsley and serve the gumbo in individual soup or gumbo bowls over hot, steamed white rice.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Categories    : Condiments                      Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  yellow mustard seeds
     1/3           cup  drinking-quality white wine
     1/3           cup  white wine vinegar
  1                     shallot -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2             sprigs  fresh tarragon -- leaves finely
                        chopped
                        Pumpernickle bread squares -- accompaniment
                        Smoked salmon -- accompaniment
                        Chopped capers -- for garnish
                        Minced onions -- for garnish
                        Chopped parsley leaves -- for garnish

     3/4         pound  kosher salt - (abt 1 3/4 cups)
  1 1/2           cups  honey
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  ground cloves
                        === CREOLE MUSTARD REDUCTION SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1                cup  dry red wine

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat the water, salt, and honey in a stockpot.  Stir to dissolve the honey and salt.  Remove from the heat.  Add the thyme, pepper, and cloves, and refrigerate until well chilled, about 2 hours.  Once cool, submerge the pork chops in the brining liquid.  Marinate for 2 hours, refrigerated.

Stir and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced to a thick glaze, 18 to 20 minutes.

Add the chicken stock and Creole mustard, stir well, and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.  Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm until ready to serve.  (Makes 2 cups)

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     Cornish game hens - (1 lb ea)
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2                orange -- cut into 6 slices
     1/4           cup  white wine
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     3/4           cup  chicken stock
                        Bourbon Mashed Sweet Potatoes -- (see recipe)

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees and position the oven rack in the center of the oven.

Rinse hens inside and out with cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Tuck wing tips under the hens, then place them, breast-side up, in a large roasting pan, alternating directions of hens so that they fit well in the pan.  Rub the hens with 1/2 tablespoon each of the butter.  Season the hens inside and out with salt and pepper.  Place an orange slice inside the cavity of each bird.  Roast hens for 10 minutes, then move them slightly in the pan to prevent them from sticking on the bottom.  Continue to roast the hens until they are golden brown and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes longer.

Remove the pan from the oven and transfer hens to a serving platter.  Cover loosely with aluminum foil while you prepare the sauce.

Pour off any excess fat in the bottom of the roasting pan.  Place the roasting pan on the stovetop over high heat.  Deglaze the pan with the white wine, scraping the bottom of the roasting pan with a wooden spoon.  When the wine has almost evaporated, add the orange juice and allow to reduce by half.  Add the chicken stock and cook until sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Remove from the heat, stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Serve immediately with some of the Bourbon Mashed Sweet Potatoes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
     1/2           cup  shortening -- room temperature
  1              stick  butter -- room temperature
  2               cups  sugar
  5                     eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
  2               cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  buttermilk -- room temperature
  2               cups  shredded coconut
  1                cup  finely-chopped pecans or walnuts
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FOR THE FROSTING ===
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  butter -- softened, and
                        at room temperature
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1                     box powdered sugar - (16 oz) -- sifted
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped pecans or walnuts

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees and grease and flour 3 (9-inch) cake pans.

In the bowl of an electric mixer cream the shortening, butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add the egg yolks 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Sift the flour, baking soda and salt together onto a sheet of waxed or parchment paper.  With the mixer on low speed, add the sifted ingredients in batches alternately with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff, and gently fold into the prepared batter.  Add the coconut, pecans and vanilla and fold into the batter.  Divide the batter among the 3 prepared cake pans and bake for about 25 minutes, or until golden brown and a tester comes out clean when inserted into the middle of each cake.  Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to finish cooling.  When the cakes are completely cool, stack the layers with the frosting and frost the sides and top.

While the cake is baking, prepare the frosting.  In a large bowl combine the cream cheese, butter and vanilla and, using an electric mixer, beat until smooth and creamy.  Add the sifted powdered sugar and mix until thoroughly combined.  Add the nuts and fold together.  Keep refrigerated until you are ready to frost the cake.

This recipe yields 1 (3-layer) cake; 10 servings.

Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     leg of lamb - (7 lbs) -- fat trimmed to 1/4"
  12                    anchovy fillets packed in oil
  12                    garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        halved lengthwise
     1/4           cup  duck fat
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              large  yellow onion -- peeled, quartered
  1              large  carrot -- cut 2" pieces
  1              large  turnip -- trimmed, quartered
  2                     celery stalks -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" pieces
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  1                cup  rich chicken or beef stock
  2        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut 4 pieces

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  With a small, sharp knife, make 12 (1 1/2-inch deep) slits about every 2 inches of the lamb.  Wrap the anchovies around the garlic cloves and stuff into the slits.

In a large roasting pan set over 2 burners, heat the duck fat over medium-high heat.  Add the lamb and sear, turning, on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and, in a small bowl, combine the rosemary, Essence, salt, and pepper, and rub evenly over the meat.  Add the vegetables, and stir to coat with the fat.  Roast until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the leg reads 130 degrees for medium-rare, about 1 hour and 15 minutes, stirring the vegetables every 30 minutes.

Remove from the oven, transfer to a large platter, and cover loosely to rest for 15 minutes.  Place the pan over 2 burners over medium-high heat.  Add the wine and cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan and reduce by half.  Add the stock and stirring, reduce again by half.  Strain into a small saucepan through a fine mesh strainer, pushing down on the vegetables to extract as much liquid as possible.  Return to medium heat, and stirring constantly, add the butter a piece at a time.  Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.

Carve the lamb, and if desired, serve with the roasted vegetables on the side.  Serve with the gravy.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                         Light And Fluffy Omelets

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes
                Omelets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted
  3        tablespoons  grated cheese -- (optional)
                        = (such as cheddar or Swiss)

Place the eggs, heavy cream, salt and pepper in the blender and mix until very frothy, about 1 minute.

Heat a saute pan over medium heat and, when hot, add the butter to the pan, swirling to coat.  Pour the egg mixture into the pan.  Using the rubber spatula, stir continuously and scrape down sides so as to evenly cook the mixture.  Once the mixture resembles wet scrambled eggs, after about 30 seconds, use the rubber spatula to smooth the eggs so that they are an even depth throughout.  Cook until almost set, about 10 seconds longer, and use the rubber spatula to fold the omelet in half.  Carefully slide the omelet out of the pan onto the plate.

Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Comments:  If you want a cheesy omelet, sprinkle grated cheese over top of the omelet just before folding in half.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREAMY ITALIAN DRESSING ===
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  minced yellow onions
  3           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2           cup  white wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  6        tablespoons  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  finely-grated Parmesan
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR THE CHICKEN ===
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut 1" cubes
  2          teaspoons  Essence
  8             ounces  button mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and stems trimmed
  1             medium  yellow onion -- peeled, and
                        cubed into eighths
  1              large  green or red bell pepper -- stem end trimmed,
                        seeds removed, cut into 1" pieces
  1               pint  cherry tomatoes
  1              large  zucchini -- cut 1/2" slices
  1              pound  mixed greens -- for serving

Place the parsley, onions, basil, garlic, oregano, thyme, Essence and the vinegar in a blender or food processor.  With the motor running, add the olive oil, the heavy cream, mayonnaise, and cheese, and blend until smooth.  Adjust seasoning to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer half to a decorative bowl.

Place the chicken in a large glass bowl and toss with 2 teaspoons of the Essence.  Pour the remaining dressing over the chicken and toss to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.

If using wooden skewers, soak in water for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Place the oven rack in the top position.  Line a baking sheet with foil.

Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and pat dry with paper towels.  Thread one chicken cube onto a skewer, followed by a mushroom, a piece of bell pepper, a cherry tomato, zucchini and a chunk of onion.  Continue threading ingredients onto the skewer, until full.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.

Place the filled skewers on the baking sheet.  Bake until the chicken is cooked through and brown, 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove the baking sheet from the oven.  Place greens on a large platter.  Hold one end of each skewer with an oven mitt, with a fork push the chicken and vegetables from the skewer onto the platter.  Serve with the Creamy Italian Dressing.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  egg whites -- room temperature
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     2/3           cup  superfine granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips
                        = (or finely-chopped semisweet chocolate)
  1                cup  finely-chopped walnuts

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Set aside.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat egg whites until foamy.  Add the cream of tartar and beat until fluffy but not at all dry.  (Be careful not to over beat.)  Add the sugar gradually, about 3 tablespoons at a time.  When 1/2 of the sugar has been added, add the vanilla extract.  Continue beating and adding remaining sugar in batches, until all of the sugar is dissolved and the meringue is very shiny and tight.  Gently fold in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts.

Working one teaspoon at a time, push a teaspoonful of meringue from the tip of 1 teaspoon with the back of another teaspoon onto the lined baking sheets, leaving 1-inch of space between cookies.  Place baking sheets in the preheated oven and turn the oven off.  Leave the cookies (undisturbed) in the oven for at least 2 hours and up to overnight, or until cookies are crisp and dry.

This recipe yields about 4 dozen cookies.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat egg whites until foamy.  Add the cream of tartar and beat until fluffy but not at all dry.  (Be careful not to over beat.)  Add the sugar gradually, about 3 tablespoons at a time.  When 1/2 of the sugar has been added, add the vanilla extract.  Continue beating and adding remaining sugar in batches, until all of the sugar is dissolved and the meringue is very shiny and tight.  Gently fold in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Working one teaspoon at a time, push a teaspoonful of meringue from the tip of 1 teaspoon with the back of another teaspoon onto the lined baking sheets, leaving 1-inch of space between cookies.  Place baking sheets in the preheated oven and turn the oven off.  Leave the cookies (undisturbed) in the oven for at least 2 hours and up to overnight, or until cookies are crisp and dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 4 dozen cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  rich lamb or chicken stock*
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  6                     green onions -- finely chopped
  4             ounces  dried bean thread noodles -- soaked, and
                        cut into bite-size pieces
  1              pound  leafy greens -- chopped bite size
                        = (such as spinach, bok choy, or
                        Napa cabbage)
     3/4         pound  boneless lamb -- sliced paper thin
                        = (this is easier to do if lamb is
                        partially frozen)
                        === SESAME CHILE SAUCE ===
  3                     dried chiles -- seeded, minced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  sesame paste
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  black vinegar
                        === STAR ANISE BLACK VINEGAR REDUCTION ===
  1                cup  black vinegar
  2              whole  pods star anise

* Note:  The success of this dish depends on starting with a full-flavored stock or broth.

Place the stock, ginger, garlic and green onions in a large pot; bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.

Soak the noodles in warm water until softened; drain.  Cut into bite-size lengths.  Cut the greens into bite-size pieces.  Cut the lamb into paper-thin, bite-size slices.  Arrange the noodles, lamb and vegetables on a large platter.  Cover and chill until ready to cook.

Reheat the broth to simmering.  Set a Mongolian hot pot or electric wok in the center of a table.  Pour the broth into the pot and adjust the heat so that the broth simmers gently.  The guests use chopsticks or Chinese wire strainers to cook the lamb and vegetable slices in the simmering broth, and then dip into the sauce of their choice.  After the meat and vegetables are consumed, guests add the noodles and any remaining greens to the broth to make the soup.

Sesame Chile Sauce:  Mince chiles and garlic finely and place in a mortar.  Mash with the heel of a cleaver or pestle.  Add sugar and stir until it dissolves.  Add sesame paste, sesame oil, soy sauce, and black vinegar stirring between each addition.

Star Anise Black Vinegar Reduction:  Place vinegar and star anise in a small saucepot and simmer over medium-low heat until reduced by 1/2 about 7 minutes.  Remove star anise before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     rack lamb - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- trimmed
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  seasoned bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  grated Parmesan
                        Fig Chutney -- (see recipe)

Serve with some of the Fig Chutney, if desired.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     garlic heads -- stem ends
                        trimmed by 1/2"
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
     1/4           cup  chicken stock or water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  chicken stock or water
                        French bread -- accompaniment
                        Chopped parsley leaves -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Rub the garlic with the olive oil and place the heads, cut-side up, in a small saute pan or baking dish that's just large enough to hold the garlic comfortably.  Season the garlic with the salt and pepper and add the stock/water to the saute pan.  Place the saute pan in the oven and roast for about 30 minutes, or until the garlic is golden brown on the top and the cloves can be pierced easily with the tip of a sharp paring knife.  Remove the chafing dish from the oven and allow the garlic to cool.

When the garlic is cool enough to handle, squeeze the roasted garlic out from the skins.  Serve with slices of French bread and garnish with chopped parsley.

This recipe yields about 1 cup roasted garlic cloves.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  Parmigiano-Reggiano -- grated

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Lightly spray each of 4 (9-inch) disposable aluminum pie tins with cooking spray.  (Note: it is important that you use new, unblemished pie tins.)

Using a 3-inch cookie cutter as a guide, place 1 tablespoon of grated cheese into the ring and spread evenly within the boundaries of the cutter.  Repeat, forming 3 spreaded rounds of grated cheese on each prepared pie tin.  Repeat with the remaining cheese and remaining pie tins -- you should have 12 spreaded rounds of cheese.  Bake for 8 minutes, or until the fricos are golden brown and melted.  Remove from the oven and remove the fricos from the pie tins using a metal spatula.  Transfer to parchment lined cooling racks or inverted sheet pans to cool.

Repeat the entire process with remaining cheese to form a total of 24 fricos.  You should not have to re-oil the pans for the second batch of fricos.

This recipe yields 24 fricos.

Comments:  If the fricos stick to the pie tins, return them to the oven for a few seconds and you should be able to remove them with the spatula.  Also, fricos can be shaped when they just come out of the pan by draping them over rolling pins (for a cylinder shape) or the bottom of an upturned coffee cup or small bowl (for a small cup-shaped frico).

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  egg
     1/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  3          teaspoons  sugar
  3 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     vanilla bean -- split
  1         tablespoon  orange zest
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cardamom
  2            pinches  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2         pound  frozen puff pastry -- thawed,
                        but still cold
  3                     firm-ripe pears -- such as Anjou
  1                     lemon -- halved
     1/4           cup  apricot preserves
                        Creme fraiche or vanilla ice cream -- for serving
                        Mint -- for garnish

In a small bowl whisk the egg with 1/3 cup of the sugar until blended.  Add the flour and whisk until thoroughly incorporated.

In a small heavy saucepan combine the butter, vanilla bean, orange zest, cardamom and pepper and cook over high heat until the butter is light golden brown and has a nutty aroma, about 3 minutes.  Remove the vanilla bean, scraping the seeds from the inside into the melted butter.  Discard the vanilla bean or reserve for another use.  Allow the butter to cool slightly, then add to the flour mixture and whisk to combine.  Allow to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 1 hour.  This filling may be prepared up to 3 days in advance.

Halve the puff pastry sheet and roll each half out to approximately 1/8-inch thickness.  Using a small plate as a guide, cut 3 (6-inch)circles out of each half of puff pastry with the tip of a sharp paring knife.  Transfer the rounds onto 2 ungreased baking sheets, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to overnight before proceeding.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Using a sharp knife, cut approximately 1-inch off the tops of each pear, so that the remaining fruit is more or less spherical.  Peel, halve, and core the pears.  Rub them with the juice of half a lemon to keep them from discoloring.  Place 1 pear half, cut-side down, onto a work surface, and slice crosswise into about 1/8-inch thick slices.  Do not separate the slices.  Repeat with the remaining pear halves.  Squeeze more lemon juice over the sliced pears.  Reserve any uneven pieces and the end pieces separately.

Remove the puff pastry rounds from the refrigerator and place 1 heaping tablespoon of the butter filling into the center of each round.  Using 1 pear half for each round, decoratively fan the slices in a tight, overlapping circle so that the pear slices cover the pastry round.  The slices should not extend beyond the edge of the pastry.  Any uneven slices or end pieces of pear may be cut into small wedge-shaped pieces and then placed in the center of the tartlets to form rosettes.  Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of sugar over each tartlet and bake for about 30 minutes, or until the pears are tender and the tartlets are lightly browned around the edges.

While the tartlets are baking, heat the apricot preserves in a small saucepan (thin with a small amount of water, if necessary).  When the preserves have melted, use a pastry brush to gently brush the top of each tartlet with some of the preserves.

Garnish with mint and serve warm or at room temperature with crËme fraiche or vanilla ice cream, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  3                     carrots -- peeled, and

  3                     celery ribs -- peeled, and

  3                     onions -- peeled, quartered
  1                     chicken - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs) -- rinsed, patted dry
  1 1/2    tablespoons  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  cracked white pepper
  1                     lemon -- halved
  2                     fresh bay leaves
  6                     garlic cloves -- roughly chopped
  4             sprigs  rosemary -- roughly chopped,
                        plus
  1         tablespoon  chopped rosemary -- for gravy
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1                cup  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  roasted garlic
  1                cup  dry white wine

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

In a 9- by 13-inch roasting pan, add the carrots, celery and onions.  Season the chicken both inside and out with the kosher salt and white pepper.  Squeeze the lemon halves over the chicken and place the rinds inside the cavity.  Place the bay leaves inside the cavity.  In a small bowl, combine the garlic, rosemary, olive oil and butter.  Rub the chicken both inside and out with the garlic rosemary blend and place in the roasting pan.

Place the pan in the oven and roast the chicken for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the juices run clear.  To test this, insert a thermometer in the thickest part of a leg.  It should register at 160 degrees internal temperature.  Remove the chicken from the oven and allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.

Pour off excess fat from pan and return to heat.  Whisk in chicken stock, roasted garlic, white wine and chopped rosemary, scraping up the bits on the bottom of pan.  Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.  Reduce gravy by half, until thickened.

Serve chicken with gravy on the side.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  sparkling wine
                        === POACHED PEARS ===
  12                    pears
  1             bottle  sweet white wine
                        = (Moscato, Muscat, Riesling, etc.)
  1                     vanilla bean -- split

Fill a 1-quart saucepan half-full with water over medium heat and bring to a simmer.

Place all Sabayon ingredients in a medium stainless steel bowl and whisk until well combined.  Place the bowl over the saucepan and continue to whisk until the sauce is thick and doubled in volume, 3 to 5 minutes.  The sauce should be thick enough so that it will support a ribbon of sauce trailing off the end of the spoon when lifted.

Serve warm over poached pears in small bowls or decorative glasses.

Poached Pears:  Cut a small "x" on the bottom of each pear.  Bring a saucepan of water to a boil and set up a large bowl of ice water.  Add the pears to the boiling water and cook for 15 to 30 seconds, just to loosen skin.  Remove and immediately plunge into the ice water.  Slip the skins off the pears.  Halve and remove the pits.

Combine the wine and vanilla bean in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add the pears, cover and simmer gently for 3 to 5 minutes, or just until the pears are tender.

Remove the pears from the poaching liquid and chill.  Top with the sabayon.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHIPOTLE MAYONNAISE ===
  1                cup  mayonnaise -- preferably homemade
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1                     chipotle pepper in adobo sauce
  1           teaspoon  lemon or lime juice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  Mexican oregano
                        === GUACAMOLE ===
  2                     Florida avocados -- peeled, mashed
  1                     lime -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped onion
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, minced
  1                     garlic clove - (to 2) -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
                        === ANCHO BBQ SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  molasses
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  chili peppers packed in adobo sauce
                        === FRIED FONDUE ===
                        Vegetable shortening -- for deep frying
  1              pound  pork tenderloin -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 3/4" cubes
  1              pound  chorizo sausage -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/3"-thick slices

Make the 3 dipping sauces and set aside.

For the Chipotle Mayonnaise:  Combine all ingredients in the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer to a small bowl and refrigerate until needed.  (Makes about 1 cup)

For the Guacamole:  Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and stir until thoroughly combined.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside, refrigerated, until needed.  Should be made as close to serving time as possible.  (Makes about 3/4 cup)

For the Ancho BBQ Sauce: Combine the sugar, vinegar, tomato paste, sesame oil, molasses, soy sauce, and chili peppers in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until it starts to become syrupy and dime-sized bubbles form, 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a blender or food processor.  Process on high speed until smooth.  (Makes about 3/4 cup)

Melt enough vegetable shortening in a metal fondue pot to come halfway up the sides.  Heat over high heat on the stovetop until a thermometer reads 375 degrees.  Transfer the fondue pot to its burner over a high flame.

Cook the pork and sausage according to individual preferences, until golden brown and cooked through.  Divide the dipping sauces among each diner and allow guests to dip into their preferred sauce.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry
                        = (half of 17.3-oz package)
     1/3           cup  grated Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  1              large  egg
                        All-purpose flour -- for dusting

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Line 3 large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Thaw the pastry sheet at room temperature covered by a clean kitchen cloth, about 30 minutes.  While the pastry is thawing, combine cheese, olive oil, garlic, oregano, salt and cayenne in a small mixing bowl.  Stir well to combine.  In a clean small mixing bowl, beat the egg with a fork.  On a lightly floured surface, gently unfold the pastry.

Sprinkle the pastry lightly with flour and using a rolling pin, roll into a 14- by 10-inch rectangle.  Brush the top of the pastry with a beaten egg.  Cut in half lengthwise to form 2 (7- by 10-inch) rectangles.  Spread the herb-cheese mixture with the back of a spoon evenly across 1 rectangle.  Lay the second rectangle across the coated piece, egg side-down.  With the rolling pin lightly roll the 2 sheets together to seal.  With a large knife cut crosswise into strips, about 1/3-inch wide each.  (Alternately, you can use a pizza wheel to cut the strips.)

One at a time, grab the ends of each strip and twist in opposite directions to form a spiral.  Transfer to the prepared baking sheets.  Bake until light golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool on baking sheets until cool enough to handle.  Serve either warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 30 twists.

                         Quick Summer Tomato Soup

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2               cups  chopped onions
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     celery rib -- finely chopped
  1                     carrot -- finely chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  4             pounds  very ripe tomatoes -- roughly chopped
     3/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  2               cups  fresh basil leaves - (packed) -- rinsed, patted dry
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

In a medium enameled or other nonreactive saucepan, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the chopped onions, 2/3 of the minced garlic, the chopped celery and chopped carrot and saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the crushed red pepper and tomatoes and continue to cook, covered, until the tomatoes give up their liquid and begin to fall apart, about 15 minutes.  Add the water and orange juice and continue to cook, covered, until the tomatoes have completely broken up, about 15 minutes longer.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

While the soup is cooking, combine the basil leaves, remaining 2 cloves of garlic, and remaining 1/2 cup of olive oil in a blender and process until very smooth.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste and set aside, refrigerated and covered with plastic wrap, until ready to use.

Remove the soup from the heat and puree, in batches, in a blender.  The soup may be served either hot or cold -- if you plan on serving it hot, return the pureed soup to a clean saucepan and keep warm until ready to serve.  If you plan on serving it cold, pour the soup into a heatproof bowl and let come to room temperature, then chill in the refrigerator at least 2 hours and up to 2 days before serving.  (Remember to taste the soup and re-season if serving it cold.)

When ready to serve the soup, ladle into bowls and garnish with drizzles of the basil-garlic puree.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Rabbit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  2                     rabbits -- rinsed, and
                        cut into 8 pieces each
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions
  1                cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  chopped green bell peppers
  1 1/2           cups  chopped tomatoes
  2                     green onions -- chopped
                        = (green and white parts separated)
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  4               cups  chicken stock or broth -- plus
                        more if necessary
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
                        Cooked white rice -- for serving

In a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Season the rabbit pieces with the Essence and, working in batches if necessary, cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Transfer the rabbit to a plate lined with paper towels and reduce the heat to medium.

Add the flour to the oil in the pot and whisk to combine.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the roux is a golden brown color, about 10 minutes.  Add the onions, celery, bell pepper, tomatoes, white parts of the green onions and the garlic and cook until vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes.  Stir in the tomato paste and chicken stock and bring to a boil.

Return the rabbit to the pot and return to a boil.  Add the thyme and salt, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, uncovered, until the rabbit is very tender, about 2 hours, adding more broth or water, if necessary, if the sauce gets too thick.

When the rabbit is tender and you are ready to serve the stew, add the green parts of the green onions and parsley and cook for 5 minutes.  Serve the rabbit with the gravy over hot white rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  self-rising flour
     3/4           cup  cake flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  4        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  melted butter
  1 1/4           cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.

Into a medium mixing bowl, sift the self-rising flour, cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar.  Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work the butter into the flour until there are no butter pieces larger than a pea.  Add the heavy cream to the flour mixture and, using your hands or a rubber spatula, stir just until the cream and flour come together to form a dough.

Sprinkle some of the all-purpose flour on a flat surface and place the dough on top of the flour.  Using your hands, press the dough into a 1/2-inch thick disk about 8 inches in diameter.  Using a 3-inch round cutter dusted in flour, cut the dough into circles.  Be sure to press straight and downward when cutting the dough -- a twisting motion will prevent the dough from rising.  You will need to reform the scraps of dough in order to have 8 biscuits.  Do this by pushing the scrap pieces together and press to reform into a 1/2-inch thick disk.

Place the biscuits on a small sheet pan and brush the tops with the melted butter.  Bake in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.  Allow to cool briefly and serve while still warm.

This recipe yields about 8 (3-inch) biscuits.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2            bottles  Zinfandel - (750 ml ea)
  4          teaspoons  whole black peppercorns
  1                     vanilla bean -- split and scraped
  2        tablespoons  orange zest -- plus
                        more for garnish
  6                     cardamom pods
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  4                     ripe pears -- peeled
                        = (such as Anjou or Bartlett)
     1/2           cup  mascarpone -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  toasted -- crushed pistachios
                        Mint leaves -- for garnish
                        Creme anglaise -- (optional) for
                        garnish

Place the wine, peppercorns, vanilla beans, zest, cardamom and sugar in a 2 1/2-quart saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved.  Bring the saucepan to a boil then reduce to a gentle simmer.  Place the pears in the saucepan and cook for about 30 to 45 minutes, or until the pears are tender.

Remove the pears from the poaching liquid and set aside on a plate.  Allow them to cool completely.

While the pears are cooling, strain the poaching liquid and discard solids.  Return the liquid to the pan, increase the heat to medium-high and reduce the poaching liquid to a syrup, about 5 to 10 minutes.  You should have about 1/2 cup syrup.  Set aside.

When the pears are cool enough to handle, remove the inner core using a melon baller.  Stuff each pear with 2 tablespoons of the mascarpone.

To serve, pour about 2 tablespoons of the poaching syrup on a chilled appetizer plate with a pear in the center.  Sprinkle toasted pistachios around the plate and garnish with mint leaves and orange zest.  Drizzle with creme anglaise, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Place the wine, peppercorns, vanilla beans, zest, cardamom and sugar in a 2 1/2-quart saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved.  Bring the saucepan to a boil then reduce to a gentle simmer.  Place the pears in the saucepan and cook for about 30 to 45 minutes, or until the pears are tender.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the pears from the poaching liquid and set aside on a plate.  Allow them to cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the pears are cooling, strain the poaching liquid and discard solids.  Return the liquid to the pan, increase the heat to medium-high and reduce the poaching liquid to a syrup, about 5 to 10 minutes.  You should have about 1/2 cup syrup.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the pears are cool enough to handle, remove the inner core using a melon baller.  Stuff each pear with 2 tablespoons of the mascarpone.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, pour about 2 tablespoons of the poaching syrup on a chilled appetizer plate with a pear in the center.  Sprinkle toasted pistachios around the plate and garnish with mint leaves and orange zest.  Drizzle with creme anglaise, if desired.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     butternut squash - (1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and rough chopped
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  Italian sausage removed from casing
  1                cup  small-diced onion
     1/2           cup  small-diced carrot
     1/2           cup  small-diced celery
     1/2           cup  small-diced leeks
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  apple cider vinegar
  1 1/2         quarts  chicken stock
  2          teaspoons  maple syrup
  1           teaspoon  fresh chopped sage leaves
                        Roasted Parsnip Soup -- (see recipe)
                        Tarragon Oil -- (see recipe)

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Place the chopped squash in a medium-size mixing bowl.  Drizzle the squash with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper.  Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil and place the squash on top of the sheet pan.  Set the sheet pan into the oven and roast for 30 minutes, or until the squash is lightly caramelized and tender.

Remove the squash from the oven and set aside.  Place a 1-gallon saucepan over medium-high heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan and render the Italian sausage.  Cook, stirring often until the meat is caramelized and has released most of its fat, about 3 minutes.  Add the onions, carrots, celery and leeks in the pan and sweat, stirring often for 5 to 7 minutes.  Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and sweat for 1 minute stirring continuously.  Deglaze the pan with the vinegar and add the chicken stock to the pan.  Place the squash in the pan with the maple syrup and sage.

Bring the pan to a boil and reduce to a simmer.  Continue to cook the soup for 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are all tender.  Use an immersion blender to puree the soup to a smooth consistency and velvety texture.  Alternately, you can puree the soup in batches using a blender.  Taste the soup and re-season if necessary with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.  Keep warm until serving.

When you are ready to serve the soups:  Using 2 half-cup measures, each filled with 1 of the soups, pour the soups side by side, simultaneously into a small heated soup cup or bowl.  Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the tarragon oil and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 quarts serving 6 to 8 when served together and portioned equally.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  Idaho potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" wedges
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt -- divided
  1 3/4           cups  heavy cream
  1 1/2         sticks  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  4 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh rosemary
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.

Combine the potatoes and 1 teaspoon of the salt in a heavy, medium pot.  Cover with water by 1-inch and bring to a boil.  Cook until the potatoes are just fork tender, 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain in a colander and spread in a layer on a baking sheet.  Bake until dry, 10 minutes.

Remove from the oven and transfer to a heavy, medium pot.  Over medium heat, add the remaining ingredients, and with a hand-held potato masher, mash the potatoes until creamy and the ingredients are well blended.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a casserole dish.  If preparing for the next day, allow to cool to room temperature and refrigerate, covered with plastic wrap, until the following day.

Remove from the refrigerator and allow to warm to room temperature.  Replace the plastic wrap with aluminum foil and bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until hot throughout.  Remove from the oven, stir well to fluff potatoes, then serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2               cups  Court Bouillon -- (see recipe)
  4                     sea bass fillets - (4 oz ea) -- skin removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  4             ounces  cold unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cubed
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped tarragon
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped chervil -- plus
                        more for garnish
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  butter
  1 1/2           cups  carrots -- cut into batonnet
                        = (1/4" by 1/4" by 2 1/2" to 3")
  1 1/2           cups  zucchini -- cut into batonnet
  2        tablespoons  water

Place a 12-inch saute pan on the stove, add the shallots, garlic and court bouillon to the pan.  Set over a high heat and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook for 5 minutes.  Season the sea bass fillets on both sides with the salt and white pepper.  Place the fillets in the poaching liquid and cover with a lid, or a buttered round of parchment paper.  Cook the fish for 5 to 6 minutes, or until cooked through.

Remove the fillets from the poaching liquid using a slotted metal spatula and place on a warm plate loosely covered with aluminum foil.  Put the plate in a warm place while you make the sauce.  Raise the heat to high and reduce the court bouillon for about 10 minutes, or until reduced to 1/2 cup.  Lower the heat, and add the butter to the pan a little at a time.  Use a whisk to stir the cold butter into the sauce and season with salt and white pepper.  Sprinkle the tarragon and chervil into the sauce and return the fish to the pan.  Place the pan over a medium-low heat and warm the fish through, about 1 minute.

In a 10-inch saute pan, set over a medium-heat, add the olive oil and 1 teaspoon of butter to the pan.  Once the butter has melted, add the carrots to the pan and saute, stirring often for 1 1/2 minutes.  Add the zucchini and 2 tablespoons of water to the pan and continue to cook for 2 minutes more.  Season the vegetables with salt and white pepper and divide among 4 warmed entree plates.  Place a sea bass fillet over the vegetables and divide the sauce among the 4 plates as well.  Garnish with chervil.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  lobe Grade-A duck or goose foie gras -- veins and impurities
                        removed, cut lengthwise 1/2"-thk slices

     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced shallots

     1/4           cup  Armagnac
  16            slices  brioche or other egg bread -- toasted

Lightly season both sides of the sliced foie gras with salt and pepper.

Heat the clarified butter in a large non-stick skillet over moderately-high heat, but not smoking.  Sear the foie gras in batches, about 45 seconds per side.  Remove from the pan and cover to keep warm.

Divide the foie gras and apples among plates and garnish with the toasted brioche.

Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  shrimp -- peeled, deveined
                        and tails left on
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1              small  onion -- sliced thinly
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1                     lemon -- juiced

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2          teaspoons  dark brown sugar* -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  olive oil
                        Mesclun salad mix or favorite greens -- for accompaniment
                        Assortment of salad ingredients -- for garnish
                        = (such as cherry tomatoes, chopped
                        carrots, sliced red onion, chopped
                        celery, diced cucumbers, walnuts)
                        Blue cheese -- for topping

* Note:  If using a good quality balsamic vinegar you should not need the sugar, but if using a lesser quality you might want the sugar to round out the dressing.

Beat the vinegar in a bowl with the optional sugar, garlic, salt and pepper until sugar and salt dissolves.  Then beat in the oil by droplets, whisking constantly.  (Or place all the ingredients in a screw-top jar and shake to combine.)  Taste and adjust the seasonings.

Toss a few tablespoons of the dressing with the salad mix and desired salad ingredients, top with blue cheese and serve immediately.

If not using dressing right away, cover and refrigerate, whisking or shaking again before use.

This recipe yields about 1 cup.

  2                     jalapeÒo peppers -- seeded, minced fine
     1/2         bunch  scallions (green onions) -- minced
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro leaves
  2                     limes -- juiced
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large bowl, combine all ingredients except the shrimp and the relish mix well to combine.  Add the shrimp to the seasoning paste, and toss to thoroughly coat with the seasoning mixture.  Let the shrimp sit in the seasoning mixture while you prepare the grill.

Prepare a grill and thread the shrimp onto 4 or 6 metal skewers (depending on their size).  Place shrimp skewers on the grill and cook for about 3 minutes on each side, or until the shrimp turn pink and are lightly charred on both sides.  Do not overcook!

Serve the shrimp with Black Bean Relish

For the Black Bean Relish:  In a large bowl combine all of the ingredients and stir to mix well.  Season the black bean relish with salt and pepper, and set aside at least 1/2 hour before serving with the shrimp.  Finish the black bean relish with the chopped cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  If you don't have metal skewers for grilling, bamboo skewers will work just fine.  Simply remember to soak them for at least 30 minutes in warm water before threading them with ingredients, this will keep them from burning.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Noodles

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground pork
  4        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  peanut oil
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped ginger
     2/3           cup  finely-chopped green onions (scallions)
  1         tablespoon  Chinese sesame paste
  3        tablespoons  chile oil
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  dried Szechuan peppercorns -- roasted and ground
                        = (or 3 tbspns Szechuan chile paste)
     3/4         pound  Chinese thin egg noodles
  1                cup  matchstick-cut radish -- for garnish

In a large saucepan heat 2 quarts of lightly salted water to a boil.

While waiting for the water to come to a boil, combine the pork and 2 tablespoons of the soy sauce in a small bowl and mix well.  Add the oil to a wok or saute pan and heat over medium-high heat until very hot.  Add the pork and stir-fry, stirring with a spatula to break it into small pieces.  When the pork is crispy and dry, about 5 minutes, remove it with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper-lined plate to drain.

Pour off most of the oil, leaving 2 tablespoons in the wok.  Reheat the wok, add the garlic, ginger, and scallions, and stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Add the sesame paste, remaining 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, chili oil, and chicken stock and simmer for 4 minutes.

When the water has come to a boil, cook the noodles until al dente, for 2 minutes if they are fresh or 5 minutes if they are dried.  Drain the noodles and add to the reduced sauce in the wok, along with the reserved pork, and toss until thoroughly combined and coated with the sauce.

Top with the matchstick radishes and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
     3/4           cup  warm water
  2        tablespoons  white sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  white sugar
  1 3/4           cups  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  lard or vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
                        === SHRIMP AND GREEN ONION FILLING ===
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped ginger
  6                     green onions -- chopped
  1              pound  raw shrimp -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  canned bamboo shoots -- drained, chopped
  1 1/2    tablespoons  white sugar
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch -- mixed with
  2 1/2    tablespoons  water
                        Lettuce or cabbage leaves -- for lining steamer

Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup warm water.  Add 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and stir to mix well.  Allow to stand for 30 minutes.

Mix in remaining warm water, remaining flour and sugar, salt, and lard or vegetable oil.  Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic.  Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

Punch down dough, and spread out on a floured board.  Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes.  Divide dough into 2 parts, and place the piece you are not working with in a covered bowl.  Form each half into a log about 2 inches thick.  Cut logs into 1-inch pieces and roll each into a ball.  Cover with a damp towel.

Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, press into a thin disc shape.  Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in center, and then gather up edges and twist to seal, using some extra drops of water to stick together as needed.  Cover with a damp kitchen towel and repeat with remaining dough.

Line bamboo steamer tray with lettuce or cabbage leaves.  Place buns, sealed-side down, in bamboo steamer tray and let rise for 45 minutes.  Meanwhile, heat water to boiling in a wok to a level just below the bamboo steamer.

Place bamboo steamer in wok and steam buns for 20 to 25 minutes, and then remove from heat.  Remove lid before turning off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blister".

For the Shrimp And Green Onion Filling:  Place a wok over medium heat.  Add the oil and, when hot, add the ginger, and green onion and stir-fry until aromatic, about 1 minute.  Add the shrimp and bamboo shoots and cook for 1 minute.  Add the sugar, soy sauce, and sesame oil and stir to combine.  Combine the cornstarch and the water and add to the shrimp mixture, stirring frequently.  The mixture should thicken immediately.  Transfer mixture to a bowl and allow to cool before assembling the buns.

This recipe yields 24 buns.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Corn oil -- for frying
                        = (or another oil with high smoke point,
                        such as safflower or peanut)
  3 1/2           cups  sifted flour -- plus
                        extra for rolling
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  sugar
  4                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/3           cup  canola oil
     1/3           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar -- for serving

Fill a large, heavy-bottomed, wide-mouthed pot halfway with corn oil and heat over a medium-high flame until oil reaches a temperature of 360 degrees.

While the oil is heating, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt.  In another large bowl whisk together sugar and eggs.  Stir canola oil and milk into sugar-egg mixture.  Stir dry ingredients into egg mixture until a biscuit-like dough forms.

Lightly flour a work surface and turn out the dough.  Sprinkle dough lightly with flour and, using a rolling pin, gently roll the dough out to a thickness of 1/8-inch.  Using a sharp knife or dough scraper, cut into 2-inch squares.  You will have scraps leftover but do not try to remix these as that will cause tough dough; just fry as they are.

Use the dough scraper to lift dough squares off the work surface.  Fry the beignets in small batches about 4 minutes, or until golden, turning several times to color evenly.  Using a slotted spoon gently remove the beignets and drain thoroughly on paper towels.  Place powdered sugar in a sieve and shake over the beignets to cover with powdered sugar and serve immediately.

This recipe yields about 2 dozen.

Fill a large, heavy-bottomed, wide-mouthed pot halfway with corn oil and heat over a medium-high flame until oil reaches a temperature of 360 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the oil is heating, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt.  In another large bowl whisk together sugar and eggs.  Stir canola oil and milk into sugar-egg mixture.  Stir dry ingredients into egg mixture until a biscuit-like dough forms.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly flour a work surface and turn out the dough.  Sprinkle dough lightly with flour and, using a rolling pin, gently roll the dough out to a thickness of 1/8-inch.  Using a sharp knife or dough scraper, cut into 2-inch squares.  You will have scraps leftover but do not try to remix these as that will cause tough dough; just fry as they are.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Use the dough scraper to lift dough squares off the work surface.  Fry the beignets in small batches about 4 minutes, or until golden, turning several times to color evenly.  Using a slotted spoon gently remove the beignets and drain thoroughly on paper towels.  Place powdered sugar in a sieve and shake over the beignets to cover with powdered sugar and serve immediately.

  6                     eggs
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder - (heaping)
  2        tablespoons  milk, water or whiskey
  3               cups  hickory nuts or pecans -- chopped
                        = (hickory nuts are best)
  1                cup  whiskey or bourbon -- plus

  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream -- whipped, for
                        serving with the cake

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour a tube pan.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Gradually add flour, baking powder, and milk or whiskey.  Fold in nuts and pour into prepared baking pan.

Place a shallow pan of water on the bottom rung of the oven.  Bake the cake in the middle of the oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until golden brown and a tester comes out clean when placed in the center of the cake.

Allow cake to cool on a cooling rack.  When the cake has cooled completely, use a pastry brush to coat all sides of the cake with whiskey.  This should use about 3/4 cup.  Wrap the cake in a piece of cheesecloth and pour the remaining 1/4 cup of whiskey over the cheesecloth so that it is damp.  Store the cake in the refrigerator for several weeks, re-wetting the cheesecloth as needed with additional whiskey.

Serve with whipped cream.

     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     veal scallops - (abt 3/4 lb) -- pounded 1/8"
                        thickness
  1 1/2    tablespoons  vegetable oil
  5        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  1                     lemon - (or more to taste) -- juiced
                        = (abt 2 tbspns)
  2         tablespoon  capers -- drained
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley leaves -- (optional), plus
                        parsley sprigs for garnish

In a shallow bowl or plate combine the flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt and pepper and stir to combine thoroughly.  Quickly dredge the veal scallops in the seasoned flour mixture, shaking to remove any excess flour.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until very hot but not smoking.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter and, working quickly and in batches if necessary, cook the veal until golden brown on both sides, about 1 minute per side.  Transfer to a plate and set aside.

Deglaze the pan with wine and bring to a boil, scraping to remove any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  When the wine has reduced by half, add the chicken stock, chopped garlic, lemon juice and capers and cook for 5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.  Whisk in the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, remaining 3 1/2 tablespoons of butter and the chopped parsley.

When the butter has melted, return the veal scallops to the pan and cook until heated through and the sauce has thickened, about 1 minute.  Garnish with parsley sprigs and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  rye bread
                        Emeril's Russian Dressing -- (see recipe)
  8             ounces  thinly-sliced Swiss cheese
  8             ounces  sliced baked ham
  8             ounces  sliced corned beef
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened
  1                cup  sauerkraut -- as accompaniment

Preheat a waffle iron.

Place 2 slices of the bread on a flat work surface.  Spread one side of each slice with the Emeril's Russian Dressing.  On 1 slice of bread, stack half of the cheese, ham, and corned beef in layers.  Top with the other slice of bread, dressing-side down, and push together to form a sandwich.

Spread softened butter on both sides of the sandwich and place in the hot waffle iron.  Cook until the sandwich is golden brown on the outside and the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the grill and cut into quarters.  Serve immediately with the sauerkraut, and repeat with the remaining sandwich.

This recipe yields 2 sandwiches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter -- softened, plus
  6             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  6             ounces  white chocolate
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  5              large  eggs
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  buttermilk
                        === MACERATED BERRIES ===
  1               pint  strawberries -- rinsed, hulled,
                        and halved
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  orange or lemon flavored liqueur
  1               pint  blueberries, raspberries or
                        blackberries -- rinsed
  2          teaspoons  fresh basil or lemon balm -- leaves cut
                        chiffonade
                        === BUTTERMILK ICE MILK ===
  1 1/2           cups  superfine sugar
     1/4           cup  lemon juice -- plus
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
  1              pinch  salt
  3               cups  buttermilk

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Butter a 10- by 3-inch springform pan with 1/2 teaspoon of the butter and line with parchment paper.  Butter the paper with 1/2 teaspoon of the butter and set aside.

Scald the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Remove from the heat.  Place the white chocolate in a heat-proof bowl.  Add the hot cream and let side for 2 minutes, then whisk until smooth.

With an electric mixer, cream together the remaining 6 ounces of butter, sugar, and vanilla until pale and fluffy.  Add 4 of the eggs to the butter mixture one at a time, beating well after the addition of each.  Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl, and add 2 tablespoons of the egg to the batter.  Add the melted white chocolate and beat well, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.

Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt.  Alternately add the dry ingredients and the buttermilk to the batter, beating after each addition and ending with the flour mixture.  Pour into the prepared pan and bake until golden brown and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 1 hour.  Remove the sides and turn out the cake on the wire rack to finish cooling.

Serve a slice of the cake with some of the Macerated Berries spooned over the top, with a scoop of Buttermilk Ice Cream on top of all.

For the Macerated Berries:  In a medium bowl combine strawberries, sugar and liqueur and toss to combine.  Allow to macerate until sugar is dissolved and strawberries begin to give up their juice, about 20 minutes.  Add remaining berries and toss gently to combine.  Serve over the White Chocolate Buttermilk Cake, garnished with basil or lemon balm.

For the Buttermilk Ice Milk:  In a large non-reactive bowl combine sugar, lemon juice, zest, salt and buttermilk and stir until the sugar is dissolved.  Cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator until thoroughly chilled, about 1 hour.  Process in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.  (Makes about 1 quart)

This recipe yields 1 (10-inch) cake.
