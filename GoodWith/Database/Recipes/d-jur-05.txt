  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1                cup  warm water
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh yeast
  1 1/2           cups  high gluten flour
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  semolina flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour -- for dusting
                        === LOBSTER CREAM ===
  1                     lobster  - (1 lb)
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1                     plum tomato -- cut into quarters
  3                     parsley sprigs -- with the stalk
  4                     peppercorns
  1              ounce  ricotta salada
  1              ounce  parmesan cheese
                        === TOPPING INGREDIENTS ===
  2                     shallots
  2                     garlic cloves
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  scallions in small-cut rounds
                        Meat reserved from 1 lb lobster

For the Pizza Dough:  Mix first four ingredients and let rise for hour.  Add the next three ingredients to above, then add enough all-purpose flour to bring dough together into a smooth, soft, but not sticky dough.  Let sit out 1 hour.  Put in oiled bowl.  Cover.  Refrigerate overnight.  Use the next day.

For the Lobster Cream:  In boiling salted water, blanch the lobster for seven minutes, then shock it in an ice bath.

Remove the head for the lobster cream sauce.  Remove the lobster meat and dice it into half-inch pieces.  Split the lobster body in half and by half again.  Place the body in a saucepan and then cover it with the cream.  Add the parsley and the tomato and peppercorns.  Slowly simmer cream, reducing it by half.  Remove cream from heat and strain.

Grate the parmesan and the ricotta salada cheese.

Slice shallots and garlic, and cook slowly in olive oil till translucent.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Divide pizza dough into five ounce portions, gently rolling into balls.  Using a small rolling pin, gently roll the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to an 11-inch circle.  Place the dough on a floured pizza peel or flour the back of a small sheet pan and place the dough on that.

In a small bowl, place the lobster pieces.  Ladle two ounces of the lobster cream into the bowl.

Sprinkle the dough with both cheeses.  Add lobster and cream.  Sprinkle shallots and garlic and some of the olive oil on top.  Sprinkle with the scallion rounds.  Bake on the bottom of a hot oven, dusted with semolina or flour, or on a pizza stone that has been preheated.  Bake until the pizza is golden brown and crisp on the bottom.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 sevings.

               Braised Chard Stems With Saffron And Tomato

Recipe By     :Deborah Madison
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  chard stems
  1              quart  water -- simmering with
  1                     bay leaf -- plus
  2                     onion slices -- plus
  2                     thyme sprigs -- plus
                        Juice of 1 lemon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2         small  onion -- finely diced
  2        tablespoons  basil leaves - (abt) -- torn small pieces,
                        plus extra for garnish
  1              pinch  saffron threads
  2                     tomatoes -- seeded, diced fine
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat the broiler on low.

Trim the chard stems, then cut into 2- to 3-inch lengths, on the diagonal.  Drop them into the simmering water, add 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cook until tender but still just a little resistant to the knife, about 12 minutes.  Scoop them out, reserving the cooking liquid.

Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet with the onion, basil, and saffron threads.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions soften and the saffron begins to yield its color, about 5 minutes.

Add the blanched chard stems, season with salt and pepper, then add a cup of the reserved cooking water.  Simmer, covered, until the stems are fully tender, about 7 minutes.

Remove the lid, add the tomatoes, and cook until the remaining liquid has reduce to a syrupy consistency.

Transfer the cooked chard stems to a small gratin dish.  Scatter the cheese over the top then slide under the broiler until the cheese is lightly browned in places.  Garnish with a few more torn basil leaves, then serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

         Broiled Polenta With Vegetables And Caramelized Shallots

Recipe By     :Jeanne Lemlin
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === THE POLENTA ===
  3 1/2           cups  vegetable stock
                        = (or water)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        = (less if your stock is salty)
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
                        = (or 1/4 tspn dried rosemary, crumbled)
  1                cup  cornmeal
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  1                cup  grated mozzarella cheese
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- for brushing polenta
                        === THE VEGETABLES ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  18                    shallots -- peeled
                        = (separate small ones from large ones)
  1              pinch  sugar
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  12                    shiitake mushrooms -- stems discarded,
                        caps kept whole
  2                     red bell peppers -- cored, and
                        cut into strips 2" by 1/2"
  2              small  zucchini -- halved lengthwise,
                        and cut diagonally 1/4" thick
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Rosemary sprigs -- for garnish

To make the polenta, set aside a 10- by 10-inch shallow baking dish or other comparable dish.

Bring the vegetable stock, salt, and rosemary to a boil in a medium-size saucepan.  Reduce the heat to a simmer, then gradually sprinkle in the cornmeal, whisking constantly with a wire whisk.  Cook the polenta, whisking all the while, until it begins to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 7 minutes.  Whisk in the butter, Parmesan cheese, and mozzarella cheese.

Scrape the polenta into the reserved baking dish and smooth over the top.  Let cool for 10 minutes, then cover and chill for at least 1 hour, or until cold throughout.  When you are ready to broil the polenta, cut it into 12 squares or diamonds.  Lightly brush both sides of each piece with the olive oil, and place the polenta on a baking sheet.  Set aside while you cook the vegetables.

To cook the vegetables, melt the butter in a medium-size skillet over medium heat.  Add the largest of the shallots and cover the pan.  Cook 5 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally.  Add the smaller shallots, sprinkle on the sugar, then sprinkle on a few tablespoons of water.  Lower the heat, cover the pan, and cook until caramelized and soft, about 25 minutes.  Continue to shake the pan on occasion while the shallots are cooking.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add the shiitake caps and saute until brown and juicy.  Remove onto a plate.  Add the remaining oil, then toss in the red peppers.  Cook 2 minutes, then mix in the zucchini.  Cook the vegetables, tossing often, until they are tender, yet crisp.

Make a small well in the center of the pan and add the garlic.  Cook 1 minute before mixing it into the vegetables.  Stir in the shallots and shiitake mushrooms, then season generouly with salt and pepper.  Keep the vegetables warm over low heat.

Broil the polenta until golden brown on top and hot throughout.  Serve 2 polenta squares on each plate with some vegetables along the center.  Garnish with rosemary sprigs.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Melissa Murphy

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  eggs yolks
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1                cup  milk
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a large mixing bowl, lightly whisk the egg yolks until smooth.  Set aside.

In a medium, heavy-based saucepan, heat the brown sugar, milk, and cream over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Scald the mixture (do not boil it) and remove it from heat.

While the cream mixture is heating, dissolve the sugar and water over low heat in a large, heavy-based saucepan; increase the heat to high and boil the sugar until it's amber in color.  If the sugar starts to sputter, use a pastry brush dipped in water to wash down the sides of the pan.  As soon as the sugar turns dark amber (like a old penny), carefully and slowly pour the hot cream into it, stirring the mixture.  (The caramel will bubble as you add the cream, so use a long wooden spoon or whisk to combine them.)

Gently and slowly whisk the cream mixture into the egg yolks.  Stir in the salt and vanilla.  Strain the pudding and cool it in an ice bath or refrigerate until cool.

Skim off any air bubbles from the pudding mixture and divide the cool pudding mixture among 6 (6-ounce) ramekins.  Set the ramekins in a shallow roasting pan and fill the roasting pan with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins.  Cover the pan with foil.

Bake the pudding until just set.  Begin checking after 1 hour.  When gently shaken, they should no longer look liquid; instead, the custard will move as one mass.

Allow the pudding to cool to room temperature in the water.  Refrigerate the pudding for several hours or overnight before serving.  The pudding will keep its dark color if refrigerated uncovered.  It will taste no different but will look lighter if you cover it, which you should do (after it has cooled completely) if you have any strong flavored-food in you refrigerator

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TARTLET CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  1              pinch  salt
  4        tablespoons  unsalted cold butter -- cut small pieces
  1              large  egg -- beaten slightly
  1         tablespoon  cold water -- plus up to
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cold water -- if needed
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  cashews -- well toasted
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds -- well toasted
     1/2           cup  walnut pieces -- well toasted
     1/3           cup  shredded coconut -- well toasted
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
  1 1/4           cups  warm Butterscotch Sauce -- (see recipe)

To make the Crust:  In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Add the butter and cut it into the dough using two knives, a pastry blender, or your fingertips until the dough looks crumbly.  Add the egg and 1 tablespoon water; mix with a fork until the dough just holds together.  (If the dough won't come together, add up to another 1 1/2 teaspoons water, a tiny bit at a time.)  Don't overmix; the dough should feel slightly sticky.  Shape the dough into a 6-inch log.  Wrap it in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.

Heat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut the chilled dough into six equal pieces.  Roll each piece into a round about 1/8-inch thick.  Prick the rounds all over with a fork and gently fit them into 4-inch tartlet pans, trimming any excess dough.

Line each tartlet with foil and fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake the tartlet shells for about 15 minutes.  Remove the pie weights and the foil and bake an additional 5 minutes until golden.  Cool on a rack.

For the Filling:  Combine the toasted nuts, coconut, and raisins with the warm Butterscotch Sauce.  Divide the filling among the six tartlet shells.  Bake until the filling at 400 degrees just starts to bubble, 7 to 9 minutes.

Using a wide spatula, carefully transfer the tartlets to a rack.  Allow the tartlets to cool for 5 minutes.  Carefully remove the tartlets from their pans and serve warm with a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream or creme fraiche, if you like.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

       Caramelized Onion, Walnut, And Goat Cheese Pizza With A Beer

Recipe By     :Jeanne Lemlin

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOPPING ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3             pounds  onions - (6 large) -- very thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped (not ground) walnuts
                        === BEER DOUGH ===
  3               cups  unbleached flour -- plus extra for dusti
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                can  beer - (12 oz)
                        = (beer such as Budweiser is fine)
                        Oil -- for greasing
  1 1/2           cups  crumbled soft goat cheese - (8 oz)
                        = (such as Montrachet)

Heat the oil in a large skillet or stockpot over medium heat.  Add the onions and a generous seasoning of salt and pepper.  Toss to coat well, then cover the pan.  Cook, tossing occasionally, until the onions are very soft and are caramel brown all over.

After the first 10 minutes or so of cooking, you will have to lower the heat to prevent sticking.  The onions need to be cooked slowly over low heat in order to caramelize properly; this will take about 45 minutes.  By cooking them covered, you can use less oil to achieve this.

Remove the cover from the pan, then add the walnuts.  Cook 5 minutes, tossing frequently.  Remove the onions from the heat and let cool.

To make the crust, preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl and mix thoroughly.  Pour in the beer and mix well.  The dough will be sticky.  Spread a handful of flour on your work surface and dump the dough onto it.  Toss the dough around to coat it with the flour and prevent it from sticking.  Knead it 2 or 3 times to make it pliable.  Shape the dough into a ball, then divide it in two.

Grease 2 baking sheets.  Use a rolling pin to roll each ball into an 11- or 12-inch circle.  Spread half the onion mixture onto each pizza.  Sprinkle the crumbled goat cheese all over each pizza.  I like to cook one pizza at a time, but you can cook the pizzas on 2 different oven racks and alternate them halfway through the cooking.  Bake 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown on top or underneath.

This recipe yields two 12-inch pizzas.

  1                     bay leaf
  2             ounces  butter
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1              large  sweet potato -- diced

                   Chard And Onion Omelet - {Trouchia}

Recipe By     :Deborah Madison
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Omelets


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  red onion -- quartered, and
                        thinly sliced crosswise
  1              bunch  chard, leaves only -- coarsely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     garlic clove
  6              large  eggs - (to 8) -- lightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped or torn basil leaves
  2          teaspoons  chopped thyme leaves
  1                cup  grated Gruyere cheese
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a 10-inch skillet.  Add the onion and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until completely soft but not browned, about 15 minutes.  Add the chard and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the moisture has cooked away and the chard is tender, about 15 minutes.  Season well with salt and freshly ground pepper.

Meanwhile, mash the garlic in a mortar with a few pinches of salt, then stir it into the eggs along with herbs.  Combine the chard-onion mixture with the eggs, stir in the Gruyere cheese and half the Parmesan.

Preheat the broiler.  Heat the remaining oil to the skillet and when it's hot, add the eggs.  Slide the pan back and forth a few times to make sure the eggs are not sticking.  Keep the heat at medium-high for about one minute, then turn it to low.  Cook until the eggs are set but still a quite moist on top.  Add the remaining cheese, slide the pan under the broiler and broil until browned.

Serve the trouchia in the pan or slide it onto a serving dish and cut into wedges.  The gratined top and the golden bottom are equally presentable.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  Idaho or russet potatoes
  24       tablespoons  butter - (4 sticks)
                        = (or duck fat)
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Peel the potatoes.  There should be about 4 1/2 pounds when peeled.  Drop the potatoes into cold water until ready to cook.  Bring enough water to boil to cover the potatoes when they are added.  Add salt to taste.  Add potatoes and cook 25 minutes, or until they are slightly undercooked.  They will cook later in the oven.

Meanwhile preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Drain the potatoes and put them in a large heavy skillet.  Sprinkle generously with pepper and add 16 tablespoons of butter.  Using a large heavy spoon, cut the potatoes haphazardly into chunks, each about 2 inches thick.  Let them cook 12 to 15 minutes, turning the pieces over so that they brown evenly.

Meanwhile, heat a large heavy skillet (preferably a 12-inch, number 10 black iron skillet) until it is hot and almost smoking.  Melt the remaining 8 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan and pour it into the skillet.  Add 1 tablespoon of the garlic and the potato mixture, mix together and then flatten it on top with a large heavy metal spoon.  Let cook moderately-high heat for three minutes.  Place the skillet in the oven and bake 15 minutes.

Remove from the oven and pour off the free butter from around the sides, taking care not to let the potatoes fall form the skillet (this butter may be recycled and put to other uses, such as scrambling eggs).  Cover the skillet with a heat proof round dish, such as a pizza pan.  Invert the skillet onto the pan, allowing the potatoes to fall evenly on the pan.

Place the pan in the oven and bake 15 minutes longer.  Pour off any free-flowing butter from the pan.  Carefully slide the pie from the pizza pan or other pan onto a round serving dish.  Sprinkle the garlic into a circle in the center of the pie, garnish around the circle of garlic with an outer circle of chopped parsley.  Serve with the perfect roasted chicken, T-bone or roasted lobster.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  10       tablespoons  corn, peanut or vegetable oil
  1              large  fresh garlic head -- cut crosswise
                        through the center
  6             sprigs  fresh rosemary
                        = (or 1 tspn dried rosemary)
  12            sprigs  fresh thyme
                        = (or 1 tspn dried thyme)
  4          teaspoons  red wine vinegar -- plus
     1/4           cup  white wine
  2               cups  fresh or canned chicken broth
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter

To roast the garlic, preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Break the garlic into individual unpeeled cloves, season with salt and pepper and 1 teaspoon of olive oil.  Place the garlic in a heat-proof baking dish and place in the oven.  Bake 25 minutes and set aside.

Put chickens in a large bowl and add olive oil, corn oil, split head of garlic, rosemary and half the thyme sprigs.  Cover and refrigerate.  Let stand turning occasionally, for 24 hours.  When ready to cook, scrape the herbs from the chickens, season with salt and pepper.  It is not necessary to truss them.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Heat a heavy skillet large enough to hold the chickens in one layer without crowding, or use 2 skillets.  Place the chickens in the skillet(s) breast-side down.  Cook until the breasts are nicely browned, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Turn the chickens to the opposite side and then on their backs.  Brown each part of the chickens as they are turned.  Place the chickens in the oven and bake for 30 minutes.

Remove the chickens from the skillet and pour off the fat.  Add the wine and vinegar (if 2 skillets are used, use half the remaining ingredients for each skillet), the broth, the roasted garlic cloves, the remaining thyme sprigs tied in a bundle and salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to a boil and cook for about 2 minutes.  Swirl in the butter, stirring, and add any liquid that may flow from the inside of each chicken.

Carve the chickens and arrange on dinner plates.  Garnish each serving with thyme sprigs and roasted garlic cloves.  Spoon the sauce over and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

Comments:  For a wood smoke flavor to the roast chicken -- place a roasting pan on top of your stove burner.  Add 1 cup of apple wood chips and cover with a wire rack.  This must be done in a well ventilated area, or you can heat the pan on the stove and then bring it outside.  Heat the pan on the burner on high heat until the wood chips begin to smoke.  Place the chickens into the rack and cover with another pan (inverted) or aluminum foil.  Smoke for about 5 minutes then remove from pan and begin browning.  An old roasting pan should be used for this technique.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dark raisins
  1                cup  port wine
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  4                     chicken breasts
  2                     shallots -- diced
     1/4         pound  fresh mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  heavy cream or evaporated milk
     1/4      teaspoon  grated fresh nutmeg

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  Dutch cocoa
  2               cups  whole-wheat pastry flour
  2        tablespoons  baking powder
  2        tablespoons  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
  1                cup  maple syrup
  1                cup  corn oil
  6             ounces  tofu -- pressed dry
     3/4           cup  vanilla soy milk
  1         tablespoon  pure vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  orange juice
  1                cup  non-dairy grain-sweetened chocolate chips
                        === GLAZE ===
  1                cup  Dutch cocoa
  1                cup  maple syrup
     1/4           cup  corn oil
     1/4           cup  vanilla soymilk
  2        tablespoons  pure vanilla extract
                        === STRAWBERRY COULIS ===
  2               cups  fresh strawberries -- hulled
                        = (or 12-oz thawed frozen strawberries)
  2        tablespoons  maple syrup -- unless you have
                        freshly picked berries in season
  2        tablespoons  organic apple juice -- plus additional as
                        needed to thin sauce
  2          teaspoons  Grand Marnier
                        = (or your favorite orange liqueur)
                        Fresh strawberry slices -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a large bowl, sift cocoa, pastry flour, baking powder, baking soda, and sea salt.

In a blender, combine maple syrup, corn oil, tofu, soy milk, vanilla extract and orange juice.  Blend until the mixture achieves a smooth and even consistency.  Add the wet ingredients to the sifted dry ones.

Spoon the batter into oiled and floured star-shaped individual cake pans, filling them no more than 3/4 of the way full.  Place about 10 chocolate chips in the center of the batter in the mold to form a "gooey" center.  Bake the cakes for 15 to 18 minutes.

Glaze:  Sift the cocoa.  Whisk it together with maple syrup, corn oil and vanilla.  On a low flame, stirring constantly, heat for 3 to 5 minutes.  Refrigerate until glaze cools.

Strawberry Coulis:  In a food processor combine the strawberries, maple syrup, and apple juice.  Process until mixture is smooth, being careful not to over-process the berries or they will discolor.  Add more apple juice as necessary if sauce is too thick.

Strain mixture through a fine sieve into a nonreactive bowl.  Stir in the liqueur.  This coulis will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.  (Makes 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 8 individual cakes.

                             Christmas Bombe

Recipe By     :Alice Medrich
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  fresh cranberries
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  raspberry preserves
                        Hot Milk Sponge Sheet -- (see recipe)
                        White Chocolate Mousse with Kirsch -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  strained apricot preserves
  2        tablespoons  minced unsalted pistaschios - (to 3)

Special Equipment:  You will need one 6-cup bombe mold or bowl with similar capacity (the one I use is 7 1/4 inches in diameter and 3 1/2 inches deep) and one 7-inch round corregated cake circle.

Make Cranberry-Raspberry Puree:  Rinse and pick over cranberries and combine with sugar in small nonreactive saucepan.  Cover and bring to simmer over medium heat.  Uncover, raise heat and stir occasionally.  Cook only a few minutes or until about three-fourths of the berries are burst, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Press mixture through a medium-fine strainer or food mill along with the raspberry preserves.  Discard tough dry pulp and raspberry seeds.  Cool the puree completely before using.  Puree may be made and refrigerated up to 1 week in advance.

Assemble and Freeze the Jelly Roll:  Reverse the Hot Milk Sponge Sheet onto a piece of foil; peel off the parchment.  Turn sponge carefully over again (use a cookie sheet to aid you if sponge is delicate) so that brown side faces up.  Spread all of Cranberry-Raspberry Puree evenly over sponge.  Roll up as tightly as possible to form a 16- by 17-inch long thin jelly roll.  Wrap tightly in foil and freeze at least several hours or overnight -- or up to 1 month in advance of using.

Line the Bombe with Jelly Roll Slices:  Remove frozen jelly roll from freezer and unwrap.  Trim ragged ends if necessary.  Use a sharp serrated knife to cut slices 1/4-inch thick.  Line the mold with the slices by placing one slice in the center of the bottom of the mold.  Next fit 7 (or more) slices around the center pushing and fitting so that no space is left between the slices.  Fit the next 9 (or more) around the bowl starting up the sides.

Finish by fitting about 10 slices to completely line the mold, pushing and fitting so that no space is left.  Trim slices even with the rim of mold if necessary, or just push them so they are flush with the rim.  Reserve trimmings and remaining slices and return them to freezer until needed.  Set lined mold aside.

Fill the Mold:  Make the White Chocolate Mousse with Kirsch.  Turn it immediately into the lined mold.  Level and smooth the surface of the mousse.  Remove the remaining slices of jelly roll and trimmings from the freezer.  Set aside just enough slices to completely cover the mousse if placed tightly together -- but do not put them in place, yet.

Dice the remaining slices and any trimmings with a sharp knife.  Scatter the diced pieces all over the mousse, and then fit the reserved slices closely together over the scattered dice to form the bottom layer of the dessert.

Place the corregated cake circle (or a small plate) inside the mold and press firmly to level and compact the bombe.  Wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours before unmolding and serving.  Bombe may be completed to this point up the 24 hours in advance of serving, or frozen up to 2 months.

Unmold, Finish and Serve:  Invert the mold and rap the edge sharply on counter to release dessert.  Simmer strained apricot preserves in a small saucepan for 2 to 3 minutes to make a glaze.  Use a pastry brush to paint the entire dessert with glaze.  Touch bottom edge of bombe with minced pistachios.  Refrigerate until serving.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

                    Clear Tomato Soup With Herb Crepes

Recipe By     :Hans Rockenwagner
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  instant-blending flour
     1/3           cup  milk
     1/3           cup  cold water
  1              large  egg
  1              large  egg white
  1              pinch  salt
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped chives
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped parsley
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh tarragon
  3        tablespoons  clarified butter
  6             pounds  vine-ripened plum tomatoes -- quartered
  7                     egg whites -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

In a blender, combine the flour, milk, water, egg, egg white, and salt and blend until smooth.  Pour into a measuring cup with a lip and stir in the herbs.  Cover and leave to rest for 10 minutes.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of the clarified butter.  Pour about 1/4 cup of the crepe batter into the pan and tilt it in all directions so that it forms a thin coating, then quickly pour out any excess.  Cook until the bottom of the crepe is lightly browned, lifting up the edges to check, then flip over and cook for 15 to 20 seconds more.

Remove from the pan, add little more butter, and make the next crepe the same way.  Continue until you have used all the batter.  Pile the crepes up, roll them into a tube, and thinly slice them crosswise into a julienne.  Set aside until ready to serve.

In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, puree the tomatoes for 3 to 4 minutes, pulsing on and off and scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary until the puree is very smooth and watery.

Pour the puree into a large saucepan, add the egg whites and the salt and whisk together.  Slowly bring the liquid to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking constantly so that the liquid doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot.  When the liquid comes to a boil, reduce the heat to very low, so that it just barely simmers, and allow to cook completely undisturbed for 5 minutes.

Line a sieve with a double-thickness of slightly dampened cheesecloth.  Without disturbing the crust of egg white which has formed, slowly pour the soup through the sieve into a clean pan (all the skin and impurities will be left behind, with the egg whites, in the sieve).  Drain in the sieve for 15 minutes, then gently reheat just before serving.

Add pepper to taste and serve in warmed bowls, each one garnished with a little jumble of the slivered herb crepes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1         tablespoon  fresh garlic

Remove a small amount of soup and place it in a bowl, add the miso and stir until dissolved.  Stir in the miso mixture back into the soup add cinnamon and vanilla and simmer for 3 minutes.   Puree soup in a blender.  Swirl parsnip soup with squash soup and top with gremolata.

               Crisp Duck With Whipped Taro And Taro Chips

Recipe By     :Executive Chef, Susan Regis
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Long Island ducks - (4 lbs ea)
  3        tablespoons  ginger
  6                     garlic cloves
  1              quart  Kikkoman soy sauce
  1                cup  sherry
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  1 1/2            cup  julienned scallions -- or more
                        Whipped Taro Root And Taro Chips -- (see recipe)
                        Duck Jus -- (see below)

Separate legs from the breast by cutting where the breast and carcass end and legs begin, or have your butcher cut it for you.  Using a sharp boning knife, follow right along the breast bone on either side and remove both breasts.  Trim fat along outside of the breast allowing approximately one-third of an inch of fat overlap.  Score fat on breast by making a diagonal cut, making sure not to cut the breast meat.  About four strokes is sufficient.

In a food processor, dice unpeeled ginger and garlic until coarsely chopped.  Place in a stainless steel bowl.  Add remaining ingredients.  Place the two whole duck legs and the four duck breasts in the marinade.  Remove the duck breasts after one hour.  The legs should continue to marinate for an additional half an hour, and then be removed.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Using the carcasses of the duck, place the duck legs on the duck carcass.  Place legs and carcasses in a roasting pan and roast for 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours.  Check periodically to make sure the ducks are not getting too dark.  They are ready when the leg wiggles freely to your touch, and they are a nice deep amber color.  The skin should look crisp and rendered of fat.  Cool.

Once cooled, take your boning knife and cut through the skin right in the middle of the legs.  Using your hands, separate duck legs.  (Use your thumb to get under the oyster and gently pull leg from the bones.)  Gently use your fingers to pull out the thigh bone.  Trim legs a little to keep a nice triangular shape.

For the breasts:  Heat a large, 12-inch saute pan to medium-high.  (You can cook two duck breasts in one pan or cook one at a time in a smaller, 10-inch pan.)  Add two breasts, skin-side down to start rendering the fat.  Cook over medium-high heat for a couple of minutes.  (You will need to remove the rendered fat as you go.  Hold duck breast still with a pair of tongs and pour fat into a stainless bowl or other container.  Return to heat).

After the first couple of minutes on medium-high heat, turn burner down to medium, so not to burn the duck.  The duck should be a rich amber color.  Continue cooking until the fat is almost completely rendered.  You can check this by looking at the incisions of the fat.  When there is only a thin, crisp skin, the duck is ready to be flipped.  Turn duck over.  Shut heat off and leave the breast to sit in the pan for about three to four minutes.  Remove from pan and allow to rest for five minutes.

Meanwhile, place the duck legs in a medium to medium-small saute pan, skin-side down and return the pan, covered, to heat and finish any additional rendering of fat, approximately five minutes.

Slice duck breast into fairly thin slices, keeping the nice shape of the breast.  With a spatula, pick up breast and fan it out onto the plate.  Place duck legs on an angle near the top of the slices.  Serve with Whipped Taro Root, Taro Chips, lots of julienned scallions, and a little Duck Jus.

For the Duck Jus:  In a heavy-bottomed sauce pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil.  Add one chopped, roasted duck body, 1 leek, roughly chopped, one stalk of celery and one carrot, cut into half-inch pieces.  Cook until vegetables are golden.  Add a cup of white wine and two cups of chicken stock and reduce by half.  Add one half cup of soy marinade, cooking an additional few minutes.  Skim off any fat and strain.  (Makes enough for 4 servings of duck)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  heavy cream
  4             ounces  chocolate
  1           teaspoon  kirsch
  7                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine the cream, chopped chocolate and kirsch in the top of a double boiler and heat, stirring, until the chocolate is melted and the ingredients are well blended.

In a medium bowl, combine the egg yolks and sugar and whisk until combined (do not whisk vigorously; the mixture should not be frothy).

Pour a little of the hot chocolate mixture into the eggs and stir well, then add the rest and stir to combine.  Strain through a fine sieve into 8 four-ounce ramekins set in a water bath.  Lay a sheet of buttered waxed paper on top of the ramekins.

Bake the custards in the preheated oven until they are no longer liquid but still slightly wobbly in the center, 20 to 25 minutes.  Cool before serving.

This recipe yields 8 four-ounce servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  cocoa powder
  1 1/2           cups  cake flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  8                     eggs -- separated
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === BERRY FILLING ===
  1 1/2          pints  fresh berries
                        = (strawberries or raspberries)
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/8           cup  water
                        === BERRY-WHITE CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
     1/2         pound  white chocolate
     1/2           cup  water
  5                     berries of choice
                        = (strawberries or raspberries)
                        === GANACHE FOR GLAZING CAKE ===
  4                     egg yolks
  4             ounces  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1              pound  dark chocolate -- plus
  12            ounces  dark chocolate
     1/2         quart  heavy cream
                        === CHOCOLATE GARNISH WINGS ===
  4             ounces  dark chocolate
                        = (can use baker's chocolate)

Mix all dry ingredients together in a bowl with a whisk.  In a mixer or by hand, in a separate bowl whip egg whites to soft peaks.  Add 1/2 cup of sugar to egg whites and mix until stiff peaks form.

In another bowl whisk yolks, vanilla extract and 1 cup of sugar to a ribbon stage.  Add a small amount of dry ingredients to the yolk mixture and alternate with a little of egg whites.  Using a rubber spatula, continue folding until all ingredients are combined.

Bake at 375 degrees on a greased half sheet tray or a cookie sheet lined with parchment and greased again.  Bake approximately 12 to 14 minutes or until springy and toothpick is almost dry.  Do not overcook.

For the Berry Filling:  In a blender combine above ingredients for approximately 1 minute or until smooth.  Reserve as filling.

For the Berry-White Chocolate Sauce:  Over a double boiler melt white chocolate.  Add water and mix until no lumps remain.  Roughly chop berries and add to sauce.  Reserve.

For Ganache For Glazing Cake:  Whip egg yolks, sugar and vanilla until lightly fluffy.  Cut chocolate into small pieces, place in sauce pan and add the cream.  Heat to approximately 150 degrees, stirring constantly.  Stir hot cream mixture into the egg yolks and continue stirring for 1 minute to assure that sugar is melted.  Keep warm and ready for glazing.

For the Chocolate Garnish Wings:  Melt over a double boiler and place into a piping bag or a parchment cone.  On a separate sheet of parchment paper pipe out wings freehand or draw with a stencil to trace.  Place in freezer so they set up.  Reserve for garnish.

To Assemble Cake:  Take cake and cut into two triangles then cut each in half laterally.  On bottom half, ladle Berry Filling and evenly distribute.  Then apply Berry-White Chocolate Sauce.  You can, at this point, add fresh berry slices if desired.

Place top half back on top then place cake on a wire rack for glazing.

Using warm Ganache ladle glaze on top of cake and allow to run down sides.  If ganache is thin add another coat.

Place in refrigerator until glaze is solid.  Take a whisk and splatter white chocolate sauce on top and decorate with more berries.  With wings, they can garnish entire cake or you can use smaller wings to garnish each individual serving.

       Flatbread With Broccoli Rabe - {Piadine Con Broccoli Di Rape

Recipe By     :David Ruggerio
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  1                cup  warm water
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === FILLING ===
  2             pounds  broccoli rabe -- washed, and
                        trimmed of any tough stems
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        sliced very thin
     1/8      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
                        Coarse salt -- to taste

To make the dough, sift the flour, salt, and baking powder together.  Make a well in the center, add the water and oil to it and blend until the dough is smooth.  Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 1 minute.  Cover and allow it to sit for at least 30 minutes at room temperature.

Cut the broccoli rabe into 2-inch pieces and blanch in a large pot of boiling salted water for 4 minutes or until tender.  Drain well in a colander.

Place the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high and saute the garlic until golden.  Add the broccoli rabe, red pepper flakes, and salt to taste.  Saute for another 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove all ingredients from the pan and allow to come to room temperature.

Divide the dough into eight equal portions, then roll them out on a lightly floured surface into 8-inch rounds.  Warm a skillet over high heat until a drop of water evaporates immediately upon hitting the surface.  Place the pieces of dough in the skillet, dry, cooking one side until they become firm and golden, which should take less than a minute.  Flip them over, cook the other side, then transfer to a plate or cutting board or just fill it in the pan, fold it over and then remove to a plate to serve hot.

While the piadine are still hot, place the broccoli mixture in the center of them, fold them over to form half-moon shapes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Place the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high and saute the garlic until golden.  Add the broccoli rabe, red pepper flakes, and salt to taste.  Saute for another 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove all ingredients from the pan and allow to come to room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the dough into eight equal portions, then roll them out on a lightly floured surface into 8-inch rounds.  Warm a skillet over high heat until a drop of water evaporates immediately upon hitting the surface.  Place the pieces of dough in the skillet, dry, cooking one side until they become firm and golden, which should take less than a minute.  Flip them over, cook the other side, then transfer to a plate or cutting board or just fill it in the pan, fold it over and then remove to a plate to serve hot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the piadine are still hot, place the broccoli mixture in the center of them, fold them over to form half-moon shapes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  2               cups  frozen raspberries (IQF) -- thawed
  2          teaspoons  butter -- for ramekins
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- for ramekins
  2             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  1              ounce  unsweetened chocolate -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  whole milk
  3              large  egg whites
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2              large  egg yolks

Whip the cream in a chilled bowl until semi-stiff.  Add confectioners' sugar and whip until stiff.  Refrigerate.  Puree raspberries in a food processor, then pass them through a sieve; fold this into the whipped cream and reserve until later.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Butter 4 1/2-cup capacity ramekins and lightly dust the insides with sugar; set aside.

In a small saucepan, combine the semisweet and unsweetened chocolates with the milk.  Melt over low heat, stirring constantly.  The minute the chocolates are melted, remove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the melted chocolate to a small bowl and cool to room temperature.

Whip the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are soft.  Add the granulated sugar and whip until stiff but not dry.  Whisk the yolks into the cooled melted chocolate.  Fold 1/4 of the whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it, then fold the lightened chocolate mixture back int the egg whites.  Spoon the mixture into the ramekins and bake for 10 to 12 minutes.  The souffles should remain moist in the center.

To serve, bring the souffles to the table and serve raspberry cream on the side.  Each diner should break the souffle open with a spoon and add raspberry cream in the center.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  diced onions
     1/2           cup  grated carrots
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  cumin
  1           teaspoon  celery seed
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
     1/2           cup  walnuts
  1 1/2           cups  cooked garbanzo beans
                        = (or one 15 1/2-oz can, drained)
  5        tablespoons  gluten flour
  2        tablespoons  arrowroot powder
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley
                        Oil -- for frying
                        Tehina Onion Sauce -- (see recipe)

Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and saute the onions, carrots, garlic, cumin, celery seed, and salt over medium heat until the onions are transparent.

In a food processor, combine the nuts, and blend until 1/2 are a coarse meal and the other are just cracked.  Place in a large mixing bowl and add the sauteed vegetable mixture.

Add the garbanzo beans in the processor and process the same way as the nuts.  Add flour and arrowroot.  Add the beans and parsley to the mixing bowl.  Mix everything together well until the mixture has enough body to form a patty.  If the mixture is too dry or crumbly, add a small amount of water to help the mixture bind.

Form the mixture into 4 burgers.  Lightly oil the frying pan and fry the burgers over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes on each side until lightly browned.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        through a coffee filter
                        === FISH SAUCE ===
  2                     haddock carcasses
  1              small  halibut bone
  1                     leek -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1                     celery stalk -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3                     parsley sprigs
  6                     peppercorns
  3        tablespoons  grapeseed oil or olive oil
  1                cup  white wine
  3               cups  water - (approximately)
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
  8        tablespoons  whole butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Spritz of lemon

In a large 12-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat.  Salt and pepper both sides of the fish.  Sprinkle the mustard seeds evenly on the skin side of the fish.  Dust skin of each filet with a scant amount of flour.  Saute the fish, skin-side down, until golden brown.  Flip the fish over adding more oil as necessary.  Remove from the heat.

Paint the skin with a smear of Dijon mustard.  Sprinkle each fillet with one tablespoon of fresh bread crumbs and one tablespoon of whole butter.  Set fish on a small sheet pan.  Preheat broiler.  Place the fish under the broiler until the crumbs are nice and brown and the fish is cooked just through.  Spritz with lemon.

Place the fillet of fish on a plate.  Serve with a piece of Tender Bacon and a spoon of the braising liquid.  A spoon of the Chutney goes well on the bacon.  Spoon a couple tablespoons of the Fish Sauce and some All English, All American frites (french fries, gaufrettes, etc.).

For the Tender Bacon:  Generously salt the fresh bacon.  In a heavy bottom saucepan, cook the sugar and one cup of water over medium-high heat.  Cook the sugar until it becomes an amber, caramel color.  Add the fish sauce and remaining water.  In a small roasting pan, place the bacon and caramelized liquid.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake in a moderate oven (325 to 350 degrees) for approximately 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  The bacon should be tender when a knife is inserted.  Allow the bacon to cool, then slice it into 1/3-inch slices.  The bacon should be heated in the liquid (braising) when ready to serve.

For the Chutney:  Combine all ingredients.  Cook over medium heat for approximately 40 minutes.  (Makes 3 to 4 cups -- will keep in the refrigerator for several weeks)

For the Fish Sauce:  In a large saucepan, place all the fish bones, leeks, celery, parsley and peppercorns.  Sweat together in oil for three to four minutes.  Deglaze with white wine.  Add enough water just to cover bones, approximately three cups.  Simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, then strain.  In a one quart saucepan, heat the stock and reduce to one cup of liquid.  Add the heavy cream, and reduce by 1/3.  Whisk in the butter.  Season with salt and pepper to taste and a spritz of lemon.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === MOUSSE ===
  1                     chicken breast - (3 oz)
  1                     egg yolk
  1              whole  egg
     1/4           cup  heavy cream

Prepare the Watercress:  Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil.  Submerge the watercress into the water.  Cook until tender about 2 minutes.  Drain.  Place into a food processor and puree until smooth adding cream, salt and pepper.  Keep the mixture warm until ready to use.

Prepare Carrots: Peel carrots and cut into strips 1/8-inch wide by 6-inch long.  Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil.  Submerge carrots into the water.  Cook until tender, about 2 minutes.  Drain.  Put into a small saucepan with the butter.  Season with salt and pepper.  Hold warm until ready to use.

Make the Sauce:  Heat veal stock in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil and add the heavy cream and butter.  Keep warm until ready to use.

Assemble the dish:  Remove veal from steamer.  Unwrap and place in the middle of a serving plate.  Place a spoonful of watercress puree on top of the veal fillet.  Place a bunch of spaghetti of carrots on top of the watercress.  Drizzle plate with sauce.

This recipe yields 4 main course servings.

Optional accompaniment:  Shredded potato pancake, sauteed wild mushrooms, roasted garlic or roasted shallots.

For the Cornmeal Blini:  Sift cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and sea salt in a medium bowl.  In a small bowl beat together corn oil, maple syrup, soymilk, water and vinegar.  Combine the wet and dry ingredients.  Stir in parsley.

Heat a skillet and add a 1/2 teaspoon corn oil.  Drop batter by scant tablespoons onto heated skillet.  Carefully turn blini after about a minute.  Lower heat and flip blini to cook only about 45 seconds on that side.

To serve blini with Hiziki Caviar:  Place a teaspoon of caviar on top of each blini and garnish with chives or parsley

This recipe yields 2 1/2 dozen blini.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  butter or margarine - (1 stick)
     1/2           cup  minced yellow onion
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
     1/2           cup  mild honey
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  curry powder - (rounded)
  2        tablespoons  peach or mango chutney
  1              small  handful dried currants or
                        chopped dark raisins
  2                     roasting chickens - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs ea)

Special Equipment:  One or 2 shallow baking sheets with 1-inch rims.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  sweet butter -- cut small pieces
     3/4           cup  sifted cake flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3                     egg yolks -- room temperature

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line bottom of 12- by 16-inch or 11- by 17-inch jelly roll or half sheet pan with waxed or parchment paper so that the paper overhangs the pan at two opposite ends.

Heat milk with butter in small saucepan over medium heat until butter melts.  Reduce heat to low and keep hot but do not simmer.

Sift flour with baking powder twice.  Return to sifter and set aside.

In a large heatproof bowl, use a hand-held whisk to combine sugar, eggs and yolks.  Set bowl over or in a pan of barely simmering water.  Warm the mixture, whisking occasionally, until it is lukewarm to the touch.  (Alternatively, omit the water bath and hold the bowl directly over the stove burner, whisking vigorously for about a minute until the eggs are warm.  This is the quickest, easiest method but you must whisk the eggs continuously to keep them from starting to scramble).

Transfer bowl to electric mixer; beat at high speed until mixture has cooled, tripled in volume and has the consistency of thick whipped cream.  Sift one-third of flour mixture over batter and fold it gently, by hand, using the largest rubber spatula you have.  Fold in half the remaining flour; then fold in the remaining flour.  Pour hot milk and butter into batter and fold well, scraping the bottom each time and bringing the batter up the sides of the bowl until you can no longer see traces of liquid.

Transfer batter into prepared pan and spread evenly.  Bake until cake is browned, starts to shrink from the sides of pan, and springs back when lightly pressed; about 10 minutes.  Cool cake in pan, on a rack.  When cake is cool, run a small knife or spatula around the edges to release before unmolding.  Cool completely before filling.

This recipe yields one sponge sheet.

                        = (or use a combination of both peppers)
  2               cups  long grain white rice
                        = (preferably Basmati or Texmati rice)
  4               cups  rich well-seasoned chicken stock
                        = (or "doctored" canned broth)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  additional butter or margarine -- (optional)

* Note:  One large (12 to 16 ounces) drained can or 1 (10 ounce) box frozen corn may be substituted.  Do not thaw before using.

If using fresh corn:  After removing the husks and silk, cut the kernels from the cobs using a sharp knife (being careful not to cut into the cob itself).  Place the kernels into a bowl and using the knife, scrape up and down the shaft of the cob (over the bowl of corn) extracting the natural "corn cream".  If using canned or frozen corn, simply begin with the next step.

To saute the vegetables:  Melt the butter (or heat the oil) in a 2 1/2-quart heavy bottomed sauce pot (one that comes with a tight fitting lid).  When hot, add the onions and garlic and saute for 3 minutes.  Add the green pepper and saute until all the vegetables are softened and very fragrant, about 5 minutes over meduim-low heat.

To toast the rice:  If using an "aromatic" rice, rinse it through a sieve (medium mesh) and drain well.  (If using long grain "converted" white rice, rinsing is neither necessary nor recommended.).  Add the rice and cook over medium heat, stirring to coat the rice with the butter and vegetables.  Cook for about 3 minutes or until the rice is dry and beginning to turn golden.

To simmer (see note):  Add the hot broth and return to a boil.  Stir in the corn (whether fresh, drained canned or frozen), and bring back to a boil.  Cover the pot and turn the heat to low.  Simmer over a low flame for exactly 17 minutes without lifting the lid.

Note:  If your stove is electric, you won't have the same control when regulating the heat source.  To help rectify this, while your rice mixture is coming to a boil, heat another burner to low.  This way, as soon as you cover the pot, you can quickly adjust the temperature by switching the pot to the other burner.

To "settle" and serve:  Uncover and add a good amount of fresh pepper and some salt to taste.  If desired, stir in 1 tablespoon of additional butter or margarine.  Fluff with a fork, and cover the pot.  Allow the rice to settle for 3 to 5 minutes to absorb any excess moisture.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

       Madame E's Simply Steamed Sea Bass With Ginger And Pickled P

Recipe By     :Susan Regis
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     portions skin-on Chilean sea bass - (6 oz  -- cut into squares
  8             ounces  fresh shrimp - (U16) -- heads on preferably
  2        tablespoons  thinly-julienned peeled ginger
  2                     vine-ripe tomatoes -- quartered
                        = (or other ripe varietals)
  1                cup  picked cilantro sprigs
  1                jar  umeboshi pickled plums
  1         tablespoon  Kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  freshly-cracked white pepper
                        Steamed Rice -- (see recipe)

Have your fishmonger cut the bass into nice, thick squares.  With a sharp French knife or boning knife, score the skin side of the fish in a one-inch diagonal pattern.

The best equipment for steaming this fish is a wok and a large bamboo steamer.  Shallow, heat resilient ceramic bowls that fit inside the steamer are perfect.  You may have to steam the fish in waves, or you can stack an additional steamer onto the original to create a layered steamer tower.  If you do not have heat resistant bowls to serve the fish in, any shallow stainless pan will work and then you just will have to transfer the fish into serving bowls.

Peel the shrimp, leaving heads intact.  Slice shrimp down the middle, beginning at the base of the head and continuing to the beginning of the tail.  Remove the vein.  Hold the shrimp by the tail and then pull the tail through the slit, going under so the tail stands upright.

For steaming in individual bowls:  Place one piece of lightly salted fish in the center of the bowl.  Combine in a stainless steel bowl, 3 to 4 cups of water, julienned ginger, tomato sections, cup of cilantro sprigs, and 4 to 5 umeboshi plums, seeds removed and lightly mashed between your fingers.  In each bowl, place two shrimp and ladle two pieces of tomato and about 6 to 8 cups of the liquid around the fish, making sure to get equal amounts of ginger and plum in the bowl.  Sprinkle cracked white pepper on top of the fish.

While you are preparing the bowls, set up wok with water and steamer(s).  Turn on heat, bringing it up to full steam.  Carefully place bowl(s) in steamer, then cover and cook till fish is done.  The cooking time will vary according to the thickness of the fish and the intensity of the steam.  An average piece of bass, approximately one-inch thick, will cook in approximately six to seven minutes.  Cautiously remove bowl(s) and garnish with fresh cilantro sprigs.  Serve with ample steamed rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Rachel Gitlin
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  extra-firm tofu
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  brown rice syrup
  2        tablespoons  brown rice vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  grated ginger
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame oil
                        === FILLING ===
  5            bunches  scallions -- sliced thinly
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame oil
  3        tablespoons  white miso
  1           teaspoon  mirin or white wine
  1           teaspoon  rice or maple syrup
  10                    green scallion parts -- blanched
                        Nori sheets -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Slice tofu into 1/4-inch thick slices.  Places slices into a shallow baking dish with the above marinade ingredients.  Be sure to coat each slice of tofu well.  Marinate for at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour.

Place the tofu slices on a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake 30 minutes or until deep golden brown and crispy on the outside.  The marinade can be saved to use again.  Be sure to boil the marinade before each additional use.

Filling:  Heat the toasted sesame oil on a skillet and add the scallions.  Saute for 3 to 5 minutes on medium heat until they become soft and becoming translucent.  Turn the heat down to low and add the remaining ingredients except the blanched scallion greens) incorporating the scallions into the miso.  Heat through for 2 minutes, adding a little water if necessary.

Make "sandwiches" with the tofu slices, slathering one piece of tofu with the miso scallion mixture and placing another piece of tofu on top.  Cut the sandwiches in half for hors d'oeuvres size or leave whole for main course.  If desired, place a piece of nori on top of the tofu "sandwich".  Tie the piece together to form a package with the blanched scallion ribbons.

Serve at room temperature.

                Miniature Fried Pizzas - {Pizzelle Fritte}

Recipe By     :David Ruggerio
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  yeast
  3 1/4         pounds  bread flour
                        = (or all-purpose flour)
  1              quart  water -- (90 degrees)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  salt
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
     3/4           cup  shredded mozzarella
     3/4           cup  mild Gorgonzola in small pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

For the Pizza Dough:  Mix 1 tablespoon of the water, the sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon of the yeast into a small bowl.  Place one-third of the flour in the mixing bowl of a mixer with the hook attachment.  Add the warm water, olive oil, dissolved yeast, egg, and salt and mix for 5 minutes on low speed.  Fold in another third of the flour and continue to mix for another 5 minutes on slow speed.  Add the remaining flour and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon of dry yeast, increase the speed to medium, and continue to mix for an additional 5 minutes.  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Divide the dough into six 7-inch circles, approximately 4 ounces each.  Rub your hands with a little oil so the dough won't stick to your fingers.  Place the dough on a lightly oiled cookie sheet, cover well with plastic wrap, and let them rest in a warm place for another 3 hours.  (The dough can be wrapped in individual-pizza portions and refrigerated for up to 5 days, or it can be frozen.)

To Assemble:   Thoroughly mix the two cheese together in a bowl.  Divide the dough into 12 even spherical portions.  Roll each ball into a 4-inch circle, about 1/16-inch thick.  Place a spoonful of the cheeses in the center of each piece of dough, then fold one edge over to form a half-moon shape.  Pinch the edges to seal them and prevent the cheese from seeping out during cooking.

Place the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot.  Test the oil to determine whether it's ready for frying by dropping a small piece of dough into the pot.  If the piece floats right away with bubbles all around it then the oil is ready.  Fry the pizzelle until golden brown on both sides.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12              cups  mixed greens
                        = (such as kale, chard, beet, or escarole)
                        Salt -- to taste
  3              large  garlic cloves
  1                cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  1                cup  finely-chopped cilantro
  2          teaspoons  hot or sweet paprika
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  3        tablespoons  fruity olive oil
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Green or oil-cured Moroccan olives
                        Lemon wedges
                        Tomato wedges -- (optional)

Discard any inedible parts of the greens, such as kale stems and tough ribs.  Plunge the leaves into boiling salted water and cook until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.  Drain, then chop into small pieces.

Pound the garlic with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a mortar until you have a rough paste, then work in the parsley and cilantro and pound them briefly to release their flavors.  Add the paprika and cumin.  (If you do not have a mortar and pestle, chop the garlic with the parsley and cilantro, then add the spices.)

Warm the oil in a wide skillet over medium heat with the garlic-herb mixture.  As soon as it releases its flavor, when the oil has heated, add the greens.  Cook, stirring frequently, until any extra moisture has evaporated.  Taste for salt.  Pile into a dish and garnish with the olives, lemon, and tomato wedges.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SEMOLINA DOUGH ===
  1 1/4           cups  warm water -- divided
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1             packet  active dry yeast - (2 1/4 tspns)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  unbleached flour
  1                cup  semolina
                        === TOPPING ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3             medium  onions -- halved, sliced thin
  1 1/2         pounds  mixed mushrooms -- very thinly sliced
                        = (such as shiitake, portobellos,
                        button, and oyster)
  2                     thyme sprigs -- leaves removed,
                        stems discarded
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper - (generous)
                        Oil or cornmeal -- for baking pizzas
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  4 1/2           cups  grated Fontina cheese

To make the dough, place 1/4 cup of the warm water in a small bowl.  Stir in the sugar until dissolved, then sprinkle the yeast onto the surface of the water.  Let the yeast sit undisturbed for 1 minute, then stir it into the water until blended.  Let the yeast "proof" for 10 minutes; it should become bubbly because of the presence of sugar.  If it doesn't bubble, it is outdated and inactive.

Pour the yeast mixture into a large bowl.  Mix in the remaining cup of water, the olive oil, and salt.  Add the flour and semolina and stir with a wooden spoon until a ball of dough forms.  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10 minutes, flouring the work surface as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking.

Lightly oil a large ceramic or glass bowl.  Place the dough inside, then flip it over so the oiled side is on top.  Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise until double in bulk, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Meanwhile make the topping.  Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat and add the onions.  Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are golden brown all over, about 20 minutes.  Mix in the mushrooms and cook until they are brown and juicy, about 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and season the mushrooms with the thyme, salt, and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  If you are using a pizza stone heat it at least 45 minutes before cooking the pizza on it.

Punch down the dough and dump it onto your work surface.  Divide it into 3 portions.  Lightly flour the work surface, then with a rolling pin, roll one portion of the dough into an 11-inch circle.  If you are using a pizza stone, then sprinkle some cornmeal onto a pizza peel and place the disk of dough on it; otherwise, lightly grease a baking sheet and place the dough on that.

Spread 1/3 of the sour cream all over the dough.  Sprinkle on 1/3 of the fontina cheese, then scatter 1/3 of the mushroom mixture all over the pizza.  Bake 8 to 10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown underneath.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

This recipe yields three 11-inch pizzas.

Comments:  This recipe makes three 11-inch pizzas.

To make the dough, place 1/4 cup of the warm water in a small bowl.  Stir in the sugar until dissolved, then sprinkle the yeast onto the surface of the water.  Let the yeast sit undisturbed for 1 minute, then stir it into the water until blended.  Let the yeast &quot;proof&quot; for 10 minutes; it should become bubbly because of the presence of sugar.  If it doesn&apos;t bubble, it is outdated and inactive.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the yeast mixture into a large bowl.  Mix in the remaining cup of water, the olive oil, and salt.  Add the flour and semolina and stir with a wooden spoon until a ball of dough forms.  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10 minutes, flouring the work surface as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly oil a large ceramic or glass bowl.  Place the dough inside, then flip it over so the oiled side is on top.  Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise until double in bulk, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile make the topping.  Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat and add the onions.  Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are golden brown all over, about 20 minutes.  Mix in the mushrooms and cook until they are brown and juicy, about 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and season the mushrooms with the thyme, salt, and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  If you are using a pizza stone heat it at least 45 minutes before cooking the pizza on it.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Punch down the dough and dump it onto your work surface.  Divide it into 3 portions.  Lightly flour the work surface, then with a rolling pin, roll one portion of the dough into an 11-inch circle.  If you are using a pizza stone, then sprinkle some cornmeal onto a pizza peel and place the disk of dough on it; otherwise, lightly grease a baking sheet and place the dough on that.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread 1/3 of the sour cream all over the dough.  Sprinkle on 1/3 of the fontina cheese, then scatter 1/3 of the mushroom mixture all over the pizza.  Bake 8 to 10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown underneath.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7             ounces  almond paste - (to 8)
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- very soft
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  orange liqueur
                        = (such as Grand Marnier or triple sec)
                        Grated zest 1 orange
                        = (or 1/2 tspn orange extract)
  5              large  eggs -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  cake flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Butter and flour a 9-inch springform pan and set it aside.

Break up the almond paste and place it in the container of a food processor.  Process for a few seconds until it is grainy, like the texture of cracked wheat.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar together until very fluffy, at least 3 minutes.  Add the almond paste, orange liqueur, and orange zest.  Beat until perfectly blended, another 2 minutes or so.

One by one, beat in the eggs until the mixture is very smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes.  Sprinkle on the flour and baking powder and beat just until combined, 30 seconds or so.

Scrape the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake 55 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, and the sides of the cake have begun to shrink away from the pan.  Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.  (The cake might sink a little in the center.)

Remove the outer ring of the pan.  Place a plate over the cake and invert it.  Remove the bottom of the pan.  Invert again onto a wire rack and cool the cake completely.  Serve dusted with confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FRUIT ===
  10             large  firm ripe peaches -- skins removed
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  lemon zest
                        === BISCUITS ===
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/4      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  cold unsalted butter -- cut into cubes
     1/2           cup  buttermilk or heavy cream
                        Heavy cream -- for glazing
                        === ALMOND TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped whole unblanched almonds
  3        tablespoons  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon

For Cobbler:  In food processor, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Pulse to combine.  Add cold butter and pulse until mixture is crumbly.  Drizzle most of buttermilk/cream over flour mixture, pulse to combine.  If mixture seems dry, add a little more.  Dough should be just moist.

Gather the dough and spread out onto lightly floured parchment or waxed paper.  Pat into a disc a little less than 1/2-inch thick; chill for 1/2 hour.

For Fruit:  Slice peaches into wedges, toss with lemon juice.  In a small bowl, combine cornstarch, spices, pinch of salt and lemon zest.  Toss with the peaches and pour unto lightly greased 8-inch baking dish.

To assemble:  On a lightly floured surface, using a fluted cutter or any shaped cutter, cut out biscuits gently re-rolling scraps. Arrange biscuits over fruit, slightly overlapping.  Brush biscuits with cream.

In a small bowl, combine almonds, brown sugar and cinnamon.  Sprinkle over dough.  Place in the oven and cook until fruit is bubbling, biscuits are golden, and a skewer poked into the center of the biscuit dough comes out clean.  Serve warm with ice cream, heavy cream or creme anglaise.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7             ounces  ricotta salata - (1 whole piece)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         small  onion -- peeled, chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  3 1/2         pounds  ripe Italian plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
     1/4           cup  fresh basil leaves -- julienned
  4              small  eggplants
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  penne pasta

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Toast the ricotta on a baking sheet until golden on all sides, about 15 minutes.  Allow the cheese to cool, then grate it on a large hole grater and set aside.

To make the sauce, place 3 tablespoons of the extra virgin olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and saute the onion for 4 minutes or until soft.  Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and saute for 3 more minutes.  Add the tomatoes and allow to simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.  Puree the sauce, stir in the basil and reserve.

Trim the bottoms and tops off the eggplants then cut them lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices.  Lightly salt the eggplant and place it in a colander with a bowl on top to press it down.  Allow to stand for 30 minutes.

Place pure olive oil to a depth of 1/4-inch in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.  Fry the eggplant until golden brown on both sides, turning once.  Drain well on paper towels and season with fresh pepper.

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Cook the penne al dente.  Drain the pasta well, toss it with three-fourths of the sauce and half the cheese.

Place a layer of the pasta in a 9- by 13-inch baking dish, covering it with a layer of fried eggplant.  Layer the remaining pasta on top and then the remaining eggplant on top of that.  Sprinkle the eggplant with the remaining cheese, drizzle with the remaining sauce and one tablespoon of olive oil.  Bake in the oven for 5 minutes, then serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless pork shoulder or leg
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  coriander seeds
  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds
  2          teaspoons  mustard seeds
  10                    dry red chile peppers
  1           teaspoon  turmeric
     1/3           cup  coconut or red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
                        === FINISH THE DISH ===
  5        tablespoons  mustard oil or olive oil
  1                     cinnamon stick - (3" long)
  6                     whole cloves
  1                cup  finely-chopped onions
  1         tablespoon  grated or crushed fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  Goan palm sugar
                        = (or jaggery or maple syrup)
  1                cup  water
                        Coarse salt -- to taste

Trim all visible fat off the pork and cut into 1-inch cubes and place in a bowl.  Combine coriander, cumin, mustard, and chilies and grind into a fine powder and transfer into a measuring cup.  Add turmeric, vinegar, and garlic and mix.  Pour the marinade over the pork and rub well.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Add the cinnamon, cloves, and onions, and ginger.  Cook until the onions are very soft -- do not let them brown -- about 5 minutes.

Remove pork from the refrigerator and drain, reserving the liquid.  Add pork to the onion mixture and cook until the meat is lightly seared.  Add paprika, plam sugar, water, salt, and the reserved liquid and bring the contents to a boil.  Simmer pork for 1 1/2 hours or until very tender.  Serve vindaloo with plain or coconut rice.

                    Potato Pizza - {Pizza Del Lattaio}

Recipe By     :David Ruggerio
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  baking potatoes -- peeled
  1           teaspoon  dry yeast
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
  3             ounces  Asiago cheese -- cut 1/4" cubes
  3             ounces  Fontina cheese -- cut 1/4" cubes
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              sprig  rosemary, leaves only
  2             ounces  grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Cook the potatoes in lightly salted boiling water until they are easily pierced with a knife.  Drain them, mash a quarter of them into a bowl, cut the remainder into small cubes and reserve.

To make the dough, dissolve the yeast in 1 cup warm water.  Combine with 1/4 cup of the olive oil, salt, and the mashed potatoes.  Stir in the flour a little at a time, adding just enough to make a dough that does not stick to the sides of the bowl.  Knead the dough for 4 to 5 minutes until it reaches a smooth consistency.  Put it on a lightly floured surface and knead with your hands.  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl.  Wrap or cover with a damp towel and let it rest in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 45 minutes.

Roll the dough out into a large circle 1/8-inch thick and about 25 inches in diameter.  Place the dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet, sprinkle with the Asiago and Fontina, and top with the cubed potatoes.  Drizzle the remaining olive oil on top of the pizza, then sprinkle it with fresh pepper, rosemary, and Parmesan.  Cover again, and allow to rise in a warm place for 25 minutes.

Place in the oven and bake for about 35 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                  Ratatouille-Filled Herb Phyllo Crisps

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     box phyllo dough
  2             sticks  butter -- melted
  1              bunch  chives -- chopped
  1              bunch  parsley -- chopped
  1                     24-slot mini muffin pan
  1                     paint brush
                        === RATATOUILLE ===
  2              large  zucchini -- small diced
  1             medium  eggplant -- small diced
  2                     red peppers -- small diced
  1                     onion -- small diced
  1                     yellow squash -- small diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (16 oz) -- crushed, save juice
  1                cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  10            ounces  log of goat cheese

For the Ratatouille:  Saute each vegetable in olive oil separately until tender.  Return the vegetables to a large saucepan, adding garlic, tomatoes, tomato juice and remaining olive oil.  Reduce by two-thirds or until liquid is like a paste.  Season with salt and pepper and add a handful of chopped herbs.  Allow to cool completely.

For the Herb Phyllo Crisp:  Unfold phyllo sheets out of the box and cover with a wet cloth.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place chopped herbs in a workable container, pour melted butter into a workable container, have your paint brush ready, then clean your work space.

The idea is to layer melted butter and chopped herbs in between layers of phyllo, brush with melted butter, sprinkle with chopped herbs and repeat for 3 layers.  With a sharp knife, cut 6 even strips going vertically and then cut 4 even strips horizontally, making 24 even squares.

Carefully mold each square into each space of the muffin pan until all are completed.  Place in the middle rack and bake for 2 to 3 1/2 minutes.  They cook very quickly.  Remove from pan.  Repeat this step until you have enough phyllo crisps for your party.

Fill herb phyllo crisps with room temperature ratatouille, a small spoon of goat cheese, and you are ready to serve.

This recipe yields 60 pieces.

Comments:  Working with phyllo can be tricky for a first time user, but if you'll remember a few simple steps you will always have success.

  a.  Never buy just one box, since some sheets are torn or matted together.
  b.  Make sure the box is completely thawed out before attempting any dish.
  c.  Always cover sheets not being used with a damp cloth towel; phyllo will dry out and turn to cracker mill right before your eyes.

  2                     semi-boneless baby chickens
                        = (or Cornish hens)
  2          teaspoons  canola oil
  9               cups  raw sweet corn kernels
     1/2                vanilla bean
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  chopped jalapeÒo pepper
     1/4           cup  blanched fava beans
     1/4           cup  blanched sweet corn kernels
     1/4           cup  roasted carrots in medium dice
  6                     roasted cipolini onions -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves

Season the skin of the baby chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat a saute pan over a medium heat until hot.  Rub the chicken skin with the canola oil and place in a saute pan skin-side down.  Saute until nicely browned.  Transfer saute pan to a pre-heated 375 degree oven and finish cooking skin-side down (approximately 8 to 10 minutes).

Juice the raw corn kernels in a vegetable juicer.  Strain the juice through a fine mesh strainer.  The yield should be approximately 2 cups.  Pour into a small sauce pot over a medium-low heat.  Add the vanilla bean and bring to a very gentle simmer, while constantly stirring.

Simmer until the corn milk naturally thickens.  Add the lemon juice, lemon zest and season with salt and pepper.  Add the jalapeno pepper, stir, tasting constantly, until the heat of the jalapeno comes out.  Strain immediately and return to the pot.  Add all the vegetables and heat through.

Spoon equal amounts of the succotash onto the center of 2 warm bowls.  Remove the chickens from the oven and arrange over the succotash, skin-side up.  Sprinkle thyme leaves over each chicken

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dried cannellini beans -- soaked overnight in
  8               cups  cold water
  1                     bay leaf
                        Rosemary sprigs -- to taste
  6               cups  spring water
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  onion -- cut small dice
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the drained beans, bay leaf, rosemary and spring water in a soup pot and bring to a rolling boil.  Reduce heat and cover, removing any foam that appears.  Beans will soften in about 40 minutes.  Add a generous pinch of sea salt the last five minutes of cooking to keep the skins of the beans intact.

While the beans are cooking, saute the onion in olive oil with a pinch of salt over medium heat for 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and then the white wine, cooking the mixture until all of the liquid is absorbed.  Add the cooked beans and some (about 1 1/2 cups) of their broth to the onion mixture along with the additional sea salt as needed.  Add another sprig of rosemary if a stronger flavor is desired.  Lower the heat and cook for about 20 more minutes.  Beans should be a little juicy and soft.  Add black pepper to taste.  Sprinkle with fresh parsley just before serving.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Place the drained beans, bay leaf, rosemary and spring water in a soup pot and bring to a rolling boil.  Reduce heat and cover, removing any foam that appears.  Beans will soften in about 40 minutes.  Add a generous pinch of sea salt the last five minutes of cooking to keep the skins of the beans intact.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the beans are cooking, saute the onion in olive oil with a pinch of salt over medium heat for 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and then the white wine, cooking the mixture until all of the liquid is absorbed.  Add the cooked beans and some (about 1 1/2 cups) of their broth to the onion mixture along with the additional sea salt as needed.  Add another sprig of rosemary if a stronger flavor is desired.  Lower the heat and cook for about 20 more minutes.  Beans should be a little juicy and soft.  Add black pepper to taste.  Sprinkle with fresh parsley just before serving.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  cider reduction
                        = (abt 2 cups apple cider reduced
                        to a syrupy thickness)
  1         tablespoon  sherry vinegar
  1         tablespoon  reduced chicken stock
                        = (abt 2 cups chicken stock reduced
                        to a syrupy thickness)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              pinch  salt
  1         tablespoon  canned green peppercorns in brine
                        === FOIE GRAS AND APPLES ===
  1                     Granny Smith apple -- cut 1/8" julienne
                        on a mandoline
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1                cup  frisee lettuce
                        = (curly endive-preferably as yellow
                        as possible or use mesclun greens)
  4             slices  NY state duck foie gras - (abt 3 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  Wondra flour -- for dredging
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- for sauteeing
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

About 1 hour ahead, combine reduced cider and sherry vinegar with the reduced chicken stock in a small saucepan.  Heat over medium heat to a low boil and add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time with a whisk.  Add salt and the green peppercorns and set aside in a warm place until ready to use.

Cut the apple julienne and toss with the olive oil and lemon juice.  Add the salad greens and toss together.  Do not do this too far ahead or the salad will wilt.  Divide the salad onto 4 plates and set aside while sauteeing foie gras.

You need to cook the foie gras in 2 pans or 2 slices at a time.  Heat a medium saute pan over high heat until very hot.  Season the foie gras with salt and pepper quite liberally (some of the seasoning will melt away as the foie gras saute).

Dredge the foie gras slices in the flour, and put the oil in the saute pan, it will smoke a little, then immediately put 2 slices of foie gras in the pan.  Be careful not to splash the oil, or catch the oil on fire.  Saute the foie gras until browned on one side, then flip over and cook on the other side until nicely browned.

Place immediately onto the salad on each plate, then repeat with the other 2 slices if sauteeing in the same pan.  Foie gras is best eaten while hot right out of the pan so its best to saute in 2 pans if possible.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
     1/2           cup  warm milk
  1         tablespoon  dry yeast -- plus
  1           teaspoon  dry yeast
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              pinch  salt
                        === FILLING ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, chopped
     1/2         pound  lump crabmeat -- picked of any shells
  1         tablespoon  chopped tomato
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped basil
  1         tablespoon  chopped Italian parsley
  2                     shallots -- peeled, chopped
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

To make the dough, combine the milk, yeast, 2 tablespoons of the sugar and 2 tablespoons of the flour in a large mixing bowl.  Mix well and set aside for 30 minutes.

In another bowl combine the egg, butter, salt, sugar, and flour.  Mix together until smooth and elastic, then combine with the other dough.  Do not overmix.  Cover and let rise for 1 hour.

For the filling, place 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat.  Saute the garlic, crab, tomato, and salt and pepper to taste, for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool.  Pour off any excess liquid, then mix well in a bowl with the remaining butter, herbs, shallots, and salt and pepper.

Divide the dough into 12 equal portions, forming them into round balls.  On a lightly floured surface, roll each ball out into a 6-inch circle.

Divide the filling into 12 equal portions, placing one portion onto each circle of dough.  Take up the edges of each dough circle and roll it into a ball, sealing in the filling.  Place on a buttered baking pan, cover with a damp towel, and allow to rise for 25 minutes.

Lightly brush with the beaten egg, then bake in the oven for 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Blend the fresh herbs into the cheese.

Blanch the spinach leaves for 2 minutes in boiling water and let cool.

Butterfly the shrimp (split them down the center, cutting almost but not completely through) and open them flat to resemble a butterfly shape).  Dip the shrimp in cornstarch.  Between 2 sheets of plastic wrap, pound the shrimp to a 1/16-inch thickness.

Place 1 spinach leaf on each shrimp.  Pipe a 2-inch strip of cream cheese from head to tail down the center of the spinach.  Arrange a strip of bell pepper along one side of the cream cheese.  Roll the flattened shrimp and refrigerate.

A few minutes before serving time, dredge the shrimp rolls lightly in the seasoned flour, then in the egg whites, and then in the bread crumbs.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a nonstick ovenproof frying pan, heat the olive oil until hot.  Brown the breaded shrimp rolls until golden brown.  Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 8 to 10 minutes.  Slice on the diagonal.  Serve with the Tequila-Lime Relish.

For the Tequila-Lime Relish:  Mix all the ingredients and let stand for 1 hour.  For garnish, use carrot peels and chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     red peppers
  4                     sole filets - (6 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  black olive paste
  6             ounces  dry white wine
  1                     lemon
  1         tablespoon  capers -- rinsed
  4             ounces  canned tomato juice
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  basil chiffonade

Roast 2 lightly oiled and seasoned red peppers in a sautÈ pan on the bottom of a 400 degree oven.  Turn every few minutes until all sides are fairly charred, about 12 minutes.  Place peppers in a plastic bag to loosen skin.  When cool, peel and discard stem and seeds.  Cut into sections about 4 inches by 1 1/2 inches.

Place each sole filet, whiter-side down on cutting board.  Cover with double layered plastic wrap and pound lightly with the smooth side of a mallet or heavy knife to thin out fish some without tearing it.  Spread black olive paste lightly onto each filet, and lay down one red pepper strip per filet.  Roll each filet fairly tight from thin end (tail) to head (thicker end).

Season roulades and poach in 2 ounces white wine, juice and strips of zest of one lemon, capers, tomato juice and 4 ounces cold water.  Bring to boil, then simmer covered 10 to 12 minutes.

When fish appears cooked, whisk in 1 teaspoon olive oil and basil chiffonade.  Split roulade along natural divide and serve sole roulade with olive paste, roast peppers and capers.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Spicy Seared Tuna With Sesame Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Hans Rockenwagner
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger root
                        Sesame Vinaigrette -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  best-quality ahi tuna
  6               cups  mizuna greens, curly endive or
                        red leaf lettuce - (loosely packed)
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped chives -- for garnish
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
  1                cup  Marinated Shitake Mushrooms -- (see recipe)

Melt the butter over low-heat, stir in the ginger root and remove from the heat.  Allow the mixture to infuse for 2 to 3 hours or overnight for the flavor to develop.

Reheat the butter and ginger root infusion until it is soft enought to spread easily.  Brush each sheet of aluminum foil with some of this mixture, and sprinkle with a little salt and white pepper.  With a very sharp knife, slice the tuna about 3/8-inch thick against the grain and lay 2 slices in a single layer on each piece of foil.  Preheat a grill, griddle, or large heavy skillet to very high heat.

Toss the greens with just enough Sesame Vinaigrette to coat all the leaves and reserve the remaining vinaigrette for another use.  Mound an equal quantity of the salad on each of 6 serving plates.

Transfer the sheets of foil to the hot grill and cook for about 30 seconds, or until the tuna is seared on one side and still raw on the other.  Immediately transfer the tuna slices, raw-side up, to the plates and drape them loosely around the edges of the salad.  Garnish with the chives and the Marinated Shitake Mushrooms, if desired, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  water
  2               cups  jasmine rice
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  light oil
                        = (such as grapeseed oil)
                        Banana leaf -- (optional)

If you have a rice steamer, proceed as you would to steam any rice.  A banana leaf placed in the steamer will impart a wonderfully fragrant perfume.

To cook jasmine rice:  Bring four cups water to a boil.  Add rice, salt and oil and boil hard until you see big rounds of boiling rice, approximately three to four minutes.  Reduce heat to simmer, cover pot and cook for 15 minutes.

Check rice with a fork, taste.  If it is a little al dente, leave covered on stove with the heat off for three to four more minutes.  Serve in individual bowls.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === PASTRY DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  whole-wheat pastry flour
     1/4      teaspoon  sea salt
     1/4           cup  corn oil -- less may be needed

     1/3           cup  barley malt or maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
     1/2           cup  pecans -- chopped

                        === PUMPKIN FILLING ===
  1              pound  firm tofu
  1                can  pumpkin puree - (16 oz)
                        = (do not use fresh pumpkin because
                        it is too watery)
  1                cup  maple syrup
  1         tablespoon  barley malt or molasses
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly oil a 9-inch pie plate.

Mix the flour, salt and oil thoroughly, using a fork to incorporate the ingredients.  Slowly add the rice milk and stir to form a stiff dough.  Gather it into a ball and knead for 2 minutes.  Roll out thinly between sheets of waxed paper to form a 10-inch circle.  Lay it over the prepared pie plate, pressing it down to eliminate any air pockets.  Crimp edges.  Prick the pastry with a fork and bake for 10 minutes.  Allow the crust to completely cool before filling.

Pecan Surprise:  Combine the sweetener and corn oil in a saucepan and cook until foamy.  Quickly stir in the pecans.  Spread evenly over the bottom of the pie crust and set aside at room temperature.

Pumpkin Filling:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Combine all of the ingredients in a food processor.  Process for about 3 minutes.  Pour the filling into the prepared crust and bake for 50 minutes.  Garnish the edge of the pie with whole toasted pecans.  Let the pie cool and serve with a dollop of Tofu Whipped Creme, if desired.

This pie is also delicious served chilled, allowing the pie to rest about 10 minutes after you pull it from the refrigerator before eating insures optimum flavor.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     flour (wheat) tortillas - (8" dia)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
                        === TOPPING ===
  4                     plum tomatoes -- finely diced
  12                    black olives -- pitted, halved
                        = (such as Kalamata or oil-cured olives)
  1             medium  zucchini -- halved lengthwise,
                        and sliced paper thin
     1/2           cup  red onion in thin slivers
  4          teaspoons  finely-chopped oregano
                        = (or 2 tspns dried oregano)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper - (generous)
  3        tablespoons  fruity olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  finely-crumbled feta cheese - (8 oz)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Using 2 baking sheets, place 2 tortillas side by side on each sheet.  With a pastry brush, lightly brush each tortilla with some of the olive oil.  Flip the tortillas and brush again.  Bake 8 to 10 minutes, flipping over the tortillas and alternating the placement of the baking sheets halfway through the cooking time.

Also, during the first few minutes, use a knife point to pop any air bubbles that might develop.  The tortillas should be golden and crisp when done.  (The tortillas may be prepared to this point up to 3 days in advance.  Cool completely, seal in a plastic bag, and refrigerate until ready to use.)

In a large bowl, combine the tomatoes, olives, zucchini, onion slivers, oregano, pepper, and olive oil and toss well.  Gently fold in the feta cheese.  Scatter all over the 4 tortillas.  Bake 12 minutes, or until the feta is sizzling and the zucchini softened.  Alternate the placement of the baking sheets halfway during the cooking time.  Cut and serve immediately.

This recipe yields four 8-inch pizzas.

                      Warm Lobster And Crab Cocktail

Recipe By     :David McInerney
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lobsters - (1 lb ea)
  1                cup  Beurre Blanc -- (see below), warm
  2        tablespoons  butter
  3             ounces  crabmeat
  10                    chives -- sliced thin
  2             ounces  Leek Sauce -- (see below)
                        === BEURRE BLANC ===
  1                     shallot -- chopped
  2             ounces  white wine
  2             ounces  cream
  8             ounces  cold cubed butter
                        === LEEK SAUCE ===
  2             ounces  lobster stock
  1                cup  chopped green leeks - (tightly packed)
  1         tablespoon  cold cubed butter -- plus
  1           teaspoon  cold cubed butter
     1/4           cup  ice cubes
                        === BLOOD ORANGE SAUCE ===
  5              large  blood oranges

Remove the claws and tails from the lobsters.  The bodies may be used for stock.  Boil the claws for 4 minutes and the tails for 3 minutes, until they are just barely cooked with some translucency left in the middle.  Remove the claws and tails from the shell, cut the tails into 3 even medallions.  Put the 6 medallions and 2 claws in a small saucepan with the Buerre Blanc.

Warm the butter in a small saucepan and fold in the crabmeat and chives.  Season with salt and pepper.

Arrange 3 medallions on each serving plate, and put a spoonful of the crabmeat in the center.  Top with a claw.

Warm the green leek and blood orange sauces separately, and spoon each sauce around the lobster and crab.

For the Beurre Blanc:  Reduce the shallots and white wine until almost dry in small saucepan.  Add cream and reduce by half.  Whisk in butter.  Hold warm.

For the Leek Sauce:  In a medium saucepan bring the lobster stock to a boil.  Stir in the leeks until all are submerged and cook 1 1/2 minutes until tender.  Transfer to a blender and add the cubed butter.  Blend until the butter is melted.  Then add the ice cubes with the blender running.  Blend until smooth.  Pass through a chinois and season with salt and pepper.  Finish cooling in ice bath.

For the Blood Orange Sauce:  Juice the oranges and pass through a chinois.  In a small saucepot, reduce to a syrupy consistency.  Hold at room temperature.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  taro root
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  peanut or grapeseed oil

Peel taro root.  First, for the chips, take your peeler and peel approximately one cup of long taro shreds.  Reserve for frying.

Take the remaining taro and cut it up into rough 2-inch chunks.  Place in a sauce pan, covering with cold water.  Boil root until tender.  Strain into a colander, reserving 1 cup of the liquid.

In a food processor, pulse taro, adding little dabs of butter as you go, along with some of the cooking liquid to make a smooth consistency.  Remove and season with salt and pepper.

For the chips:   Heat a couple of cups of peanut or grapeseed oil to 350 degrees.  Drops shreds into oil in small batches.  Remove when crisp (the chips should still be light in color) and salt and pepper to taste.  (Makes garnish for 4 servings)

                    White Chocolate Mousse With Kirsch

Recipe By     :Alice Medrich
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9             ounces  white chocolate -- cut very small piece
  2        tablespoons  water
  3        tablespoons  Kirschwasser
  1 1/2           cups  heavy whipping cream

Place chocolate, water, and Kirschwasser in a medium-size heatproof bowl.  Bring 1 inch of water to a simmer in a wide skillet.  Turn the heat off and wait 30 seconds.  Set bowl of chocolate in pan of water.  Stir white chocolate mixture constantly until melted and smooth.  Or, melt in a microwave on low for about 2 minutes.  Stir until smooth and completely melted.

White chocolate is very fragile and burns easily.  Do not turn the heat on again under the skillet unless absolutely necessary.  Let cool until a dab touched by your upper lip feels slightly cool.

Whip the cream until soft peaks form -- not too stiff.  Carefully fold cream into cooled white chocolate mixture; the mousse will seem very soft.  Scrape mold immediately into lined mold.  Mousse sets quickly and should not be spread or manipulated too much after it is completed.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
  1                cup  hot water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     onions -- diced
  4             ounces  fresh mushrooms -- sliced
  2             medium  carrots -- sliced
  2                     celery stalks -- diced
  2                     leek tops -- sliced
  4                     thyme sprigs - (to 6)
  2                     bay leaves
  6                     parsley sprigs -- roughly chopped
  3                     sage leaves
                        = (or a pinch of dried sage)
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
  9               cups  spring water

Cover the dried mushrooms with 1 cup hot water and set aside.

Heat the olive oil in the soup pot and add the onions to caramelize.  When they have turned a deep brown add the remaining vegetables, herbs, garlic, sea salt and saute an additional 3 minutes (add a little liquid if necessary).

Add the dried porcini and their soaking liquid plus 9 cups cold water, and bring to a boil.  Simmer for 45 minutes uncovered.  Strain the stock through a fine mesh colander.

Use as is or return it to the stove to reduce and intensify the flavor.  A general rule of thumb: it takes about 15 minutes at a slow boil to reduce the volume of liquid by one cup.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
  7        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- peeled, chopped fine
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, chopped
  2             pounds  white mushrooms -- washed, sliced
  5                     fresh Italian plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              sprig  fresh marjoram
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
  5               cups  chicken stock
  3                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  grated pecorino cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian parsley
  8             slices  Italian bread, 1/2" thk -- preferably stale

Soak the porcini in a cup of warm water for at least 30 minutes.  Drain the liquid, straining it through a fine strainer to remove any sand.  Reserve the strained liquid, re-rinse the mushrooms, pat them dry, and chop finely.

Place 4 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat.  Saute the onion and garlic for about 5 minutes until wilted.  Add the porcini and the white mushrooms and cook for 10 minutes.  Add the porcini liquid, tomatoes, salt, pepper, marjoram, thyme, and the stock.  Bring to a boil, lower heat, and allow to simmer for 15 minutes.

Combine the egg yolks, Parmesan, and pecorino in a mixing bowl, then gradually whisk 1 cup of the hot soup into the mixture to warm it.  Then whisk the egg mixture directly into the simmering pot, stirring to thicken the soup.  Add the parsley and cook for 5 more minutes.

Meanwhile, brush the slices of bread with the remaining olive oil and toast them in the oven at 400 degrees until golden brown.  Place one piece of the toast in the bottom of each serving bowl, ladle the soup over the top and serve with additional grated Parmesan on the side.

This recipe yields 8 servings.
