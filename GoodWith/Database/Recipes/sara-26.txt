  5                     sheets phyllo dough
  2                     egg whites
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  panko bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  chopped almonds

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  dried apricots - (firmly packed) -- chopped
     3/4           cup  chopped walnuts
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  6                     Granny Smith apples
     3/4           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/4           cup  butter -- softened

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a medium bowl, combine the apricots, walnuts, brown sugar, and butter.

Core the apples, making each opening large enough to hold 1/6 of the apricot mixture, peel the top third of each apple.  Arrange the apples, cavity-side up, in a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish, and fill the cavities with the apricot mixture.  Sprinkle any remaining filling around the apples, pour the orange juice around them, and dot with butter.

Bake apples 15 minutes and baste with juices.  Continue to bake, basting regularly, until tender, about 1 hour.  Remove from oven and let stand about 10 minutes before serving.  Transfer to serving bowls, spoon juices over, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Sprinkle any remaining filling around the apples, pour the orange juice around them, and dot with butter.

  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  6                     strips fresh orange zest - (3" by 1") -- removed with a

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STUFFING ===
  1              pound  finely- ground pork
     1/4         pound  ground fresh pork fat
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  minced fresh parsley leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        === TURKEY AND SAUCE ===
  6 1/2         pounds  turkey breast -- boned
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme -- crumbled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  sliced baked ham
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  6               cups  brown stock
                        = (or canned beef broth)
                        Bouquet garni
                        = (12 parsley sprigs, 1 tspn dried thyme,
                        and 1 bay leaf tied in a cheesecloth bag)
  2        tablespoons  arrowroot
  2        tablespoons  Sercial Madeira
     1/4           cup  heavy cream

Make the stuffing:  In a food processor blend the pork and fat.  With the motor running, add the eggs, 1 at a time, and combine well.  With the motor still running, add the heavy cream in a stream.  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and add the remaining ingredients.  Chill, covered, for at least 30 minutes.

Turkey Breast Preparation:  With a sharp boning knife, remove the turkey breast halves beginning at the breast bone and cutting along the ribcage, using long, swift strokes, pulling the meat away from the bone as you go.  Remove and reserve the fillets (tenderloins) from the underside of the breast.  Remove and discard any tendons, sinew, or silverskin.  Reserve.

On a double thickness of cheesecloth, arrange the turkey breast skin-side down with a long side facing you.  Sprinkle it with half the thyme and salt and pepper, to taste.  Smooth 1/4 (about 1 cup) the stuffing over the turkey breast, leaving a 1-inch border.  Cover the stuffing with a layer of the ham.  Cover the ham with another cup of stuffing.  Halve one of the fillets and wrap each half with a piece of ham.  Lay the wrapped fillets side by side, with the ends touching, on top of the stuffing.

Beginning with the long side of the breast nearest you, roll it carefully away from you into a cylinder.  Fold the cheesecloth over to enclose it and twist the ends, maintaining the cylinder shape.  Tie the ends securely with string.  Repeat with the remaining breast.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Pat the turkey rolls (ballontines) dry.

In a roasting pan, heat the butter and oil over moderate heat until hot and in it brown the turkey, in the cheesecloth, about 2 minutes per side.  Add 6 cups stock and bouquet garni to roasting pan,

Braise the turkey, covered tightly with foil, in the middle of the oven, basting occasionally for 1 1/2 hours, or until the internal temperature is 165 degrees and its juices run clear when the breast is pricked with a skewer.

The turkey can be made 1 day ahead up to this point and kept refrigerated, covered, in the cooking liquid.  To reheat, bring to a boil over moderately-high heat, baste, and heat, covered, in a preheated 350 degree oven, basting frequently, for 1 hour.

Transfer the turkey to a rack to cool.  Unwrap it.  Skim the braising liquid and strain it into a saucepan.  In a small bowl, combine the arrowroot, Madeira, and cream.

Bring the strained liquid to a boil and stir in the arrowroot mixture.  Cook the mixture over moderately-high heat until it is thickened slightly.  Keep the sauce warm, covered with a buttered round of waxed paper.

Transfer the turkey to a carving board and slice half of it into 1/2-inch slices.  Transfer the slices and remaining turkey to a platter and serve warm with the sauce.

This recipe yields 14 servings.

Beginning with the long side of the breast nearest you, roll it carefully away from you into a cylinder.  Fold the cheesecloth over to enclose it and twist the ends, maintaining the cylinder shape.  Tie the ends securely with string.  Repeat with the remaining breast.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Pat the turkey rolls (ballontines) dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a roasting pan, heat the butter and oil over moderate heat until hot and in it brown the turkey, in the cheesecloth, about 2 minutes per side.  Add 6 cups stock and bouquet garni to roasting pan,
</DirT>
<DirT>
Braise the turkey, covered tightly with foil, in the middle of the oven, basting occasionally for 1 1/2 hours, or until the internal temperature is 165 degrees and its juices run clear when the breast is pricked with a skewer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The turkey can be made 1 day ahead up to this point and kept refrigerated, covered, in the cooking liquid.  To reheat, bring to a boil over moderately-high heat, baste, and heat, covered, in a preheated 350 degree oven, basting frequently, for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the turkey to a rack to cool.  Unwrap it.  Skim the braising liquid and strain it into a saucepan.  In a small bowl, combine the arrowroot, Madeira, and cream.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring the strained liquid to a boil and stir in the arrowroot mixture.  Cook the mixture over moderately-high heat until it is thickened slightly.  Keep the sauce warm, covered with a buttered round of waxed paper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the turkey to a carving board and slice half of it into 1/2-inch slices.  Transfer the slices and remaining turkey to a platter and serve warm with the sauce.

This recipe yields 14 servings.

  3 1/2           cups  unpeeled eggplant in 1/4" dice -- (abt 1 1/4 lbs)
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped onion

     1/3           cup  chopped pitted green olives
  3        tablespoons  chopped drained bottled capers
     1/4           cup  red-wine vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar -- or to taste
  3        tablespoons  golden raisins -- (optional)

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make toasts:  Prepare grill or preheat broiler.  With a serrated knife cut bread crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Grill slices on a rack set about 4 inches over glowing coals for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crisp outside but still soft inside.

Alternatively, slices may be broiled in batches under a broiler about 4 inches from heat 1 to 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or until golden.

Rub toasts with garlic on one side and lightly brush same side with oil.  Toasts may be made 1 week ahead and kept in an airtight container.

Tomato and Ricotta Salata:  In a small skillet cook shallots in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until softened.  Stir in tomato and salt and pepper to taste and cook, stirring 30 seconds, or until just heated through.  In a bowl toss together tomato mixture with cheese, chives, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste and mound about 1 tablespoon on oiled side of each toast.

Mozzarella, Greens, and Garlic:  Discard coarse stems from greens and wash leaves thoroughly.  Chop greens coarse (there should be about 6 cups).

In a large heavy skillet, cook garlic paste in oil over moderately-low heat, stirring, 1 minute.  Add greens, salt, and pepper and saute over moderately-high heat, stirring, until wilted and tender, about 3 minutes.  Pour off any excess liquid.  Transfer greens mixture to a bowl and cool to warm.  Stir in mozzarella.

Caponata:  In a heavy skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over moderately-high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it cook the eggplant, stirring, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it is tender, and transfer it to a bowl.

To the skillet add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and in it cook the onion and the celery over moderate heat, stirring, for 5 minutes.

Add the olives, the capers, the vinegar, the sugar, the raisins, the pine nuts, and the tomatoes and cook the mixture, covered, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it is cooked through and the celery is tender, and transfer it to the bowl.  Stir in the parsley, let the caponata cool, and chill it, covered,overnight.  Season the caponata with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Paula Lambert
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  dried cranberries
                        = (or chopped dried cherries)
  2        tablespoons  amaretto liqueur
  8             ounces  ricotta - (1 cup) -- homemade or
                        store-bought, well drained
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2             ounces  mascarpone -- cold
     1/4           cup  toasted pistachio nuts -- chopped
  8              large  or 12 mini cannoli shells -- homemade or
                        store-bought
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar -- for garnish
                        === HOMEMADE RICOTTA ===
  1             gallon  whole milk
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Salt -- (optional)
                        === HOMEMADE CANNOLI SHELLS ===
  12                    egg roll wrappers
  1                cup  vegetable oil

Soak the dried cranberries in the amaretto in a small bowl for 30 minutes.

Combine the ricotta and sugar in a small bowl and whip until smooth.  Add the mascarpone and stir to incorporate.  Be careful not to overmix, or the mascarpone might separate.  Fold in the pistachios and dried cranberries with their soaking liquid.

Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip and pipe the mixtrue into the cannoli shells.  If you donít have a pastry bag, put the filling into a plastic bag, snip off 1 corner, and squeeze the filling out into the pastry shells.  (Do this close to serving time so the shells wonít lose their crispness.)  Refrigerate until serving time.

To serve, dust with confectioners' sugar, using a sieve.  Serve chilled.

For Homemade Ricotta:  Prepare a sanitizing solution of 1 quart of water and 1 tablespoon of household bleach.

Rinse a large stainless steel or enameled stockpot or soup pot with the sanitizing solution and pour the milk and cream into the pot.  Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring as necessary with a sanitized spoon so the milk doesn't scorch on the bottom of the pot.  Reduce the heat to low and stir in the lemon juice.  Continue stirring slowly until the milk curdles and white curds float to the top.  Remove from the heat and cover.  Wait for 5 minutes while the curds solidify slightly and become firmer.

Rinse a colander and a large piece of muslin or several layers of cheesecloth in the sanitizing solution.  Wring out the cloth to release the excess water.  Line the colander with the cloth and set the colander in the sink or over a large bowl.

Using a sanitized perforated spoon, gently ladle the curds into the colander.  Let the whey drain for 30 minutes, or until the ricotta is still moist but fairly dry.

After about 15 minutes, lift the edges of the cloth toward the center of the colander to loosen the cheese from the cloth and facilitate draining.  If the ricotta is still too liquid and runny in texture after 30 minutes, gather the edges of the cloth together using 1 hand, wrap a piece of kitchen string around the gathered cloth to form a bag, and tie it closed.  Hang the bag containing the cheese from the faucet or the handle of a kitchen cabinet door and allow the excess whey to drip from the bag into the sink or a bowl.

If adding salt, transfer the ricotta to a sanitized bowl and stir in the salt.  Place the ricotta in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator.  Use within 5 days.  (Makes 3 1/4 cups)

For Homemade Cannoli Shells:  Cut the egg roll wrappers into circles 4 inches in diameter.  Roll the wrappers around mold or pieces of aluminum tubing that are 1-inch in diameter and 4 1/2 to 5 inches in length.  Moisten the overlapped flap of dough with water to seal each wrapper.

Heat the oil in a large skillet until hot but not smoking, about 350 degrees.  Add the shells, still on the tubing, and fry, turning with tongs as necessary, until golden brown and cripsy on all sides.  Remove immediately, using tongs, and stand the tubing on end on paper towels to drain.  When cool, slip the cannoli shells off of the tubing.  (Makes 8 large or 12 mini cannoli shells)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings (8 large or 12 mini cannolis).

        Carnival Squash Soup, With Fried Sage And Shaved Parmesan

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     carnival squashes - (abt 4" to 6" across)
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  thinly-sliced onion
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  6               cups  chicken stock -- or more for
                        desired consistency
  1                cup  fresh sage leaves
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 250 degrees.

Cut the top 1/4 off 8 squashes, reserving the lids.  Scrape the seeds out, clean, rinse, and pat dry.  Toss the seeds with 3 tablespoons oil and salt, and arrange in one layer on a baking sheet.  Bake in the middle of the oven, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour to 1 1/4 hours, or until they are golden and crisp.

Increase the oven heat to 350 degrees.

Bake the squashes and the lids, cut-side down on lightly oiled baking sheets for 40 minutes or until they are tender (the lids will probably be ready at 30 minutes).  When cool enough to handle, scrape most of the pulp out of the squashes leaving just enough in each squash so that it retains its shape.  Reserve all the pulp.

Cook the onion in the butter in a skillet, over low heat for 5 minutes or until it is softened.  Add the pumpkin pulp and the chicken stock and simmer the mixture for 20 minutes.

Puree the mixture in batches in a blender and transfer to a saucepan.

Heat 2 inches vegetable oil to 350 degrees in a deep saucepan.  Add the sage in small batches (it will bubble up) and fry for 20 seconds or until translucent.  Transfer to paper towels to drain and sprinkle with salt.

Warm the squash shells and lids in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Heat soup until hot, adding water if necessary to thin it slightly.  Add salt and pepper, to taste.  Put each of the shells into shallow soup bowls and ladle some of the soup into the shell.  Top with a few fried sage leaves and some Parmigiano-Reggiano shavings and place the lid, slightly askew, on top.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the onion in the butter in a skillet, over low heat for 5 minutes or until it is softened.  Add the pumpkin pulp and the chicken stock and simmer the mixture for 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Puree the mixture in batches in a blender and transfer to a saucepan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat 2 inches vegetable oil to 350 degrees in a deep saucepan.  Add the sage in small batches (it will bubble up) and fry for 20 seconds or until translucent.  Transfer to paper towels to drain and sprinkle with salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Warm the squash shells and lids in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Heat soup until hot, adding water if necessary to thin it slightly.  Add salt and pepper, to taste.  Put each of the shells into shallow soup bowls and ladle some of the soup into the shell.  Top with a few fried sage leaves and some Parmigiano-Reggiano shavings and place the lid, slightly askew, on top.
</DirT>

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BASIC ===
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped pecans
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2           cups  flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  10       tablespoons  fat
  1                cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  liquid
                        = (or 1 large egg)
  1         tablespoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips - (6 oz)
                        Nonstick cooking spray -- as needed
                        === THIN ===
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped pecans
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2           cups  bleached all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  10       tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  light brown sugar
  3        tablespoons  light corn syrup
  2        tablespoons  milk
  1         tablespoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips - (6 oz)
                        Nonstick cooking spray -- as needed
                        === PUFFED ===
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped pecans
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2           cups  cake flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  9        tablespoons  butter-flavored shortening
  1                cup  minus 1 tbspn brown sugar
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips - (6 oz)
                        Nonstick cooking spray -- as needed
                        === IN BETWEEN ===
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped pecans
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2           cups  cake flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  5        tablespoons  butter
  5        tablespoons  butter-flavored shortening
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  light corn syrup
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips - (6 oz)
                        Nonstick cooking spray -- as needed

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  On a large baking sheet, roast the pecans for 10 to 12 minutes.  While the nuts are still hot, stir in 2 tablespoons butter.  Turn the oven up to 375 degrees.

Sift together the flour, salt and baking soda or baking powder in a medium mixing bowl.  Using an electric mixer, cream fat and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy.  Add the corn syrup, if using.  Add the liquid or egg and beat thoroughly.  Beat in the vanilla.  On low speed, gradually add the dry ingredients until thoroughly combined.  Scrape down the sides once with a rubber spatula.  Add the pecans and chocolate chips.  Beat 5 seconds on low.  Use the rubber spatula to finish mixing well.

Spray cookie sheets lightly with nonstick cooking spray.  With a tablespoon or small ice cream/food scoop (I use a No. 40, about 1 1/2-inch diameter), drop slightly heaped tablespoons of batter about 2 inches apart onto the greased sheets.  Bake the cookies for about 12 minutes or until the edges just begin to brown.  Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheet on a cooling rack for 3 minutes, then remove the cookies to a rack to cool completely.

Variations:  Replace the pecans with walnuts or replace semisweet chocolate chips with white chocolate and the pecans with macadamia nuts.  For "supercookies," in addition to the pecans, add 1 cup roasted, chopped walnuts.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 dozen cookies.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  rolled (old-fashioned) oats
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped pecans
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (lightly packed)
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1              large  egg
     1/4           cup  maple syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     3/4           cup  semisweet chocolate chips

Set 2 racks in the middle and upper thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

In a medium bowl, stir the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, oats, and pecans together with a whisk or fork.

In a large bowl, beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together for 30 seconds until blended.  Beat in the egg until smooth and barely fluffy.  With mixer running on medium-high, drizzle in the maple syrup until incorporated.  Turn the mixer down to its lowest setting and gradually add the flour-oatmeal mixture.  Blend just to combine, then mix in the chocolate chips.

Drop walnut-sized balls of dough onto a nonstick or parchment-lined cookie sheet at 3-inch intervals.  With moistened fingers, flatten and round out the cookies a little.  Bake for 9 minutes, turning the pan once for even baking.  The cookies are done when they are lightly browned on top.  Set the cookie sheets on a rack to cool.

This recipe yields about 36 cookies.

                       Chocolate Raspberry Souffle

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet's Best Desserts
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9             ounces  imported bittersweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  3             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  6                     egg yolks
  1 1/2       packages  frozen raspberries - (10 oz pkgs) -- thawed, crushed,
                        and strained, producing 3/4 cup of syrup
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar -- plus
     1/3           cup  sugar
  9                     egg whites -- room temperature
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  2               cups  heavy cream -- well chilled

Fit the individual souffle dishes with 6-inch wide doubled bands of foil, brushed with flavorless vegetable oil, to form collars extending 3-inches above the rim.

In a large heatproof bowl over barely simmering water, melt both chocolates, stirring occasionally, until smooth.  In a bowl with the mixer beat the egg yolks until they are thick and pale.

In a small saucepan, combine the raspberry juice with 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar.  Bring raspberry mixture to a simmer, add it to the egg yolks in a stream, beating constantly, and beat the mixture for 1 minute.  Add the yolk mixture to the chocolate mixture in a stream, beating constantly.

In a large bowl with the mixer beat the egg whites until frothy, add the cream of tartar, and beat the whites until they hold soft peaks.  Add the remaining sugar, a little at a time, and beat the whites until they hold stiff glossy peaks.

In a chilled bowl with the mixer beat the cream until it just holds stiff peaks.  Stir 1/4 of the whites into the chocolate mixture, fold in the remaining whites, and just before they are incorporated completely, fold in the whipped cream gently but thoroughly.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared souffle dish, smooth the top, and chill the dessert, covered loosely with plastic wrap, for at least 3 hours, or until set.  Just before serving, remove the collar carefully.

(The souffle may be prepared 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled with the foil collar in place).

Wine Suggestions:  Sauternes - Filhot

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a large bowl with the mixer beat the egg whites until frothy, add the cream of tartar, and beat the whites until they hold soft peaks.  Add the remaining sugar, a little at a time, and beat the whites until they hold stiff glossy peaks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a chilled bowl with the mixer beat the cream until it just holds stiff peaks.  Stir 1/4 of the whites into the chocolate mixture, fold in the remaining whites, and just before they are incorporated completely, fold in the whipped cream gently but thoroughly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon the mixture into the prepared souffle dish, smooth the top, and chill the dessert, covered loosely with plastic wrap, for at least 3 hours, or until set.  Just before serving, remove the collar carefully.

<DirT>
(The souffle may be prepared 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled with the foil collar in place).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16            slices  fresh home-made type white bread -- crusts removed
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  2             ounces  semi or bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
                        Sugar -- to taste
                        === RASPBERRY SAUCE ===
  3               cups  raspberries
  3        tablespoons  raspberry liqueur or orange liqueur
  2        tablespoons  water - (to 4)
  3        tablespoons  sugar - (to 4)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Melt the butter.  Roll out bread slices between two pieces of parchment paper until very thin.  Brush bread on both sides with melted butter.  Place 1 teaspoon of the chocolate in the center of each slice.  Fold in half diagonally to cover the filling and form a triangle, trim edges.

Press the edges with your fingers to tightly seal.  Brush tops and bottoms with melted butter crimp edges with fork and sprinkle top with sugar.  (At this point, the turnovers can be placed in a zippered plastic freezer bag and frozen for future use.)

Place on parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes (20 to 25 minutes if taken out of the freezer) or until golden brown.  Serve warm or cooled, with Raspberry Sauce.

Raspberry Sauce:  In a food processor, puree all ingredients until smooth.  Pour puree through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing on solids, and chill, covered.  Sauce may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.

This recipe yields 16 turnovers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  large shrimp -- shelled, deveined
                        Sea salt -- as needed
  2               cups  vegetable oil
  2               cups  Fresh Unsweetened Coconut Cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  Fresh Unsweetened Coconut Cream -- (procedure below)

  2        tablespoons  palm sugar or light brown sugar
                        === CHU-CHI CHILE PASTE ===
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced cilantro roots and stems
  1                     dried New Mexico (or California) chile -- softened in
                        warm water and seeded
  15                    dried de arbol or Japones chiles -- softened in
                        warm water
  1         tablespoon  dried shrimp -- softened in
                        warm water and pureed, (optional)
     1/2      teaspoon  Thai white peppercorns -- dry roasted,
                        and ground
     1/2      teaspoon  caraway seeds -- dry roasted,
                        and ground
  1           teaspoon  minced galangal
                        = (or 1 tbspn minced fresh ginger)
  1                     lemongrass stalk -- green parts and
                        hard outer layers removed, minced
  1           teaspoon  grated kaffir lime zest
                        = (or 1 tbspn grated regular lime zest)
  2                     shallots -- minced
  1         tablespoon  fresh grated coconut flakes
  1           teaspoon  fermented shrimp paste
                        = (or 1 tablespoon red miso)
                        === GARNISHES ===
  6                     fresh red bird or serrano chiles - (to 7) -- 1/2 seeded,
                        other 1/2 not, and slivered
  15                    fresh mint leaves -- sliced thin strands
  10                    kaffir lime leaves -- sliced thin strands
                        = (or 1/4 cup minced cilantro leaves)

Massage the shrimp with a few pinches of sea salt and place in a colander in the sink to drain for 10 minutes.  Rinse with cool water and dry thoroughly with paper towels.

In a 12-inch skillet, heat the oil over high heat for 2 minutes to 325 degrees.  (You can also test for readiness by dipping the tip of a wooden spoon into the oil; if bubbles form around it, the oil is ready for frying.)  Deep-fry the shrimp until golden, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a tray lined with paper towels.  Cover lightly with more paper towels and set aside.

In a 12-inch skillet, mix the 2 cups coconut cream with the chile paste and set over high heat.  Cook, stirring to prevent the paste from burning, until the mixture begins to bubble, about 2 minutes.  Lower the heat to medium-high and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and the oil separates, releasing tiny bubbles the color of the chile paste, about 7 minutes.

Add the fried shrimp, stirring to coat well, increase the heat to high, and season with the fish sauce and palm sugar.  Cook, stirring well, for 1 to 2 minutes, then transfer to a serving platter.  Garnish with the fresh chile slivers, mint leaf strands, and kaffir lime leaf strands.

Chu-Chi Chile Paste:  Using a mortar and pestle, pound the sea salt and garlic into a paste.  One at a time, add the cilantro roots and stems, chiles, dried shrimp, if desired, the peppercorns, caraway seeds, galangal, lemongrass, lime zest, and shallots in sequence, adding each new ingredient only after the previous one is pureed and incorporated into the paste.  Add the grated coconut and mix well, then add the fermented shrimp paste and mix well.  The chile paste can be stored in the refrigerator for at least 1 month.  (Makes about 3/4 cup)

Fresh Unsweetened Coconut Cream and Milk:  Fresh unsweetened coconut cream and milk are called for in many Thai recipes.  After peeling the dark skins off the chunks of white meat, cut the meat into 1 to 2-inch chunks and place them in a heavy-duty food processor fitted with the steel blade.  (If the coconut meat has been frozen, thaw it completely before slicing and grinding.)  Grind for 30 to 60 seconds.  Pause to scrape down the sides of the processor bowl; then pulse and blend until the meat turns to pulp.  Add 1 cup warm water and process for 30 seconds.  Transfer the coconut meat and liquid to a large mixing bowl, preferably one with a spout for pouring.  "Milk" the coconut -- that is, massage and squeeze the meat at least 89 times.  This is a Thai ritual believed to produce a rich and creamy coconut milk.  It works!

Place a fine-mesh strainer, potato ricer, or bouillon strainer over another large mixing bowl.  Pour the coconut cream and meat into the strainer, then press firmly to extract the liquid from the pulp.  Refrigerate the liquid for at least 1 hour.  The thick cream will coagulate on top, leaving the whey, or milk, in the bottom of the bowl.  Skim off the thick cream into a resealable plastic bag or plastic container and refrigerate or freeze.

Meanwhile, put the coconut pulp back into the first mixing bowl.  Pour 3 cups of warm water over the pulp, and massage and squeeze the coconut meat another 89 times.  Strain the liquid into another bowl, as before, and refrigerate the liquid for at least 1 hour, giving the thick cream time to rise to the top.

Skim off the cream and combine with the thick cream extracted from the first milking.  Pour the thin whey into a separate glass or plastic container and refrigerate until ready to use.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cooks Note:  More cream that can be used as cooking oil can be extracted from the thin whey after the second milking.  Boil the milk gently in a large saucepan for 5 to 7 minutes.  When the cream rises to the surface, skim it off and use as cooking oil to stir-fry chile or spice pastes.  Then thin milk can be used for a broth to cook and tenderize meat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9        tablespoons  softened unsalted butter -- divided
  1                cup  sugar -- divided
  1              pound  cranberries -- rinsed, picked over,
                        and patted dry
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1           teaspoon  minced orange rind
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  double-acting baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/3           cup  red currant jelly
                        Sweetened whipped cream -- as accompaniment,
                        if desired

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Butter the bottom and sides of the cake pan with 3 tablespoons butter, sprinkle 1/2 cup of the sugar evenly over the bottom, and arrange the cranberries in the pan.

In a bowl with the mixer cream together the remaining 6 tablespoons butter and 1/2 cup sugar.  Add the egg, vanilla, and orange rind and beat the mixture until well combined.

Into another bowl sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.  Stir the dry ingredients into the butter mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, alternately with the milk until it is combined.  Pour the batter over the cranberries and smooth the top.

Bake the cake on a baking sheet in the middle of the oven for 30 to 45 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.  Transfer the cake to a rack and let it cool in the pan for 20 minutes.  Run a thin knife around the inside of the pan and invert the cake stand.

In a small saucepan melt the currant jelly over low heat, stirring, and brush it over the cake.  Serve the cake warm or at room temperature with the whipped cream, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings, 1 (9-inch) cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  cake or all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  double-acting baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh dill
  1 1/4           cups  heavy cream -- plus additional
                        for brushing biscuits

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Into a bowl, sift together the flour, the baking powder, and the salt.  Add the dill and 1 1/4 cups of the cream.  Stir the mixture until it just forms a dough and gather the dough into a ball.

On a lightly floured surface knead the dough gently 6 times and pat it out 1/2-inch thick.  Cut out as many rounds as possible with a 3-inch round cutter dipped in flour and invert the rounds onto a lightly greased baking sheet.  Gather the scraps, pat out the dough, and cut out more rounds in the same manner until there are 8 rounds in all.

Brush the tops of the rounds with the additional cream, bake the biscuits in the middle of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are pale golden, and transfer them to a rack.  Serve the biscuits at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 biscuits.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  baking potatoes -- scrubbed
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  half-and-half or milk
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan -- plus
  2        tablespoons  freshly grated Parmesan
                        Freshly-grated nutmeg -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Melted unsalted butter -- for drizzling
                        over the potatoes

Bake the potatoes in a preheated 400 degree oven for 1 hour, or until they are tender.  Halve the potatoes lengthwise, scrape the flesh into a bowl, and press them through a ricer into a large bowl.

With an electric mixer beat in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, the whole eggs, 1 at a time, and the half-and-half and beat the mixture until it is combined well and smooth.  Add 1/3 cup of Parmesan.  Add the nutmeg, pepper, and salt, to taste, and transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a large decorative tip.

Pipe the mixture into 6 rosettes onto a buttered baking sheet and drizzle them with the melted butter and remaining cheese.  (The rosettes may be chilled, covered loosely, for several hours or overnight).

Bake the potatoes in a preheated 350 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes for potatoes at room temperature, or for 25 to 30 minutes for chilled potatoes, or until they are heated through.  Then, put the baking sheet under a preheated broiler about 6 inches from the heat, and broil the potatoes until the tops are golden.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              large  oranges
  3                     boneless Muscovy or
                        Magret duck breast halves - (1 lb ea) -- thawed if frozen
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  julienned orange zest

Stir sugar and water in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil until syrup turns deep amber, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan.

Remove from heat.  Add vinegar (mixture will bubble vigorously), orange juice, and shallots.  Bring mixture to a boil, stirring, and simmer until reduced to 3/4 cup.

Add demiglace.  Reduce to 1 cup.  Strain through fine sieve.  Correct seasoning by adding orange liqueur, lemon juice, salt, and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.  Set aside.

Using small knife, cut off peel and white pith from 2 oranges.  Working over bowl, cut between membranes to release segments.  (Sauce and oranges can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover separately; chill.)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Using sharp knife, score duck skin (do not pierce meat) in crosshatch pattern.  Sprinkle duck with salt and pepper and pat dry.  Heat large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until hot.  Place duck breasts skin down in skillet and cook until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes.  Turn duck and cook 2 minutes more.  Roast in oven for 7 minutes if using Muscovy duck breast or 10 minutes if using Magret duck breasts.

Transfer to cutting board and let stand 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, bring sauce to simmer, whisk in butter 1 tablespoon at a time and then the 1 tablespoon grated orange peel; whisk just until butter melts.  Drain orange segments and mix into sauce.  Set aside.

Slice duck breasts crosswise on diagonal.  Arrange on 6 plates.  Spoon orange segments with sauce alongside.  Sprinkle with remaining peel.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                 Field Greens With Pears And Blue Cheese

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Paula Lambert
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     pears
  4             ounces  mixed field greens - (to 6) -- washed, dried
  1                cup  toasted walnuts -- coarsely chopped
  8             ounces  Maytag blue cheese -- crumbled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === PORT-SHALLOT DRESSING ===
  2               cups  ruby port
     1/2           cup  thickly-sliced shallots
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Just before serving time, peel, core, and slice the pears.  Combine the greens, pears, walnuts, and blue cheese in a large salad bowl.  Drizzle half the Port-Shallot Dressing over the top and toss.  Drizzle in the remaining dressing, tossing until the greens are well coated -- you may not need to add all the dressing.  (Leftover dressing can be kept refrigerated for up to 1 week for another use.)  Season with salt and pepper, and toss again.

Place on chilled salad plates and serve.

Port-Shallot Dressing:  Pour the port into a small heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Add the shallots and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and cook for 15 minutes, or until the port is reduced to 2/3 cup without the shallots.  Set aside to let cool.

Pour the port and shallots into the conainer of a blender and puree.  Add the vinegar and blend well.  While the motor is running, drizzle the oil through the hole in the blender top and continue to blend until emulsified and smooth.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Set aside; refrigerate if not using immediately.  (Makes 1 1/4 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Just before serving time, peel, core, and slice the pears.  Combine the greens, pears, walnuts, and blue cheese in a large salad bowl.  Drizzle half the Port-Shallot Dressing over the top and toss.  Drizzle in the remaining dressing, tossing until the greens are well coated -- you may not need to add all the dressing.  (Leftover dressing can be kept refrigerated for up to 1 week for another use.)  Season with salt and pepper, and toss again.

Place on chilled salad plates and serve.

Port-Shallot Dressing:  Pour the port into a small heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Add the shallots and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and cook for 15 minutes, or until the port is reduced to 2/3 cup without the shallots.  Set aside to let cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the port and shallots into the conainer of a blender and puree.  Add the vinegar and blend well.  While the motor is running, drizzle the oil through the hole in the blender top and continue to blend until emulsified and smooth.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Set aside; refrigerate if not using immediately.  (Makes 1 1/4 cups)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fillet steak
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
                        === CURRIED CHUTNEY SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt -- drained in cheeseclo
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  mango chutney -- drained, chopped
  1           teaspoon  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  toasted curry powder
  2        tablespoons  minced red onion
                        === BEARNAISE SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  dried tarragon
  3                     egg yolks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- melted in saucepan
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh tarragon
                        === BARBECUE SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  onion -- finely minced
  1                     garlic clove -- finely minced
  2               cups  chili sauce
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  dark brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  water
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
                        Salt -- to taste

Cut the steak into 3/4-inch cubes and arrange on platter.  Fill a fondue pot half full with vegetable oil.  Heat on stove and transfer to burner.

To serve, the meat is picked up with fondue fork and immersed into hot oil until cooked to desired doneness.  Once cooked, the meat is dipped into accompanying sauces.

Curried Chutney Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in a food processor and pulse 2 or 3 times.  Adjust seasoning.  Chill the sauce, covered, for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.  Transfer the sauce to a serving dish.  (Makes 1 1/2 cups)

Bearnaise Sauce:  In a small saucepan combine vinegar, wine, shallots, and dried tarragon and simmer over moderate heat until reduced to 2 tablespoons of liquid.  Cool and strain through a fine sieve.

In the top of a double boiler or a heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks until they become thick and sticky.  Whisk in the reduced vinegar mixture, salt, and pepper.  Place the pan or bowl over a saucepan of simmering, not boiling, water.  Whisk until mixture is warm, about 2 minutes.  (If mixture appears to become lumpy, dip pan immediately in a bowl of ice water to cool, whisk until smooth and then continue recipe.)  The yolk mixture has thickened enough when you can see the bottom of the pan between strokes and mixture forms a light cream on the wires of the whip.

While whisking the yolk mixture, gradually pour in the melted butter, a tablespoon or so at a time whisking thoroughly to incorporate before adding more butter.  As the mixture begins to thicken and become creamy, the butter can be added more rapidly.  Do not add the milk solids at the bottom of the melted butter.

Season the sauce, to taste, with fresh tarragon, salt, and pepper.  To keep the sauce warm, set the pan or bowl in lukewarm water or in a thermos.  (Makes 1 to 1 1/2 cups)

Barbecue Sauce:  In a medium saucepan heat oil.  Add onions and garlic and saute until softened.  Add rest of the ingredients and cook at a simmer for about 15 minutes.  Thin out with water if necessary.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                        = (do not use unsweetened chocolate)
     1/4           cup  heavy cream

Preheat oven 350 degrees.

Roll out bread between two pieces of waxed paper very thin.  Cut bread in half in rectangles to yield 12 rectangles.  Brush both sides with melted butter and sprinkle with sugar.  Transfer to parchment-lined baking sheet.  Bake in oven for 15 minutes or until browned lightly.  Remove from oven and let cool.

Toss strawberries with lemon juice and sugar.

Arrange 1 bread rectangle on each plate, top with whipped cream, Praline Powder, and strawberries, cover with another rectangle, add some more cream, praline powder, and strawberries, another bread rectangle and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.  Serve with Chocolate Sauce.

Praline Powder:  In a heavy saucepan bring to a boil the sugar with the cream of tartar and water over moderately-high heat, stirring and washing down any sugar crystals clinging to the sides of the pan with a brush dipped in cold water.

Cook the syrup over high heat without stirring, swirling the pan until it is a light caramel.  Add the almonds, swirl the pan until the nuts are coated with the caramel, and begin to make a popping sound.

Pour the mixture onto an oiled marble surface or jelly roll pan and let cool until it is hard.  Transfer the praline to a cutting board, chop it coarsely, and use a food processor or blender to pulverize it in batches.  Store the praline powder in an airtight container.  (Makes 1 cup)

Chocolate Sauce:  Place chocolate in medium bowl.  In a small saucepan heat cream over medium heat to scald, do not boil.  Pour cream over chopped chocolate whisking until smooth.  (Makes 1/2 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

              Fresh Green Bean Salad With Basil And Tomatoes

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Shirley Corriher
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh green beans
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
  1           teaspoon  salt
  5                     firm ripe tomatoes -- sliced
  4             sprigs  fresh basil -- for garnish
                        === GARLIC-BASIL DRESSING ===
  1                     garlic clove
  1                     shallot
  2        tablespoons  water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     3/4           cup  canola, corn or vegetable oil
  15                    fresh basil leaves

Leave the pointed tips on the green beans, but snap off the stem tips.  Wash.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the sugar and 1 tablespoon salt.  Drop in the green beans and cook until crisp-tender, about 6 to 7 minutes.  Drain the beans and plunge them into ice water to stop cooking.  Drain well and refrigerate.

When ready to serve, toss the green beans with 1/3 cup of the Garlic-Basil Dressing in a large mixing bowl.  Taste and add more dressing or salt as needed.  Pile the beans high in the center of a large white platter.  Arrange the tomato slices overlapping around the edge.  Sprinkle the tomatoes with remaining salt and drizzle 3 tablespoons of the dressing on top of them.  Garnish with basil sprigs.  Serve immediately.

Garlic-Basil Dressing:  Turn on the processor fitted with the steel blade and drop the garlic and shallot down the feed tube onto the spinning blade to mince.  Add the water, salt, pepper, mustard, and sugar.  With the processor running, slowly drizzle in the oil.  Add the basil leaves and coarsely chop with several on/off pulses.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     garlic heads -- cloves separated,
                        but not peeled
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2 1/2         pounds  Yukon Golds or new potatoes
                        Salt -- to taste
     3/4           cup  milk -- plus extra if needed
  4             ounces  fresh goat cheese - (to 6) -- softened

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the unpeeled garlic cloves in a small ovenproof container and cover with the olive oil.  Cover with a lid or aluminum foil.  Place in the oven and roast for 20 minutes, or until the cloves are tender when tested with the tip of a knife.  Remove the garlic cloves and place on a plate to cool.  Strain the olive oil and reserve for later use.

Squeeze the roasted garlic out of the skins when cool enough to handle.  Puree the garlic by chopping and smashing it with the blade and side of a knife, or with a mortar and pestle.

Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut them into 2-inch pieces.  (There will be about 8 cups potatoes.)  Place them in a large saucepan.  Add enough water to cover the potates by 1-inch.  Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt, place the pan over high heat, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover the saucepan with lid placed slightly ajar, and simmer the potatoes for 20 to 30 minutes, or until tender when pierced with the tip of a knife.

Combine the milk and goat cheese in small saucepan and heat to a simmer, stirring until there are no lumps.  When the potates are cooked, drain them, return them to the pan, and place in the still-warm oven, uncovered to dry out for 10 minutes.

Remove the potatotes from the oven and pass them, along with the garlic, through a potato ricer or a food mill fitted with the fine disk.  Alternatively, the potatoes can be whipped using an electric mixer.  Add the reserved garlic oil and the goat cheese-milk mixture and whip the potatoes with a mixer or by hand, adding additional milk if too dry.  Reheat, covered, over very low heat if necessary.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large saucepan, combine the potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2- to 2-inch pieces, and the garlic, with enough salted cold water to cover the potatoes by 1/2 inch.  Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, for 15 to 25 minutes, or until they are tender but not falling apart.

While the potatoes are cooking, in a small saucepan heat the cream with the 1 cup butter, the goat cheese, and salt and pepper, to taste over moderately-low heat, stirring, until the butter and cheese are just melted and smooth.  Keep the mixture warm.

Drain the potatoes and garlic and force them through a food mill fitted with the medium disk or a ricer into a bowl.  With an electric mixer beat in the butter mixture, the scallion, and salt and pepper to taste, beating just until the potatoes are fluffy and smooth (do not over-beat), and transfer the mixture to a 1-quart shallow flameproof baking dish.  Dot with remaining 2 tablespoons butter.

(The potatoes may be prepared up to this point 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled.  Reheat the potatoes in a preheated 400 degree oven for 20 minutes, or until they are heated through, before broiling them.)

Broil the potatoes under a pre-heated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the top is golden.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  red potatoes -- halved
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     onions -- chopped
     1/2         pound  bacon -- chopped
  6             ounces  mild cheddar cheese
  2               cups  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  warm water
     1/4           cup  corn oil

Boil the potatoes until well done, drain and mash with butter.  Set aside.

In a large skillet over medium heat cook the onions and bacon together.  Reserve 1/2 cup of mixture for spooning over the cooked perogies.  Add the remaining bacon and onions to the potatoes.  Stir the cheese into the potato mixture.  Mix well.  Chill until very cold.

Mix flour and salt in large bowl.  Make a well in the middle.  Pour water and oil into the well.  Mix together.  Add more flour, 1/2 cup at a time until dough is firm.  Knead dough until mixture does not stick to hands.  Cover tightly and let stand for 1/2 hour in a warm place.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4-inch thickness and cut in 2-inch diameter circles.  Add 1 teaspoon filling, fold over 1 half of circle and press the edges together to seal.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add 1 tablespoon oil, then add perogies.  Stir occasionally so perogies wonít stick to the bottom.  When perogies rise to the top, add 1 cup cold water to stop the cooking.  Remove the perogies with a slotted spoon.  Perogies will cook in 3 to 4 minutes.  Serve topped with reserved onion-bacon mixture.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             quarts  salted water
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     3/4           cup  milk
  2               cups  fresh parsley leaves - (packed) -- washed, spun dry

  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)

In a large colander drain the spaetzle and place in serving bowl.

In a small heavy saucepan, cook the rosemary with salt and pepper, to taste, in butter over moderate heat, stirring, for 2 minutes.

Drizzle the rosemary butter over the spaetzle, tossing well.  Season the spaetzle with salt and pepper.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Paula Lambert
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             gallon  whole milk
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Salt -- (optional)

Prepare a sanitizing solution of 1 quart of water and 1 tablespoon of household bleach.

Rinse a large stainless steel or enameled stockpot or soup pot with the sanitizing solution and pour the milk and cream into the pot.  Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring as necessary with a sanitized spoon so the milk doesn't scorch on the bottom of the pot.

Reduce the heat to low and stir in the lemon juice.  Continue stirring slowly until the milk curdles and white curds float to the top.  Remove from the heat and cover.  Wait for 5 minutes while the curds solidify slightly and become firmer.

Rinse a colander and a large piece of muslin or several layers of cheesecloth in the sanitizing solution.  Wring out the cloth to release the excess water.  Line the colander with the cloth and set the colander in the sink or over a large bowl.

Using a sanitized perforated spoon, gently ladle the curds into the colander.  Let the whey drain for 30 minutes, or until the ricotta is still moist but fairly dry.

After about 15 minutes, lift the edges of the cloth toward the center of the colander to loosen the cheese from the cloth and facilitate draining.  If the ricotta is still too liquid and runny in texture after 30 minutes, gather the edges of the cloth together using 1 hand, wrap a piece of kitchen string around the gathered cloth to form a bag, and tie it closed.  Hang the bag containing the cheese from the faucet or the handle of a kitchen cabinet door and allow the excess whey to drip from the bag into the sink or a bowl.

If adding salt, transfer the ricotta to a sanitized bowl and stir in the salt.  Place the ricotta in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator.  Use within 5 days.

This recipe yields 3 1/4 cups.

  3        tablespoons  milk
  2        tablespoons  sugar

In a bowl, combine the flour and salt, add the butter, and blend the mixture with your fingertips or two knives until it resembles coarse meal.  Add the shortening and blend the mixture until it resembles meal.  Add the ice water, tossing the mixture with a fork, and adding more water if necessary to form a soft but not sticky dough.  Shape the dough into a ball.

The dough may be rolled out immediately or wrapped in waxed paper and chilled, for up to 2 days.  The dough may be frozen, wrapped in plastic wrap and foil, for up to 1 month.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

In a bowl, combine sugar, cranberries, apples, walnuts, raisins, orange juice, the zest, and the flour and toss gently.  Divide the filling among 8 individual pie tins or souffle cups.

On a lightly floured board, roll out the dough in a rectangle 1/8-inch thick.  Cut out 8 rounds 1/3-inch larger than pie tins or souffle cups and cut 1 slit in the middle.  Put a pastry round on top of each cup and brush with milk and sprinkle with sugar.  Pressing with the tines of a fork, seal the pastry to the rim of the cup.

Place the cups on a baking sheet and bake the pies in the middle of the oven for 15 minutes.  Reduce the temperature to 400 degrees and bake the pies for 10 minutes more, or until the crusts are golden.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                         Maple Syrup Creme Brulee

Recipe By     :Recipe adapted from Jacques Torres
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Custards                        Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/2                vanilla bean
  1              small  egg
  3              large  egg yolks
  7        tablespoons  grade B maple syrup
  4        tablespoons  demarara sugar -- for topping
  6                     four-ounce brulee molds

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Pour the heavy cream into a non-reactive saucepan and place over medium heat.  While the cream is heating, slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise, using a sharp paring knife.  Separate the seeds from the skin by scraping the bean with the knife.  Place the seeds and skin in the heating cream.  Scald the cream by heating it until bubbles start to form around the edge of the pan.  Remove from the heat.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the whole egg, egg yolks, and maple syrup until well blended.  Continue to whisk while slowly pouring the hot cream into the egg mixture and whisk until the mixture is smooth and homogenous in color.  Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the vanilla bean pieces and overcooked eggs.  Your next step will be made easier if you strain the mixture into a large measuring cup with a spout.

Place the molds on a baking sheet with 1-inch-high sides.  Fill the molds half-full with the custard and set the sheet in the oven (it's much easier to transfer the sheet with the molds only half-full).  Now, finish filling the molds to the top.  It is important to fill the molds to the top, as the custard will lose volume as it bakes.

Traditionally, creme brulee is baked in a hot water bath to insulate the custard from the direct heat of the oven and to keep the eggs from cooking too fast, which would cause them to separate.  Using hot water from the tap, pour enough water into the baking sheet to reach halfway up the sides of the molds.  If you are using a convection oven, however, a water bath is not needed because the even circulation of the air insulates the custard from the direct heat.

In either case, baking time is approximately the same, about 40 minutes.  When baked correctly, the custard should tremble slightly when gently shaken.  If you detect any liquid under the skin, the custard is under baked.  Put them back in the oven and shake them every 5 minutes or so until they are ready.

Remove the molds from the water bath and place on a cooling rack for 30 minutes.  Then refrigerate for 2 hours (or for up to 3 days) before serving; the custards will finish setting in the refrigerator.  Let the water bath cool before removing it from the oven.

Preheat the broiler.

If condensation occurs during chilling, carefully blot with a paper towel to remove moisture.  Place the molds on a clean baking sheet.  Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of the sugar over the top of the custards.  It is important to spread the sugar evenly; if it is too thick or too thin in places, the caramelization will not be even across the top.

When the broiler is hot, place the sheet about 4 inches under the broiler and broil until the sugar is caramelized.  Keep a close eye on the creme brulee during broiling.  They are finished when they are light brown.  Place each mold on a small dessert plate and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

<DirT>
Remove the molds from the water bath and place on a cooling rack for 30 minutes.  Then refrigerate for 2 hours (or for up to 3 days) before serving; the custards will finish setting in the refrigerator.  Let the water bath cool before removing it from the oven.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the broiler.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If condensation occurs during chilling, carefully blot with a paper towel to remove moisture.  Place the molds on a clean baking sheet.  Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of the sugar over the top of the custards.  It is important to spread the sugar evenly; if it is too thick or too thin in places, the caramelization will not be even across the top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the broiler is hot, place the sheet about 4 inches under the broiler and broil until the sugar is caramelized.  Keep a close eye on the creme brulee during broiling.  They are finished when they are light brown.  Place each mold on a small dessert plate and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  shallots -- minced
  1         tablespoon  dried thyme leaves
  3        tablespoons  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
  1 1/2         pounds  London broil (top round)
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  butter

Combine the shallots, thyme, brown sugar, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and oil in a freezer-type zip-top plastic bag.  Add the steaks.  Squeeze out as much air as possible and seal the bag.  Place the bag in a medium bowl in the refrigerator to marinate overnight, turning bag several times for even coating.

Heat a grill.

Drain the steaks, reserving the marinade.  There will not be much.  Pour the marinade into a small saucepan.  Rinse the bag with 1/4 cup water and add to marinade.  Simmer 4 to 5 minutes and stir in the butter.

Grill steaks to medium-rare, about 2 minutes each side.

Let stand 4 to 5 minutes before slicing.  Thinly slice at an angle across the grain, which runs up and down the short side of the steak.  Bring the marinade-butter mixture back to a boil, pour over the meat, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  8              large  mushrooms - (abt 1/2 lb total)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped shallot
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              large  eggs
  2                     puff pastry sheets - (from 17 1/4-oz pkg) -- thawed
     1/2           cup  Gorgonzola - (abt 5 oz)
                        === SAUCE ===
  2               cups  veal or beef demi-glace
  4        tablespoons  Sercial Madeira

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Pat filets mignons dry and season with salt and pepper.  Sear on both sides in saute pan with heated oil.  Chill filets, covered, until cold, about 1 hour.

Thinly slice mushrooms and in a heavy skillet cook in butter with shallot, garlic, and salt and pepper, to taste, over moderate heat, stirring, until mushrooms are lightly browned.  Transfer mushroom mixture to a bowl to cool completely.  In a small bowl lightly beat eggs to make an egg wash.

On a lightly floured surface roll out puff pastry sheets into 2 (14-inch) squares.  Trim edges to form 2 (13-inch) squares and cut each square into 4 (6 1/2-inch) squares.

Put 1 tablespoon Gorgonzola in center of 1 square and top with 1/8 of the mushroom mixture.  Top mushroom mixture with a filet mignon, pressing it down gently, and wrap 2 opposite corners of puff pastry over filet, overlapping them.  Seal seam with egg wash.  Wrap remaining 2 corners of pastry over filet and seal in same manner.  Seal any gaps with egg wash and press pastry around filet to enclose completely.

Arrange beef Wellington, seam-side down, in a non-stick-baking pan.  Make 7 more beef Wellingtons in same manner.  Chill remaining egg wash for brushing on pastry just before baking.  Chill beef Wellingtons, loosely covered, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Brush top and sides of each beef Wellington with some remaining egg wash and bake 20 to 30 minutes, or until pastry is golden and the meat temperature is 117 degrees.

Sauce:  Make sauce while beef Wellingtons are baking.  In a saucepan, boil demi-glace and Madeira 1 minute and keep sauce warm.  Serve beef Wellingtons with sauce.

                   Monterey Jack And Jalapeno Turnovers

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  2          teaspoons  finely-minced cilantro
  16            slices  fresh home-made type white bread -- crusts removed
  1                cup  shredded monterey jack cheese
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin seeds -- toasted
  1         tablespoon  minced pickled jalapeÒos
  1                     scallion -- minced

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Melt the butter with minced cilantro.  Roll out bread between two pieces of waxed paper until very thin.  Brush bread lightly on both sides with melted butter mixture.

In a bowl combine cheese, cumin, peppers, and scallions.  Place some of the filling, about 1 heaping teaspoon, in the center of each slice.  Fold making a triangle shape, trim edges.

Press the edges with your fingers to tightly seal.  Brush tops and bottoms with melted cilantro butter and crimp edges with fork.  (At this point, the turnovers can be placed in a zippered plastic freezer bag and frozen for future use.)

Place on parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes (20 to 25 minutes if taken out of the freezer) or until golden brown.  Serve warm with salsa dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 16 turnovers.

  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter, divided
  2             medium  shallots -- minced
  10            ounces  cultivated white mushrooms -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh thyme
                        = (or 1 tspn dried thyme)
     1/4           cup  dry sherry
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  1                     egg -- for egg wash
                        Salt -- to taste

  16            slices  very fresh thinly-sliced

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     Crumb Crust -- (see below)
  5           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- softened
  1 3/4           cups  sugar
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                     orange -- zested
  1                     lemon -- zested
  5              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
                        === CRUMB CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  finely-ground graham crackers - (5 oz)
                        = (or cookies such as chocolate or
                        vanilla wafers or gingersnaps)
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/3           cup  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt

Make Crumb Crust:  Stir together crust ingredients and press into bottom and 1 inch up side of a buttered 24-centimeter springform pan.  Fill right away or chill up to 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 550 degrees.

Beat together cream cheese, sugar, flour, and zests with an electric mixer until smooth.  Add eggs and yolks, one at a time, then vanilla, beating on low speed until each ingredient is incorporated and scraping down bowl between additions.

Put springform pan with crust in a shallow baking pan.  Pour filling into crust (springform pan will be completely full) and bake in a baking pan (to catch drips) in middle of oven 12 minutes, or until puffed.  Reduce temperature to 200 degrees and continue baking until cake is mostly firm (center will stay slightly wobbly when pan is gently shaken), about 1 hour more.

Run a knife around top edge of cake to loosen and cool completely in springform pan on a rack.  Chill cake, loosely covered, at least 6 hours.  Remove side of pan and transfer cake to a plate.  Bring to room temperature before serving.  Cheesecake keeps, covered and chilled, 2 weeks.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Omelets


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  onions -- chopped finely
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     baking potatoes, like russets -- (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
     1/4      teaspoon  saffron threads
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  6              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced scallion greens
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a 12-inch non-stick skillet cook onions in 2 tablespoons oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 20 minutes.  Transfer onions to a bowl and cool.

While onions are cooking, peel potatoes and cut into 1/4-inch cubes.  In a saucepan of boiling salted water cook potatoes until almost tender, about 8 minutes, and drain well in a colander.  Cool potatoes and add to onions.  Onion and potato mixture may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.

Crumble saffron threads into a small metal bowl.  In a small saucepan heat broth until hot and pour over saffron.  Let mixture stand until saffron is softened, about 5 minutes.

In a large bowl whisk together eggs, scallion greens, saffron mixture, and salt and pepper to taste and stir in onion and potato mixture.

In skillet set over moderately-high heat, heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil until hot but not smoking and add egg mixture, spreading potatoes evenly.  Reduce heat to moderate and cook omelet, stirring occasionally, until eggs just begin to set, about 1 minute.  Shift skillet so that 1/4 of omelet is directly over center of burner and cook 1 minute.  Shift skillet 3 more times, cooking remaining fourths in same manner.  Center skillet and cook omelet over low heat until almost set, about 4 minutes more.

Slide omelet, bottom-side down, onto baking sheet and invert omelet back into skillet.  Cook other side of omelet until golden, about 4 minutes.  Slide omelet onto a platter and cool to room temperature.

Omelet may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring omelet to room temperature before serving.

Cut omelet into wedges.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sugar
  1                cup  whole milk
  2               cans  evaporated milk - (5 oz ea)
  5              large  eggs
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                can  solid-pack pumpkin - (15 oz)
  2        tablespoons  premium golden agave tequila or bourbon
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        === PUMPKIN SEED PRALINE ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
  1                cup  hulled (green) pumpkin seeds -- toasted

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Cook 1 cup sugar in a dry 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately-low heat, stirring slowly with a fork, until melted and pale golden.  Cook caramel without stirring, swirling pan, until deep golden, about 5 minutes.

Quickly and carefully remove hot dish from oven and immediately pour caramel into dish, tilting it to cover bottom and sides.  (Leave oven on.)  Keep tilting as caramel cools and thickens enough to stay in place.

Scald whole milk with evaporated milk in a saucepan and remove from heat.  Beat eggs and remaining cup sugar with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.  Beat in salt, pumpkin, tequila, and spices.  Pour milk mixture through a sieve into a bowl and beat into pumpkin mixture in a slow stream until combined well.

Pour custard over caramel in dish and set in a water bath of 1-inch hot water.  Put pan in middle of oven and lower temperature to 350 degrees.  Bake until golden brown on top and a knife inserted in center comes out clean, about 1 1/4 hours, possibly longer.  Remove dish from water bath and transfer to a rack to cool.  Chill flan, covered, until cold, at least 6 hours.

To unmold flan, dip bottom of souffle dish briefly (20 to 30 seconds) in a warm water bath.  Then, run a thin knife around flan to loosen from sides of dish.  Wiggle dish from side to side and, when flan moves freely in dish, invert a large serving platter with a lip over dish.  Holding dish and platter securely together, quickly invert and turn out flan onto platter.  Caramel will pour out over and around it.  Cut flan into wedges and serve with caramel spooned over and with shards of Pumpkin Seed Praline.

For the Pumpkin Seed Praline:  Preheat oven to 250 degrees.   Lightly oil a large sheet of foil on a baking sheet and keep warm in oven.

Cook sugar, water, and a pinch of salt in a deep 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately-low heat, stirring slowly with a metal fork, until melted and pale golden.  Cook caramel without stirring, swirling pan, until deep golden.

Immediately stir in pumpkin seeds and quickly pour onto foil, spreading into a thin sheet before it hardens.  (If caramel hardens and is difficult to spread, put in a 400 degree oven until warm enough to spread, 1 to 2 minutes.)

Cool praline on baking sheet on a rack until completely hardened, then break into large pieces

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Mai Pham
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Spring/Summer Rolls             Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3         pound  pork shoulder -- untrimmed, and
                        cut into 2 pieces
  12            medium  raw shrimp -- unpeeled
  4             ounces  bun (rice vermicelli or rice sticks) -- boiled 5 minutes,
                        rinsed and drained - see Cook's Note
  1                cup  bean sprouts
     1/2           cup  mint leaves
  1              small  red-leaf lettuce head -- leaves separated,
                        and washed
  8                     dried round rice papers - (12" dia) -- plus extras
     1/2           cup  Vietnamese Bean Dipping Sauce -- (see below)
                        === VIETNAMESE BEAN DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  fermented whole soybeans
     1/2           cup  water
     1/3           cup  unsweetened coconut milk
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  3        tablespoons  chopped yellow onion
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        === GARNISH ===
  1         tablespoon  ground chile paste -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped Roasted Peanuts -- (see below)
                        === ROASTED PEANUTS ===
  1                cup  raw shelled peanuts -- skin removed

Cook's Note:  To cook bun, boil until the noodles are white and softened but still resilient, about 4 to 5 minutes, drain, rinse immediately in cold water and drain completely before serving.

Cook the pork in boiling salted water until it's done but still firm enough for slicing, about 30 minutes.

While the pork is cooking, bring another small pot of water to a boil.  Add the shrimp and cook until they turn pink, about 3 minutes.  Rinse under running water and set aside to drain.  When cool enough to handle, peel, de-vein, and cut in half lengthwise.  Refresh in cold water and set aside.

Remove pork from the heat and drain.  When it is cool enough to handle, slice into thin slices, about 1 by 2 1/2 inches.  Place on a small plate and set aside.

Set up a salad roll "station."  Line a cutting board with a damp kitchen towel.  Fill a large bowl with hot water and place it nearby.  (Keep some boiling water handy to add to the bowl.)  Arrange the ingredients in the order they will be used: the shrimp, pork, rice vermicelli, bean sprouts, mint and lettuce.

Working with 2 rice paper rounds at a time, dip 1, edge first into the hot water and turn it to wet completely, about 10 seconds.  Lay the round down on the towel.  Repeat with the second rice paper and place it alongside the first.  This allows you to work with 1 while the second is being set.

Line the bottom third of the rice paper round with 3 shrimp halves, cut-side up, and top with 2 slices of pork.  Add 1 tablespoon rice vermicelli, 1 tablespoon bean sprouts, and 4 to 5 mint leaves.  (Arrange the ingredients so the rolls will end up being about 5 inches long and 1-inch wide.)  Halve a lettuce leaf lengthwise along the center rib.  Roll up in 1 piece and place on the filling.  (Trim if it's too long.)

While pressing down on the ingredients, lift the bottom edge over the filling, then fold in 2 sides.  Roll into a cylinder about 1 1/2 inches wide and 4 to 5 inches long.  If the paper feels thick, stop three-quarters of the way and trim the end piece.  (Too much rice paper can make the rolls chewy.)  Repeat with the remaining rice papers and filling.

To serve, cut rolls into 2 or 4 pieces and place them upright on a plate. Serve with the Vietnamese Bean Dipping Sauce on the side.

Vietnamese Bean Dipping Sauce:  Place the soybeans, water, coconut milk, vinegar, onion and sugar in a blender or food processor and process just until smooth.  Transfer the mixture to a saucepan and bring to a boil over moderate heat.  (If you don't have a food processor, cook the soybean mixture first, then beat with a whisk.)  Reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce thickens enough to coat a spoon, about 5 minutes.  Add a little water if it's too thick.  Set aside to cool.

To serve, transfer to individual sauce bowls and garnish each with chile paste and chopped Roasted Peanuts.  This sauce will keep up to 2 weeks if refrigerated in a tight-lidded jar.

Roasted Peanuts:  Place the peanuts on a cookie tray and bake in a preheated 325 degree oven until golden, about 20 minutes.  Halfway into the baking, gently shake the tray so the peanuts roast evenly.  (You can also roast the peanuts in a dry pan over low heat).  Remove and set aside.  Use the peanuts whole or coarsely chop them with a mortar and pestle, a food processor or a knife.  (Makes 1 cup)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

        Roasted Pepper Gnocchi With Tomatoes, Olives, And Marjoram

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  Gaeta olives
  2             pounds  ripe plum tomatoes -- cut 1/2" dice
  1         tablespoon  fresh marjoram -- leaves only
                        === ROASTED PEPPER GNOCCHI ===
  1              pound  russet potatoes
  2             medium  red bell peppers -- roasted, cored,
                        seeded, and finely chopped
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                     extra-large egg -- beaten
  1           teaspoon  salt

Make the gnocchi dough.  In a large saucepan, boil the potatoes until they are soft, about 45 minutes.  While still warm, peel and pass through a vegetable mill or ricer onto a clean pasta board.  Place the chopped peppers in a towel and wring to extract as much liquid as possible.

Make a well in the center of the potatoes and sprinkle all over with the flour, using all the flour.  Place the egg, salt, and chopped pepper in the center of the well and, using a fork, stir into the flour and potatoes, just like making pasta.  Once the egg and roasted peppers are mixed in, bring the dough together, kneading gently until a ball is formed.  Knead gently another 4 minutes until the ball is dry to the touch.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add about 2 tablespoons salt.

Heat the olive oil in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan over medium heat until almost smoking.  Add the garlic and cook until light brown, about 30 seconds.  Add the olives and tomatoes and cook for 3 minutes.  Keep warm.

Divide the dough into 4 balls.  Flour the board and roll each ball into a 1-inch-thick rope.  Cut the rope into 1-inch-long pieces and let the pieces dry slightly before shaping.  Roll the pieces down the tines of a fork to establish the classic shape.  Repeat with the remaining gnocchi dough.  Drop the gnocchi, 10 to 15 at a time, into boiling water and cook until they float to the surface.

Gently remove with a slotted spoon and add to the pan with the olives and tomato.  Add the marjoram.  Toss until coated over medium heat, about 1 minute.  Place in a warm bowl and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                   Shallot Mashed Potatoes With Garlic

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  Burbank russet (Idaho) or
                        Yukon gold potatoes - (to 5) -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/3"-thick
  3             medium  shallots -- crushed, plus
  5                     shallots -- finely minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed, plus
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  4          teaspoons  salt -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  cider vinegar
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                cup  heavy or whipping cream
     1/2           cup  half-and-half or milk - (to 1)

Precook the potatoes by heating enough water (about 6 cups) to cover them in a large pot over high heat until hot but well below a simmer.  Turn heat down to low and add the potato slices, crushed shallots and garlic, 2 teaspoons salt, and vinegar.  The potatoes will cool the water down to about 160 degrees.

Cook at about this temperature, well below a simmer, for about 20 minutes.  Drain and run cold water over the potato slices to cool them.  Let them stand in water in the pot until you're ready to finish cooking, or drain, cover, and refrigerate.

When ready to mash, saute the minced shallots and garlic in butter over medium heat until just soft in a heavy, medium saucepan.  Stir in 2 teaspoons salt and the white pepper.  Add the cream and half-and-half and heat gently.  Set aside.

To finish cooking, add water to the cool potatoes if necessary, bring to a boil, and simmer until fork-tender, about 5 minutes at a simmer.  Drain, remove the crushed shallots and garlic, put the potatoes back in the pot, and heat for about 1 minute to dry them out.

To mash, push the potatoes once through a ricer or large-holed strainer into a medium mixing bowl.  Bring the shallot and cream mixture to a boil and stir into the hot mashed potatoes.  Taste and add more salt or pepper as needed.  Serve immediately.

Make ahead and serve hot:  Make complete mashed potatoes 1 day ahead, refrigerate overnight, cover tightly with foil and heat for 40 minutes in a 325 degree oven.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2           cup  fresh parsley leaves - (packed) -- washed, spun
                        dry, and minced
  3        tablespoons  fine dry bread crumbs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Whisk the batter well, and ladle about 2/3 cup into the pan.  Swirl so the batter completely covers the surface.  Neatly pile about 1 cup bean sprouts and 1/2 cup mushrooms on 1 side of the crepe, closer to the center than to the edge.  Reduce the heat slightly, cover the pan and cook until the edges pull away from the sides of the pan, about 5 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low.  Uncover and cook until the crepe is crisp and the chicken and shrimp are done, another 2 to 3 minutes.  Slip a spatula under the crepe to check on the bottom of the crepe.  If it's not brown, cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.

Lift the side of the crepe without bean sprouts and mushrooms and fold it over the covered side of the crepe.  Using a spatula, gently slide the crepe onto a large plate.  Wipe the pan clean and make the remaining crepes in the same way.  Be sure to oil the pan before beginning the next crepe.

To serve, place the crepes, Vietnamese Dipping Sauce and Table Salad on the table.  To eat, tear a piece of the banh xeo and wrap the lettuce or mustard leaves and herbs.  Roll into a packet, then dip into the sauce and eat.

Vietnamese Dipping Sauce:  Cut the chiles into thin rings.  Remove one-third of the chiles and set aside for garnish.  Place the remaining chiles, garlic, and sugar into a mortar and pound into a coarse, wet paste.  (If you don?t have a mortar, just chop with a knife.)  Transfer to small bowl and add the water, lime juice, and fish sauce.  Stir well to dissolve.  Add the reserved chiles and carrots.  Set aside for 10 minutes before serving.

Table Salad:  Arrange the greens in an attractive manner on one side of a large platter.  Place the cucumber, bean sprouts and herbs on the other side.  Place the platter in the center of the table and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lemongrass stalks -- outer layers peeled,
                        bottom white part thinly sliced and
                        finely chopped - (abt 1/4 cup)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  chopped Thai bird chiles
                        = (or another fresh chile)
     1/2      teaspoon  dried chile flakes
  1           teaspoon  ground turmeric
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  12            ounces  tofu -- drained, patted dry,
                        and cut into 3/4" cubes
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2                yellow onion -- cut 1/8" slices
  2                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  4        tablespoons  chopped Roasted Peanuts -- (see below)
  10                    pepper leaves -- shredded
                        = (or 2/3 cup loosely-packed
                        Asian basil leaves)
                        === ROASTED PEANUTS ===
  1                cup  raw shelled peanuts -- skin removed

Combine the lemongrass, soy sauce, chiles, chile flakes, turmeric, sugar, and salt in a bowl.  Add the tofu cubes and turn to coat them evenly.  Marinate for 30 minutes.

Heat half of the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately-high heat.  Add the onion, shallot and garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Reduce the heat to low and cook until the onions are soft, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to a plate and keep warm.

Wipe the pan clean and heat the remaining oil over moderate heat.  Add the tofu mixture and, using chopsticks or wooden spoons, turn so it cooks evenly, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the onion mixture and cook, uncovered, for another 2 to 3 minutes.  Add half the peanuts and all the pepper leaves.

Remove from the heat and transfer to a serving plate.  Garnish with the remaining peanuts and serve immediately with steamed rice.

Roasted Peanuts:  Place the peanuts on a cookie tray and bake in a preheated 325 degree oven until golden, about 20 minutes.  Halfway into the baking, gently shake the tray so the peanuts roast evenly.  (You can also roast the peanuts in a dry pan over low heat).  Remove and set aside.  Use the peanuts whole or coarsely chop them with a mortar and pestle, a food processor or a knife.  (Makes 1 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2           cup  hazelnuts - (3 oz)
  1         tablespoon  Sherry vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  minced shallot
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  4                     sheets phyllo dough -- thawed if frozen
     2/3          cups  blanched almonds
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus extra for phyll
  1              large  egg -- beaten lightly
  1                     egg yolk
     1/8      teaspoon  almond extract
  1 1/2          pints  small strawberries -- hulled
                        = (if large, halve lengthwise)
     1/2           cup  red currant jelly -- melted

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Brush a 14- by 1/2-inch rectangular tart pan with removable bottom with some butter.

On a work surface arrange 1 phyllo sheet with the short side facing you, brush with some butter and sprinkle with sugar.  Repeat layering procedure with remaining phyllo, buttering and sprinkling sugar with each layer.

Cut sheets vertically in half and place one on top of the other.  Place into prepared tart pan and press phyllo into pan with fingertips.  Trim excess dough to 1/2-inch around.  Fold edges back into the pan, to form a decorative edge.  Brush edge with remaining butter.

In a food processor blend the almonds and the sugar until a powder is formed, add the eggs and the almond extract, and blend the mixture until it is combined well.  Spoon the frangipane (it will be very thick) onto the phyllo, spread it carefully over the bottom.

Bake for 10 minutes, rotate pan and bake for additional 10 minutes or until the frangipane is puffed and golden.  Cool completely on a cooling rack, making sure the frangipane is cooled completely.

Carefully remove tart from pan.  Brush top of frangipane with some melted currant jelly and arrange the strawberries decoratively over the top.  Brush with remaining jelly to glaze.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Pate Brisee -- (see below)
  1              large  egg white -- lightly beaten
                        for egg wash
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh rhubarb -- cut 1" pieces
  1 3/4           cups  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1              pinch  ground cloves
  1               pint  strawberries -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch - (to 3) -- depending upon
                        the juiciness of the fruit
  3        tablespoons  black raspberry liqueur
                        = ( Chambord recommended)
  4              large  egg whites
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar -- or to taste
                        === PATE BRISEE ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut into bits
  2        tablespoons  vegetable shortening -- chilled
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  ice water - (to 3)

Pate Brisee:  In a bowl, blend the flour, butter, shortening, and salt until the mixture resembles meal.  Add the water, tossing with a fork and adding more water if necessary to form a soft by not sticky dough.

Form the dough into a ball, dust it with flour, and chill, wrapped in wax paper, for 1 hour.  The dough can be made 2 days ahead and kept refrigerated, wrapped in plastic wrap.  It can be frozen for 1 month, wrapped in plastic wrap and foil.  (Makes dough for 1 single-crust 9-inch pie)

Roll out the dough 1/8-inch thick on a floured surface and fit into a 9-inch pie plate.  Crimp the edge decoratively and prick the bottom with a fork.  Chill for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Line the shell with waxed paper and fill the paper with raw rice.  Bake in the lower third of the oven for 15 minutes.  Remove the rice and paper carefully and brush the shell with the egg wash.  Bake the shell for 15 minutes more, or until golden.  Let it cool on a rack.  The shell can be made 1 day ahead and stored, covered loosely, in a cool, dry place.

In a large bowl let the rhubarb macerate with 3/4 cup of the granulated sugar for 1 hour.  In a saucepan combine the rhubarb mixture with the cinnamon and cloves and bring to a boil.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the rhubarb is almost tender.  Add the strawberries and simmer, stirring, until the rhubarb is tender.

In a small bowl combine the cornstarch and the liqueur and add to the rhubarb mixture, stirring.  Cook over moderately-low heat until thickened.  Transfer the filling to a bowl and let it cool.  Chill, covered, overnight.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg whites until foamy.  Add the cream of tartar and salt and beat until the whites hold soft peaks.  Beat in the remaining 1 cup granulated sugar, a little at a time, and beat until the whites hold stiff peaks.  Beat in the vanilla and transfer 1/3 of the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a decorative tip.

Spoon the filling into the shell and spread the remaining meringue over it, smoothing the top.  With the tip of a small knife, score the top, forming a latticework pattern.  With the pastry bag, pip meringue over the top of the pie, following the lattice design.

Sift the confectioners' sugar over the pie and bake it on a baking sheet in the middle of the oven to 10 minutes.  Put the pie under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat until golden.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  long-grain Thai jasmine sticky rice
                        === SAUCE SYRUP ===
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  palm sugar or light brown sugar
  2                     long strips pandanus leaves  - (to 3)
                        = (or 1 to 2 drops orange or
                        almond extract)
  1                cup  fresh unsweetened coconut milk
                        === TOPPING SYRUP ===
  2                     long strips pandanus leaves  - (to 3)
                        = (or 1 to 2 drops orange or
                        almond extract)
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
  1                cup  fresh unsweetened coconut cream
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Sliced mango
                        Sliced pears
                        Sliced peaches
                        Sliced kiwis

Sticky Rice:  Line a steamer basket insert of a pot with fresh corn husks or soaked dried corn husks (used as Mexican tamale wrappers).  Spray the corn husks with vegetable oil spray to prevent sticking.  Spread the soaked rice evenly over the husks.

Fill the pot with water to come to just under the steamer basket insert.  Put the steamer basket insert into the pot, cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Steam the rice for at least 20 minutes, or longer.  Transfer the rice to a serving bowl when ready to serve.  Cover the rice with some corn husks to keep it moist and warm.

Reheating Sticky Rice:  Divide the leftover cooked rice into small serving portions, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate.  The rice will keep well for 2 to 3 days.  The easiest and best way to reheat the sticky rice is by microwave.  Warm the wrapped sticky rice in the plastic it was stored in on high power for 1 to 2 minutes, or until hot.  To reheat by steaming, unwrap the sticky rice and follow the above method for cooking sticky rice.

After you've prepared the rice, make the Sauce Syrup:  Combine the sugar, palm sugar, pandanus leaves, if using, and the coconut milk in a 2-quart saucepan.  Heat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved.  Without increasing the heat, allow the coconut cream to come to a gentle boil, and boil and thicken for 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove the saucepan from the heat.  Cover to keep warm.  Leave the pandanus leaves in the syrup until you are ready to make the syrup for topping, or, if you are using extract, add it now.

To make the Topping Syrup, if you are using pandanus leaves, pull them out of the sauce syrup and place them in a 2-quart saucepan.  Add the sugar, salt, and coconut cream.  Heat over low to medium-low heat until the sugar and salt dissolve; do not let the coconut cream boil, or it will curdle.  Let the syrup simmer slowly until it thickens, 7 to 10 minutes.  Remove the saucepan from the heat.  Leave the pandanus leaves in the syrup until ready to be used.  Or, if you are using extract instead, add it now and stir well.  Pour the mixture into a medium bowl and set aside.

To make sticky rice dessert, put the hot rice in a large mixing bowl.  Pour the warm Sauce Syrup over the rice, mixing well with a wooden spoon.  The mixture will be soupy.  Cover tightly with clear plastic wrap and let the rice absorb the syrup for about 10 minutes, then stir the rice mixture again with the wooden spoon.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap again and let it rest for another 10 minutes.

To shape the rice for serving, dip your hands in a bowl of cool water and shake off excess droplets.  Scoop a handful of rice at a time from the bowl and mold it into an oval shape.  Or shape the rice by using a rubber spatula to scoop up a mound of rice onto a large oval wooden spoon, shape it with the spoon, and transfer the mound to a serving platter.  The rice may stick to the spatula, so dip it in cold water and shake off excess droplets before scooping more rice.

Put the rice on a serving platter or individual plates.  Spoon the thickened coconut Syrup Topping over the rice.  Garnish with sliced fruits, such as, mango, pears, peaches or kiwi.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Sticky Rice:  Line a steamer basket insert of a pot with fresh corn husks or soaked dried corn husks (used as Mexican tamale wrappers).  Spray the corn husks with vegetable oil spray to prevent sticking.  Spread the soaked rice evenly over the husks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill the pot with water to come to just under the steamer basket insert.  Put the steamer basket insert into the pot, cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Steam the rice for at least 20 minutes, or longer.  Transfer the rice to a serving bowl when ready to serve.  Cover the rice with some corn husks to keep it moist and warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reheating Sticky Rice:  Divide the leftover cooked rice into small serving portions, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate.  The rice will keep well for 2 to 3 days.  The easiest and best way to reheat the sticky rice is by microwave.  Warm the wrapped sticky rice in the plastic it was stored in on high power for 1 to 2 minutes, or until hot.  To reheat by steaming, unwrap the sticky rice and follow the above method for cooking sticky rice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
After you&apos;ve prepared the rice, make the Sauce Syrup:  Combine the sugar, palm sugar, pandanus leaves, if using, and the coconut milk in a 2-quart saucepan.  Heat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved.  Without increasing the heat, allow the coconut cream to come to a gentle boil, and boil and thicken for 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove the saucepan from the heat.  Cover to keep warm.  Leave the pandanus leaves in the syrup until you are ready to make the syrup for topping, or, if you are using extract, add it now.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Topping Syrup, if you are using pandanus leaves, pull them out of the sauce syrup and place them in a 2-quart saucepan.  Add the sugar, salt, and coconut cream.  Heat over low to medium-low heat until the sugar and salt dissolve; do not let the coconut cream boil, or it will curdle.  Let the syrup simmer slowly until it thickens, 7 to 10 minutes.  Remove the saucepan from the heat.  Leave the pandanus leaves in the syrup until ready to be used.  Or, if you are using extract instead, add it now and stir well.  Pour the mixture into a medium bowl and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make sticky rice dessert, put the hot rice in a large mixing bowl.  Pour the warm Sauce Syrup over the rice, mixing well with a wooden spoon.  The mixture will be soupy.  Cover tightly with clear plastic wrap and let the rice absorb the syrup for about 10 minutes, then stir the rice mixture again with the wooden spoon.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap again and let it rest for another 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To shape the rice for serving, dip your hands in a bowl of cool water and shake off excess droplets.  Scoop a handful of rice at a time from the bowl and mold it into an oval shape.  Or shape the rice by using a rubber spatula to scoop up a mound of rice onto a large oval wooden spoon, shape it with the spoon, and transfer the mound to a serving platter.  The rice may stick to the spatula, so dip it in cold water and shake off excess droplets before scooping more rice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the rice on a serving platter or individual plates.  Spoon the thickened coconut Syrup Topping over the rice.  Garnish with sliced fruits, such as, mango, pears, peaches or kiwi.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     veal scaloppine - (abt 3 oz ea)
  8                     very thin slices prosciutto - (abt 4 oz)
  8             ounces  fresh mozzarella -- cut into 8 slices
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry Marsala
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh flat-parsley

Lay a sheet of plastic wrap out on a work surface.  Place a piece of veal on the plastic, and cover with another sheet of plastic.  Pound the meat with a meat pounder or other flat utensil until it is uniformly 1/8-inch thick.  Repeat with remaining pieces.  (The butcher could also do this step.)

Lay the veal out on the work surface.  Top each piece with a slice of prosciutto and then a slice of cheese.  Fold the veal over to completely enclose the prosciutto and cheese and secure with toothpicks.  You should have nice little flat packages about 3 by 2 inches.  Sprinkle both sides of the veal with salt and pepper, to taste.  Place the flour on a small plate and dredge the veal packages in the flour, shaking off any excess.

Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  When the butter foam subsides, add the meat and brown on both sides, turning as necessary.  Reduce the heat if necessary to keep the veal from burning.  When the packages are golden brown, transfer them to a heated plate.

Add the Marsala to the pan juices and stir well to release the browned bits on the bottom of the pan.  Reduce the heat to low, return the veal to the pan, and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, with a lid slightly ajar, until the meat is tender and cooked through.

Return the veal to the heated plate.  Add the lemon juice and parsley to the pan, increase the heat, and cook for 1 minute, or until the sauce has thickened.

To serve, remove the toothpicks and serve 2 little suitcases, drizzled with the sauce, per person.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

            Winter Salad With Toasted Mustard Seed Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  fennel bulbs
                        = (sometimes called anise)
  2        tablespoons  mustard seeds
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  1              small  shallot -- finely chopped
  1              large  romaine head - (2 lbs) -- torn bite size
  1              large  frisee head - (1 lb) -- torn bite size
  3                     Belgian endives -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/2"-wide slices
  1                cup  fresh flat-leaf parsley

Trim fennel stalks flush with bulbs and discard stalks.  Quarter bulbs lengthwise and cut out most of cores, leaving enough to keep pieces intact.  Cut quarters lengthwise into thin slices.

Fennel may be trimmed and sliced 1 day ahead and chilled in a sealable plastic bag lined with dampened paper towels.

Toast mustard seeds in a dry small heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until mustard seeds begin to pop and turn 1 shade darker, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to a plate to cool.

Whisk together vinegar, Dijon mustard, and salt and pepper, to taste, then add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified.  Stir in shallot and mustard seeds.

Dressing may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring to room temperature and season before serving.

Toss together fennel, romaine, frisee, endives, and parsley in a large bowl.  Serve with dressing on side.

This recipe yields 8 servings.
