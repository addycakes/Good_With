              'Stuffed' Pork Chops With Sausage And Apricots

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     thinly cut boneless pork loin chops
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1                cup  chicken stock -- divided, plus
                        a splash
  1              pound  Italian bulk sausage
  2                     celery ribs -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
     1/2                red bell pepper -- chopped
  6                     dried apricots -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped sage leaves
                        = (or 1 tspn dried sage)
     1/4           cup  heavy cream

Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Season chops with salt and pepper.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil to hot skillet then add the chops and sear to caramelize the meat on each side, 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer chops to a pan or casserole dish and add 1/2 cup chicken stock to help the meat remain moist while it finishes cooking -- just eyeball the amount.  Loosely cover the dish or pan with foil before placing in the oven.

Return pan to the stove and add another tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil.  Add Italian sausage and crumble it as it browns.  Add celery and onions and cook 2 or 3 minutes then add red bell pepper and apricots.  Cook 2 minutes, then add parsley and sage and another 1/2 cup of chicken stock.  Reduce heat and cook stuffing 5 or 6 minutes longer until apricots are tender and plump.  Add a splash of chicken stock and 1/4 cup heavy cream to moisten stuffing.

To serve, remove chops from oven.  Place 4 chops on individual plates or on a platter.  Mound sausage and vegetables on first chop, then top with second chop and pour gravy down over the top of stacked chops and filling.  The pan drippings may also be added to the gravy to stretch the amount.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    jumbo raw shrimp - (16/20 count) -- peeled, deveined
  12             large  sea scallops -- trimmed, and
                        well drained
  1                     lime -- juiced, zested
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  grill seasoning
                        = (or coarse salt and black pepper)
  1           teaspoon  hot red pepper flakes
  12            slices  center-cut or applewood smoked bacon -- cut in halves
                        Toothpicks -- as needed
  3                     scallions -- very thinly sliced
                        on an angle

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Place shrimp and scallops in a shallow dish or bowl.  Dress seafood with lime juice and zest, a generous drizzle of sesame oil, grill seasoning and hot pepper flakes.  Wrap each shrimp and scallop with a half slice of bacon.  Wrap each shrimp working from head to tail, pulling bacon snuggly around the shrimp.  Wrap the bacon around the outside of each scallop.  Fasten bacon in place as necessary with picks.

Arrange the shrimp and scallops on a slotted baking pan, such as a broiler pan, to allow draining while bacon crisps.  Bake shrimp and scallops 10 to 14 minutes, until shrimp is pink and curled, scallops are opaque and bacon is crisp.  Shrimps may finish before the scallops.

Arrange cooked seafood on platter and sprinkle with chopped scallions.

This recipe yields 24 pieces.

  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2         pound  angel hair -- cooked just shy of
                        al dente, about 4 or 5 minutes

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

To a small skillet preheated over medium heat, add extra-virgin olive oil, onion and garlic.  Cook onions 5 minutes, until translucent.  Add wine to the pan and reduce for 30 seconds.  Add tomatoes and break up the sliced stewed tomatoes with a wooden spoon as they heat through.  When the sauce comes to a boil (2 or 3 minutes) remove it from the heat and stir in the parsley.

Season the fish with salt and pepper.  Pour a few spoonfuls of sauce into the bottom of a shallow baking dish.  Add fish to the dish in a single layer.  Add remaining sauce and bake 15 to 17 minutes until fish is firm and opaque.

Remove fish to serving plate or dinner plates.  Spoon a few bits of tomato and sauce over the fish.  To the remaining sauce in the baking dish add 2 tablespoons butter cut into small pieces.  Add hot pasta to butter and sauce and turn pasta in dish to coat evenly and to allow pasta to absorb juices.  Pile pasta alongside fish and serve.

If you are entertaining, try bundling portions of pasta around a large, 2-pronged meat fork, by twisting the fork in the pasta allowing it to curl up the fork.  Shimmy the twisted pasta off the fork on to a plate you will create pasta "nests."  This simple "twist" adds a lot to the plate presentation.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  bucatini (tube pasta)
                        Salt -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  pancetta* - (4 or 5 slices) -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  4                     garlic cloves - (to 6) -- chopped
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, Grana
                        Padano or Romano -- to pass at the table

* Pancetta is Italian rolled, cured pork, similar to bacon, but not smoked.  Look for it at your deli counter.  Bacon may be substituted resulting in a smoky tomato sauce.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and salt the water.

Heat a large deep pan over medium-high heat.  Add oil and pancetta.  Cook pancetta 2 or 3 minutes then add onions and garlic and crushed red pepper flakes.  Cook 7 or 8 minutes more, until onions are translucent.  Add tomatoes and parsley.  Season the sauce with salt and pepper.  Simmer sauce over low heat until ready to serve.

Cook bucatini pasta to al dente or, with a bite to it.  Drain pasta well.  Do not rinse.  Starchy pasta holds more sauce.  Toss hot pasta with sauce and serve.  Pass grated cheese at the table.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1         tablespoon  butter -- cut into pieces
  12                    regular marshmallows
  2               cups  puffed rice cereal
                        = (Kellogg's Rice Krispies cereal
                        recommended)
  4                     any brand, any flavor, fruit roll-ups
                        = (pressed dried 8" fruit rounds)
  8                     strips licorice candy -- any flavor
                        = (Twizzler's brand recommended ñ pieces

                        width of roll-ups)

Melt butter in a medium saucepan over low heat and add marshmallows.  Stir marshmallows until completely melted.  Remove mixture from heat and add cereal.  Stir to coat cereal evenly in melted marshmallows.

Roll out the fruit roll-ups.  Place 1/4 of the coated cereal onto each fruit roll up and spread and gather toward 1 side of roll up.  Place 2 licorice twists onto the center of the spread out cereal mix.  Wrap and roll the candy and fruit, maneuvering the licorice to the center of the roll, so that the finished product resembles a sushi roll.  Repeat with remaining rolls.

Place a sharp knife into a bowl of very warm water.  Cut candy sushi with warm knife and arrange on a plate then serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                               Cheese Fries

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bag frozen French fries, any brand or shap -- prepared to package
                        directions
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
  1                     bag shredded yellow Cheddar - (10 oz)
     1/4           cup  ketchup -- more or less

Put fries in oven on a cookie sheet.

While fries are baking in the oven, place a sauce pot on the stove and heat it over medium heat.  Add butter and melt it.  Add the flour and stir.  Cook butter and flour together for 1 minute or so.  This is called "roux" and it helps to thicken up sauces.

Use a whisk to stir as the milk goes into the pot.  Keep stirring until the milk gets thicker.  Use a wooden spoon or heat-safe spatula to stir in the cheese.  When all of the cheese melts, take the sauce off the heat and stir in 3 squirts of ketchup.

Pour the sauce over the fries or serve the sauce on the side if you like dipping better.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme leaves
  1                cup  pre-sliced fresh mushrooms
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                can  stewed tomatoes with peppers, onions and
                        celery - (15 oz)
  2                     roasted red peppers -- drained
  1                cup  tomato sauce
  1            package  chopped frozen spinach -- thawed, drained
  6               cups  chicken broth
  1            package  chicken breast tenders - (3/4 to 1 lb)
  1              pound  fresh ravioli -- any flavor
  1                cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Romano -- to pass at table
                        Crusty Italian bread or rolls -- to pass at table

Heat a big soup pot over medium-high heat.

Whack the garlic with a fist or the palm of your hand.  Separate the skins from the smashed garlic and throw just the skins away into the garbage bowl.  Whack the 3 cloves of garlic with the bottom of a small saucepan.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, to the soup pot.  Throw in the garlic and 2 stems each of the rosemary and fresh thyme herbs.  The leaves will fall off the stems and give a delicious and really cool flavor to your special stew.  Add the mushrooms, too and help stir as the mushrooms cook 3 to 5 minutes.  Season the mushrooms up with a little salt and pepper as they're cooking.

Next, open the can of tomatoes and pour into the soup pot.  Use a sharp, small knife to chop the red roasted bell peppers into bite-size pieces.  Add the chopped up roasted red peppers to the tomatoes and stir.  Squeeze as much liquid as possible out of the spinach.  Add spinach, tomato sauce and chicken broth to the pot. Stir until the spinach is all broken up in the broth.  Cover the soup and raise the heat to high.

Cut up the chicken on a separate cutting board from the one you cut up the vegetables on.  Cut the chicken tenders into 1-inch pieces across and add them to the stew.  Wash up right away with lots of soap and hot water so that the raw chicken doesn't get on anything else in the kitchen or any other food.

When the stew comes up to a boil again, add the ravioli and leave the lid off.  Cook stew until the ravioli is almost done, about 5 minutes.  Turn off the heat and let the stew cool down a little bit.  Serve up the stew and pass cheese and bread at the table to go with it.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Accompaniment                   Compound Butters

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             sticks  butter
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped cilantro leaves
  1                     lime -- juiced, zested

Cut butter into chunks.  Place butter in a bowl.  Place bowl in microwave and cook on high for 15 seconds.  To chop herbs super-fine, hold the tip of your knife on a cutting board and move the back of your knife up and down very fast going over the herbs again and again.  Stir in chopped cilantro and lime zest and juice into the butter using a rubber spatula.  Transfer the butter onto a large strip of plastic wrap.

Gather the ends of the plastic wrap in on 1 hand and use a straight edge, like a small cookie sheet pan, to push the butter back and away from your body making the butter take on a log shape.  Gently roll the log wrapped in plastic back and forth on the countertop to evenly round out the shape.  Twist up the extra wrap on the ends and place the compound butter log into the freezer to make the butter cold enough to slice again.

This recipe yields 1/2 pound.

                        smoked Cheddar cheese
  3        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  4                     extra large eggs
  4             slices  thick-cut bread/ 1" to 1 1/2" thick

                        skins
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper or several drops hot sauce
                        = (Tabasco recommended)
                        Chopped fresh cilantro leaves -- for garnish
                        === YELLOW TOMATO SALSA ===
                        = (Any flavor or variety of store-bought
                        salsa that you may have in your pantry is
                        a fine substitute here as well)
  3             medium  or 2 large yellow tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
     1/2        medium  red onion -- finely chopped
  1                     serrano or jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, chopped fine
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro or parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste

Chop all veggies for hash.  Pierce potatoes with a fork and cook on high in microwave 5 minutes.  Remove potatoes from microwave oven and cool for 5 minutes.

While potatoes are working, add chopped bacon to a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown until crisp.  Remove to paper towels to drain, wipe pan and return to heat.

Preheat your broiler to high.  Preheat a nonstick griddle pan for frying eggs over medium heat.

Chop or wedge potatoes.  Add oil to the skillet which you returned to the heat, then potatoes.  Begin to brown and crisp potatoes, 2 minutes on each side.  Use this time to chop your salsa ingredients.

Combine salsa in a small bowl and season with salt.

Back to the hash; add the mushrooms to potatoes.  Brown mushrooms a minute or 2, then add peppers and onions and season mixture with grill seasoning blend or salt and pepper, then hot sauce.  Cook 3 to 5 minutes longer until veggies are just tender and potatoes are cooked through.  Turn off heat and add bacon back to the pan.  Combine bacon with the veggies then add cheese to the pan to evenly cover the mixture.  Tent the skillet with foil to gently melt cheese over vegetables and potatoes and to retain heat.

Add a couple pats, 1/2 tablespoon butter, to preheated griddle pan.  Crack extra-large eggs on to griddle and fry to desired doneness.  Eggs may, of course, be scrambled as well.  As you like!

Place thick cut bread under broiler and toast 6 inches from heat on both sides.  Place 2 tablespoons butter in a small cup with a clove of garlic and ground cayenne pepper or a few drops of hot sauce.  Melt in microwave for 30 seconds.

Brush toast with garlic cayenne butter and sprinkle with parsley.  Remove from broiler.

Transfer vegetable and bacon hash to plates.  Top each portion with a single fried egg or arrange the fried eggs evenly over the platter.  Serve with Texas garlic toast and serve the salsa on the side to compliment either menu item.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        = (or store-bought prepared basil pesto)
                        === WATERCRESS AND HAZELNUT PESTO ===
  12            ounces  watercress -- stems removed
     1/2           cup  hazelnuts -- toasted

                        === SAMMIES ===
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling, plus
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     sweet Italian sausage patties - (4 oz ea)
  1                     cubanelle pepper -- seeded, sliced
                        = (long sweet Italian light-green pepper)
  1             medium  yellow-skinned onion -- sliced
                        Salt -- to taste

  8             slices  Italian bread or white bread
  8             slices  deli-sliced provolone

Heat the milk over moderate heat in a medium pot.  Put tomatoes, tomato paste, onions, salt and pepper, sugar, flour, butter, celery into a food processor and grind until smooth.  Pour mixture into milk and raise heat to bring soup to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes.  While soup cooks, make pesto and sammies.

Fill the food processor with watercress, loosely packed.  Add hazelnuts, 1/2 of the oil and garlic cloves to the watercress in the processor.  Add nutmeg, salt and pepper to the processor bowl, set lid in place and pulse grind the mixture into a thick paste.  Add any remaining watercress to the processor and grind into the paste by pulsing the processor again.  Transfer watercress paste to a bowl.  Stir in the remaining oil and the cheese.  Taste pesto sauce and adjust seasonings.

Heat a griddle over medium-high heat.  Drizzle the pan with extra-virgin olive oil and add the patties and cook 5 minutes on each side.  Remove from the griddle and add another tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and the peppers and onions.  Season the peppers and onions and cook until just tender, 5 minutes.  Remove them from the griddle.

Wipe the griddle clean and reduce heat to medium-low.  Assemble sandwiches: place 4 slices of bread down, top with 1/4 each of the peppers onions, then a slice of cheese, a cooked sausage patty, another slice of cheese and then place bread on top.  Add butter to griddle and cook sammy melts 2 or 3 minutes on each side until golden and cheese is melted.  Press with spatula as sammies cook or set another heavy skillet on sammies to weigh them down.

Pour soup into shallow bowls and add a couple of rounded spoonfuls of pesto to each dish and stir it into the soup.  Cut the patty melts corner to corner and dip in the soup as you eat.

        Creamy, Lemony, Pepper-Parmesan Dressing On Romaine Salad

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  mayonnaise - (heaping)
  1                     lemon -- zested, juiced
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1              pinch  salt
  3                     romaine lettuce hearts -- chopped

Combine the mayonnaise, lemon zest (grated yellow part of lemon) and lemon juice.  To get the juice out of a lemon, heat it up in microwave for 10 seconds on high.  Cut the lemon across in half.  Squeeze the lemon halves while holding them upright over the dressing bowl so that the seeds stay with the lemon halves, not in the dressing!  Add pepper to the dressing bowl, too.

Whisk the dressing and pour in the extra-virgin olive oil while you whisk.  If you pour in a slow, steady stream, 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil will pour out in a count to the number six.  Once the oil is combined with the acid (the lemon juice) and the mayonnaise, you can switch utensils and stir in the cheese and a pinch of salt with a spoon or rubber spatula.

Chop up the lettuce into 2-inch pieces.  Place the lettuce in a salad bowl and top with the dressing when you are ready to serve dinner.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  corn flakes
  1                cup  plain bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2         pounds  chicken breast tenders -- cut 2" pieces
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  2                     eggs -- beaten
     1/4           cup  honey mustard
                        = (Gulden's recommended)
     1/4           cup  barbecue sauce

Turn the oven on to 375 degrees.

In a pie pan or other shallow, large dish, pour out the corn flakes.  Crush the cereal up with your hands.  Mix in bread crumbs, sugar, salt, pepper, and allspice.

Drizzle about 3 tablespoons vegetable oil evenly over the breading, tossing and turning it to mix the oil all through the bread crumbs and crushed-up corn flakes.

Cut the chicken fingers into toes, 2-inch pieces.  Turn the chicken in flour, eggs and then in the special crunchy breading.  Arrange the chicken toes on a nonstick baking sheet.  Place the chicken toes in the oven and cook 15 minutes or until crisp and brown all over.

Mix together honey mustard and barbecue sauce in a small bowl.  Serve hot chicken toes with honey mustard and barbecue sauce for dipping.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
     1/2                red onion -- finely chopped
  1                can  black beans - (15 oz)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground chipotle chili powder or cumin
  2          teaspoons  hot sauce
                        = (Tabasco or Frank's Red Hot recommended)
  4              large  or extra-large eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                jar  tomatillo salsa - (16 oz)
                        = (salsa verde or green salsa)
  1 1/2           cups  shredded sharp Cheddar
  4              small  flour tortillas - (6" 8" dia)
                        === GARNISHES ===
                        Chopped cilantro or parsley
                        Finely-chopped scallions, chives or
                        red onions
                        Sour cream or yogurt

Heat a skillet.  Add extra-virgin olive oil and the onion.  Cook until slightly softened.  Add the black beans, chipotle and hot sauce.  Cook until well heated through.  Turn heat down to low and keep warm.

Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium-low heat.  When hot, drizzle pan with extra-virgin olive oil and add eggs.  Cook eggs gently, 2 at a time, with a couple inches between each egg, to desired doneness, over easy to over hard.  Season the eggs with salt and pepper on 1 or both sides.

Take the lid off of the salsa.  Place container in the microwave and warm through, 45 seconds on high.

Spoon salsa over the eggs once you turn them.  Place a large handful of shredded Cheddar on top of each salsa covered egg.  Cover the pan loosely with a tin foil tent to melt cheese.

If you have a gas top stove, heat and blister the tortillas individually, holding them with tongs, over the open flame of a burner, 15 to 20 seconds on each side.  Otherwise, warm tortillas according to package directions for the microwave oven.

To assemble, place a tortilla on a plate.  Top with a generous serving-spoonful of warm black beans, top the beans with a fried egg, salsa and cheese.  Finish off this killer, 24-hour belly-pleaser with a sprinkle of cilantro or parsley and chopped scallions, chives or red onion, sour cream or yogurt.

This recipe yields 4 servings, easily adjusted for 1 or some.

        Grilled T-Bones With Chipotle Rub And Cilantro-Lime Butter

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Cilantro-Lime Butter -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  steak seasoning blend for the grill
                        = (Montreal Seasoning by McCormick
                        recommended)
  1         tablespoon  chipotle (smoky) ground chili powder
                        = (or dark chili powder)
  1         tablespoon  sweet paprika
  4                     T-bone steaks, 1 1/2" thick

Preheat a two-burner grill pan over high heat or a table-top electric grill to high or preheat the outdoor grill.

Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and unwrap.

Combine the steak seasoning blend with hot chipotle pepper and sweet paprika.  A tablespoon is about a palm full of powdered or ground seasonings.  Rub the seasoning blend into the steaks, distributing the spices evenly among them.  Go wash up.

Using tongs, place steaks on screaming-hot grill, carefully place the thin tip of 1 steak facing the wide end of the next so that all 4 steaks fit onto the grill pan or grill grate at the same time.  Cook steaks 6 to 7 minutes on each side for medium doneness.  Remove steaks and let them rest so that the juices can redistribute, 5 minutes.

When ready to serve, top steaks with disks of sliced compound butter and serve with salad or vegetables on the side.  The smashed cheesy potatoes and sauteed sliced vegetables make especially tasty side dishes for these steaks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3         pounds  ground sirloin
  1              large  egg -- beaten
     2/3           cup  Italian bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano
     1/2         small  green bell pepper -- chopped
  1              small  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  corkscrew shaped pasta with lines -- (cavatappi)
                        = (or small shell pasta)
                        === THREE CHEESE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  shredded sharp Cheddar
     1/2           cup  shredded asiago cheese
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  Italian bread crumbs
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped rosemary leaves - (to 3)
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley

Put a large pot of water on to boil for pasta.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Place meat in a bowl.  Make a well in meat.  Fill well with egg, bread crumbs, 1/4 cup cheese, peppers, onions, garlic, tomato paste, salt and pepper.  Mix meat and breading and form 4 individual oval meat loaves, 1-inch thick.  Coat loaves with extra-virgin olive oil and arrange on a baking sheet.  Roast 18 to 20 minutes.

When the pasta water boils, salt water and add pasta.  Cook until slightly undercooked -- pasta will continue to cook when combined with cheese sauce.

Melt butter in a saucepan and add flour.  Whisk in milk.  Bring to a bubble.  Thicken milk, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add cheeses: Cheddar, asiago, 1/2 cup Parmesan and black pepper.  Stir to melt cheeses.

Drain pasta and combine with melted cheese sauce and transfer to a baking dish or casserole.  Place bread crumbs in a bowl and add extra-virgin olive oil and herbs to bread crumbs.  Top pasta with bread crumbs.  Place under a broiler and brown bread crumbs.  Serve cheese and pasta alongside meat loaf.

  2        tablespoons  butter

  1                     box golden raisins - (2 oz)
                        === OLIVE AND PEPPER SALSA ===
  1                cup  Spanish olives with pimentos -- drained, chopped
  2                     vine-ripe tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  1              small  green bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  1              small  white-skinned onion -- chopped
                        Several drops hot sauce
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
     1/2                lemon or lime -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === AVOCADO AND GARLIC SOUR CREAM ===
  2                     ripe avocados -- pitted, and

     1/2                lemon -- juiced

Stir and lightly brown the chicken, then add the rice and cook another 1 to 2 minutes.  Add chicken stock, poultry seasoning, Sazon seasoning, tomato sauce and raisins.  Bring the stock to a quick boil, 2 or 3 minutes.  When the liquid boils, reduce heat to low and cook 13 to 15 minutes, until rice is tender but still a little chewy in the center.

While the rice and chicken are working, prepare the salsa.  Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and adjust the salt and hot sauce, to taste.  Next prepare the Avocado and Garlic Sour Cream by adding all ingredients to a food processor and processing until smooth.  Adjust seasoning, then transfer to a small bowl.

Stir 1/2 cup of prepared Olive and Pepper Salsa to the chicken and rice mixture.  Turn off heat and let stand 5 minutes.

Serve the prepared Latin rice and chicken in shallow bowls with spoonfuls of salsa and avocado cream to garnish.  Serve any remaining salsa and sour cream with plantains and corn chips for dipping and scooping.

     1/2         pound  small white mushrooms -- sliced
     1/2         small  white onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

  1                cup  frozen green peas
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf or curly parsley

Preheat oven according to package directions for biscuits.  Arrange biscuits on nonstick baking sheet and sprinkle with a little ground cayenne pepper or sweet paprika then place biscuits into a preheated oven.  Bake until golden, remove biscuits from oven and then cool.

Preheat a second skillet over medium heat.  Add oil and butter.  When butter melts into oil, add mushrooms and onion and cook 5 minutes until tender.  Add flour and cook another minute.

Pull chicken from broth and set on cutting board.  Ladle cooking liquid into the mushrooms, whisking it in.  Add 2 to 2 1/2 cups of liquid and discard the bay leaf.  Add pimentos and peas to the sauce.  Dice chicken into bite-size pieces and slide into bubbling sauce.

Split the biscuits, place bottoms on dinner plates and cover with ladles of Chicken A La King.  Cap with biscuit tops and garnish with chopped parsley.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

         Marinated Grilled Flank Steak With BLT Smashed Potatoes

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  grill seasoning blend
                        = (Montreal Steak Seasoning recommended)
  1           teaspoon  smoked paprika, ground chipotle chili
                        powder or ground cumin
  2           teaspoon  hot sauce
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  flank steak
  2 1/2         pounds  small red-skin new potatoes
  1                     leek -- tough tops trimmed
  4             slices  thick-cut smoky bacon -- chopped
                        = (such as applewood smoked bacon)
  1                cup  chicken broth or stock
  1                     vine ripe tomato -- seeded, chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  sour cream -- to pass at table

Mix garlic, steak seasoning, smoked paprika, chipotle or cumin, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce and vinegar.  Whisk in extra-virgin olive oil.  Place meat in shallow dish and coat it evenly in marinade.  Let stand 15 minutes.

Cut larger potatoes in half, leave very small potatoes whole.  Place potatoes in a pot and cover with water.  Bring to a boil and cook potatoes 12 to 15 minutes until tender.

Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to high heat.

Cut leek in half lengthwise.  Chop into 1/2-inch pieces.  Place leeks in big bowl of water and release all the dirt from them with a good swish, separating all the layers.  Drain leeks in a colander.

Grill flank steak 6 to 7 minutes on each side.

Put a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil into a hot nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook bacon 3 to 5 minutes until it begins to crisp and has rendered most of its fat.  Add leeks to the skillet and cook 3 to 5 minutes more until the leeks are tender.

Drain the potatoes and return them to the hot pot.  Smash the potatoes with the chicken stock.  Add the BLT: bacon, leeks and tomatoes to the potatoes and continue to smash.  Season the potatoes with salt and pepper to your taste.

Remove flank steak from grill and let juices redistribute before slicing.  Thinly slice meat on an angle, cutting the meat against the grain.  Serve sliced flank steak next to BLT potatoes and top potatoes with a dollop of sour cream.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

         Mini Cheeseburger Salad With Yellow Mustard Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  ground sirloin or ground turkey
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2          teaspoons  steak seasoning blend
                        = (or coarse salt and ground black pepper)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
     3/4         pound  brick sharp Cheddar*
                        = (Cabot brand or Cracker Barrel brand
                        recommended)
  3              large  romaine lettuce hearts
  1                cup  sliced pickles -- drained
                        = (choose from sweet, half-sour or
                        dill varieties)
  1                cup  cherry or grape tomatoes
                        === DRESSING ===
  3        tablespoons  yellow mustard
                        = (French's brand recommended)
  2        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped chives
  2        tablespoons  drained salad pimentos
                        = (or 1/4 small red bell pepper, finely
                        chopped)

* There are many flavors of sharp Cheddar out in today's markets to choose from, so go plain or go wild!  Among the choices out there in sharp cheddars: 5-peppercorn, smoked, dill, garlic and herb, roasted garlic, horseradish, chipotle, habanero, jalapeÒo -- on and on!

Preheat a grill pan or a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat or, preheat outdoor grill.

Combine the meat with onion, Worcestershire and steak seasoning or salt and pepper.  Form 2-inch meatballs, then flatten them into patties.  Drizzle formed mini patties with extra-virgin olive oil to keep them from sticking to cooking surface.

Slice the brick of cheese into 1/4-inch pieces.  Place patties into a preheated pan or grill pan or arrange on outdoor grill.  Cook the mini burgers for 3 minutes on each side then add cheese to melt over patties.  On outdoor grill, close the lid to melt cheese.  In a skillet or on a grill pan, tent the mini cheeseburgers loosely with foil to melt cheese.

Coarsely chop romaine and combine with sliced pickles and halved cherry or grape tomatoes.

Whisk together the mustard and cider vinegar.  Stream in the extra-virgin olive oil.  Add the chopped chives and pimentos, stir to combine

Arrange mini cheeseburgers on salad and drizzle prepared yellow mustard over the completed dish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                cup  chicken stock or turkey broth
                        === TURKEY AND GRAVY ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  chicken stock or turkey broth
  1           teaspoon  poultry seasoning
                        Salt -- to taste
                        A few grinds black pepper
  1 1/2         pounds  turkey breast meat - (to 2)
                        = (roasted turkey breast or thick-cut
                        deli turkey)
  4             slices  whole-grain bread
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley or
                        chopped chives -- for garnish

Preheat a medium skillet over medium-high heat.

Place potatoes in a medium pot.  Cut larger potatoes in half.  Leave smaller baby potatoes whole.  Cover potatoes with water and top with a lid.  Place over high heat.  When the water boils, salt water and cook potatoes with the lid off pot for 10 to 11 minutes, until tender.

Place a second low pot on the stove top over medium-high heat.  Add apple sauce and canned cranberry sauce.  Stir to combine and gently heat through, about 10 minutes.

Toast 2 slices whole grain bread and butter heavily, 1/2 tablespoon per slice.  Chop into small cubes and reserve.

Add extra-virgin olive oil and sausage meat to hot skillet.  Brown and crumble the sausage with a wooden spoon or heat safe spatula.  Add onions and celery to the skillet then season with poultry seasoning and salt and pepper and cook 5 minutes.  Add bread to the skillet and stir to combine.  Dampen the stuffing with chicken stock and turn to combine.  Turn off heat and cover pan loosely with foil to hold heat.

Preheat a second skillet over medium heat to prepare turkey and gravy.

Drain cooked potatoes and return to hot pot.  Smash with sour cream, butter and crisped, chopped bacon.  Season the smashed potatoes with salt and pepper.  If they are too thick, thin them out with milk or a splash of broth.

Add 2 tablespoons butter to preheated skillet and melt it.  Whisk in flour and cook 1 minute.  Whisk in 2 cups stock or broth.  Add the poultry seasoning, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper to the gravy.  Allow it to thicken slightly.

Cut roasted turkey meat away from the breast bones of rotisserie turkey breast.  If you are using deli turkey, remove from packaging and separate slices.  Set turkey into gravy.

Place a bread slice on dinner plate.  Use a large ice cream scoop to place a mound of stuffing on the bread.  Place turkey on top of stuffing.  Serve smashed potatoes and cranberries on the side.  Spoon the extra gravy over potatoes and turkey sandwiches.  Sprinkle the plates with chopped parsley or chives and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2              large  sweet onions -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 3)

  1                cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        === TOMATO-BASIL SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- chopped

  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 oz) -- drained
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  20                    fresh basil leaves -- torn or shredded
                        === GORGONZOLA CHEESE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  cream
  2        tablespoons  chopped sage leaves
     3/4         pound  gorgonzola cheese -- cut into pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Put large pot of water on to boil for penne.  Salt boiling water and cook penne to al dente.

In food processor, combine parsley, pignoli, garlic.  Process and stream in about 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil.  Remove parsley paste to a large serving bowl.  Stir in pepper and grated cheese.  Add remaining extra-virgin olive oil, stir to combine.

Heat a medium pot on stove top over medium-low to medium heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, garlic and onion for the tomato basil sauce.  Let onions cook with garlic slowly over 15 minutes, be careful not to brown onions -- just keep an eye on the heat and stir the onions frequently.  After 15 minutes, stir in tomatoes and raise heat to warm tomatoes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Stir in basil and wilt it into the sauce.  Remove sauce from heat.  When ready to serve, place sauce in the bottom of a large serving bowl to toss with hot pasta.

In a second medium pot over medium heat, melt butter.  Add flour and cook 1 minute.  Whisk in wine, reduce 15 to 20 seconds.  Whisk in stock, then cream.  Add sage, then pieces of cheese.  Stir until cheese melts into sauce.  Simmer over low heat until ready to serve.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Place 1/3 drained pasta in bowl with pesto, 1/3 with tomato basil sauce and 1/3 in another serving dish.  Combine pasta with pesto, then coat and toss the second bowl of pasta with red sauce, to the last bowl, pour the gorgonzola sauce down over the pasta and toss.

Serve the three pastas family style or buffet style, immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                jar  roasted red pepper - (14 to 18 oz) -- drained
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1                     garlic clove -- cracked from skin
  1 1/2           cups  prepared hummus spread
                        = (Tribe of Two Sheiks 40 Spice Hummus
                        recommended)
                        Chopped parsley leaves -- for garnish
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes -- for garnish
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt
  20                    carrot sticks
                        = (available already cut in supermarket)
     1/3         pound  fresh green beans -- trimmed
  1             medium  zucchini -- cut into sticks
  1              large  red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into strips
     1/2          pint  grape tomatoes

Coarsely chop peppers and place them in a food processor with lemon juice and a clove of garlic.  Pulse grind the peppers to get them going, then scrape in the prepared hummus and process until dip is smooth and evenly red in color.

Transfer dip to a bowl and garnish with parsley and crushed pepper flakes.  Serve with vegetables.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Many brands of prepared hummus offer a roasted red pepper variety but taking 5 minutes to dress up a plain or a forty spice hummus will result in a much richer dip, bright in color with the added amount of red peppers you are using and bright in flavor with a little extra lemon juice and garlic.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  large white mushrooms -- sliced
  1                     red bell pepper
  1                     yellow bell pepper
     1/2         large  red onion
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  Cilantro-Lime Butter -- (see recipe)

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan in a slow stream.  Add sliced mushrooms and let them brown.

While the mushrooms begin to cook, cut the peppers in half and pull out the seeds and connective membranes and throw them into your garbage bowl.  Cut peppers in quarters lengthwise, then slice across.  Cut onion in half and peel it.  Cut off ends and cut the half onion in half-again lengthwise, then slice the onions across.

Add peppers and onions to mushrooms and season with salt and pepper.  Cook veggies another 3 to 5 minutes, stirring often, until the veggies are just tender but still have a little crunch left to them and lots of bright color.  Remove veggies from the heat and add 2 tablespoons of Cilantro-Lime Butter.  Toss veggies to melt butter then serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Sandwiches                      Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/3         pounds  ground turkey breast or
                        lean ground turkey
     1/2                red onion
     1/2                red bell pepper
  1         tablespoon  grill seasoning blend
                        = (McCormick Montreal Grill Seasoning or
                        Mrs. Dash poultry seasoning recommended)
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1                cup  tomato sauce - (an 8-oz can)
  4                     crusty sandwich rolls -- split
  12                    celery sticks
                        = (available in produce department)
  12                    carrot sticks
                        = (available in produce department)
                        Cheese Fries -- (see recipe)

Place a big skillet over medium-high heat.  Use some kitchen scissors to cut the turkey package open.  Add some extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan in a nice, slow stream.  Add the ground turkey to the pan.  Break the turkey up with a big wooden spoon as it starts to cook.  If anyone touches the raw turkey, they should go wash their hands.

If you are a really good chopper, using a small, sharp knife chop up some red onion.  Remember when you are chopping to keep the fingers that are not holding the knife all tucked in and curled under.  You need half a red onion chopped up small.  Pull the seeds and white membrane and the top out of a half red bell pepper and chop that up small too.  Add the veggies to the cooking meat and stir it all together.

Next, mix in a small bowl: grill seasoning blend, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce and the tomato sauce.  This will make your special sauce.  When all the ingredients are combined, pour the sauce evenly over the meat and stir everything together really well.  Turn the heat down to simmer and cook the sloppy mixture for 10 minutes.  Blow on a spoonful until cool and taste it to see if you need to adjust the seasoning.

To serve:  Place a bun bottom on a plate.  Use a big ice cream scoop to get a pile of sloppy meat onto the bun.  Put bun top in place and serve with vegetable sticks on the side and Cheese Fries.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  1                     extra large sweet onion
  2               cups  complete pancake mix -- any brand
  1                cup  beer
  1           teaspoon  sweet paprika
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cayenne pepper
                        = (or 1 tspn hot sauce)
                        Salt -- to taste

Heat 1-inch vegetable oil of moderate to medium-high heat.  If you wish to test the oil, add a 1-inch cube of bread to hot oil.  If it turns deep golden brown in color in a count of 40, the oil is ready.

Trim ends of onion and peel.  Cut into 3/4-inch slices and separate rings.

Mix together pancake mix and beer, season with paprika, chili powder and cayenne pepper or hot sauce.  Batter should be thick.  If it gets too thick, add a splash more beer.

Working in small batches of 5 to 6 slices, coat rings of onion in batter and fry 4 to 5 minutes, until evenly golden brown.  Turn onions over so that both sides get puffed and cooked.

Transfer to paper towels to drain.  Season o-nuts with salt while hot.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.  When all the onions are dipped and fried, turn off oil to cool before discarding.

                Stuffed Steak With Prosciutto And Spinach

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  chopped frozen spinach - (10 oz)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/2         small  onion -- chopped
     1/2         small  red bell pepper -- 1/4 chopped,
                        and 1/4 cut into thin strips for garnish
  2             ounces  prosciutto - (abt 3 to 4 slices) -- cut into ribbons
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  Italian bread crumbs
     1/3           cup  grated Parmigiano
  2             pounds  eye round roast -- strings cut off
                        Re-sealable plastic bag

Defrost spinach in microwave.  Wrap in clean kitchen towel and wring chopped spinach dry.

Place a large skillet on the stove over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil-to hot skillet.  Add garlic to oil.  Add onion and red pepper, cook 1 minute.  Lower heat to medium.  Add the prosciutto and the spinach.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add bread crumbs and cheese to spinach.  Turn off heat.  Let stuffing cool.

To create the cavity for the stuffing, use a long sharp knife (like a boning knife), and cut a 1 to 2-inch hole through the center of the roast making a lengthwise slit.  Turn the meat around and cut another slit in the same spot so that your knife completes the cavity.  Insert a wooden spoon into the cavity to make sure the hole is even and goes all the way through.

Put the cooled filling in a re-sealable plastic bag and snip a hole in the corner of the bag.  Pipe the filling into the cavity.  You may need to push it along with your fingers to make sure that it goes all the way through.

Preheat nonstick skillet over high heat.  Cut the roast into 6 even slices, being careful to keep the stuffing in each slice.  Add 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil to the pan.  Season the steaks with salt and pepper and sear in hot, nonstick skillet, 2 minutes on first side.  Flip the steaks and sear for an additional 2 minutes then lower the heat to medium-high and cook until done (about 3 to 4 more minutes).  Garnish with thinly sliced red pepper.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Defrost spinach in microwave.  Wrap in clean kitchen towel and wring chopped spinach dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a large skillet on the stove over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil-to hot skillet.  Add garlic to oil.  Add onion and red pepper, cook 1 minute.  Lower heat to medium.  Add the prosciutto and the spinach.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add bread crumbs and cheese to spinach.  Turn off heat.  Let stuffing cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To create the cavity for the stuffing, use a long sharp knife (like a boning knife), and cut a 1 to 2-inch hole through the center of the roast making a lengthwise slit.  Turn the meat around and cut another slit in the same spot so that your knife completes the cavity.  Insert a wooden spoon into the cavity to make sure the hole is even and goes all the way through.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the cooled filling in a re-sealable plastic bag and snip a hole in the corner of the bag.  Pipe the filling into the cavity.  You may need to push it along with your fingers to make sure that it goes all the way through.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat nonstick skillet over high heat.  Cut the roast into 6 even slices, being careful to keep the stuffing in each slice.  Add 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil to the pan.  Season the steaks with salt and pepper and sear in hot, nonstick skillet, 2 minutes on first side.  Flip the steaks and sear for an additional 2 minutes then lower the heat to medium-high and cook until done (about 3 to 4 more minutes).  Garnish with thinly sliced red pepper.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- cracked
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2             medium  firm eggplant
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2                red onion -- chopped
  1                can  chopped fire roasted tomatoes - (28 oz)
                        = (Muir Glen recommended)
  1                     small can tomato sauce - (8 oz)
  4                     sub rolls -- split
  1                cup  fresh basil leaves -- sliced thin or torn
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1              pound  smoked mozzarella -- thinly sliced

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Heat a small pan with extra-virgin olive oil and cracked garlic in it over medium-low flame.

Trim ends of eggplants and remove a sliver of the skin off of 1 side, so the eggplant sits flat for you to slice it.  Cut the eggplant into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Arrange the eggplant on cookie sheets.  When garlic sizzles in oil, using a pastry brush, brush both sides of sliced eggplant.  Season eggplant with salt and pepper and roast in hot oven 15 minutes or until tender.  Turn eggplant once.

Take a couple of tablespoons of remaining extra-virgin olive oil and place in a second pan, a medium skillet, over medium-high heat.  To hot garlic oil, add remaining chopped garlic and red onions.  Saute the red onions and garlic 2 to 3 minutes then add chopped fire roasted tomatoes and tomato sauce then season with salt and pepper.  Lower heat and allow sauce to thicken.

Remove eggplant from the oven.  Get split sub rolls ready to fill, arranging the split rolls on a broiler pan.  Preheat broiler to melt cheese on subs.  Pile layers of cooked eggplant, roasted tomato sauce and torn basil into sub rolls, equally dividing ingredients.  Top subs with grated cheese and smoked mozzarella cheese.  Melt cheeses under the broiler.  Serve subs hot.

This recipe yields 4 super submarine sandwiches.

                   Tomato, Basil And Cheese Baked Pasta

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small-shell pasta
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3              large  garlic cloves
     1/2         small  to medium yellow onion
  1                can  crushed Italian tomatoes - (28 oz) -- any brand
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves - (10 to 12) -- torn small pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  store-bought basil pesto sauce
  1                cup  ricotta cheese
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/2         pound  fresh mozzarella

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt the water.  Add small-shell pasta and cook the pasta to al dente doneness which means that the pasta will still have a bite to it or be a little chewy.  The pasta will soak up more juice and keep on cooking after we drain it, so we need it to be a little under cooked.  The shells will probably cook about 9 or 10 minutes.

Preheat a deep, big skillet or a medium sauce pot over medium heat.

Place garlic on the cutting board and place the flat of your knife on top of each clove.  Carefully give the garlic a whack with the palm of your hand to separate the cloves from the skins.  Throw out the skins and chop up the garlic.  Remember to keep your fingers curled under and the edge of your sharp, chef's knife tilted slightly away from your body.

Add extra-virgin olive oil to the pan by pouring a slow stream of it twice-around-the-pan.  This will be about 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil just enough to coat the bottom of the pan.  Do not let the oil pour out too fast.  You are looking for a slow, steady stream.  Add the garlic to the oil.

To chop the onion, cut the ends off and cut the whole onion down the center.  Wrap half and save it.  Cut the other half into thin slices then twist the slices a quarter turn and chop them again.  Hold the tip of knife on the cutting board and lift the back of the knife up and down over the onion to make the pieces really small.  Add the chopped up onion to the garlic and oil.  Cook, stirring a lot, 5 minutes until the onions are mushy and look cooked.

Add the tomatoes to the onions and stir.  When the tomatoes come to a bubble, reduce the heat under the sauce to low.  Stir in basil pieces to wilt them.  Season the sauce with salt and pepper, to your taste.

Preheat your broiler to high and place a rack in the center of the oven.

Drain pasta shells.  Add them to a casserole dish.  Add pesto sauce, 1 cup of ricotta cheese and a handful of grated Parmigiano, too.  Stir carefully and coat the hot pasta with the pesto and cheeses.  Pour the hot tomato and basil sauce over the pasta, as much as you like.  You can always serve a little extra at the table, to pass around.

Shred up some mozzarella cheese with a grater and scatter it over the pasta.  Add a final sprinkle of Parmigiano to the mozzarella as well.  Place the casserole under the broiler in the middle of oven, 10 to 12 inches from the heat.  Let the cheese melt and bubble on top, 3 to 5 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                 Turkey Club Salad With Avocado Dressing

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            slices  microwave ready sliced bacon
                        = (Ready Crisp bacon recommended)
  3                     romaine lettuce hearts
  2               cups  pea shoots, radish spouts or bean spouts
  3                     plum tomatoes -- sliced
     1/2        medium  red onion -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  rotisserie turkey breast
                        = (or thick-sliced deli roast turkey
                        breast)
  2                     ripe Hass avocados
  1                     lemon -- zested, juiced
  1                     garlic clove
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  hot sauce
                        = (Tabasco sauce recommended)

Crisp the bacon in microwave according to package directions.  Remove from microwave and chop.  Of course, any bacon or turkey bacon which you have on hand may be substituted.  These pre-rendered bacon products simply allow you to keep more heat out of the kitchen by giving you the option of a low-maintenance microwave preparation.

Chop romaine lettuce and arrange on large platter.  Arrange a bed of pea shoots or sprouts on top of the lettuce then arrange the tomatoes and chopped red onion on top of that.  Season the salad vegetables with salt and pepper, to your taste.  Scatter chopped bacon onto salad.

Remove the rotisserie turkey from the bone with a sharp carving knife.  Slice the rotisserie breast meat on an angle into strips.  For thick-cut turkey from the deli, julienne the meat into 1/2-inch strips.  Arrange the sliced turkey down the center of the salad platter.

Cut all around the ripe avocados down to the pit.  Twist and separate the halved fruit.  Remove the pit with a spoon, then scoop the flesh with a spoon into your food processor bowl.  Add the zest and juice of 1 lemon to the food processor.  Chop garlic on your board and mash with 1 teaspoon salt to paste the garlic.  Add garlic paste and the red wine vinegar to the food processor.  Place lid on the food processor and turn it on.  While the blade is spinning, stream in extra-virgin olive oil and add hot sauce.  Stop processor, taste dressing and adjust seasonings.  Pour dressing back and forth over the platter evenly when you are ready to serve this simple and so-cool salad meal.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Add garlic paste and the red wine vinegar to the food processor.  Place lid on the food processor and turn it on.  While the blade is spinning, stream in extra-virgin olive oil and add hot sauce.  Stop processor, taste dressing and adjust seasonings.  Pour dressing back and forth over the platter evenly when you are ready to serve this simple and so-cool salad meal.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             slices  marble rye bread
  4        tablespoons  softened butter -- divided
  2 1/2         pounds  turkey breast cutlets

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3          teaspoons  poultry seasoning -- divided, plus
  1           teaspoon  poultry seasoning
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1              quart  College Inn turkey broth
                        = (or Kitchen Basics chicken stock in a
                        re-sealable paper box)
  1              pound  mushrooms -- chopped
  2                     ribs celery ribs from the heart -- chopped with
                        leafy green tops
  1                cup  water chestnuts - (1 small can) -- drained, chopped
  3                     scallions -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  fresh parsley leaves -- chopped

Turn on broiler to high and toast the bread on both sides.  Butter the toasted bread liberally with softened butter.  Set aside.  Switch oven to bake and preheat to 375 degrees.

Season the turkey cutlets with salt, pepper and 2 teaspoons poultry seasoning.  In a large skillet, brown turkey cutlets on each side over medium-high heat in 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil.  Transfer the cutlets to a shallow baking dish and add 1 cup broth to keep meat moist.  Transfer cutlets to oven, loosely tented with foil, to continue cooking through.

To skillet that you browned the cutlets in, add 2 tablespoons butter and melt it over medium heat.  Add flour to butter and cook a minute or two more.  Whisk in about 2 cups turkey broth or chicken stock and allow it to thicken up, 5 minutes.  Season the gravy with salt and pepper and poultry seasoning, to your taste.

Preheat a second skillet, over medium-high heat add 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan.  Add chopped mushrooms and brown 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Season mushrooms with salt and pepper.

Add celery and water chestnuts as you get them chopped.  Continue to cook until veggies are all tender, another 5 minutes.  Add scallions, 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning and the parsley.

Cut bread into cubes and add.  Moisten stuffing with 1 cup broth or stock.  Transfer to a serving dish.  Use an ice cream scoop to portion out the stuffing at the table.  Top mounds of stuffing with turkey cutlets and gravy, serve with sugar snap peas and brown rice or other vegetable side dishes of your choice.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  4                     boneless veal shoulder chops, no
                        more than 1" thick
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2                     beaten eggs
  1                cup  bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano or Romano cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  ground or grated nutmeg
                        Olive oil -- for frying
  3                     vine ripe tomatoes -- chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped yellow-skinned onion
  1                cup  basil leaves -- torn or shredded
                        A drizzle extra-virgin olive oil
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
     1/2                lemon -- cut into wedges

Pound chops between waxed paper with small heavy skillet to 1/4-inch thickness.  Chops will be about 10 inches wide each.  Season chops with salt and pepper.  Set up an assembly line: a dish of flour, a shallow dish with beaten egg, a plate with bread crumbs combined with cheese and nutmeg.

Add a thin layer of oil to a very large skillet over medium to medium-high heat.  When oil is hot, add the first 2 pieces of veal.  Cook 3 minutes on each side until evenly golden.  Transfer to a serving platter and repeat with remaining veal.

This dish is fine served at room temperature.  Do not put cooked veal in a warm oven or you will dry it out.  Also, do not cover the platter with foil it will trap steam and make the cutlets soggy.  The reason this dish is perfect for small dinner parties is because it is very tasty eaten at room temperature and because the sauce is raw and cold.  You never have to rush your guests to their seats.

Combine tomatoes, onions, and basil and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil.  Season the raw sauce with coarse salt, to taste.  Transfer to a small bowl and set on platter with veal.  Garnish platter with lemon wedges.

Top veal with a little squeeze of lemon juice and raw sauce and enjoy.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  ground chicken breast
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped ginger root
  2                     scallions -- finely chopped
  1              small  red pepper -- 1/4 finely chopped,
                        and the remainder thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  hoisin sauce (Chinese style bbq sauce)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- divided
     3/4         small  red bell pepper -- sliced
  1                cup  shredded carrots
  1                cup  bean spouts
  1                cup  snow pea pods -- julienne cut
  1              pound  bucatini -- cooked to al dente
     1/4           cup  dark soy (Tamari) sauce - (to 1/3)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Place balls on a nonstick cookie sheet and coat lightly with vegetable oil, about 1 1/2 tablespoons.  Roll balls around with your hands to gently coat with the oil.  Roast the chicken eyeballs 10 to 12 minutes in a very hot oven.

About 5 minutes from the meatballs coming out of the oven, start stir-frying the veggies.  Heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil.  Add the sliced red bell pepper, carrots, spouts and pea pods to hot pan.  Stir fry 1 minute, then drain noodles and add them to the vegetables.  Add dark soy sauce to the noodles and toss to combine and evenly coat.

Transfer noodles to a serving platter and top with chicken eyeballs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
