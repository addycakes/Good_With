         Aged Goat Cheese W Dried Fruit Moscato Compote & Toasts

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  dried apricots -- cut 1/8" julienne
  1              ounce  dried cranberries
  1              ounce  dried cherries
  1              ounce  dried currants
  8             ounces  Moscato D'Asti
                        = (sweet wine from Italy)
     1/2           cup  hazelnuts -- roughly chopped
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  4             slices  good-quality white bread -- toasted
                        = (Arnold or Pepperidge Farms)
  8             ounces  aged goat cheese, caraway round
                        = (preferably Coach Farm brand)

In a medium sauce pan over medium-low heat, stir together the apricots, cranberries, cherries, currants and wine.  Bring to a boil, turn off the heat and let stand 30 minutes.  The fruit will plump to twice their original size and the wine should just moisten the fruit.

In a large mixing bowl put the hazelnuts, sugar and soft butter.  Blend with a spoon until homogenous.  Spread this mixture over the toast in a thin layer all the way to the edges.  Remove the crusts with a sharp knife.  Cut each toast into triangles, and divide the toast among 4 saucers.

Using 4 large martini glasses divide the fruit mixture and juices evenly.  Place each glass on a saucer with the toast.  Shave goat cheese with peeler over each glass and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  artichokes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  virgin olive oil
  2                     lemons -- cut in wedges

Pull off outer layers of deep green leaves from each artichoke and discard.  Cut off stem and set aside.  Rub each cut with a lemon wedge.  Place artichoke on its side and cut off top third.  Discard these points.  Using a pair of scissors, cut off the sharp points.  Soak 10 minutes in cold water with 1 ounce lemon juice.

Carefully open the leaves by prying with your fingers as if opening a flower and pressing down on the counter the opening face.  Drain each artichoke on paper towels, shaking to remove all liquid.  Season aggressively with salt and pepper between each leaf and all over.

Heat the virgin olive oil in a tall-sided sauce pan, 8 to 10 inches wide at base until just smoking.  Cook artichokes in this hot oil 12 to 15 minutes, until golden all over.  After 10 minutes of cooking, spritz the pan by shaking your wet hand over the artichokes to mist them.  Be careful; this will cause the oil to sizzle and spatter.

When the artichokes are cooked, remove each one, and holding the artichoke by skewering its base with a fork, press the flower side down to force it further open.  Drain on paper towels, season with salt and pepper again and serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Add 3 tablespoons oil to hot pan and toss in fennel.  Cook fennel until lightly browned and wilted (about 4 minutes) and set aside.

Remove zest from tangerines and then slice off peel.  Place zest and segments into mixing bowl and toss in warm cooked fennel, 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, olives and fennel fronds.  Season with salt and pepper and divide among 4 plates.  Place one cooked fish on each plate and serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  quick cooking polenta or corn meal
  1                cup  Tapenade (Black Olive Paste) -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4             ounces  virgin olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves
  2             pounds  shiitake mushrooms -- hard part of stem
                        removed, and cut in half
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  8             ounces  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring 2 1/2 cups water to boil.  Add polenta in thin stream, stirring constantly.  When polenta is all in, lower heat to simmer.  Add Tapenade and salt and cook 5 to 7 minutes until very thick, or the consistency of thick oatmeal.

Pour the polenta out into a clean but not greased 8- by 12-inch brownie pan, smoothing over the top with the back of a spoon to create even thickness.  Set aside to cool 1/2 hour.  When cool, cut into 8 wedges.

Preheat broiler.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 4 ounces olive oil over moderate heat.  Add garlic and saute until just lightly browned.  Add shiitakes and, stirring quickly to move the garlic off the pan bottom, saute 3 to 4 minutes until lightly browned.  Add wine and rosemary and reduce by one half.  The mixture should be loose but not thin like a sauce.  Set aside off heat.

Place polenta under broiler and cook until hot but not darkened, or about 3 minutes per side.  Bring shiitake mixture up to a boil over moderate heat.  As an entree, place two wedges on each of four plates and divide shiitakes, spooning over top.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 entree or 8 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
  2            bunches  Swiss chard -- cut 1" ribbons
  8             ounces  Fresh goat cheese
                        = (preferrably Coach Farm brand)
     1/2           cup  Freshly-grated parmesan cheese
  2               cups  Bechamel Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Roll the Basic Fresh Egg Pasta into 4 sheets at thinnest setting, and cut into 6-inch by 8-inch rectangles (12 pieces).

Butter a 10- by 13-inch baking dish, suitable for the table.

Boil 6 quarts water and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop Swiss chard into the boiling water and cook 2 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove chard and drain in colander over sink.

Set a large bowl of cold water near the pasta pot and using the same boiling water drop 4 pieces of pasta into water and cook 25 to 30 seconds.  Using slotted spoon remove pasta from boiling water and transfer to bowl of cool water.  Lay out kitchen towels on the counter or a cutting board and lay the cooled pasta pieces flatly over towels.  Repeat this with all the pasta pieces.

Heat oven to 450 degrees.

Stir together the Swiss chard, goat cheese, 1/2 of the Parmesan, 1 cup of Bechamel Sauce in a medium mixing bowl until well combined.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover each of the pasta pieces evenly with the Swiss chard mixture, about 1/4 cup per piece.  Roll the pieces of pasta up like a jelly roll and evenly lay each one into the buttered baking dish with the flap-side facing down.  Spoon the remaining bechamel sauce over and between the cannelloni, sprinkle with remaining Parmesan.  Bake 15 minutes until golden brown and slightly crispy on top.  Allow to stand 10 minutes outside of oven and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/4           cup  freshly-grated pecorino cheese
  2                     fresh ripe pears
     1/2         pound  capricola -- sliced paper thin
                        by your butcher

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a food processor, puree 1 cup of the beans till smooth.  In a mixing bowl, mix pureed and whole beans with 6 egg yolks and milk till smooth.  Mix in flour to form a smooth paste.  Add salt and sage leaves.  In another bowl, whip egg whites to stiff peaks and fold into bean mixture.

Lay a piece of parchment paper, cut to dimensions of a 9- by 12-inch brownie pan.  Pour bean mixture into brownie pan and sprinkle evenly with the pecorino.

Place in the oven and bake until fluffy and golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  The mixture should sink in the pan.  While still warm, roll it up like a jelly roll, remove parchment paper, and set aside.

Core and seed the pears and cut into thin slices.  Arrange capricola in a single layer around 4 plates.  Cut souffle into 2-inch thick slices and stand upright in the center of a plate.  Arrange pear slices around like teepees and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

               Carpaccio With Olive Salad And Mustard Aioli

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     egg
                        Juice and zest of one lemon
  1                     garlic clove -- finely sliced
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  8             ounces  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2             ounces  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  Moroccan olives -- pitted
     1/2           cup  Picholine olives -- pitted
  1              bunch  fresh marjoram -- leaves stripped
                        and stems discarded
  1              pound  fresh beef top round -- sliced thinly
                        by your butcher

To make aioli:  Place egg, lemon juice, garlic and mustard in a blender and blend until smooth (1 minute).  Starting two drops at a time with machine going, slowly pour in olive oil until sauce begins to thicken.  Finish adding olive oil in a thin stream and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Set aside.  Aioli should be the consistency of unwhipped heavy cream.  If it is too thick, thin with cool water, adding a teaspoon at a time and blending between additions.

To make olive salad:  Mix the Moroccan and picholine olives, the lemon zest and the marjoram leaves together in a small bowl and set aside.

To make the carpaccio:  Pound the slices of top round between the two pieces of foil with a drop of oil on each side until as thin as construction paper.  Flip pieces of pounded beef onto chilled plates and continue pounding and flipping the remainder of the meat until all plates are covered, including the rims.

To prepare the dish:  Divide the olive salad into piles in the centers of the meat.  Season the meat with salt and freshly-ground pepper.  Drizzle the aioli with a teaspoon over the meat in fancy designs.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

           Celery Root Napoleon With Parmigiano And Truffle Oil

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  celery root knob -- leaves removed
  1              quart  pure (pomace) olive oil -- plus
  4        tablespoons  pure (pomace) olive oil
  4                     celery ribs
     1/2         pound  Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- shaved thin strands
  4             ounces  white truffle oil
  1                     lemon -- zested, juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Slice the celery root into paper thin slices, using a peeler or a very sharp knife.

Heat 1 quart olive oil in a very deep sauce pan over a moderate heat until just smoking.  Fry the celery root pieces 3 or 4 at a time so they do not lower the oil temperature.  Fry until the pieces are nice and light brown.  Drain on paper towels.  Season well with salt and pepper.  Continue to fry the celery root until all are completed (about 20 to 25 pieces resembling potato chips).

Meanwhile chop the leaves from the celery root finely to yield 1/4 cup.  Slice the celery ribs thinly on a bias to 1/8-inch thick.

In a large 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil over high heat.  Saute celery pieces until light brown and quite soft.  Remove to a mixing bowl while still hot and mix with chopped celery root leaves, white truffle oil, lemon juice and minced lemon zest.  Season with salt and pepper.

Build towers by alternating fried celery root slices and 1 to 2 tablespoons warm celery mixture.  Top with shaved parmesan cheese and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  sausage
  1                cup  panzanella -- omitting cucumbers
  12                    sage leaves -- finely chopped
  4                     chicken legs -- thigh and drumstick

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Bake the sausage in the oven for 20 minutes.  Remove, drain and cool.  In a large mixing bowl crumble the cooked sausage to resemble the texture of rough bread crumbs.  Add the panzanella and chopped sage, toss well.

Place the chicken legs skin-side down on a cutting board.  Season with salt and pepper.  Divide the sausage mixture among the chicken legs, filling them as much as possible.  Fold the legs around the sausage mixture and tie each into a tight packet with butcher's string.

Place the legs in a small roasting pan flap-side down.  Roast in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until browned and crispy.  Remove from the oven and place on a serving platter.  Serve immediately.

                 Crespelle With Mushrooms And Truffle Oil

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  milk
  5                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- divided
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  16                    shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        and cut in half
  1              ounce  dried porcini mushrooms -- soaked in
  1                cup  hot water -- for 10 minutes
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- finely chopped
  3             ounces  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             ounces  white truffle oil
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  2               cups  milk
  3 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1              pinch  salt

To make crespelle:  Put flour in a large mixing bowl and slowly drizzle with milk, stirring constantly to avoid making lumps.  Add eggs one at a time beating with a fork until a thin batter is formed.  Add salt and let stand 20 minutes.  Place a 6-inch non-stick pan over medium-low heat and heat one minute.  Add 1 teaspoon of butter to hot pan and tilt to coat pan.  Add about 1/3 cup of batter to pan, again tilting and turning to coat pan evenly and cook crepe until it is set on bottom about 30 seconds.  Flip with spatula, cook another 30 seconds and remove to plate.  Continue cooking crepes until batter is gone, stacking one on top of the other.

Drain porcini mushrooms reserving the liquid and roughly chop.  In a 12-inch saute pan, saute onion in olive oil until light brown over medium heat, approximately 5 to 7 minutes.  Add shiitake and porcini and cook until brown and softened over medium heat, approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  Add reserved water from the porcini mushrooms and cook until liquid is just moistening the mushrooms.  Set aside to cool.

To make bechamel:  Heat the milk over low flame until it is steaming hot but not boiling.  While milk is heating, melt the butter in a separate pan, also over low heat until it smells slightly nutty, but has not yet browned.  Slowly whisk in the butter mixture into the hot milk until it is incorporated.  Continue stirring with whisk until milk thickens to a thin pudding-like consistency.  Season with salt and remove from heat.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Butter a baking pan large enough to hold crespelle.

Assembly:  Stir the cooled mushroom mix, the truffle oil and 1/2 of the bechamel together in a mixing bowl until well mixed.  Lay the crespelle on the counter and divide the mushroom mix evenly among them, about 2 to 3 tablespoons each.  Fold the crespelle into a half-moon and again into a quarter-moon.  Lay the crespelle into the buttered baking dish overlapping with the point toward the top and the thinner layers facing down.  Dot the top of each crespelle with a scant teaspoon of the bechamel.  Bake in oven 15 minutes until the tops are slightly crispy and the bechamel has melted over.  Allow to stand 5 minutes outside oven and serve.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     fennel bulbs -- trimmed of stalks
  1                cup  Bechamel Sauce -- (see recipe)
  4             ounces  fontina cheese -- grated
  8             ounces  robiola cheese
  2             ounces  fresh bread crumbs -- lightly toasted

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Bring 4 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Butter 4 small round (4-inch diameter) earthenware gratin or shallow sauce dishes.

Halve fennel bulbs and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices.  Place in boiling water and blanche until very tender, 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain in a colander over sink and set aside until cool enough to handle.  Mix tepid fennel with Bechamel Sauce and fontina and mix well.  Divide evenly among 4 gratin dishes and pat down with back of spoon.

Bake in top half of oven for 25 minutes until bubbling and hot.  Remove from oven.  Place 2-ounce dollop or square of robiola in center of each dish, sprinkle bread crumbs over robiola and place in oven 5 to 6 more minutes, until robiola is hot and soft and crumbs have melted in.  Remove.  Allow to stand 3 minutes before serving.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- chopped 1/4" dice
  8                     green plum tomatoes - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- chopped 1/2" dice
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  salt
  6             ounces  dry white wine
  8             ounces  fresh soft goat cheese

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        bottle  inexpensive port wine - (abt 16 oz)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  walnut halves
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2         pound  sweet gorgonzola cheese

In a 2-quart saucepan bring the port wine to a boil and reduce it to about 1/2 cup thick syrup.  Allow to cool.  The liquid may even thicken some more.  This is fine.

To serve, divide the gorgonzola evenly among 4 plates.  Sprinkle equal amounts of walnuts over each portion of cheese.  Using a tablespoon, drizzle a pretty design of port syrup over the cheese and the plate.  Enjoy!

This recipe yields 4 servings as a cheese course or dessert.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     fennel bulbs -- trimmed of stalks
                        and quartered, leaves set aside
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             ounces  Sambuca or anisette
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  12             large  Gulf prawns -- peeled, with
                        their heads still on
  6                     scallions, green and white parts -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  portobello mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        cubed 1/2" and set aside for other use
  10       tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1           teaspoon  anchovy paste
  4        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
  1                cup  roasted bell peppers
  1              bunch  arugula -- washed, spun dry
  4        tablespoons  lemon juice

  8             slices  Italian Bread, 1/2" thick -- toasted

Preheat broiler.

Toss peppers in bowl with 2 tablespoons of the extra-virgin olive oil to coat evenly.  Place peppers under broiler or on barbecue and roast, turning often to blacken skin evenly all over.  Allow to cool and then peel under running water, rubbing skins gently to remove all charred bits.  Remove seeds and stems, cut into 1-inch strips and place in a mixing bowl.

Broil portobellos until slightly softened, 3 minutes per side, and remove.

In a small bowl, mix 4 tablespoons of the extra-virgin olive oil, anchovy paste, vinegar and dry thyme.  Divide this mixture onto the gill sides of the portobellos and let stand one half hour.

In a mixing bowl, toss roasted peppers, clean arugula, remaining 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and lemon juice.  Season with salt and pepper and divide onto 4 of the bread slices.  Place one portobello on each and top with second half of bread.  Press lightly and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

       Grilled Tuna With Ligurian Olives & Green Olive Vinaigrette

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  olive oil -- divided
  2              large  red bell peppers
  1                cup  Ligurian olives
     1/2           cup  Green Olive Pesto -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  sherry vinegar
     1/2           cup  virgin olive oil
  4                     tuna steaks, 1" thk - (6 oz ea) -- highest quality
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Light barbecue or preheat broiler.

In a mixing bowl, toss bell pepper in 2 ounces olive oil to coat.  Place on barbecue or under broiler and char skin of peppers, turning often until nicely blackened all around.  The quicker this is done, the meatier the final product will be.  When cool enough to handle, rub skin off and remove seeds, leaving flesh as whole as possible.  Cut peppers into diamonds or strips and mix with olives.  Set aside.

In a blender or food processor, blend Green Olive Pesto, sherry vinegar and virgin olive oil until smooth and silky.  Add two tablespoons of this vinaigrette to olive and roasted pepper mixture and set the rest aside.

Grill or broil tuna to medium-rare, about 3 to 4 minutes a side over high heat.  Divide pepper and olive mixture in center of four plates.  Place hot tuna over mixture and drizzle each steak with several teaspoons of sauce.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Venison

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless venison saddle
     1/2           cup  pomace olive oil -- plus
  4               cups  pomace olive oil -- for frying
  4                     thyme sprigs
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2               cups  cooked scarlet runner beans
     1/2        medium  onion -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
     1/4           cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  2                     leeks -- cleaned, and
                        cut 4" long julienne, in cold water
  1             medium  beet -- roasted in oven
                        at 400 degrees for 1 hour, peeled,
                        and roughly chopped
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  6        tablespoons  red wine vinegar

Twenty-four hours in advance, strip the venison of all connective tissue and silver skin.  In a mixing bowl, stir together 1/2 cup pomade oil, thyme, pepper and garlic, mixing well.  Pour over meat in a casserole and let stand in refrigerator overnight or at room temperature for two hours.

Pick through and rinse beans.  In an 8- to 10-inch saute pan, cook red onion in 2 tablespoons of virgin olive oil until light brown.  Add cooked beans, rosemary and Basic Tomato Sauce.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes.  Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper and let stand.

In a tall-edged saucepan, heat 4 cups pomade oil until just smoking.  Drain leeks well on a towel.  Fry in four lots until crispy and golden brown.  Season with salt and set aside.

In a food processor, combine chopped roasted beet, Dijon mustard and red wine vinegar, processing until smooth.  Drizzle in remaining 1/4 cup virgin olive oil to form emulsion and process until creamy, about 30 seconds.  Season with salt and pepper and set aside.

Season venison and cook over hot grill until medium-rare (about 4 to 5 minutes per inch per side).  Reheat beans and divide among 4 serving plates.  Remove venison from grill and slice into 1/2-inch slices.  Arrange over bean piles, drizzle 2 tablespoons of beet sauce around beans, top with fried leeks and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat.  Drain potato cubes and shake dry.  Add potatoes to hot oil and saute until light brown, stirring constantly (about 4 to 5 minutes).  Add olives, fennel and garlic and continue cooking 4 to 5 minutes until fennel is softened but still firm.  Add Cinzano, flame and boil 2 minutes until reduced by half.  Remove from heat and add butter.  Set aside.

Season quail with salt and pepper.  Cook quail on barbecue or under broiler until medium, watching carefully not to burn the skin (about 3 minutes on each side, depending on heat source).

Bring potato mixture to a boil and stir until butter is incorporated yet vegetables are very moist.

Place quail in center of warm serving plates, pour potato mixture over and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  broccoli rabe
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  hot Italian sausage -- sliced 1/8" rounds
  6             ounces  Dry white wine
  1              pound  orecchiette pasta
  2        tablespoons  salt
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino Romano

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Remove the thick stems from the broccoli rabe and rinse well.  Drop the broccoli into the boiling water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, just until tender.  Remove the broccoli rabe with a slotted spoon into an ice bath, to refresh the greens.  Drain the broccoli rabe and set aside.  (Keep the pot of water boiling for the pasta.)

In a large 12- to 14-inch saute pan over medium heat, add the olive oil.  Add the garlic and saute until light brown, about 1 minute.  Add the sausage rounds and cook stirring occasionally, until the sausage is cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain off the excess fat.  Add the white wine and simmer for 2 minutes longer.  Set aside.

Place the pasta in the boiling water and cook until tender yet al dente, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain the pasta in a colander over the sink.  Toss the pasta into the saute pan with the sausage.  Add the broccoli rabe and grated cheese, toss together and heat for about 2 minutes, until well mixed and uniformly heated.  Pour into a warm serving dish and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  radicchio heads -- quartered lengthwise
  2             ounces  virgin olive oil
  8                     sage leaves
  8             ounces  soft goat cheese
                        = (preferably Coach Farm brand)
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1              large  egg
  4        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
  6        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar -- divided
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

In a large 12- to 14-inch saute pan heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Place the radicchio quarters in the oil 4 at a time and saute cut-side down until lightly brown on both cut sides.  Set aside and repeat with the remaining 4 quarters.  Let cool.

While the pan is still hot, saute the 8 sage leaves until crisp and brown, set aside.

In a mixing bowl stir together the goat cheese, rosemary, egg, Parmesan and 2 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar until well blended.  Pack about 3 tablespoons of the cheese mixture on top of each radicchio quarter, smoothing over to form a slightly rounded top.

Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until the goat cheese has started to brown slightly.  Remove from oven, sprinkle with remaining balsamic vinegar and garnish with 2 sage leaves each.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings as an antipasto.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fresh ricotta
  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- plus
  4        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/4           cup  chestnut flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  chestnut flour
                        = (available in gourmet markets)
  1                cup  finely-chopped roasted chestnuts -- spread out
                        on a flat plate
  1                can  anchovy filets - (4 oz) -- with their juices
  6                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              quart  pure (pomace) olive oil -- for frying

In New York City you can find roasted chestnuts readily.  If you cannot find roasted chestnuts, here is what to do.  Take 10 chestnuts and score a cross on the pointed end of each chestnut and roast in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes.  Peel the nuts and chop them until the texture is of bread crumbs.  Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl place the ricotta cheese, 2 eggs and 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano and blend well.  With your hands mix in the chestnut flour until a smooth cookie-like dough forms.  If the dough is too soft add slightly more chestnut flour until you reach the desired consistency.  To test the dough, form a small ball and set aside.  The dough ball should be able to hold its shape.

In a small bowl beat the remaining egg.  Take a small amount of the ricotta mixture and make a 2-inch ball.  Carefully cover the ball with the beaten egg and while still wet, dredge in chopped chestnuts.  Gently press the nuts so that they adhere.  Continue this process until all the cheese mixture is finished.  Allow the balls to rest for 20 minutes on a plate in your refrigerator to dry.

Pour the 1 quart olive oil into a large 4-quart sauce pan, one with sides at least 6 inches high.  Heat the oil over medium heat until just smoking.

Meanwhile combine the anchovies with their juices, garlic and 1/2 cup olive oil in a small sauce pan and stir over medium heat.  Mash the anchovies to a paste and cook until just warm but not hot -- about 10 minutes.  Stir in the butter 1 tablespoon at a time until melted and smooth.  Set aside.

Fry the ricotta balls in hot oil until golden brown, turning with tongs about 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove ricotta balls with tongs to a plate covered with paper towels.  Place in a warm oven (180 degrees) while frying the remainder of the balls.  Pour bagna cauda into individual ramekins and serve as a dipping sauce.

                        domestic mushrooms here)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2        medium  red onion -- finely sliced
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  8                     fresh sage leaves -- finely chopped
  6             ounces  dry red wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring 2 1/2 cups water to boil and add polenta in a thin stream, stirring constantly.  When polenta is all in, lower heat to simmer and cook until very thick, or the consistency of thick oatmeal.

Pour polenta into clean brownie pan (8-inch by 12-inch) and smooth over top with back of spoon to form even thickness.  Allow to cool and then cut out round shapes with a 3-inch diameter wine glass.

Preheat broiler.

In a large 12-inch to 14-inch saute pan, place mushrooms and olive oil under broiler.  Brown lightly, shaking occasionally for 2 minutes.  Remove from broiler and add onions, garlic and sage and saute on top of stove at high heat until browned all over.  Add wine and reduce to 2 tablespoons and set aside.

On a broiler pan, place polenta and cook until crusty and evenly browned and hot (about 2 to 3 minutes).  Place one round in center of each plate and divide warm mushroom mixture over each.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 appetizer servings.

                Robiola In Chestnuts With Persimmon Sauce

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  robiola cheese
                        = (packages come with two 4-oz cubes)
     1/2           cup  roasted chestnuts -- finely chopped
  1                     ripe persimmon
  2             ounces  orange juice
  2        tablespoons  sugar

In New York City you can find roasted chestnuts readily.  However, if you can not find roasted chestnuts, here is what to do.  Take 10 chestnuts and score a cross on the pointed end of each chestnut.  Roast in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes.  Peel and chop.

Remove the Robiola cheese from its package and drain its liquid.  Cut each cube into 2 pieces.  Gently press each piece into the chestnuts.  The chestnuts should adhere to all sides of the cheese.  Set aside at room temperature.

Peel and seed the persimmon and place in a blender with the orange juice and sugar.  Blend until smooth, about 1 minute.

Divide the sauce among 4 dessert plates, place a piece of nut crusted cheese in the center of each plate and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  Fresh Homemade Sausage -- (see recipe)
                        = (or Italian style from your butcher)
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  4                     Russet potatoes -- scrubbed, skin on,
                        cut 1" cubes, in cold water to cover
  2              large  Spanish onions -- cut 1" cubes
  2                     dried hot chilies - (abt 2" to 3" long)
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1                     garlic head -- cloves removed
                        but not peeled
  6             ounces  dry white wine

Pre-heat your broiler and oven to 400 degrees.

Prick the sausages all over with a pin and place them in a roasting pan.  Place them under a broiler and cook for 3 minutes.  Turn the sausages over and continue to cook for another three minutes.  Remove from the broiler and drain all the fat.  Set aside.

In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the olive oil until just smoking.  Drain the potatoes well and place them in a hot pan.  Add the onions and saute until they are both lightly browned, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the chilies, rosemary, whole garlic cloves and white wine.  Saute one minute more, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen the browned bits.

Place the sausage on top of the potatoes and place in hot oven.  Roast the mixture until the potatoes are very tender, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                  Sauteed Apples In Amarone With Asiago

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- divided
  4             medium  Granny Smith or Macintosh apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and quartered
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
  6             ounces  Amarone wine
                        = (or other full bodied wine from Veneto)
     1/2         pound  fresh Asiago cheese
                        = (the youngest cheese possible)

Heat a large 12- to 14-inch saute pan over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of the butter.  The butter should sputter and begin to brown immediately.

When the butter stops sputtering, but before it turns very dark brown, add the apples.  Continue to cook 3 to 4 minutes until softened yet still retaining their shape.

Add sugar, nutmeg and wine and cook 1 minute.  Add 2 tablespoons cold butter and shake the pan to completely blend the butter into the wine mixture, forming a creamy emulsion.

Spoon the apples into a shallow serving dish.  Shave the Asiago cheese into paper thin shards over the apple mixture using a peeler or a shovel nose cheese knife.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings as dessert or cheese course.

  12            ounces  Stracchino cheese -- well refrigerated
     1/2           cup  pine nuts -- spread on a plate
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- divided
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  6             ounces  Amaretto liqueur

Ask your cheese monger to cut the cheese into a 4- by 4-inch square roughly 3 inches high.  Cut this block into 4 equal pieces and gently press the cut side of the cheese onto the plate of pine nuts, creating a crust on one side.  Continue with each piece until all four are crusted on one side.

Heat a 10-inch nonstick pan over medium heat.  Add 1 tablespoon butter and saute 2 pieces of cheese, nut crusted-side down.  Cook until lightly brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove and place each piece on a separate plate, nut crusted-side up.  Repeat this procedure with the remaining 2 pieces.  Remove any nuts that fell off the cheese.

Add the cinnamon, 2 remaining tablespoons butter and Amaretto.  Turn the heat to high and reduce to about 4 tablespoons.  Remove from heat and spoon 1 tablespoon of liqueur over each piece of cheese.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

        Spaghetti W Bitter Greens, Garlic & Pecorino Romano Cheese

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried spaghetti
  2        tablespoons  salt
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1              bunch  bitter greens -- chopped 1/2" pieces
                        = (broccoli rabe, kale or collard greens)
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes - (to 1/2 tspn) -- or to taste
  1                cup  freshly-grated Pecorino-Romano cheese

If you have the ingredients organized this dish can be assembled in the amount of time it takes to cook the pasta.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop the pasta into the boiling water and cook for 8 to 12 minutes until tender but al dente.

Meanwhile heat a large 12- to 14-inch saute pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil.  Allow the oil to heat until smoking, add the garlic and cook until lightly brown, about 1 minute.  Toss the greens into the pan stirring quickly to coat the greens evenly.  The greens should wilt within 2 to 3 minutes but remain bright green in color.  Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper.

When the pasta is cooked, drain in a colander over the sink into a bowl.  Reserve 1 cup of cooking liquid.  Toss the hot pasta into the pan with the greens.  Place over a medium heat and stir to mix well.  If the mixture is too dry add some of the reserved pasta liquid.  Add the grated Pecorino cheese and toss.  Pour into a heated serving bowl and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  virgin olive oil

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

On each skewer, slide 3 cubes of bread and 2 cubes of mozzarella, starting with the bread and alternating with the cheese.  Set aside.

Place the skewers on an oiled cookie sheet in the center of your oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the bread is toasted and the cheese is sagging but not melted.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     jumbo artichokes
  1                     lemon -- halved
     1/2        medium  red onion -- finely chopped
  3             ounces  vegetable oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs -- lightly toasted
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt.

Pull off the outer dark green leaves of each artichoke until what remains is pale at the base and green at the ends of tips.  Cut off the green points to about 1-inch from top of pointy end.  Each time you cut the artichoke rub the freshly cut sides with half a lemon.  This will retain its light color.  Cut the artichokes into quarters.  Using a small sharp knife, trim away the choke from the inside.  Rub all cut edges with lemon.  Boil 5 minutes and refresh in cold water.  Drain and set aside.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

In a medium saute pan saute onion and garlic over medium heat in 3 ounces of olive oil until softened, 8 to 10 minutes.  Allow to cool and stir in parsley, grated cheese and fresh toasted breadcrumbs.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer all to a shallow casserole, just large enough to hold artichokes in one layer.  Bake uncovered about 20 minutes or until breadcrumbs are golden brown.

This recipe yields 4 antipasto servings.

Pull off the outer dark green leaves of each artichoke until what remains is pale at the base and green at the ends of tips.  Cut off the green points to about 1-inch from top of pointy end.  Each time you cut the artichoke rub the freshly cut sides with half a lemon.  This will retain its light color.  Cut the artichokes into quarters.  Using a small sharp knife, trim away the choke from the inside.  Rub all cut edges with lemon.  Boil 5 minutes and refresh in cold water.  Drain and set aside.

<DirT>
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium saute pan saute onion and garlic over medium heat in 3 ounces of olive oil until softened, 8 to 10 minutes.  Allow to cool and stir in parsley, grated cheese and fresh toasted breadcrumbs.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer all to a shallow casserole, just large enough to hold artichokes in one layer.  Bake uncovered about 20 minutes or until breadcrumbs are golden brown.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  red onions -- peeled with root
                        and stem attached, halved lengthwise
  2              large  red bell peppers -- halved, seeded
  2              large  tomatoes -- halved across
                        equator, seeds and juice scooped and saved
  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs -- lightly toasted
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated parmesan
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring two quarts water to boil.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Drop 4 onion halves in boiling water and blanche 2 minutes until pliable and remove.  When cool enough to touch, remove inner half of onion using a paring knife, leaving behind the outer three or four layers intact, shaped like a cup.

Chop the onion insides and mix in large mixing bowl with tomato seeds and juices, bread crumbs grated cheese, parsley and olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper.

In a shallow, oven-proof serving casserole just large enough to hold all vegetables, place peppers, onion cups and tomatoes all cut-side up.  Stuff vegetables with bread crumb mixture just to top and drizzle a thin stream of olive oil over each.  Bake uncovered about 30 minutes or until bread crumbs on top of each are dark brown and crispy.  Serve immediately or at room temperature.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             large  zucchini blossoms
  4        tablespoons  pine nuts -- toasted under
                        broiler until dark brown
  8             ounces  ricotta cheese
  1              large  egg
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  salt -- divided
  1              bunch  watercress -- stems removed,
                        washed, and spun dry
  8             ounces  plain yogurt
  4             ounces  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
                        Juice of 1 lemon

Wash and pat dry zucchini blossoms and set aside.

Mix 2 tablespoons pine nuts, ricotta, egg, parsley and nutmeg in a medium mixing bowl until homogenous and of a rough paste-like consistency.

Gently open each flower and, using a small teaspoon, place 2 tablespoons ricotta mixture in each flower and close up again by twisting ends of flower like the ends of a mustache.  Set aside.

In a blender, mix 1/2 watercress, yogurt and 1/2 teaspoon salt until smooth and creamy (about 1 minute).

In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick pan, heat 1 ounce of the extra-virgin olive oil until just smoking and place 6 blossoms in pan.  Cook until golden brown (about 2 minutes) and turn once, cook 1 minute more and remove to warm plate.  Repeat with remaining blossoms.

While last blossoms are cooking, toss remaining watercress with remaining 2 ounces of extra-virgin olive oil and juice of 1 lemon to coat.  Divide into center of 4 plates.  Drizzle a puddle of yogurt sauce around watercress and place 3 warm blossoms in Mercedes-Benz angles on top of sauce.  Sprinkle each plate with a few of the remaining pine nuts and serve.

         Warm Monkfish Paillard W Beer-Glazed Endive & Basil Oil

Recipe By     :Mario Batali

Categories    : Appetizers                      Fish (Ocean)
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  monkfish -- bones, skin removed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/2           cup  virgin olive oil
  4              large  Belgian endive - (abt 3/4 lb) -- halved lengthwise
  1                cup  Pilsner beer
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  basil leaves - (loosely packed)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Zest of 1 lemon in long pieces

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bring 6 cups water to boil.

Slice three 3/4-inch pieces of monkfish and place all three between oiled pieces of aluminum foil.  Lightly pound with flat side of side of cleaver or large knife until about 1/32-inch thick and three pieces have more or less joined together.  Flip "paillard" out onto center of cool plate and set aside.  Continue process with remainder of fish to yield four plates with 6-inch rounds of thin fish in the center.

In a 12-inch skillet, heat 2 tablespoons virgin olive oil over medium heat.  Cook eight pieces of endive cut-side down until golden brown (about 5 to 7 minutes).  Add beer and sprinkle with sugar and bake 10 minutes in 400 degree oven.  Remove from oven and allow to cool in liquid about 10 minutes.

Make ice bath with one cup ice cubes and two cups water.  Plunge basil leaves in boiling water and cook 20 seconds.  Remove from boiling water, drain and plunge into ice bath.  When cool, drain basil leaves and press out excess water.  Blend basil leaves and 1/2 cup virgin olive oil until smooth and bright green.  Set aside.

Remove cooked endive from liquid and drain.  Place four plates with paillards in 400 degree oven for 30 seconds to one minute or until fish has just whitened but has not yet begun to shrivel at the edges.  Remove from oven and place 2 pieces of endive in center of plate on top of fish.  Drizzle with 2 tablespoons basil oil, season with salt and pepper, sprinkle with lemon zest and serve.

This recipe yields 4 antipasto servings.
