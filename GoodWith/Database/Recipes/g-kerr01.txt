Recipe By     :Graham Kerr
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              small  apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced 1/2" thick
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  Calvados -- plus
  2        tablespoons  Calvados
  1                cup  flour -- sifted
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4         ounce  yeast
     3/8           cup  flat beer
     3/8           cup  apple juice
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2                egg white -- stiffly beaten
                        Oil -- for deep frying
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dredging
  1              pound  canned apricot halves
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4           cup  Slivovitz
                        Grated rind of 1/2 orange
     3/8           cup  cream
  1                     egg yolk

Place apple slices in a bowl.  Sprinkle with sugar and 1/4 cup Calvados and allow to macerate 15 minutes.

Make batter by placing sifted flour and salt into a warm bowl.  Make a well in the center of the flour.  Add the yeast, beer, apple juice and olive oil.  Combine to form a smooth batter.  Cover the bowl and allow the mixture to stand 4 hours.  After this period add a little more beer if necessary and fold in the half egg white stiffly beaten.

Heat oil for deep frying.  Place macerated apple slices into a small frying basket and then place this basket into the batter.  Allow all the apple slices to become well coated in the batter.  Drain and then place into the hot oil.  Fry the beignets for 3 minutes, or until batter is crisp and golden, drain and dredge in confectioner's sugar and serve accompanied by the apricot sauce.

Apricot Sauce:  Place apricots into a pan on high heat.  Add the butter and allow to melt.  Flavor with cinnamon.  Pour in Slivovitz and light.  When flames have almost died down, add the remaining 2 tablespoons Calvados.  Add the grated rind of half an orange, and then stir in the cream.  Puree in blender and then pour mixture back into the pan and heat.  Whisk in the egg yolk and then place sauce into sauceboat.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Graham Kerr
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  flour -- plus more
                        for dusting
  1 1/8            cup  suet
  1           teaspoon  baking powder - (heaping)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  water
  8             ounces  beef kidney -- cut 1" pieces
  1 1/2         pounds  rump steak -- cut 1" pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     parsley stalks -- cut 1/4" pieces
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme
  1                cup  mushrooms -- cut 1/2" slices
  12                    oysters -- plus their juice
     1/4           cup  red wine

For pastry:  Combine flour, suet, baking powder, salt and water to form a smooth dough.  Dust a smooth surface with flour and press out pastry with fingers to form a circle 1/4-inch thick.  Lay a pudding cloth or cheesecloth into a basin or large ovenproof bowl and mold the pastry to it.

In a separate bowl, combine kidney and steak.  Season well with salt and pepper. Add parsley and thyme.  Dust with a little flour.

Place half the meat mixture into the suet crust.  Add half the mushrooms, then the remaining meat, and the mushrooms again.  Add enough oyster juice to the wine to make 1/2 cup and pour into the pudding.

Brush the edges of the crust with water.  Use the cloth to fold the pastry sides over to cover the filling.  Cut away excess dough.  Tie cloth with a string.

Bring a pot (large enough to completely enclose the pudding bowl) filled half way with water to a boil.  Place pudding bowl in pot -- the water should reach up to 3/4 of the sides of the bowl.  Cover with lid.  Or to mold the pudding to the shape of a babyís head, remove the nob from the lid of the pot and thread the clothís string through the exposed holes.  Secure the string to the potís handles to suspend the pudding in the pot.

Boil pudding for 3 1/2 hours.  Make sure the water doesnít boil away.  One hint: place two marbles in the pot with the water.  Their pinging will notify you when the water completely evaporates.

Remove pudding from bowl.  Carefully pull away pudding cloth and invert pudding onto a large, heated serving dish.  Cut out a top in the puddingís crust and add the oysters, mixing them in with a fork.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A Classic English dish based upon a pudding made at the Exeter Inn, Devon, England.

  2        tablespoons  clarified butter
  1             medium  onion -- thinly sliced
  4                     bacon slices -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  16            ounces  water
  16            ounces  bitter beer -- flat
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1                     bay leaf

In medium saute pan, lightly saute mushrooms in the remaining tablespoon of clarified butter.  Add lemon juice and cayenne.

Strain the meat braising liquid and return to roasting pan, skimming any remaining fat.  Bring to a boil.  Mix arrowroot with reserved beer and add to pan.  Cook for another minute to thicken.  Add the oysters and mushrooms.

  8        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar -- for dusting, plus

  1                     spiny lobster - (6 lbs)
  6        tablespoons  clarified butter
     1/2           cup  diced onion

     1/4           cup  brandy
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     5/8           cup  fish stock
  10            ounces  tomato -- peeled, and
                        roughly chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  2                     egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  cream

Preheat oven to broil.  Remove lobster head and rinse well.  Remove claws, and legs.  Remove meat from claws and cut up roughly.  Break up lobster shell.  Split lobster tail down the center, careful not to cut all the way through.

In a large casserole dish or roasting pan, add 3 tablespoons clarified butter, the onion, scallion, garlic, and carrot.  Saute over medium heat for a few minutes.  Add parsley stalks, bay leaf, and thyme.  Add the lobster head, claws, and legs.  Saute until the shells turn bright red.

Add the brandy and flambe.  Douse the flames with the wine and fish stock.  Add tomatoes.  Season with salt and pepper, and bring the sauce to a simmer.  Simmer for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, brush a broiler rack with rest of clarified butter.  Place lobster tail on rack, cut-side down.  Broil for 8 minutes.  Turn, drizzle cut side with a little clarified butter and cook another 6 minutes.  Remove the flesh from the shell and cut into chunks.  Keep warm on a heated serving dish.

Pass the sauce through a sieve into a small, clean pan.  Add curry powder.  Whisk together egg yolks and cream.  Whisk into sauce, stirring quickly to avoid curdling.  Pour sauce over lobster pieces to serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  10            pounds  saddle of pork - (6 ribs) -- cut short on
                        flap or skirt
  3                     pork kidneys
  1              pinch  thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Butcher's twine
                        Clarified butter -- as needed

Ask your butcher to debone the saddle of pork for you.  Wash the kidneys thoroughly and slice them in half lengthwise.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place a meat platter to heat in the warming oven.

Remove the rind from the lower flaps (or breast).  Score the remaining top rind with a sharp knife in long diagonal strokes, both ways in order to form diamonds.  Place the saddle flat on the board inside-up and season generously with freshly ground salt and black pepper and thyme.  Place the kidneys on top and roll up firmly.  Tie securely with string every 2 inches.  Place the saddle on a roasting pan and season the outside with salt and white pepper.  Drizzle clarified butter across the meat.

Roast the saddle in a preheated 375 degree oven for 3 hours and 20 minutes.  No basting is required.  The saddle has its own fat to keep it moist.  Remove the saddle to a cutting board and cut off the string.  Cut the rind down the center and run a carving knife under rind and remove.  Cut the crispy rind into serving size pieces, if desired.  Put on the warm meat platter and carve.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Saddle of pork stuffed with pork kidneys and roasted.  Speciality of "The Hotel Majestic", Cannes, France.

Recommended Drink:  A good dry white Burgundy or a cool but excellent Rose.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  granulated sugar
  10            ounces  hazelnuts
  3 1/2         ounces  sultana raisins
  3             medium  carrots - (10 oz)
  6                     egg yokes
  6                     egg whites
  1           teaspoon  cold water
                        Freshly-ground salt
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon zest (thin rind)
  1           teaspoon  all purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  4          teaspoons  raspberry jam
  1         tablespoon  icing sugar (confectioners' sugar)

Sift the granulated sugar.  Crush the hazelnuts very small (best results in a blender).  Wash the sultanas.  Wash and grate the carrots.  Grease the cake tin (9- by 12-inch deep).  Place a bowl over a pan of hot water.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Into a warmed bowl place the egg yolks and 4 ounces of the granulated sugar and whisk together until the mixture thickens.  (It should be doubled in bulk, lighter in color and creamy in texture).  When this happens, set aside the yolk and sugar mixture for a moment (off the heat).

Into a clean, cold bowl place the whites of eggs, add 1 teaspoonful cold water and some freshly ground salt and whisk quickly until they are stiff and peaked.  Gradually beat into the fluffy whites of eggs the remaining 6 ounces of granulated sugar until it is fully incorporated.  Set aside until required.

Place the egg yolk mixture over the warm water and add the ground nuts and lemon juice.  To this add the grated carrots and lemon zest.  Fold in the 1 teaspoonful of flour and sultanas.  Remove the bowl from the heated water.  Fold in 2 tablespoonfuls of egg whites.  Then put all the mixture into the remainder of the whites of eggs and fold in well.  Add the 1/4 teaspoonful of cinnamon.

Pour all the mixture into the greased cake tin and put it into the preheated oven set at 350 degrees, on the middle shelf, for 60 minutes.  Remove cake from the pan and cool completely.  Cut cake in half, spread the jam over the bottom and replace top.  Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A specialty of "Grut Farm" just outside Zurich, Switzerland.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  canned Turtle Soup
                        Juice from 1/4 lemon
                        Freshly-ground salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2                     egg yolks
  3             ounces  butter -- cut into 3 pieces
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  2        tablespoons  cold whipping cream

Remove the turtle meat from the can of soup and chop it into small pieces.  Pour the soup into a pan and heat.  Add the turtle meat and simmer.

Into the top of a heated double boiler, place the lemon juice and some freshly ground salt and white pepper.  Beat in the egg yolks and gradually add the cubes of butter stirring constantly.  Whisk in the curry powder and nutmeg.  Continue beating and increase the heat under the soup.  Dribble the cold cream down the sides of the pan and beat in thoroughly.  The sauce will now be thickening very fast, so lower the heat under the double boiler.  (If the sauce curdles, then add an ice cube and whip it away from the heat).

Pour the hot soup into cups and top with the thick cream sauce.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Turtle Soup topped with a thick cream sauce.  A specialty of Apollo Hotel, Amsterdam, Holland.

  2              large  capon chicken breasts
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  1                     beaten egg -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
                        Olive oil -- to coat surface
                        of large frypan to cook chicken breasts
  4             ounces  mushrooms -- stalks removed,
                        and halved

Make tomato sauce.  Place clarified butter into a frypan and add the carrots, onion and garlic.  Allow the vegetables to fry 2 minutes.  Add the tomato paste and allow to cook until the tomato paste has deepened in color.

Add the tomatoes, sugar and white wine.  Season with salt, pepper and basil.  Bring to a vigorous boil and allow to cook for 10 minutes.  Strain through a fine sieve.  Deglaze pan with a little white wine and add this to the strained sauce.

Flatten chicken breasts and season with salt and pepper.  Coat with Parmesan cheese and then paint with the egg and olive oil mixture.  Place into the bread crumbs and coat both sides.  Place enough olive oil into a large frypan to coat surface and add the chicken breasts.  Cook 3 minutes on each side.

Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and add the lemon juice.  Pour half the tomato sauce around the chicken and cover the breasts with the cheese slices.  Cover the pan and allow the cheese to melt.  When the cheese has melted scatter the finely chopped parsley over the chicken.

Remove the chicken breasts to a serving dish.  Add a little more tomato sauce to the pan, deglaze and then spoon the mushrooms and the sauce around the chicken.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  butter
  1                cup  flour
  2 1/2           cups  milk

     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2 1/2           cups  reduced chicken stock
  4        tablespoons  grated parmesan cheese
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
                        Finely chopped parsley -- for garnish

Make crepe batter by placing flour into a bowl.  Make a well in the center and add egg, yolk and salt.  Combine slowly with milk to form a smooth batter.  Allow to stand 4 hours.

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a crepe pan.  Place a small ladleful of batter into the pan and roll it around until it covers the pan base.  Cook until waxy bubbles appear on the surface then turn the crepe over with a palette knife.  Finish cooking and remove to a plate.  Continue until 8 crepes are made.

Poach celery for 5 minutes in boiling salted water.  Place clarified butter into a casserole dish on top of the stove.  Add the carrot and onion and fry until golden.  Add the chicken, cover and allow to steam 10 minutes.  Add cold water to cover, bring to a boil, and simmer for 1 1/4 hours.  Remove chicken and cut into small pieces and reduce chicken stock to 2 1/2 cups.  Strain.

To make the sauce, melt the butter in a pan and add the flour.  Stir to form a roux and whisk in the milk to form a thick sauce.  Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Add the wine and simmer 10 minutes.  Add the chicken stock and simmer 5 minutes longer.  Add poached celery to the chicken flesh and then combine with 2 cups of the sauce.  Add 3 tablespoons of cheese to remaining sauce.

Lay crepes onto an ovenproof dish.  Place a heaping tablespoon of the celery and chicken mixture in the center of each crepe.  Fold and turn over.  Coat with cheese sauce.  Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and place under the broiler to brown (about 5 minutes).  Serve sprinkled with cayenne pepper and garnished with finely chopped parsley.

                              Dutch Pancakes

Recipe By     :Graham Kerr
Serving Size  : 3     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast                       Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  flour -- sifted
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1              whole  egg
  3                     egg yolks
  1 1/4           cups  milk
  1              ounce  butter -- plus extra, softened
                        for dotting tops of pancakes
  4             slices  bacon
  1         tablespoon  maple syrup -- plus
     1/4           cup  maple syrup
  1                     green apple (Granny Smith) -- cored, sliced thin
                        Sugar -- for dusting
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  arrowroot
  1              pinch  cinnamon

Make the pancake batter by combining flour and freshly ground salt and pepper.  Make a well in the center and add 1 whole egg, 1 egg yolk and the milk gradually and beating all the time.  Set aside in a cool place for 2 hours.

Melt 1 ounce butter in the frying pan.  Add it to the batter mixture.  Pour the batter into the pan and rotate until the base is evenly covered.  When the topside looks waxy the underside is cooked.  Flip over using a palette knife.  Cook lightly and then turn pancake from the pan "second-side up" onto a heated serving dish.  (This side gets a complete cooking later when covered by bacon and broiled.)  Lay slices of bacon on top and 1 tablespoon of syrup.  Put dish under broiler and cook bacon for 2 1/2 minutes.

Meanwhile prepare a second pancake.  When the bacon is cooked cover it with the second pancake.  Arrange thin slices of apple around the top of the pancakes.  Dust with sugar and small pieces of softened butter.  Return to the broiler until apples are soft and glazed -- approximately 2 1/2 minutes.

Now make the sauce.  Heat the 1/4 cup of maple syrup and the cream in a pan.  Mix the arrowroot and the remaining 2 egg yolks together and add them to the pan.  As it comes gently to the boil add a pinch of cinnamon.  Stir constantly to avoid curdling.  Remove from heat when thick and pour over the pancakes.  Serve piping hot -- immediately.

This recipe yields 3 servings.

Comments:  Pancakes filled with bacon, topped with glazed apples and smothered by a fresh cream and maple syrup sauce.  A specialty of the "Port Van Cleve", Amsterdam, Holland.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     5/8           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- plus extra
                        for seasoning
  1                     egg
     1/4           cup  dry sherry
  1 1/2    tablespoons  melted butter
  5               cups  olive oil -- for deep frying
  12                    mussels
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  clarified butter
  1                     green pepper -- finely diced
     1/2        medium  onion -- finely diced
     1/2           cup  shelled raw shrimp -- finely sliced
  2                     pimentos -- finely diced
     1/2           cup  crabmeat -- finely sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              sprig  lemon thyme

                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

First prepare the dough.  In a bowl mix flour with baking powder, sugar and salt.  Make a well in the center of the flour and add egg, the sherry and the melted butter.  Mix quickly with a spatula forming a smooth dough.  Knead lightly and then place in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Place olive oil into a deep fryer and set at 370 degrees.

Place mussels in a saucepan with 2 tablespoons dry white wine, cover with lid and place on heat, shaking from time to time -- cook 2 minutes.  Take mussels from shell, remove beard, finely slice mussels.

Place clarified butter into a frypan and add green pepper and onion.  Saute gently and then add raw shrimp and pimento -- stir until shrimp is colored and then add crab and mussels.  Season with salt, pepper and lemon thyme.  Remove mixture from heat and allow to cool completely.

Roll pastry dough out thinly.  Cut pastry into 1 1/2-inch by 3-inch pieces.  Brush with egg white and place a teaspoon of filling in the center of each.  Dab your fingers in a little flour and fold pastry over and secure by pressing gently around edges.  Drop 'empanadas' into the hot oil and cook 3 1/2 minutes or until puffed and golden.  Turn them once.  Place on serving dish and dust with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 20 little pies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/2         ounces  wet yeast
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1                cup  milk -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  warm water
  6               cups  flour -- plus more for
                        kneading, sifted, kept in a warm place
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground salt
     3/4           cup  butter
     3/4           cup  dried fruit
     1/8           cup  mixed citrus peel
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  cold water

Combine yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in a small bowl.  Let stand for 10 minutes.  Combine milk and water in a pot; heat until lukewarm.

In a large bowl, combine flour and salt.  Rub in butter with fingertips.  Add yeast mixture and remaining sugar.  Gradually add the warmed milk.  Blend until the dough becomes elastic and starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl.  Mix in the fruit and peel.

Turn dough onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth and pliable.  Dust inside of a warm bowl; place dough in it.  Cover with a lightly floured clean towel.  Leave in a warm place, about 100 degrees, until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured board.  Gently knead; do not overwork.  Cut dough into 6 even pieces.  Shape into even, smooth rounds.

Place cakes onto a baking sheet and cover with a towel.  Let rest another 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Once rested, bake cakes for 30 minutes.

To make glaze:  Dissolve 1/4 cup sugar in water over low heat.  Brush over hot cakes.  Cool and serve.

This recipe yields 6 large buns.

Comments:  A Specialty of England, even if they donít serve Russian tea.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Bones from sole
  1                cup  fish stock
  1                cup  dry white wine
  12                    sole fillets, totaling 1 3/4 lbs -- rinsed, plus
  1              pound  sole fillets -- ground smooth
                        for quenelles
  1                cup  cold water
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  flour -- sifted
  1              whole  egg -- plus
  2                     egg whites -- beaten together
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/4           cups  heavy whipping cream
     1/2                Granny Smith apple -- peeled, sliced thin
  2        tablespoons  Calvados
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder
  12            medium  shrimp -- shelled, deveined
  2        tablespoons  Beurre Manie -- (see below)
                        === BEURRE MANIE ===
     1/4           cup  soft unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  flour

In large saute pan, heat fish bones, fish stock, and wine.  Add fillets and gently bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to simmer and cover.  Cook about 6 minutes or until done.  Remove from pan to a plate, and cover with buttered paper to keep warm.  Reserve poaching liquid.

The quenelles:  Meanwhile, in another pot, bring to boil the cold water with a pinch of salt.  Stir in 1/4 cup of the butter, just to melt.  Remove from heat and stir in flour.  Beat thoroughly with a wooden spoon until the mixture begins to pull away from the sides of the pot.  Let cool.  Add egg and whites and mix well.  Season ground sole with salt and white pepper.  Add to pot with flour-egg mixture.  Beat well.  Gradually add 1/4 cup of cream.  Place quenelle mixture in a pastry bag with a 1-inch plain nozzle or use teaspoons; see below.

Add the apple slices, Calvados, and curry powder to the sole poaching liquid.  Simmer over low heat.  Add remaining 1 cup of the cream.  Bring to a boil and reduce to a fast simmer.  Pipe quenelle mixture directly into the poaching liquid pot or use 2 spoons to mold the mixture into oval shapes.  Add the shrimp.  Stir gently and poach for 3 minutes.  Stir in 2 tablespoons Beurre Manie to thicken.  Cook for another minute to lose any floury taste.

For Beurre Manie:  Combine flour and butter on a clean surface.  Knead together well.  This makes more than you'll need for the Sole.

To serve, cover fillets with the quenelles and some sauce.

This recipe yields 4 first course servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     eggs -- separated
     1/4      teaspoon  dry mustard
                        Salt -- to taste

  1              pinch  chervil
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  tomato paste
     1/2      teaspoon  brandy
  3                     anchovy fillets -- small diced

  4             ounces  sole
  4             ounces  salmon
  4             ounces  scallops

Sauce:  Beat the egg whites until stiff and set aside.

Put the egg yolks into a bowl and place over a pot of warm water.  Beat with an electric mixer until they are light and creamy.  Remove from the heat.  Add the mustard and a pinch of fresh ground salt and pepper and continue beating gradually adding 1/4 cup oil, drop by drop.  If the mayonnaise should curdle and lose its bulk add some of the beaten egg white.  Continue to add the remainder of the oil so that the mixture is smooth and creamy.  Add the boiling water.  Set aside.

In a fourth bowl the curry powder.  In the fifth tomato paste and brandy.  Sixth bowl the anchovies.  The seventh bowl should be the flaked almonds, without mayonnaise.  Pour these sauces into the fondue sauce trays.

Remove all bones from the fish.  Cut the fish into bite-size pieces.  Heat the oil in the fondue pot and set the fish cubes attractively on a serving platter.  Place a piece of fish on a skewer and dip it into the oil for 1 to 2 minutes and then dunk into the various sauces.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Warm a large bowl.  Add sifted flour; make a well.  To the well, add the yeast, 3/8 cup of the milk, sugar, and salt.  Mix until the yeast has dissolved.  Add eggs and beat with hands until well combined and smooth.  Cover bowl and put in a warm place for 45 minutes.

After 45 minutes, add the butter and remaining 1/4 cup milk.  Beat hard for a couple of minutes.  Half fill 4 greased small cake molds.  Cover molds and place in a warm spot for 10 minutes.  Once risen, place in oven for 20 minutes.  Unmold onto cake rack and allow to cool a little.  Meanwhile, make sauce.

For Sauce:  In a saute pan, large enough to hold all the babas, combine butter and sugar over medium-high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon of the rum and sultanas(raisins), peel, and grapes.  Stir to coat well.

Place the babas into the fudge mixture.  Prick lightly with a fork and turn in the sauce to coat well.  Pour 2 tablespoons of rum over each baba and set alight.  Serve babas with sauce and whipped cream.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     frying chicken - (3 lbs)
  1 1/4           cups  chicken stock
                        Freshly-ground salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Clarified butter -- as needed
     1/4           cup  unmelted butter
     1/4           cup  flour -- sifted
  1                can  cepes - (14 oz) -- drained, and
                        juices reserved
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  2                     garlic cloves -- gently bruised
                        Chopped fresh parsley
  1                     truffle -- drained, sliced fine
                        juices reserved

Cut the chicken into portions.  Begin by removing the legs and chop in half by cutting at the center joint, giving you a drumstick and a thigh.  Cut off the neck and slice into little pieces and put this together with the wings into the chicken stock.  Chop through the breast and put the back part of the chicken into the simmering stock.  Sever the actual breast into 3 pieces and remove the tiny bones.  Dry the chicken portions with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.

Heat some clarified butter in a frying pan and when hot, place the legs and thighs in to fry (these portions take longest to cook).

After a couple of minutes turn the chicken pieces.  It should be a crisp golden color.  Now add the chicken breasts and allow all the pieces to continue cooking.  Turn the breast portions until evenly colored.

Heat another pan and add the unmelted butter to begin the 'Roux'.  Once the butter has melted remove the pan from the heat and add the flour.  Stir it well then return to the heat and stir the 'roux' briskly so that all the flour is cooked.

Turn the chicken portions once again and reduce to medium heat.

Remove the roux from the heat and blend in the chicken stock gradually.  Stir briskly so that no lumps form.  Return to the heat and bring the sauce to a boil, stirring continually.  Boil for 3 minutes and then reduce heat to a low simmer.

Add the juice from the tin of cepes, white wine, and cream to the simmering sauce.  Bring it all to the boil stirring constantly.

Turn the chicken once again and add the garlic.  Allow it to give up its flavor for 2 minutes only, then discard.

Whisk the sauce until smooth and creamy.

Pour off the butter and chicken juices into a dish, and fry the cepes with the chicken in the pan.

Pour the sauce over the chicken and cepes and add the juice from the truffle and the chopped parsley.  Place the entire concoction into a heated serving dish and sprinkle the truffle slices over the top.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Chicken portions shallow fried in butter and coated with a white wine sauce containing cepes and truffles.  A specialty of "La Truffiere" in Paris, France.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPONGE CAKE ===
  4                     eggs
     1/2           cup  superfine sugar
  1                cup  flour -- sifted
  1              pinch  salt
                        === PASTRY CREAM ===
  3 3/4           cups  milk
  6                     egg yolks
     3/4           cup  superfine sugar
     3/4           cup  flour
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
                        === MERINGUE ===
  6                     egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
  2               cups  sugar
                        === GARNISH ===
  4        tablespoons  Creme de Cacao
  4        tablespoons  almond slivers
                        Confectioners' sugar for dusting -- sifted

To make sponge cake:  Place the eggs and sugar into a bowl standing over hot water and whisk until the mixture is pale and thickened (about 5 minutes).  Remove from the heat and whisk for 2 minutes more.  Fold in the sifted flour and add the salt.  Pour into an 8-inch cake tin which has been greased, sugared and floured.  Bake in a 375 degree oven for 25 minutes.  Cool on a cake rack.

To make pastry cream:  Heat milk until boiling.  Mix the egg yolks with the sugar and when well combined add the flour.  Whisk until smooth and then gradually add the hot milk.  Place the pastry cream back into the saucepan over a gentle heat and whisk until cream comes to a boil and thickens.  Flavor with almond extract and then lower heat and allow to cook 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool placing a piece of buttered waxed paper over the surface to prevent a skin from forming.

To make meringue:  Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Flavor with almond extract and then fold in the sugar.  This mixture should be very thick.

To garnish:  Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Cut cake into 3 layers.  Soak bottom and middle layer with creme de cacao.  Spread the bottom and middle layers of the cake with the cooled pastry cream and sprinkle with the almond slivers.  Reform the cake and place onto a large round oven dish.  Spread cake with a thin layer of meringue.

Fill a large piping bag with a rose shaped tip and pipe meringue in vertical loops around the sides and on top of the cake.  Dust cake with sifted confectioners' sugar and place into oven for 3 minutes to lightly brown.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  ice water

  2             ounces  butter
  4             ounces  flour -- sifted

                        === PASTRY CREAM ===
  1               pint  milk
  1                     vanilla bean
  4             ounces  superfine sugar
  3                     egg yolks
  2             ounces  sifted flour
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2          pints  heavy whipping cream
  5                     dessert spoonfuls sugar
                        === TOFFEE ===
  4             ounces  water
  8             ounces  sugar
  1                     dessert spoonful glucose
                        = (available at candy supply store)
                        === GARNISH ===
  8             ounces  candied fruit -- diced
  3             ounces  dark chocolate -- melted, spread to
                        set, and curled with a pastry scraper

For Pastry Base:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Sift flour onto a board or into a medium bowl.  Make a well in the center.  Add butter and egg to well and mix them together.  Mix sugar into butter and eggs.  Combine with the flour, adding water as needed.  Allow pastry to stand for 30 minutes before rolling.

Roll into a 10-inch round.  Place on greased baking sheet.  Cover with a round of greased parchment paper and weigh pastry down with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake 10 minutes, then remove paper and weights.  Bake 10 minutes more.  Remove from oven and let cool.

For Choux Pastry:  Bring water and butter to a boil in a saucepan.  Add sifted flour to pan, all at once,and beat hard until mixture is smooth and comes away from the sides of the pan.  Turn out onto a plate to cool.

When cool, place the pastry in a medium bowl and add the eggs, one at a time, beating hard in between each addition.  Add the salt.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Place the pastry into a piping bag with a large nozzle and pipe small nut shapes onto a greased, floured baking sheet.  Bake for 12 minutes.  Turn off the heat and keep pastry in oven for 20 more minutes to dry out the centers.  Cool and store in an airtight container until ready to use.

Pastry Cream:  In medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, slowly bring milk and vanilla bean to a boil.  Discard the bean.

In a separate bowl, beat the sugar and egg yolk until pale and thickened.  Beat in flour.  Add a little of the boiling milk to the egg mixture, and then pour all this back into the pot of milk.  Bring back to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Flavor with vanilla extract and let cool.

Filling:  Whip cream and sugar until stiff.  Place bowl in freezer for 20 minutes.

Toffee:  Place all ingredients in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil and continue to cook until it reaches 280 degrees.  Keep warm.

To assemble:  Place pastry cream into a piping bag with a thin, pointed nozzle.  Fill each choux with pastry cream.  Place a layer of choux in a circle around the edge of the pastry base and drizzle a thin coating of hot toffee on them.  Layer a second round of choux over the first, like build a wall, securing with more toffee.  Continue in this fashion until all the filled pastries are used.  Fill the center of the "wall" with whipped cream and garnish the top with candied fruit and chocolate curls.

This recipe yields 8 huge servings.

Comments:  A specialty of Ristorante Sabatini, Florence, Italy.

When cool, place the pastry in a medium bowl and add the eggs, one at a time, beating hard in between each addition.  Add the salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Place the pastry into a piping bag with a large nozzle and pipe small nut shapes onto a greased, floured baking sheet.  Bake for 12 minutes.  Turn off the heat and keep pastry in oven for 20 more minutes to dry out the centers.  Cool and store in an airtight container until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pastry Cream:  In medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, slowly bring milk and vanilla bean to a boil.  Discard the bean.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a separate bowl, beat the sugar and egg yolk until pale and thickened.  Beat in flour.  Add a little of the boiling milk to the egg mixture, and then pour all this back into the pot of milk.  Bring back to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Flavor with vanilla extract and let cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Filling:  Whip cream and sugar until stiff.  Place bowl in freezer for 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Toffee:  Place all ingredients in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil and continue to cook until it reaches 280 degrees.  Keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble:  Place pastry cream into a piping bag with a thin, pointed nozzle.  Fill each choux with pastry cream.  Place a layer of choux in a circle around the edge of the pastry base and drizzle a thin coating of hot toffee on them.  Layer a second round of choux over the first, like build a wall, securing with more toffee.  Continue in this fashion until all the filled pastries are used.  Fill the center of the &quot;wall&quot; with whipped cream and garnish the top with candied fruit and chocolate curls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
                        Pork bones
                        Water -- as needed
                        Parsley -- to taste
  1                     thyme sprig
                        Black peppercorns -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  cider - (1 fl oz)
  2          teaspoons  gelatin
     1/4        medium  onion
     1/2                Granny Smith apple
  8             ounces  pork breast - (trimmed weight)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg
                        === HOT WATER PASTE ===
     7/8           cup  water - (7 fl oz)
     5/8           cup  lard - (5 oz)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4               cups  all-purpose flour

Filling:  Cover pork bones with water.  Add parsley, sprig of thyme and black peppercorns and cook for 1 hour.  Strain.  Reduce to 1/4 cup.  Add cider and gelatin and allow to cool.

Make hot water paste:  Boil lard with water.  Heat flour and salt in a bowl in the oven.  Add lard and water to flour and mix until dough leaves sides of bowl.  Knead dough and when smooth, and while still hot, roll into a loaf shape.  Cut off 1/4 of the paste, (for the lid) and place in a bowl over hot water to keep warm.

Up-end a 2 pound jam jar and dust with flour.  Lightly dust dough with flour.  Place dough onto jar and mold it carefully around the jar until approximately 1/4-inch thick.  Cut a cross in the top.

Clip (use a bulledog clip) a piece of double folded paper around the paste and then up-end jar and pour hot water into the jar.  The paste will slide off easily.  Place the mold onto a greased baking sheet.  Do not remove the paper.

Finely chop the onion and apple.  Cut pork into 1/4-inch dice and season highly with salt and pepper.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Fill the pastry mold with layers of pork, onion and apple ending with a layer of pork, do not pack tightly.  Trim paper away 1/2-inch below rim of pastry to fit top.  Dampen edge of pastry with water and affix lid crimping edges together.  Gild with egg and bake in the oven for 1 1/2 hours.  Thirty minutes before the end of cooking, remove paper band and brush sides with egg.

Remove pie from oven and using a small funnel pour in the slightly warmed stock.  Place in the refrigerator.  Serve the pie cold with a little hot mustard on the side.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Inspired by a wonderful morning in an English pub in Dartmouth, England.

Recommended drink:  A pint of English wallop.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     uncooked lobsters - (1 1/2 lbs ea) -- in shell
  1              large  onion -- one-half diced,
                        and the other half finely sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
  4             ounces  dry white wine
     1/2      teaspoon  dried tarragon
  2             ounces  fresh butter
  2        tablespoons  sherry -- plus a dash
                        for the salad
                        Clarified butter -- as needed
  8                     fresh artichoke bottoms -- raw, halved
  2             ounces  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             ounces  wine vinegar
  1                     garlic clove -- smashed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  mushrooms -- finely sliced
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  1                     pimento -- thinly sliced

Remove lobster head and claws.  Using a large knife cut the tail shells between natural joints into 1-inch thick slices.  Remove flippers from the last slice.  Reserve one piece of lobster meat (finely shredded) to add to the artichoke mushroom salad.

Place some clarified butter into heated pan and add lobster medallions.  Saute for 1 minute and turn.  Add the 1/2 finely diced onion, salt and dry white wine.  Cover the pan, reduce heat and cook for 2 more minutes.  Add tarragon.  Strain the juices from the pan and discard the onion.  Place the lobster back into the pan.  Add 2 ounces fresh butter and 2 tablespoons of the sherry and stir until combined.  Cover and poach for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, for the salad, place a lot of clarified butter into another very hot pan.  Into the pan with the butter add the 1/2 finely sliced onion, garlic and the reserved piece of lobster.  Add freshly ground pepper to the pan with the lobster, garlic and onion.  Add pimento.

Into a bowl place the artichoke bottoms, the olive oil and the wine vinegar.  To the bowl add the mushrooms and the lemon juice.  Place the lobster medallions onto a heated serving dish with round part of the shell facing the outside.  Strain the sauce onto the lobster.  To the bowl, add the contents of the other pan with the mushrooms.  Add a dash of sherry to the bowl and toss.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Remove lobster head and claws.  Using a large knife cut the tail shells between natural joints into 1-inch thick slices.  Remove flippers from the last slice.  Reserve one piece of lobster meat (finely shredded) to add to the artichoke mushroom salad.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place some clarified butter into heated pan and add lobster medallions.  Saute for 1 minute and turn.  Add the 1/2 finely diced onion, salt and dry white wine.  Cover the pan, reduce heat and cook for 2 more minutes.  Add tarragon.  Strain the juices from the pan and discard the onion.  Place the lobster back into the pan.  Add 2 ounces fresh butter and 2 tablespoons of the sherry and stir until combined.  Cover and poach for 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, for the salad, place a lot of clarified butter into another very hot pan.  Into the pan with the butter add the 1/2 finely sliced onion, garlic and the reserved piece of lobster.  Add freshly ground pepper to the pan with the lobster, garlic and onion.  Add pimento.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Into a bowl place the artichoke bottoms, the olive oil and the wine vinegar.  To the bowl add the mushrooms and the lemon juice.  Place the lobster medallions onto a heated serving dish with round part of the shell facing the outside.  Strain the sauce onto the lobster.  To the bowl, add the contents of the other pan with the mushrooms.  Add a dash of sherry to the bowl and toss.

  1              large  pineapple
     1/4           cup  Bacardi rum
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar

Recipe By     :Graham Kerr
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  pig tails -- scrubbed, rinsed in
                        cold water, and cut into 1" pieces
  1              pound  salt beef -- cut 1/2" cubes
  6 1/2          pints  water
  1              pound  yams -- peeled, and
                        chopped into 1" cubes
  1              pound  coco -- peeled, chopped
  4               cups  ice water
  12                    okra -- rinsed
  8             ounces  Indian kale -- trimmed of heavy
                        stalks and finely sliced
  1           teaspoon  powdered thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             ounces  onion -- thinly sliced
  3                     scallions -- finely chopped
  1                can  callaloo -- see * Note
                        = (or 1 pound fresh spinach, shredded)

* Note:  A Jamaican green vegetable that tastes like a cross between broccoli and spinach.

In a pot large enough to hold at least 20 cups of water, add pig tails.  Cook on medium heat to render fat.  Pat salt beef dry with a towel.  When drippings have accumulated, add salt beef to pot and saute until brown.

Once browned, add 6 1/2 pints of water and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for 1 hour, occasionally skimming off the foam that rises to the surface and clings to the sides of the pot.

After 1 hour, add the yams and coco.  Add ice water to congeal fat and cause it to rise to the top.  Skim off fat.  Simmer for 1/2 hour more.

Add okra and kale.  Add thyme, salt, and pepper to taste.  Add chopped onion and scallion.  Cook another 1/2 hour.  Add callaloo or spinach and boil for 3 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 large servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggs
  1                cup  drained loganberries
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  1                     lemon rind -- grated
  1                     orange rind -- grated
  2        tablespoons  raisins
  1           teaspoon  vanilla sugar
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  dark rum
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- whipped
                        === VANILLA SUGAR ===
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  1                     vanilla bean pod

To make Vanilla Sugar:  Take one tablespoon of granulated sugar -- place in a tin, add 1 vanilla pod, seal the tin and wait at least 4 days.  Remove the pod whenever required and then return it to the sugar.  The sugar will be vanilla flavored for many dessert uses.

Separate eggs and beat whites stiffly.  Place loganberries through a sieve to puree.  Preheat broiler to medium.

Add the sugar to the stiff egg whites beating to form a meringue.  Add lemon and orange rind and raisins -- combine.  Add egg yolks and vanilla sugar -- fold in carefully.

Into an omelet pan on the heat place 1 tablespoon of butter.  Pour mixture into the pan and stir quickly using a palette knife.  Smooth surface.  Place kaiserschmarrn under the broiler and lightly cook surface until small bubbles appear and it has risen.

Place loganberry puree and rum in pan on medium heat and allow to boil 2 minutes.  Loosen edges of omelet and turn out onto a serving dish, break up with 2 forks and smooth with whipped cream and loganberry-rum puree.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             pounds  veal knuckles -- sawn into 8 pieces
                        of 1" rounds
  2        tablespoons  clarified butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             medium  onions -- finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, crushed
  2             medium  carrots -- finely chopped
  2              large  oranges -- zest and juice
                        from one, the other peeled, chopped fine
  3 1/4           cups  dry white wine
  1                     bouquet garni - (1 bay leaf, 4 stalks
                        parsley, 1 sprig thyme, 3" piece celery)
  1           teaspoon  tomato paste
                        Arrowroot -- if necessary
                        for thickening
  8             ounces  long-grain rice -- boiled

Put 2 tablespoons flour into a good plastic bag.  Add a little salt and pepper and shake to combine.  Wipe veal pieces with a damp cloth to remove any bone dust.  Place pieces of veal knuckle into bag and shake to cover each piece with flour.

Place clarified butter and oil into a large skillet (frying pan) and heat to 400 degrees.  Place floured veal pieces into the butter/oil.  They should foam and fry until golden.  Turn to color evenly.  Add the onions, garlic, carrots and orange zest.  Toss veal pieces and vegetables together and lower heat to 300 degrees and allow to "sweat" (the natural oils "bead" out of the vegetables like perspiration) for 3 minutes.

Now add 2 cups dry white wine and scrape pan base with wooden "spurtle" or spoon to lift up any sediment into the sauce.  Reduce heat to simmer, add the bouquet garni (tie up with string if fresh or in a muslin bag if dried herbs are used) and the tomato paste which you need to stir in well.  Simmer with a tight cover for 2 hours -- adding another 1 1/4 cups dry white wine.

About 30 minutes before serving add the orange juice.  When the meat is very tender remove the veal pieces, pass the sauce and vegetables through a strainer and reheat the veal knuckle pieces in the sauce.  Correct the seasoning and thicken, if necessary, with a little arrowroot paste.

Dish the rice with the orange pieces on a large serving plate.  Pile the veal pieces on top and coat with the sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Veal knuckle simmered in white wine with fresh vegetables and oranges.  A specialty of "Le Galant Verre" in Paris.

Put 2 tablespoons flour into a good plastic bag.  Add a little salt and pepper and shake to combine.  Wipe veal pieces with a damp cloth to remove any bone dust.  Place pieces of veal knuckle into bag and shake to cover each piece with flour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place clarified butter and oil into a large skillet (frying pan) and heat to 400 degrees.  Place floured veal pieces into the butter/oil.  They should foam and fry until golden.  Turn to color evenly.  Add the onions, garlic, carrots and orange zest.  Toss veal pieces and vegetables together and lower heat to 300 degrees and allow to &quot;sweat&quot; (the natural oils &quot;bead&quot; out of the vegetables like perspiration) for 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Now add 2 cups dry white wine and scrape pan base with wooden &quot;spurtle&quot; or spoon to lift up any sediment into the sauce.  Reduce heat to simmer, add the bouquet garni (tie up with string if fresh or in a muslin bag if dried herbs are used) and the tomato paste which you need to stir in well.  Simmer with a tight cover for 2 hours -- adding another 1 1/4 cups dry white wine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
About 30 minutes before serving add the orange juice.  When the meat is very tender remove the veal pieces, pass the sauce and vegetables through a strainer and reheat the veal knuckle pieces in the sauce.  Correct the seasoning and thicken, if necessary, with a little arrowroot paste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dish the rice with the orange pieces on a large serving plate.  Pile the veal pieces on top and coat with the sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  4                     canned serrano chili peppers
  12            ounces  tomatoes
  3             ounces  dry red wine
  8             ounces  dried red beans
  6               cups  cold water
  4             ounces  frozen peas
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  1                     egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  cilantro
  2             ounces  butter
                        All purpose flour -- for dusting
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     lime
  2             ounces  serrano chili juice from can

Place the red beans (rinsed) into a large pan and cover with 5 cups of cold water.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 1/2 hours.

Peel the potato, slice and cut into small pieces.  Squeeze the lime juice over the potato and season with salt.

Remove the silver skin from the tenderloin.  Very carefully remove and discard the seeds from the serrano chilis and finely chop them.

Blanch the tomatoes in boiling water for 2 minutes -- with a slotted spoon, remove and cool -- then peel off skin and discard the seeds.

Wash, dry and finely chop the cilantro.  Cube the meat into 1 inch cubes.  Chop the yolk of the egg into a crumb mixture.

Place a large frypan on high heat and add 1 tablespoon of clarified butter.  One by one drop the cubes of meat into it.  Season generously with salt and black pepper.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the flour over the top of the meat and stir.  Pour the 2 ounces of chili juice from the can onto the meat.  Add the finely chopped peppers.

Stir the simmering beans and add 1 cup of cold water.

Quickly pass the blade of the knife through two of the tomatoes and add to the meat.  Moisten with 1/4 cup of red wine.  Stir the meat once again.

Dry the lime marinated potato strips on a paper towel and add the meat mixture.  Add the peas.  Moisten again with 1 ounce of red wine and reduce the heat to low.

Mash the beans and beat in the butter and season with one teaspoon of chili powder.  Cut the remaining 6 ounces of tomatoes into small pieces and add these to the beans.

Pour the meat onto a serving platter and arrange the beans along the side.  Sprinkle the chopped egg yolk and cilantro over the top and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter
  1                cup  superfine sugar -- sifted
  2                     eggs
     1/4           cup  flour -- sifted
  1 1/4            cup  ground almonds
  2        tablespoons  Kirsch
  4              large  firm pears -- halved, peeled,
                        cored, bottom and top removed, stored in
                        lemon water to prevent discoloration
  5        tablespoons  apricot jam
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
     5/8           cup  cold water
                        === PASTRY ===
  2               cups  pastry flour -- sifted

Recipe By     :Graham Kerr
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MEHLSUPPE ===
  3             ounces  hot clarified butter
  1                cup  flour -- sifted
     1/4         pound  bacon rind -- cut tiny pieces
  2             ounces  celery -- finely diced
  2             ounces  carrot -- finely diced
  2             ounces  leek -- finely diced
  7 1/2           cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
                        Freshly-ground salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        === BUTTEROSTI ===
  1              pound  potatoes -- peeled
     1/4           cup  butter
                        Freshly-ground salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

"The Mehlsuppe" - Into a saucepan, pour the hot clarified butter and add the flour.  Beat the two together with a wooden spoon (or spurtle) and return the pan to high heat to cook the flour.  Continue to stir and the mixture will gradually deepen in color without actually burning the flour.

In another pan fry the bacon rind on high heat until the fat oozes out.  Add the mirepoix (finely chopped vegetables) and cook for 3 minutes.  Add this to the flour mixture and saute them all together.

Pour in 2 cups of chicken stock and whisk together briskly.  Add red wine to deepen the color and the flavor of the soup.  Bring it to a boil and add another 2 cups of chicken stock.  Boil and continue to add the stock as it thickens.  Reduce heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours stirring often.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  A grating of nutmeg also improves the flavor.

"The Butterosti" - Parboil the potatoes in salted water for 5 minutes.  Drain thoroughly and cool.  Grate them lengthwise onto a plate making the "strands" as long as possible.

Melt the butter in an omelet pan over high heat.  Add the potatoes and season generously with salt and pepper.  With a spoon, disturb the potatoes by chopping them so that they get evenly cooked.

When the underside is cooked, flip over like an omelet and keep tossing (the more the better!).  Constantly add more butter to prevent the potatoes from drying out.  This should now look like a beautifully browned omelet pancake.  Carefully slide it from the pan to a serving platter and serve at once.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A thick "flour" soup, taken as a hangover cure before it happens, and the famous Swiss potato dish.  A specialty of "The Bahnhof-Buffet", Zurich, Main Railway Station, Switzerland.

  1                     green bell pepper -- roughly chopped

     1/3           cup  chopped onion
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
     1/8           cup  olives -- halved
  1             medium  tomato -- thinly sliced
  1                     serrano chili -- finely chopped
  1                     potato -- cooked in boiling,
                        salted water, then diced
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
  4        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
  6                     eggs -- separated
     1/2      teaspoon  cold water
     1/4           cup  heavy whipping cream

Preheat broiler.

Cook bell peppers in olive oil on medium heat.  Season generously with salt and pepper.  Add onion and garlic.  Stir in olives, then tomatoes, stirring constantly.  Add serrano and potato.  Reduce heat to low and add herbs.

While vegetables are cooking, beat together egg whites, salt (to taste), and water, until mixture forms stiff, but not dry, peaks.  Separately combine cream and yolks, and thoroughly fold into egg whites.

Melt butter in a large, ovenproof pan over high heat.  Pour out half of butter and reserve.  Add 3/4 of egg mixture to pan, then add vegetables, distributed evenly.  When underside is cooked (takes less than a minute), pour on remaining egg mixture.  Place pan in broiler for 2 minutes.

To serve, invert onto a heated serving platter and brush with reserved melted butter.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Clarified butter -- as needed
  6              large  shallots -- peeled, each
                        cut into 3 pieces
  3             slices  fat bacon -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed, plus
  2                     garlic cloves -- for browning bread
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour - (1 1/2 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  Burgundy - (12 fl oz)
  1                cup  beef bouillon - (8 fl oz)
  1                     sugar lump
  1                     bouquet garni - (1 bay leaf, 4 sprigs
                        parsley, 1 sprig thyme, 3" piece celery) -- tied with string,
                        if using dried herbs, tie in muslin bag
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  3        tablespoons  butter - (1 3/4 oz)
  4             slices  white bread -- cut in rounds
  4                     eggs
                        Freshly chopped parsley -- for garnish

Pour 1 1/2 ounces of clarified butter into a pan and heat until smoking, about 400 degrees.  Add the shallots and stir briskly.  Add the bacon and brown lightly.  To this mixture, add the crushed garlic cloves.  Stir in the flour and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Add all of the Burgundy and whisk in off the heat.

Add the bouillon and stir thoroughly.  Now add the lump of sugar, for luck.  Pop in the bouquet garni, salt and pepper and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.  After 1 hour add the red wine vinegar.  At the end of 1 1/2 hours, add 1 ounce fresh butter to the sauce.

Pass the sauce through a sieve and scrape every last drop of it through.  Return to a clean pan and allow to cook gently.  In a skillet cook the garlic in a little clarified butter to release the natural juices.  Drop the rounds of bread into the garlic butter and add a little more clarified butter, if necessary.  Fry until crisp and golden brown.

Prick the wide end of the eggs with an egg pricker or needle and lower them into a pan of boiling water with a wire basket.  Count 10 seconds and remove the eggs and break them into a cup.  Take the water off the boil and add a pinch of salt and the eggs.  Raise the heat and gently poach the eggs.  Meanwhile remove the fried bread rounds from their pan and place in heated serving dishes or small bowls.

With a slotted spoon remove eggs from water and place each on a piece of garlic bread.  Pour the sauce around the egg, leaving some white showing.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Poached eggs on garlic bread with a red wine sauce poured around them.  Speciality of "La Taverne Du Poties" Paris.

Recommended drink:  A good dry red wine.

     3/4           cup  milk
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2         ounce  onion -- finely chopped
  1              pinch  mace

  2        tablespoons  butter -- for pancakes
                        Oil -- for frying

For Beer Batter:  Beat eggs until light and frothy.  Add salt.  Sprinkle in flour, then add beer and beat until lump free.  Set aside for 2 hours.

For pancake batter:  Combine flour, salt, and pepper in medium bowl.  Make a well in center and add 1 egg and 1 yolk and milk, beating gradually.  Add melted butter, beat well and set aside in cool place for 2 hours.

For Bechamel Sauce:  Melt 2 tablespoons butter in small pot on medium-low heat.  Remove from heat and stir in flour.  Return to heat and cook for 5 minutes; do not let brown.  Remove from heat again and gradually stir in milk.  Add bay leaf, onion, mace, and parsley stalks.  Increase heat and boil for 3 minutes to thicken sauce, stirring constantly.  Turn to a low simmer to keep warm until serving.

For Filling:  Add 3/8 cup bechamel sauce to half the beer batter.  Reserve remaining sauce and batter for another use.  Add camembert and cream together well.  Mix in mustard.

Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in omelet pan.  Add to pancake batter and beat well.  Return pan to heat and add a thin layer of batter to pan.  Loosen sides from pancake and cook until underside is lightly browned.  Flip and cook the other side.  Repeat, making 4 pancakes.  Chill pancakes.

Preheat oil in deep fryer to 375 degrees.  Divide cheese mixture between pancakes.  Fold pancakes over to enclose filling.  Place packages 1 at a time into hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  flour
     1/2         ounce  bakers yeast
  1         tablespoon  water -- to blend yeast
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus extra to
                        dampen pizza at end
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg
     1/4           cup  hot water
  3             pounds  egg-shaped tomatoes - (or two 28-oz cans),
                        and roughly chopped
  2          teaspoons  capers
     1/2                small tin anchovies in oil -- drained
  5             slices  mozzarella cheese
  10                    black olive halves
  1              sprig  oregano
  1              small  garlic clove -- finely sliced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- for garnish

Place the flour in a bowl.  Make a well in the center, add the yeast mixed to a paste with water and then the olive oil, salt, pepper and egg.  Mix together and then thin paste with hot water until it resembles chewing gum and comes away from the hands.  Knead for about 3 minutes until it no longer sticks to hands.  Shape dough into a ball, cover with a bowl and allow to stand 30 minutes.

Knead again and then pick up the dough and pull it out with the fingers, turning it around.  Oil a baking sheet and preheat oven to 500 degrees.

Place the dough onto the baking sheet, spreading it out to form 12-inch diameter round shape.  The edge should be a little thicker than the center.  Garnish with tomatoes, capers, anchovies, mozzarella cheese, black olive halves, oregano leaves, garlic and pepper.  Sprinkle with oil and place into the oven for 20 minutes.  Place on serving dish.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Place the flour in a bowl.  Make a well in the center, add the yeast mixed to a paste with water and then the olive oil, salt, pepper and egg.  Mix together and then thin paste with hot water until it resembles chewing gum and comes away from the hands.  Knead for about 3 minutes until it no longer sticks to hands.  Shape dough into a ball, cover with a bowl and allow to stand 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Knead again and then pick up the dough and pull it out with the fingers, turning it around.  Oil a baking sheet and preheat oven to 500 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the dough onto the baking sheet, spreading it out to form 12-inch diameter round shape.  The edge should be a little thicker than the center.  Garnish with tomatoes, capers, anchovies, mozzarella cheese, black olive halves, oregano leaves, garlic and pepper.  Sprinkle with oil and place into the oven for 20 minutes.  Place on serving dish.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4         pounds  veal leg
  2                     hard-boiled eggs -- halved
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             slices  cooked ham - (abt 1/8 lb ea)
  4          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  4                     thick white asparagus tips -- cooked
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/4           cup  clarified butter
  4                     eggs
  4             ounces  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley
     1/2           cup  butter

Place veal in freezer for about 3 hours, until partially frozen; this makes it easier to cut thin.  Slice into 12 thin strips about 4 inches long and 2 inches wide.  Trim off fat or skin and pound until very thin.  Lay slices out on board or table, 4 rows of 3 slices.  Trim 12 toothpicks to 2 inches.  If longer, it will impede browning.

Season hard-boiled egg halves with salt and pepper.  Place 1 half on the end of each of the slices in the first row.  Roll up and secure with a toothpick.

At ends of second row of veal, lay a slice of ham and spread 1 teaspoon of mustard over ham.  Roll up and secure as before.

At ends of last row of veal, lay 2 asparagus tips, cut to fit.  Season with salt and pepper.  Roll up and secure as before.

Season flour well with salt and pepper.  Add clarified butter to large saute pan over medium heat.  Roll the veal rolls in the flour.

In separate bowl, beat eggs.  Add cheese to eggs.  Coat veal rolls with egg mixture.  Place in saute pan and cook for about 2 minutes on all sides (4 sides), careful not to burn.  Remove to a serving platter and remove toothpicks.  Keep warm.

Pour off excess fat in pan.  Add Worcestershire sauce, any remaining egg and cheese mixture, parsley, and butter.  Stir and serve atop each rollito.  Three rollitos, one of each kind, per serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Trim off fat or skin and pound until very thin.  Lay slices out on board or table, 4 rows of 3 slices.  Trim 12 toothpicks to 2 inches.  If longer, it will impede browning.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season hard-boiled egg halves with salt and pepper.  Place 1 half on the end of each of the slices in the first row.  Roll up and secure with a toothpick.
</DirT>
<DirT>
At ends of second row of veal, lay a slice of ham and spread 1 teaspoon of mustard over ham.  Roll up and secure as before.
</DirT>
<DirT>
At ends of last row of veal, lay 2 asparagus tips, cut to fit.  Season with salt and pepper.  Roll up and secure as before.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season flour well with salt and pepper.  Add clarified butter to large saute pan over medium heat.  Roll the veal rolls in the flour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In separate bowl, beat eggs.  Add cheese to eggs.  Coat veal rolls with egg mixture.  Place in saute pan and cook for about 2 minutes on all sides (4 sides), careful not to burn.  Remove to a serving platter and remove toothpicks.  Keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour off excess fat in pan.  Add Worcestershire sauce, any remaining egg and cheese mixture, parsley, and butter.  Stir and serve atop each rollito.  Three rollitos, one of each kind, per serving.
</DirT>

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        === FISH STOCK ===
  1                     snapper head
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1                     bouquet garni - (2 sprigs thyme, 1 bay
                        leaf, 3" piece celery, 6 stalks parsley)
  2 1/2           cups  water
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  8                     peppercorns
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === VEAL JELLY ===
  1                     veal knuckle
  1                     onion -- roughly sliced
  1                     carrot -- chopped
  1                     bouquet garni - (2 sprigs thyme, 1 bay
                        leaf, 3" piece celery, 6 stalks parsley)
                        Salt -- to taste

For Fish Stock:  Place all ingredients in a saucepan.  Bring to a gentle boil, continually skimming the surface.  Simmer for 25 minutes.  Strain.

For Veal Jelly:  Place all ingredients in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil, continually skimming the surface.  Reduce to a simmer for 6 hours, until reduced to 1/2 cup.  Strain and store in refrigerator.  It will gel as it cools.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Remove the black skin from one side of the sole; make an incision across the tail and pull skin off.  Dredge skinned side of sole in flour, then brush with egg, and coat with bread crumbs.  Place in an ovenproof dish, crumbed-side up.  Add 1/8 cup fish stock and the white wine just to cover bottom of pan; do not let it saturate the bread crumbed side.  Season with salt and white pepper.  Drizzle fish with 2 tablespoons of the clarified butter and bake for 15 minutes.

Heat the remaining tablespoon clarified butter in saute pan.  Add shallots and saute.  Add veal jelly.  When melted, add the vermouth and remaining fish stock.  Season with salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil and reduce to a syrup consistency.

Once reduced, add cream and remove from heat.  Whisk in butter.  Add chives and lemon juice.  Remove fish from oven and broil for 2 minutes to brown.

To serve, pour sauce on heated serving tray and lay fish on top.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  4                     cups         flour -- sifted
  1 1/2                 cups         cold unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  2                     egg yolks
  1                     tablespoon   superfine sugar
     1/2                teaspoon     salt
  8                     tablespoons  ice water
     1/4                cup          whipped heavy cream
     1/4                cup          whole hulled strawberries
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to garnish

Mincemeat:  Make at least one month ahead.  Mix together first 15 ingredients.  Pack in sterile canning jars, pour in brandy, and seal according to jar manufacturer's instructions.

Pastry:  Place flour in medium bowl.  Make well in center of flour and add butter, 1 egg yolk, sugar, salt and 2 tablespoons of the water to the well.  With fingertips, mix only these "well" ingredients together, then begin to work in the surrounding flour, adding ice water as needed.  Once combined, knead several times and place pastry on a plate.  Chill in the refrigerator for an hour or so.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Cut pastry in half.  Roll 1 half to fit a 10-inch pie pan.  Prick all over with a fork.  Cut parchment paper to fit inside pastry shell.  Cover parchment evenly with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake for 15 minutes.  Remove paper and weights.  Allow pastry to cool.

Meanwhile, roll out the other pastry half so it is big enough to cover the pie.  Fill the cooled pastry crust with mincemeat.  Cover with unbaked pastry, crimp edges, glaze with the remaining egg yolk, and poke hole in center.  Bake for 30 minutes until golden brown.

Remove pie from oven and cool.  Before serving, cover with whipped cream and then strawberries.  Sprinkle strawberries with black pepper to enhance their sweetness.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PANCAKE BATTER ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1              whole  egg -- plus
  1                     egg yolk
  1              pinch  salt
  1 1/4           cups  milk
                        === CREPES ===
     1/4           cup  butter
     3/8           cup  sugar
  3              dozen  strawberries -- hulled
     1/4           cup  strawberry syrup - (you can use syrup
                        from canned or frozen strawberries)
  2        tablespoons  Pernod
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
  2        tablespoons  cognac
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream

Combine the flour, egg and egg yolk.  Add salt and combine with the milk until the mixture is smooth.  Allow to stand 4 hours, covered and refrigerated.

Place 1 tablespoon of butter in a hot pan and when melted and slightly brown, add to the pancake batter.  Stir in the butter and then place a ladle full of the pancake batter into the hot pan moving it around the pan until the mixture sets.  Place back onto the heat and wait until small bubbles appear on the surface, then flip the crepe over.  Cook for a few seconds on the other side and remove from the pan with a spatula.

Add sugar to a separate frypan and then add the strawberries and the remaining butter.  Stir together until the sugar and butter form a fudge and add the strawberry syrup and combine.  Place this mixture in the center of each crepe and roll up.

Place the filled crepes back into the pan.  Add the Pernod and set alight.  Then add the Grand Marnier and the cognac.  Place the crepes onto a heated serving dish, stir the cream into the sauce and then spoon over the crepes to coat.

This recipe yields 4 crepes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             ounces  lobster flesh
                        = (from 1 1/2 lbs live weight lobster)
  9             ounces  pike - (flesh weight only)
                        Clarified butter -- as needed
  1             medium  onion - (2 oz) -- finely sliced
  1                     garlic clove -- smashed
  1              ounce  brandy
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  mushrooms -- blanched
  1                cup  whipping cream -- plus
  1         tablespoon  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     egg whites
  2              large  tomatoes -- sliced into thick
                        rings and halved
  2                     egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  arrowroot
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

Place the live lobster in a sink of blood heat water (it is at this temperature that scientists say that all edible shellfish die with the least discomfort).  Remove from water and crack open and take out flesh (usually 5 ounces from a 1 1/2 pound lobster).  Reserve the shell.

Heat a serving platter in the warming oven -- preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Put both pike and lobster flesh through a mincer with a very fine screen.  Keep the flesh in a bowl set in another bowl of ice.

Into a frying pan, place some clarified butter and add the onion and garlic clove -- pop in the lobster shells and simmer gently.  Add 1 ounce of brandy and set it alight.  Pour in the 1 cup of dry white wine, cover and continue cooking over a low heat.

Put the blanched mushrooms through the mincer and then add to the chilled fish flesh.  Carefully blend in the 1 cup of whipping cream and season generously with freshly ground salt and pepper.  Beat the 2 egg whites in a bowl and fold into the fish.  Pour this mixture into 2 separate moulds and set them in a "bainmarie" (bath of hot water) and cover the molds with foil.  Place in the preheated oven for 30 minutes -- remove the foil after this period and cook uncovered for another 30 minutes.

Strain the stock from the lobster shells, approximately 3/4 cup should be left, pour into a heated pan -- increase the temperature and add the sliced tomatoes -- simmer.

Remove the baked fish molds from the oven and unmold onto the heated serving platter.

Sieve the tomato stock mixture -- pushing through as much tomato flesh as possible.  Add the 2 egg yolks to the sieved stock (off the heat).  Blend the arrowroot with the extra tablespoon of whipping cream and then add the mixture to the stock mixture for thickening.  Return to the heat and allow the sauce to thicken -- it shouldnít boil.  Pour the sauce over the fish molds -- dust with the chopped parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A mold of sea and river food set with cream and eggs.  A specialty of "Le Galant Verre", Paris, France.

                              The Veal Thing

Recipe By     :Graham Kerr
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  veal tenderloin -- trimmed, halved,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
  2               cups  veal stock
  3        tablespoons  salted butter
  3        tablespoons  flour -- sifted, plus more
                        for dusting
  8             ounces  white wine
  4             ounces  mushrooms -- halved or quartered,
                        depending on size
     1/8           cup  clarified butter
  1            package  puff pastry - (13 oz) -- defrosted in
                        refrigerator
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten
     1/4           cup  brandy
  4             ounces  pimento
     1/4           cup  whipped cream
  3             ounces  tiny shrimp
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley
  2                     black truffles -- washed, dried,
                        and finely chopped

Heat roasting pan over medium heat.  When hot, add veal and cover with stock.  Poach, stirring and skimming occasionally.

Meanwhile, melt salted butter in a saucepan over low heat.  Stir in 3 tablespoons flour.  Increase heat and cook roux for 3 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and gradually add wine and 1 cup of the veal liquid.  Blend well and pour over veal.

In a small pan, cook mushrooms in clarified butter over low heat.  Add to veal.  Heat veal until boiling, then reduce heat to medium and cook for 18 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Roll out puff pastry on lightly floured board to 1/8-inch thickness.  Grease the underside of an upturned, medium ovenproof bowl.  Drape dough over bowl and press down to smooth creases.  Trim off excess dough and make criss-cross cuts lightly over pastry surface, careful not to cut through.  Brush with egg yolk.  Place on baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.

Add brandy and pimento to cooked veal.  Carefully blend in cream, then the shrimp.  Add parsley and truffles just before serving.

To serve, pour onto platter and cover with pastry dome.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Graham Kerr
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  clarified butter
  3             ounces  lean pork -- finely chopped
  2             ounces  veal -- finely chopped
  2             ounces  chicken or turkey breast -- finely chopped
  2             ounces  ham -- finely chopped
  1              ounce  mortadella sausage -- finely chopped
  2             ounces  veal brains -- soaked in
                        salt water for 1 hour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Nutmeg -- to taste
  7                     eggs
  3             ounces  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- plus extra
                        for topping
  1              pound  all-purpose flour -- sifted
  3 3/4           cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  cream

Filling:  Heat clarified butter in a pan and brown pork, veal, and poultry gently.  Add the ham, mortadella, brains and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Place mixture through a fine mincer -- combine with 2 eggs and grated cheese.  It should be a very fine and smooth mixture.

Pasta:  Place sifted flour into a bowl and season with salt and pepper.  Make a well in the center and add 5 eggs -- work dough with the hands for 5 minutes until spongy.  Allow dough to stand 30 minutes.

Roll out thinly.  (The cooking time depends upon how thinly you are able to roll the pasta.)  Cut small rounds of pasta 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Place teaspoonful of filling in the center.  Fold in half to form a half-circle -- bring the two points of the half-circle together curling the tortellini around the finger to form a little 'ring' pinching edges together.  You should have about 3 dozen tortellini.  Arrange tortellini in lightly floured dish, cover with a cloth and leave until the next day, refrigerated.

Bring chicken stock to a boil.  Toss tortellini in the boiling stock and allow to cook 8 minutes.  After 8 minutes, just test one of them and continue cooking if it does not melt in your mouth.

Place the cream into the frying pan -- bring to the boil and season with salt and pepper.  With a slotted spoon place tortellini into the cream and coat.  Place tortellini onto a heated serving dish and grate Parmesan cheese over them.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  The world famous specialty of Bologna -- Made beautifully at Pappagallo's, Bologna, Italy.

                        === PASTRY ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
  5        tablespoons  butter
  5        tablespoons  lard
  4        tablespoons  iced water

                        === PIE ===
  4             ounces  venison or elk
  4             ounces  beef rump
  4             ounces  pork loin
  4             ounces  veal
  4             ounces  goose meat
  4             ounces  rabbit
  1             medium  onion -- sliced paper thin
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  allspice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1              pound  potatoes -- peeled

In a bowl sift flour with salt.  Make a well in the center and add the butter and lard cut into small cubes.  Mix lightly with the finger-tips along with the iced water.  Form into a smooth dough.  Divide into 2 discs, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Place all the meats through a fine mincer.  Place the onion into a dry frying pan over low heat and add the meat.  Allow to fry gently in its own fat.  When juices start to form in the bottom of the pan, season with the cinnamon, allspice, salt and pepper.  Moisten the meat with water and cook very gently, covered, for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Cook potatoes in water.  Drain and mash.  Allow to cool.  Add the meat mixture to the cold mashed potatoes and combine thoroughly.  Season with more salt, to taste, if necessary.

Roll out 1 disc of dough and place in a 10-inch pie plate.  Brush surface with egg white.  Prick the base and fill with the meat mixture, packing down lightly and smoothing the surface.  Roll out the other disc of dough.  Paint the rim with egg white and place the pastry lid on top.  Secure the edges by crimping them together.  Paint the pie with egg yolk and bake for 40 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

In a bowl sift flour with salt.  Make a well in the center and add the butter and lard cut into small cubes.  Mix lightly with the finger-tips along with the iced water.  Form into a smooth dough.  Divide into 2 discs, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.

<DirT>
Place all the meats through a fine mincer.  Place the onion into a dry frying pan over low heat and add the meat.  Allow to fry gently in its own fat.  When juices start to form in the bottom of the pan, season with the cinnamon, allspice, salt and pepper.  Moisten the meat with water and cook very gently, covered, for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Cook potatoes in water.  Drain and mash.  Allow to cool.  Add the meat mixture to the cold mashed potatoes and combine thoroughly.  Season with more salt, to taste, if necessary.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out 1 disc of dough and place in a 10-inch pie plate.  Brush surface with egg white.  Prick the base and fill with the meat mixture, packing down lightly and smoothing the surface.  Roll out the other disc of dough.  Paint the rim with egg white and place the pastry lid on top.  Secure the edges by crimping them together.  Paint the pie with egg yolk and bake for 40 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  fine sugar
  1 1/2           cups  flour -- sifted
                        Rind of 1/2 lemon
  2 1/2           cups  milk
                        Vanilla bean
  8                     egg yolks
  10                    lychees
  10                    raspberries
     1/2           cup  cream sherry
  2        tablespoons  brandy
  2        tablespoons  port
  1 1/2    tablespoons  gelatin - (to make raspberry jelly)
                        Raspberry juice - (a little bit cold
                        and 2 1/2 cups warm for raspberry jelly)
  2        tablespoons  strawberry jam
  2        tablespoons  blanched almonds
  1 1/4           cups  whipped cream
  1                cup  crystallized fruits - (green and red
                        cherries, angelicas, and apricots)
  1         tablespoon  toasted almonds

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Make sponge cake.  Beat eggs and add sugar gradually, beating until combined.  Place bowl over hot water and whisk eggs with 1 cup sugar until thick, light, and larger in volume.  Remove bowl from heat and continue to whisk until cool.  Fold in sifted flour and lemon rind.  Place mixture into an 8-inch cake tin, which has been buttered, sugared and floured, and bake for 30 minutes.  Turn onto a rack to cool.

To make custard, heat milk with the vanilla bean until boiling.  Beat yolks with remaining 1/2 cup sugar until thoroughly combined.  Pour in hot milk and whisk together.  Place custard into saucepan on low heat and stir until thickened.  Remove from heat, take out vanilla bean, and allow custard to cool.

Assemble trifle.  Fill centers of lychees with raspberries.  Mix together sherry, brandy and port.  Make raspberry jelly by dissolving the gelatin in a little cold raspberry juice and then combining with warm raspberry juice.  Allow to cool.

Cut sponge cake in half and then cut one half into eighths.  Place 5 slices into the bottom of a crystal bowl and separate each slice with 2 raspberry filled lychees.  Pour half of the alcohol mixture over the cake and then pour over the raspberry jelly.  Place the remaining raspberry filled lichees in the center.  Cut the 3 remaining pieces of cake into thin slices and lay on top -- add the rest of the alcohol.  Place into the refrigerator to set.

When the jelly has set, smear with the strawberry jam and scatter the blanched almonds over the top.  Cover with the cooled custard and place in the refrigerator to set for 1 hour.  Decorate trifle with whipped cream (using a rose-shaped piping nozzle), crystallized fruits and toasted almonds.  Keep in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  1 1/4         pounds  tomatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  cumin
  2          teaspoons  paprika
  1              sprig  thyme
  1                     bay leaf
  1 1/4         pounds  tripe -- cut 2" squares
  1                     pickled pigs foot -- if not available

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HOT WATER PASTE ===
  1                cup  water
     3/4           cup  lard
  4               cups  flour -- sifted
  1           teaspoon  salt - (heaping)
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2         pounds  veal fillet -- cut 1" cubes
  1              pound  leg ham - (1 slice) -- cut 1" cubes
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  mixed herbs
  1         tablespoon  gelatin
  2        tablespoons  sherry
  5                     hard-boiled eggs -- ends trimmed off

To make hot water paste, place water on heat, add lard, and bring to a boil.  Mix the sifted flour with salt.  Add water and lard to flour and stir until paste comes away from the edges of the bowl.  Work quickly while paste is still hot.  Place on board and knead until smooth.

Cover meat with water and add parsley and mixed herbs.  Cook 30 minutes.  Remove meat from stock and reduce stock to 2 cups.  Add gelatin and sherry to stock and allow to cool.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Roll out pastry to approximately 3/16-inch thick.  Cut into shapes to fit sides, base and ends of a rectangular tin.  Allow 1/2-inch shrinkage in length and width.  Line sides of tin first and then drop in piece cut to fit base and press edges together.  Make sure that sides are long enough to just come over rim of tin.

Fill pastry case by placing a neat layer of meat in the bottom.  Place whole eggs down center of mold and cover with the rest of the meat.  Cover with pastry cut to fit top and crimp together using the back of a spoon.  Brush with egg wash and make three steam holes in the pie.  Cook for 1 hour and 20 minutes.

Remove pie and while still hot place a funnel into the holes and fill with the stock -- making sure stock is evenly distributed.  Allow stock to settle and top up several times.  Refrigerate.  Accompany with green salad and decorate with parsley.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                        specialty food shops)

The Meringue Discs:  Separate the whites from the yolks of egg, sift the flour, sift the chocolate powder.  Heat the oven to 225 degrees.  Grease and dust a cookie sheet with flour.  Place a plain nozzle in a piping bag.

Make the meringues by whisking in a large bowl the whites of eggs until very stiff.  Beat in the salt and water, and gradually start beating in the sugar little by little (if this is done too quickly the whites will lose their bulk and turn almost liquid).  Fold in the last tablespoon of sugar.  The mixture should now have a good gloss and be very "peaky".

Now place the glistening white meringue mixture into the forcing bag and pipe it into two 9-inch circles (being the same diameter as the cake) on the cookie sheet and dust with the chocolate powder.  The remaining mixture can then be piped into small animal shapes as decoration.

Place the meringue mixture immediately into the preheated oven (225 degrees) on the middle shelf and bake for 2 1/2 hours.  When ready the discs and animals should lift easily from the baking sheet and have a hollow sound when gently tapped -- these can be cooled on a wire rack until required.  They can also be stored in an airtight tin for several days, should you want to prepare this dessert ahead of time.

Filling:  Whip the cream until stiff and divide the cream into 2 bowls.  The almonds can be placed on a cookie sheet and broiled until golden brown and cooled.  The sponge cake can now be split in 2 and the base lightly soaked with rum.

Assembly:  Place the base of the cake on a plate.  Spread a little chestnut puree over this and then a good dollop of fresh cream from one bowl.  Pop the second layer of sponge cake on top and sprinkle with rum.

To the cream in the first bowl, add more of the chestnut puree and beat in very thoroughly.  Blend together with rum.  Scoop this on top of the cake.  Take one layer of the baked cooled meringue and place this on top.

From the second bowl, take the puree, whipped cream and spread a thick layer of this gently on top of the meringue disc.  Lower the second round of meringue on top.  To the remainder of cream, add the last of the chestnut puree and spread this over the sides of the vacherin and a thin layer over the top, using a palette knife.  Gently press the flaked almonds over the sides.  Decorate the top with meringue animals and dust with the chocolate powder.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Layers of sponge cake and meringue with chestnut and cream filling.  A specialty of Le Petit Brouant, Nice, France.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  puff pastry
  2              dozen  mussels
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                     snapper head
  1 1/4           cups  water

                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  flour -- sifted
  1 1/4           cups  button mushrooms
                        Nutmeg -- to taste
                        Juice 1/4 lemon
  6                     jumbo shrimp -- cooked, and
                        sliced into scallops
  1                     egg yolk
     1/4           cup  cream

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Make vol au vent by cutting a circle 8 inches in diameter in 1-inch thick pastry.  Make another incision 1 1/2 inches from edge of pastry.  Place round of pastry on a baking sheet brushed with cold water and bake 30 minutes.  Remove lid and scoop out the inside to form a pastry case.  Set aside.

Place the mussels in a pan on a high heat with 1/4 cup of the dry white wine, cover, shake pan and allow to cook for 2 minutes.  Allow to cool and then remove mussels from shells.

Prepare fish stock by simmering snapper head with water, onion and Bouquet garni for 30 minutes and then strain.

Place some clarified butter into a pan on the heat and add the shallot.  Fry gently and then place the fish fillets on top and the scallops, and moisten with 1/2 cup of the fish stock and 1/4 cup of the dry white wine.  Season with salt and pepper and poach for 5 minutes.

Sauce:  Place the 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan and when it has melted add the sifted flour.  Stir gently to cook the roux but do not allow to color.  Remove from the heat and add the warmed fish stock a little at a time, beating well after each addition.  Place sauce back on heat and season with salt and pepper and allow to simmer 10 minutes, stirring from time to time.

In a separate pan place a little clarified butter and when hot add the mushrooms.  Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg and add a squeeze of lemon juice.  Allow to fry gently for 1 minute.

Remove the fish fillets to a dish and place the scallops, shrimp, mussels and mushrooms together in a bowl.  Mix the yolk with the cream and then stir into the sauce -- add 1 tablespoon butter and then fold in the seafood being very careful not to break the fish.  Check the seasoning.

Place the seafood mixture into the pastry case and heat in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A great French classic.
