             Abby "Nanna" Rowell's New England Boiled Dinner

Recipe By     :Submitted by Rowell's Inn Bed & Breakfast, Andover, VT
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              piece  corned beef - (abt 5 lbs)
                        Carrots
                        Potatoes
                        Beets
                        Cabbage
                        Turnip
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cover corned beef with boiling water and allow 4 to 5 hours to cook.

If it is desired to have meat free from the flavor of the vegetables, then each vegetable may be cooked in separate pots, taking water from the pot in which the corned beef is cooking, to flavor them.  Carrots and potatoes may be cooked with the meat without leaving a flavor.  But the beets, cabbage and turnips will leave a flavor unless cooked separately.  Some prefer, though, to cook all five vegetables in one large kettle with the corned beef.

The cabbage requires about 2 hours for cooking, and beets about 3 hours, unless they are new beets, which, of course, are very tender.  Cabbage and beets should be served in separate dishes.  The other vegetables should be served on a platter with the meat sliced.

Season vegetables to taste while cooking.

This recipe goes with "Suet Pudding and Sauce" (see recipe).

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  boneless beef, preferably Sirloin Tip
                        Butter -- as needed
     1/4           cup  brandy
     1/2         pound  small onions -- peeled
     1/2         pound  small fresh mushrooms
  2 1/2    tablespoons  potato starch (corn starch will work)
  2          teaspoons  meat extract paste - (to 2 1/2 tspns)
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1 1/2           cups  burgundy wine
     3/4           cup  dry sherry
     3/4           cup  ruby port
  1             bottle  Borvil condensed beef broth - (4.2 oz) -- mixed with
  1                can  regular beef broth -- (Use the regular
                        broth to rinse condensed broth bottle.
                        Don't add water.)
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Cube beef, 1 1/2-inch proximately.  In 2 tablespoons of butter, brown about a quarter of the beef at a time in the Dutch Oven (cast-iron works best).  Remove browned meat, and add butter until all the meat has been browned.  Return all the beef to the Dutch Oven.

In small saucepan or large ladle, heat 1/2 of brandy until vapor rises.  Ignite and pour over beef.  As flame dies, remove beef to another pan and set aside.

Add 2 tablespoons butter to Dutch Oven.  Heat slightly.  Add onions.  Cook on low heat (covered) until onions brown slightly, stirring occasionally.  Then add mushrooms.  Cook, stirring for 3 minutes.

With slotted spoon, remove mushrooms and onions.  Remove Dutch Oven from heat.  Using wooden spoon, stir in potato starch, meat extract, and tomato paste after pre-mixing ingredients.  Stir in burgundy wine, sherry, port, and condensed beef broth.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Bring wine mixture in Dutch Oven just to boiling, stirring with whisk.  Remove from heat.  Add beef, pepper, bay leaf, onions, mushrooms, and remaining brandy.  Mix well.  Place a large sheet of waxed paper over top of Dutch Oven.  Place a lid on top of paper.  Bake covered.  Stir occasionally.  Cook 1 1/2 hours or until beef is tender.  If broth is thin, add more tomato paste and potato/corn starch to thicken.

When making ahead, use small amount of mushrooms and sliced onion.  Then add sauteed fresh mushrooms and small onions when reheating.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Add wine and allow stew to heat 5 minutes.  Add beef broth to barely cover.  (Sometimes I stop here and let the beef marinate in the wine and broth overnight, then finish, per the recipe, the next day.  This will increase the wine flavor, but reduce the thickness.  To thicken, add cornstarch after baking the vegetables.)

Simmer, cover, and place in 300 degree oven and cook 1 to 1 1/2 hours until beef is close to tender.  Add water to bring to original level.  Add vegetables, cover, and return to oven to cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour until vegetables are tender.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  6                     lamb shanks
  2               cups  chopped carrots
  2               cups  chopped celery

Cover and bake at 325 degrees for 5 to 6 hours, until meat pulls from bone.  Remove shanks and set aside.  Strain sauce; discard vegetables.  Put liquid in heavy saucepan with herbs.  Reduce over medium heat until thick and flavored.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Variation:  Substitute roast beef for corned beef.

Comments:  A crisp, fried patty of corned beef hash topped with a poached egg is a breakfast favorite.  It's a great way to use leftover corned beef, and even if you don't cook corned beef for a meal, you can buy it at your grocery store for this recipe.

The trick to making good hash is to have all the ingredients finely ground and chopped so that the hash mix is almost a mush.  If the pieces of meat and/or potato are too large, the hash will not stay together in a patty.  If you prefer, ask your butcher to grind the meat for you.  ...Martha Murphy

Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  tenderized round steak -- sliced thin,
                        and fat trimmed but saved
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour - (to 3/4 cup)
     3/4           cup  milk - (to 1 cup)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Your favorite biscuit recipe

Note:  If steak is lean without fat, ask your butcher for a few beef fat scraps to use to render your skillet and season your meat

Put flour and salt and pepper to taste in a brown paper bag.  Add sliced beef and shake to well coat the pieces evenly in flour.

In a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, render the trimmed fat scraps.  Discard and add the sliced beef.  Cook until well browned, stirring frequently.  Gradually stir in a little milk, stirring frequently, to make a smooth, browned gravy.  Continue to add milk as the gravy thickens as it simmers until you have the beef in a generous, rich gravy.

Add the additional salt and pepper to taste.  Serve over split freshly baked buttermilk biscuits.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  A hearty inn breakfast in the snowy Cascades is my father's version of "biscuits and gravy"!  Guests are ready to hit the ski and snowshoe trails after enjoying this warming meal with fresh fruits and Lodge granola.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     round steak - (abt 2 lbs)
                        flour -- for dredging
                        Garlic salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  3              large  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        thickly sliced

Ask butcher to put steak through cuber.  At home, trim the fat off meat and cut into serving-size portions.  (Pieces should be about the size of a hamburger patty.)

Mix flour, garlic salt (or other seasoned salt of your choice), and pepper on a plate.  Dredge steak pieces in flour mixture.

Heat vegetable oil in Dutch oven.  Brown steak pieces in hot oil on both sides, a few at a time.  Set meat aside as it is browned.  When all meat is browned, add sliced onion to pan, then arrange steak on top of onions.  Carefully pour enough warm water into pan to barely cover meat.  Cover pan tightly and simmer on stovetop or bake in 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.

Add sliced potatoes to pan and bake 30 minutes more.  Check liquid level at intervals and add more water if needed.  When done, potatoes will be cooked through, meat will be fork tender, and you will have a delicious onion gravy to spoon over all.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  When Mom worked late, Dad cooked up this special recipe for the family.  Everything cooks in one pan, and the meat is tender enough to cut with a fork.  Just add a green salad, and maybe chunks of crusty bread to sop up the gravy.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              whole  lamb shanks - (13 to 14 oz ea)
  3              large  garlic cloves -- cut thin slivers
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  2             medium  onions -- sliced
     3/4           cup  virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
  1              pinch  cinnamon
  1              pound  plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and coarsely chopped
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  orzo
     1/2           cup  Kefalotori or Parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  With a paring knife, remove as much of the fat and sinew (tendon) from lamb shanks as possible.  Pierce lamb shanks and insert garlic slivers into meat (3 or 4 to each shank).  Salt and pepper generously.

Place shanks in roasting pan just large enough to hold shanks.  Cover with onion slices and drizzle with oil.  Roast 25 minutes.  Sprinkle meat with oregano and cinnamon.  Spoon tomato onto each shank; pour in wine.  Return to oven and roast 45 minutes more.

Remove lamb from pan and set aside.  Add chicken stock to pan and stir in orzo.  Place lamb on top and return to oven.  Cook until orzo is tender and has absorbed the liquid.  Remove pan from oven and cover tightly with foil.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Serve hot with grated cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  B & B Liqueur
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh oregano
                        (or 2 tbspns dried oregano)
  2        tablespoons  crumbled rosemary
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1                     leg of lamb (5 to 6 lbs) -- boned, butterflied,
                        and trimmed of fat, or six lamb chops

Combine marinade ingredients in a large glass baking dish.  Add lamb and turn to coast thoroughly with marinade.  Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 to 10 hours, turning the meat from time to time.

Prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire.  Grill the lamb turning and basting as needed, to desired doneness.  Let the meat rest 10 minutes before slicing.  If you will be cooking indoors, marinate a bone-in leg of lamb.  Roast for 15 minutes in a 400 degree oven; reduce the temperature to 350 and continue roasting to desired doneness, about 12 to 15 minutes per pound.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  The subtle herbal flavors in B & B Liqueur are reinforced by the herbs in this unique marinade.  It is important to keep basting the meat as it cooks; it will turn a beautiful mahogany color and smell absolutely delicious!

           Herb Spiced Butterflied Leg Of Lamb (BBQ Or Roasted)

Recipe By     :Submitted by Victorian Village Townhouses, Ludlow, VT
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     leg of lamb - (6 to 8 lbs) -- butterflied
  4                     garlic cloves -- diced
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  marjoram
  1           teaspoon  thyme
  1           teaspoon  rosemary
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  dry white wine -- if roasting

Place lamb skin-side down in a roasting pan or glass baking dish.  Mix garlic with oil, salt and pepper to taste and spread on top of lamb.  Work mixture into all folds and cover lamb surface completely.  Grind three herbs together (make sure rosemary is crushed) and spread over top of lamb.  Let marinate for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  When lifting from dish, let as much oil drain from meat as possible.

To BBQ:  Place meat skin-side down on BBQ, cover and cook over medium-high heat for 45 minutes.  Do not turn meat.  Move around on grill if necessary to keep from flaming up.  Cut into meat and check for doneness.  Let stand for 5 minutes before carving.

To roast in oven:  place lamb on rack in pan; put wine and 1/2 cup water under rack and cook at 325 degrees for 1 1/2 hours (oven-roasted potatoes are great added for the last 40 minutes).

Serve with mint jelly.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This recipe came from our family here in Vermont.  We are fortunate here in Ludlow to be able to shop at a market that has outstanding meats including venison, rabbit, pheasant, etc..  We enjoy a variety of wild game recipes but the BBQ Butterflied Lamb remains our favorite for holidays and special occasions.

Comments:  We moved to the city when I was a young child.  Just down the street was a tavern that served lunch to the local workers.  One of Ida's specialties was "Sloppy Joe".  I used to see her occasionally after lunch and talk with her.  One day she offered to give me her recipe.  I was thrilled since the recipe was very easy.  I made it the first time for my family and have been making it ever since.  I often think of this special lady who shared her popular recipe with me.  I still have the yellowed piece of paper I originally wrote it on hidden away in a favorite cookbook.

Comments:  We moved to the city when I was a young child.  Just down the street was a tavern that served lunch to the local workers.  One of Ida&apos;s specialties was &quot;Sloppy Joe&quot;.  I used to see her occasionally after lunch and talk with her.  One day she offered to give me her recipe.  I was thrilled since the recipe was very easy.  I made it the first time for my family and have been making it ever since.  I often think of this special lady who shared her popular recipe with me.  I still have the yellowed piece of paper I originally wrote it on hidden away in a favorite cookbook.

                              Jerk Seasoning

Recipe By     :Submitted by Eden House, Key West, FL
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Marinades
                Spice Blends

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             large  Scotch Bonnet chilies -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  brown mustard
  2        tablespoons  orange juice
  2        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
  3                     green onions -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  mustard seed
  1           teaspoon  seasoned salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Mix all ingredients together to make a paste.  Rub the meat or poultry liberally with the paste.  Let marinate at least 8 hours, preferably overnight.

Serving suggestion:  Try this marinade on chicken, pork, or lamb.  Works best on grilled meats.  Rub excess marinade on meats as you grill them.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  The "Jerk" method of cooking meat and poultry is a combination of slow grilling and smoking.  You will find a lot of versions of jerk seasonings.  However, there is always one common ingredient.  That is the Scotch Bonnet pepper.

In medium saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over second can of Beef Consomme and stir over low heat constantly until completely dissolved.  Remove from heat and set aside at room temperature.  Take out 1 cup of gelatin mixture and set aside.

Remove rind from salt pork, then discard rind.  Dice the pork and cook in heavy skillet until crisp and brown.  Remove and drain.  Cook liver in pork drippings until well browned and thoroughly cooked.  Remove and set aside.  Cook onions and seasonings in drippings until just tender.  In food processor or food grinder, grind together pork, liver, onions, eggs, and cracker mixture.  Add to gelatin in saucepan, mix well, and chill for two hours.

Pour reserved cup of gelatin mixture into chilled loaf pan.  Chill for about 30 minutes, until sticky to touch.  Make a design out of carrot and scallion tops, and arrange on gelatin, prettiest side down, so that it will show when turned onto platter.  Press pieces into gelatin slightly, then chill until firm.

Carefully put liver mixture into loaf pan, then cover and chill very thoroughly.  Unmold by running knife around pate.  Dip pan into warm water for a few seconds, then invert onto serving platter.  Refrigerate until time to serve.  This pate keeps well for several days.

This recipe yields 7 cups.

                  Mama Jo D'Ascanio's Italian Pot Roast

Recipe By     :Submitted by Maude's Courtyard Bed & Breakfast, Kennebunkpor
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  lean (blade-bone in) chuck roast
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  4             medium  onions -- chopped
  3          teaspoons  oregano
  2          teaspoons  thyme
  1           teaspoon  basil -- and
  6              whole  basil leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  2           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  4               cans  tomato paste - (6 oz ea)
  6               cups  water
  1 1/2         pounds  thin noodles
                        Grated Parmesan cheese -- for garnish
                        Chopped chives -- for garnish

Brown meat slowly on all sides in hot olive oil.  Remove meat and lower the heat.  Add garlic, sugar and seasonings.  Simmer about 5 minutes, being careful not to burn.  Return meat to pot.

Mix tomato paste with water and pour over meat.  Bring to a full boil, then lower heat and cover loosely.  Simmer slowly about 3 to 4 hours, turning meat occasionally.

When meat is tender, cook noodles and drain.  Slice the meat and arrange over noodles and cover with sauce.  Sprinkle with cheese and chives as desired.

This recipe yields about 8 servings.

Comments:  This is a keepsake recipe that long survived as a Sunday tradition when we went to Nana's house, and it continues to be a favorite in our family.  It's worth taking the time to prepare.  We're lucky -- Mom still makes it for us!

Make a pot roast the way they do in the Old Country, with an imaginative blend of herbs and spices.  For the secret to the real Italian flavor, make your sauce with tomato paste!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     rump roast (no other cut will do!)
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
                        Minced garlic -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped chives
  1                     large slice onion
  8                     beef bullion cubes or
                        Lipton's onion soup mix
                        Chopped raw carrots
                        Quartered potatoes
                        === FOR GRAVY ===
  1                cup  flour
                        Water -- as needed

Brown the roast in a large pot with vegetable oil covering the bottom.  As the roast is browning, sprinkle with garlic, salt, pepper, and chives.  After a thorough browning, reduce the heat a little, remove the roast to a platter, and brown onion in the oil until the onion is translucent.  Add the roast back to the pot; cover 80% with hot water, and add beef bullion cubes or onion soup mix.  Turn heat down to low and simmer (with top of pot slightly ajar) for about 4 hours.

The last hour of cooking time, add carrots and a few quartered potatoes.  Remove meat from liquid and let stand fifteen minutes before slicing (on the bias).  If you like a light gravy, bring liquid to a boil and add flour which has been diluted with tap water until smooth.  Stir into boiling liquid until gravy becomes thicker.  Adjust seasonings and pour over meat.

The crowning touch to this meal is a bowl of flat Goodman's egg noodles.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Mary was my mom. Born in New York City in 1903, she was a twin.  Her mother died when she was six months old.  Raised by a maiden aunt in Southport, Connecticut, it was there she learned how to sew and cook.  And cook she could!  Especially my favorite, a good Yankee pot roast on a Sunday afternoon.  Accompanying the roast, Mary made a coleslaw that all my life I urged her to sell.  My wife tried to copy the ingredients and the recipe, but you'll see it's a challenge for any cook to recreate.  The pot roast is melt-in-your-mouth and well worth a little effort.  So here it is, folks; she would have been very proud to know she had been published.

Oh, yes, I almost forgot -- she always sang "Oh Danny Boy" when she made this.  (It couldn't hurt!) ... Bill Strickland, Innkeeper and Proud Son, Wyatt Country Inn

                          Meat And Potato Quiche

Recipe By     :Submitted by The Decoy Bed & Breakfast, Strasburg, PA
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  frozen hash brown potatoes
  1              pound  sausage
  1 1/2           cups  cheese
  1                cup  evaporated milk
  2                     eggs
     3/4      teaspoon  salt

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  In an 8-inch square baker that has been sprayed with vegetable oil, place frozen hash brown potatoes or Ore-Ida's Potatoes O'Brien.  (We like the latter best because of the onion and green pepper in the mixture).  Sprinkle with a couple of tablespoons of vegetable oil and bake in the oven for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, brown bulk sausage, either mild or hot, and drain well.  Grate enough cheese to make 1 1/2 cups.  And in a separate bowl whisk together evaporated milk and eggs, along with seasoning salt.

When potatoes have come out of the oven, layer them with the sausage and cheese and pour the milk/egg mixture over all.  Bake at 425 degrees for a half hour.  Allow to sit for 5 to 7 minutes after it comes out of oven.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This recipe doubles well.  Bake in a 9- by 13-inch pan for the same length of time.

          Medallions Of Beef Tenderloin With Dried Cherry Sauce

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     filets - (6 to 8 oz ea) or 1 1/2 to 2 lbs
                        trimmed beef tenderloins
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        A small amount of olive oil
     1/4           cup  red wine
     3/4           cup  beef stock
     1/2           cup  cranberry juice
     1/2           cup  dried cherries -- finely chopped
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- at room temperature
  1           teaspoon  flour

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Trim fat from fillets; season with salt and pepper.  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet and brown filets.  Place filets in roasting pan and cook 15 minutes; reserve skillet.  Reduce heat to 350 degrees and roast an additional 20 minutes for rare meat.  Use an instant reading meat thermometer to test meat.  It should read 125 to 130 degrees for rare, 135 to 140 degrees for medium.  Let the fillet rest for 10 minutes before carving.

To make the sauce:  Place the reserved skillet over medium heat and add the red wine.  Reduce to half, scraping up any brown particles.  Stir in stock, cranberry juice, and cherries.  Simmer for half an hour.  Stir the butter and flour together to form a paste.  Add this to the sauce bit by bit, whisking well after each addition.  Simmer until the sauce coats the back of a spoon.  Season with salt and pepper.

To Assemble:  Cut the fillets in 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick slices.  Overlap the medallions on the plate.  Spoon the cherry sauce over the medallions.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Meat chunks -- see * Note
     1/4         pound  medium shrimp in shells -- heads off
     1/2         pound  calamari -- cleaned, skinned,
                        cut into circles, heads whole
  12                    mussels - (to 18)
  2               cups  raw white rice
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  3                     Roma plum tomatoes - (to 4) -- minced
                        Saffron -- (or 1 packet of
                        Sazon Goya con Azafran)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1              large  red bell pepper -- cut wide strips
  1                     green pepper -- diced
                        Minced garlic -- as much as you like
                        (I use at least 2 large cloves/person)
  1                     full head of garlic
                        Chopped parsley (fresh is best)
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2         pound  fresh green beans -- diced, or
                        canned peas, carrots, or chick peas
                        (depending on your taste)

* Note:  About 2 inches square; 1 or 2 of each per serving:  8 to 10 pieces of chicken breast and/or thigh, 6 to 8 pieces of rabbit, or 6 to 8 pieces of pork, meatballs, etc. (all optional, depending on appetites).

In saucepan, brown meats in olive oil; remove meat.  In drippings, add onion, green pepper, tomato, minced garlic, bay leaf, and parsley and sautÈ until the onion is soft.  Add saffron, browned meats, and 1/4 cup of water and cook over low heat 5 to 10 minutes.  Drain the juice from the saucepan and save it.

Steam mussels until they open.  Save the juice; set mussels aside.  When they are cool, separate the shells, leaving the mussels on their half shells.

Transfer saucepan contents to paella pan, distributing evenly.  Place full head of garlic at center of the pan.  Divide into pie wedges with the thick strips of red pepper standing on edge so that when it is done, you will see the tops of the pepper strips.  Distribute rings and heads of calamari.  Sprinkle beans or chick peas evenly around.  Then sprinkle rice evenly around meats.  Add 8 cups of liquid, including saucepan sautÈ juices and mussel juice.

Cook, uncovered, evenly over low flame.  This can be done in the oven, but is much better over an open flame where you can tend it.  I prefer to do it over an adjustable grille, starting relatively close to the hot coals to get it steeping and simmering, but then raising the grille from the coals to slow the cooking and let the flavors mingle.  Important: rotate the pan over the flame to make sure it cooks evenly, and keep flame from scorching the rice at the bottom of the paella pan.  This pot takes considerable watchful attention.

When the rice has risen to the top and much (but not all) of the water has cooked off, fan shrimp over the top, then stand the mussels in half shells in the rice, points down.  I do it in an attractive pattern of circled mussels and fanned shrimp.

As it cooks, gauge doneness by tasting rice from several parts of the pan to be sure it is the correct texture (cooked -- not crunchy, not mushy) and consistent throughout.  If more water is needed in certain parts of the pan, add boiling water sparingly, sprinkling from a large spoon.  If too much water is in the rice, lay newspaper lightly over the top of it and it will absorb excess water.

Best served right out of the pan.  In Spain, eating with the men out in the fields, the mussel shells served as spoons.

Serve with crusty bread and a tossed salad.  I recommend violating the seafood-white wine rule; this meal goes best with a hardy red of your choice.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  I suggest the first time you do a paella that you stick close to the recipe.  After that, feel free to experiment to taste.  I also suggest you do not attempt a paella for two.  This is a meal that requires a great deal of loving work to prepare, more than you would feel inclined to spend for only two persons.  It requires close attention for quite a few hours.  It cannot be hurried.  I have tried to calculate the quantities required for six adults.  There will be leftovers -- there almost always are.

The first thing you need is a proper paella pan.  You will find paella pans of many sizes and shapes.  The best will be the most shallow and broad you can find, with its rim slanted outward.  No lid needed.  I have a paella pan that serves 8 persons; it is about 13 inches across at the top, 11 inches across the bottom, and the sides are only about an inch and a half high.  It feeds eight persons comfortably.  (I also have one that serves 16!)

The best way to clean and treat the pan: rub its insides vigorously with a wedge of lemon after each use (and before first use), rinse, dry, and wipe its insides with olive oil on a paper towel.  It should remain rust free and ready for use.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8 3/4         pounds  ground meat - (4 kilos)
  6                     green peppers
  3                     red peppers
  10                    carrots
  3                     onions
  6                     serrano chilis
                        Some serrano chili paste -- (see below)
  3               cans  stewed tomatoes - (28 oz ea)
  1 1/8         pounds  raisins - (1/2 kilo)
  2               cups  green olives
  2               cans  black olives
                        === SERRANO CHILI PASTE ===
  20                    serrano chilis - (to 25) -- whole, washed,
                        with stems cut off
  1         tablespoon  salt -- and
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  white vinegar

Cook meat and sauce separately.

Brown meat.  Add pepper but no salt.  Olives will make the meat salty.

For the sauce, start out by sauteing the onion.  Put stewed tomatoes in blender and puree very slightly.  Add to onion.  Add chopped carrots (chop in small quarter pieces) and chopped serranos -- very fine.  After carrots cook awhile, add chopped green and red peppers.  Cook for a few minutes until the peppers are tender.

Add sauce to meat.  Stir in green olives.  Taste for spiciness and add about a teaspoon (or more) of serrano paste for desired hotness.  Let sauce cook for awhile.  Add raisins.  After raisins get plump, add black olives.  Serve with corn and flour tortillas and beans.

For the Serrano Chili Paste:  Blend chilis, salt, olive oil and vinegar together.  Makes a very hot sauce!  Good to use with meat, fish, soups, or to add some picante spiciness.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     racks lamb - (8 to 9 ribs) -- bones Frenched,
                        and fat trimmed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        === SAUCE ===
  2             medium  shallots -- minced
  1                cup  dry red wine
  2 1/2      teaspoons  minced rosemary leaves
  1                cup  low-sodium chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 425 degrees and place a shallow pan in oven to heat.  Season lamb with salt and pepper.  Heat oil in skillet over high heat.  Place lamb in skillet, meat-side down with ribs facing outward.  Cook until well browned and crust has formed on the surface, probably about 4 to 5 minutes.  Use tongs to stand ribs up against each other to brown bottoms.

Transfer lamb to preheated roasting pan and roast 12 to 15 minutes.  (Retain 2 tablespoons fat for use in sauce.)  Remove and cover meat loosely with foil and let rest for 10 to 12 minutes.  Carve into individual chops and serve them immediately with sauce.

For the Sauce:  Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the skillet in which you browned the lamb.  Saute shallots over medium heat until soft.  Add red wine and rosemary.  Increase heat to medium-high and simmer until dark and syrupy.  Add chicken broth and reduce until about 3/4 cup.  Remove from heat and add butter to blend.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  stew meat or round steak -- trimmed, and
                        cut up
  1            package  dry onion soup mix
  2               cans  cream of mushroom soup - (10 oz ea)
  2               cups  sliced fresh mushrooms
                        (or two 4-oz cans mushrooms, drained)
     1/2           cup  red wine
  1                cup  sour cream

Place meat, onion soup mix, cream of mushroom soup, mushrooms, and wine in Dutch oven.  Bake all afternoon well-covered at 200 to 250 degrees.  Allow at least three hours.  The lower the temperature, the longer it cooks, the more tender the results.

Add one cup sour cream at serving time.  Serve over noodles or rice.  This recipe is a favorite with the wranglers, cooks and guests.  It's easy to put together, easy to increase, and always turns out perfect!  It's great to serve with fresh bread, fresh tossed salad and "Rich Ranch's Fresh Cranberry Salad" (see recipe).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  chopped lamb trimmings
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  finely-diced shallots
     1/4           cup  finely-diced celery
     1/2           cup  finely-diced onion
     1/4           cup  finely-diced leek, white part only
     1/4           cup  finely-diced mushroom stems
  3                     fresh bay leaves
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
  3        tablespoons  whole black peppercorns
  2               cups  good-quality dry red wine
  6               cups  rich beef stock
  1         tablespoon  cold butter
                        === LAMB RACK ===
  1                     lamb rack -- French trimmed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme

Heat the butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the lamb trimmings and cook until golden.  Add the carrots, celery, onion, mushroom stems, and leeks; continue cooking until the vegetables are golden.  Add the bay leaf, thyme, and peppercorns; "sweat" lightly to lift the aromas, about one minute.  Add the red wine, reduce heat to a low simmer, and cook until wine is reduced to a syrup, about thirty minutes.

Add the stock.  Continue to simmer over low heat until liquid is reduced by 2/3, about two hours.  Strain the broth, return to a clean pan over low heat, and continue to cook until reduced to lightly coat the back of a spoon, about 45 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside in a warm place.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Season the lamb rack with salt and freshly-ground black pepper to taste.  Heat the butter in a large, oven-proof saute pan over high heat.  When the butter is light brown, add the lamb rack, skin-side down, and sear until golden brown.  Turn the rack to expose the browned side and rub with the fresh thyme and rosemary.  Place on the center rack of the oven; roast until internal temperature reaches 120 degrees for medium-rare.  Transfer to a warmed platter and allow the meat to rest for ten minutes before serving.

While the lamb rests, reheat the sauce over low heat; incorporate the cold butter.  Slice the lamb into chops, ladle small amount of sauce over two warmed plates, place the chops over the sauce, and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  chicken, beef, or pork
  1         tablespoon  curry powder - (to 1 1/2 tbspns)
     1/2           cup  milk or coconut milk
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  coconut milk -- for sprinkling
  3             slices  ginger
     1/2    tablespoon  coriander powder or
                        fresh coriander roots
  2        tablespoons  soybean butter
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4)
  40                    bamboo skewers - (to 45)
                        === PEANUT SAUCE - {SATAY SAUCE} ===
     1/2    tablespoon  red curry paste - (to 1 tbspn)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3        tablespoons  natural peanut butter - (to 4 tbspns)
  1           teaspoon  lime or lemon juice
     1/2    tablespoon  roasted chili paste (Nam Prik Pao) -- or more to taste
  1 1/2           cups  coconut milk
     3/4      teaspoon  salt

Cut meat thinly into 1-inch strips.  In a food processor or blender, combine garlic, ginger, curry powder, coriander, salt, soy sauce, soybean butter, and milk.  Blend until smooth.  Pour over the meat and marinate at least two hours or overnight in the refrigerator.

Soak the skewers in water for about 5 minutes to prevent them from becoming singed.  Thread the meat onto the skewers (1 to 2 strips per skewer).  Cook over charcoal (or under the broiler) while sprinkling with coconut milk.  When done, serve with satay sauce and cucumber sauce.

Peanut Sauce:  Cook the coconut milk over low heat until fat rises to the top (can use milk if concerned about fat).  Stir constantly for about 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the red curry paste and roasted chili paste.  Mix in the remaining coconut milk.  Stir for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add sugar, salt, lime juice, and peanut butter.  Mix well.  Simmer for about 4 to 5 minutes or until boiling gently.  Add sugar, salt, and lime juice to taste (the sauce should have a salty, sweet, and a little sour taste).  Remove from heat.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  chopped cooked roast beef or pot roast -- in 1/2" pieces
                        or smaller
  1                cup  chopped onions
  3               cups  thinly-sliced carrots
  1                cup  chopped celery
  2               cups  brown gravy - (approximate)
  1                     beef bouillon cube or equivalent base
  3          teaspoons  parsley flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  sage -- no more
  3              large  bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  green peppers
     1/2         pound  ground BEEFALO
  1                cup  dry bread crumbs
  1                can  tomato sauce
  1         tablespoon  chopped onion
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut thin slice from stem end of each pepper.  Remove all seeds and membranes.  Wash inside and outside.  Heat 1 cup water and 1/2 teaspoon salt to boiling.  Add peppers; cook 5 minutes and drain.

Mix remaining ingredients.  Lightly stuff each pepper with 1/3 of the meat mixture.  stand peppers upright in ungreased baking dish, 8 by 8 by 2 inches.  Cover; bake 45 minutes.  Uncover; bake 15 minutes longer.

Welcome!  Even with temperatures and humidity swelling, there is just a hint of Autumn in the steamy air.  With a few of the trees starting to show fall colors and bales of hay stacked around the area, the cool winds of fall can't be too far behind.  Keeping that in mind, the preceeding recipe is one seasonal fall favorite around our farm.

Recipe By     :Submitted by Year of the Horse Inn, Chincoteague Island, VA
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Meat -- see * Note 1
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- quartered
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1                cup  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Raisins
                        Green olives -- pitted
                        Green peppers -- cut into wedges
                        Vegetables -- see * Note 2
                        Zucchini -- (optional)

* Note 1:  Your choice (or mix) of chicken, lamb, or beef, cut into chunks.

* Note: Variety of cut vegetables that take a long time to cook (e.g. carrots, potatoes, beans, and/or turnips).

Properly done, a tagine requires its specialized pot, a deep clay dish with a cone-like chimney.  I have managed it in a large covered earthenware pot, but it requires letting the vapors escape a little -- the stewing is not as intense as typical American crockpot stews.

Heat a thin layer of olive oil in the pot or dish.  Brown the meat and chopped onion.  Add a cup of water, salt and pepper to taste, and vegetables.  Cook on very low heat 20 to 25 minutes.  Add raisins, olives, peppers, onion quarters, and zucchini and cook until vegetables are tender.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Spring-summer of 1975 found me in a town called Beni Mellal on the flank of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco, about equidistant from Fez and Marakech.  I lived in a large but bare apartment on the second floor above a bordello, on a street known locally as La Rue d'Amour (the Street of Love) because so many bordellos were doing business on that block.  Occasionally the police would raid, but not for sex.  Located in a strict Muslim section of Morocco, they were on the prowl for alcoholic beverages.

The Madam, my landlady, was always tipped in advance that a raid was scheduled that night.  As a foreigner, I was exempt from the Muslim rule, so she would carry her supply of beer and other alcoholic beverages up to my apartment and I would stash them in my closet for her until the raid had come and gone.  In exchange, she would bring me huge platters of food.  Among them was Tagine, a delicious stew.

I asked her how it was made, and she showed me.  I have had tagines since at friends' homes in Morocco and in American restaurants, but never like the tagines she made me.  Perhaps it was the sweet taste of having outwitted the morality police.  Here is how I remember it.

Cook bacon so it is still a little soft, not crisp.  Remove tongue from water and peel skin off.  Cut tongue into small pieces to fit into grinder.  Grind tongue.

Drain excess water from pinto beans and add ground tongue, ground bacon, and all other ingredients except onion.  Set on low heat and allow to boil very gently for 30 minutes, stirring often so that all ingredients are thoroughly mixed.  Add onion and mix thoroughly.

This recipe yields about 4 quarts.

Comments:  This recipe makes a delicious chile that is not too hot or spicy.  Additional spices and vegetables can be added without danger if a spicier or more flavorsome chile is desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef and pork mixed -- (equal portions)
  4             medium  potatoes - (to 5)
  1             medium  onion -- diced
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
                        Crushed cloves -- to taste
                        Butter -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Pie crust -- (Mom always made
                        her own, but store-bought would do, I
                        suppose.  You'll need a top crust as
                        well as a bottom, though.)

SautÈ onion in butter.  Add meat, salt, and pepper.  Cover and cook slowly, stirring occasionally.  Peel, boil, and mash potatoes (do not add any milk, butter, etc. to them).  Add cooked meat to potatoes and mix well.  Mix in spices to taste.

Fill pie crust, cover, puncture the top crust, and paint with milk.  Cook in oven at 425 to 450 degrees for 30 minutes, then lower oven to 350 degrees until it is what my mom called "golden done," 45 to 55 minutes in all.

Serve piping hot.  Some QuÈbecois like to lift the lid of their slice and smear it with ketchup.  I prefer not, but it is a matter of taste.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This is the traditional meal of the QuÈbecois, and I have the recipe from my mother, who passed away in July 1998 at age 87.  I believe she had the recipe from my father's family.  Both my parents were from QuÈbec, my father born there, one of 16 children of a hotelier in the mining town of Thetford Mines.  So in a way, operating a B&B for me is returning to my patrimony.

My mother was a Chicagoan transplanted to New England, but both her parents also came from QuÈbec, so the recipe may very well be her mother's.  She never said, we never asked.  It was how Mom did it.  She never had much in her life.  She knew pain and conquered it with grit -- when my younger brother was killed in a tragic motorcycle accident when he was barely 16 years old and when our father died at barely 50 years old that same year.  My mother fought life and won the battle.  She was the pillar around which our family revolved.

Every New Year's Day, we would gather at her place and she would have two or three of these delicious-smelling meat pies waiting for us along with plates of pickled beets and a platter of olives, sweet pickles, and celery stuffed with cream cheese.  It wasn't New Year's Day if it didn't include TourtiÈre.

                  Veal Chops With Shallots And Pine Nuts

Recipe By     :Submitted by The Gaslight Inn, Gettysburg, PA
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16                    shallots -- peeled
  3         tablespoon  olive oil
  4             ounces  pinenuts
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1                cup  beef stock
  4                     center-cut loin veal chops
     1/4           cup  butter
  3        tablespoons  flour
     1/4           cup  white wine
     1/2           cup  oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  chiffonade of fresh basil
     1/2           cup  butter

Place shallots in small baking pan and coat with oil.  Season with salt and pepper and roast at 350 degrees until brown and soft, about 30 minutes.  Set aside.  Brown pinenuts in a small skillet in the melted butter, shaking frequently.  Cover and set aside.  Combine chicken and beef stocks in saucepan and boil until reduced to 1/2 cup.  Reserve.

Lightly dredge chops in flour.  Melt butter in skillet and brown chops on both sides.  Transfer to 450 degree oven to finish cooking (about 20 minutes, depending on thickness).  Plate chops -- cover to keep warm.  Finish sauce.

Deglaze pan with wine, scraping up browned bits.  Add dried tomatoes, pine nuts, shallots, and reduced stock and simmer until reduced to syrup consistency, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in butter, 2 tablespoons at a time, to thicken sauce.  Add basil.

Place chops on warmed plates and spoon sauce over veal.  Serve with browned polenta, rice, or couscous along with colorful steamed vegetables.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments: This is an adaptation of a recipe found in an old Bon Apetit magazine.  It is heavenly with nice thick veal chops, but also works well with steaks or prime rib.

Place shallots in small baking pan and coat with oil.  Season with salt and pepper and roast at 350 degrees until brown and soft, about 30 minutes.  Set aside.  Brown pinenuts in a small skillet in the melted butter, shaking frequently.  Cover and set aside.  Combine chicken and beef stocks in saucepan and boil until reduced to 1/2 cup.  Reserve.

Lightly dredge chops in flour.  Melt butter in skillet and brown chops on both sides.  Transfer to 450 degree oven to finish cooking (about 20 minutes, depending on thickness).  Plate chops -- cover to keep warm.  Finish sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Deglaze pan with wine, scraping up browned bits.  Add dried tomatoes, pine nuts, shallots, and reduced stock and simmer until reduced to syrup consistency, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in butter, 2 tablespoons at a time, to thicken sauce.  Add basil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place chops on warmed plates and spoon sauce over veal.  Serve with browned polenta, rice, or couscous along with colorful steamed vegetables.

Comments: This is an adaptation of a recipe found in an old Bon Apetit magazine.  It is heavenly with nice thick veal chops, but also works well with steaks or prime rib.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     veal shanks - (10 to 12 oz ea)
                        Salad oil -- as needed
                        Seasoned flour -- as needed
  2             ounces  olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced
  1                     shallot -- chopped
  8                     fresh sage leaves -- no stems
  3                     branches fresh rosemary -- no stems
  3             ounces  Marsala - (to 4 oz)
  2             ounces  white wine
  2               cans  whole Roma tomatoes - (16 oz ea) -- coarsely chopped
  1              quart  beef stock
  4             ounces  tomato paste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Season veal shanks and dredge in flour.  Heat salad oil over medium-high heat.  Pan fry veal shanks 2 to 3 minutes on each side.  Remove from oil and place on cookie sheet.  Bake at 375 degrees for 10 minutes.  Remove from oven and let cool.

Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven.  Saute garlic and shallots to a golden color.  Deglaze pan with marsala and white wine.  Add herbs, tomato paste, canned tomatoes, and beef stock.  Heat until simmering.  Check seasonings and add salt and pepper to taste if needed.  Remember -- the sauce will thicken and reduce during cooking, so do not over-season.

Add veal shanks to pan and push them to the bottom (do not overlap them).  Make sure the shanks are covered in sauce by at least 1/4 inch.  If not, add additional beef stock or water to raise the liquid level.  Cover pot and place in oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  It is done when the meat pulls clean away from the bone.

Degrease the sauce upon removing from the oven.  Serve piping hot over fresh pasta or rice with your favorite vegetables.  Enjoy!

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                cup  canned whole-berry cranberry sauce
     1/2           cup  plus 1 tablespoon red jelly or jam -- (example: currant,
                        cherry, raspberry or strawberry)
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar - (to 3 tbspns) -- to taste
  1              ounce  fresh peeled ginger root -- or to taste

Whisk together first 3 ingredients.  Set aside.  Process ham in a food processor or chop with a knife until finely minced.  In a bowl, combine ham, cheese, and apricot mixture until blended.

Place 1/2 cup of ham mixture in the center of each 5- by 5-inch pastry square.  Moisten edges around filling with egg white.  Put opposite edges together to form triangle.  Press edges to seal.  Place on lightly oiled cookie sheet.

Trim any extra pastry from tips of triangle and use scraps of pastry to decorate top of triangular puffs.  Use tines of fork to press joined sides of triangle to secure seal.  Brush entire top with egg white.  Repeat with remaining pastry sheets and filling.

Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until pastries are puffed high and golden brown.  Serve puffs hot from the oven topped with fruit sauce and sprigs of fresh herbs.  Prepare sauce by blending together the last four ingredients in a blender or a food processor.  Process until ginger root is pureed.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Please Note:  Puff pastry is found in the frozen food section of the grocery store.  Follow package instructions for storage and use of product.  The size of the pastry sheets will vary depending on the manufacturer.  Please note size when purchasing, to determine quantity needed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     veal rib chops - (12 oz ea) -- Frenched, (use loin
                        chops if available)
  1                cup  wood chips, mixed or whatever flavor
                        you you choose -- lightly dampened
  1                cup  fresh Shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, julienned
  1                cup  fresh Portabello mushrooms -- stemmed, julienned
  1                cup  fresh Crimini mushrooms -- julienned
  1 1/2           cups  reduced veal stock -- see * Note
     3/4           cup  good red wine, such as Cabernet
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  If you cannot get veal stock, you may purchase a good quality beef broth and reduce it over medium-high heat by half to obtain amount needed and to strengthen the flavor.

Preheat your grill.  In a saute pan, saute 2 tablespoons olive oil and all the mushrooms, over medium-high heat.  Once the mushrooms have begun to cook, deglaze the pan with the red wine, reduce heat to medium and simmer until red wine is reduced by half.

Salt and pepper the chops, place the dampened wood chips under the grates (use caution when doing this, the grates are hot, and the chips may flame).  Place the veal chops on the grill, marking a quarter turn to give good grill marks.  Grill the chops until medium-rare, or temperature of choice.

Add the veal stock to mushrooms and reduce heat to low simmer and reduce again by half.  Salt and pepper to taste, hold hot until chops are ready.  Serve with homemade mashed potatoes, place veal chops on plate, coat with the mushroom sauce.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  21            ounces  veal -- sliced by hand

  2        tablespoons  butter
