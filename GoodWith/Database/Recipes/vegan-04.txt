                            'Tort' And Cheese

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Free                        Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  4                     Italian-flavored soy sausage links -- thinly sliced
                        on the diagonal
  1              bunch  broccoli rabe -- trimmed
  3        tablespoons  soy margarine or butter
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  low-fat milk or soy milk
  2               cups  shredded low-fat or regular cheddar cheese
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1            package  fresh tri-colored tortellini - (10 oz)
                        = (or other gourmet-flavored tortellini)

Heat oil in large skillet over medium, and sautÈ sausage until brown, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, steam broccoli rabe with the water on its leaves in covered saucepan just until wilted, remove from heat and drain thoroughly, squeezing out excess water by hand when cool enough to handle.  Set aside and keep warm.

To make roux, heat margarine over medium and, when melted, stir in flour.  Add milk and cheese all at once, and whisk until cheese melts and sauce thickens.  Stir in garlic, oregano, crushed red pepper, if using, and salt and pepper to taste.

Bring large pot of lightly salted water to a boil, and add tortellini.  Cook for about 4 minutes, or until tender, and drain.

To serve, arrange 4 equal portions broccoli rabe on each plate.  Top with tortellini, cheese sauce and sausage.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 540 Cal; 36g Prot; 25g Total Fat (8 Sat. Fat); 46g Carb.; 135mg  Chol; 810mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Since this dish has its roots in Italy, it's sensible to consider a good Italian wine, such as Travignoli Chianti Rufina.

Comments:  An adaptation of the popular "mac-and-cheese" concept, this entrÈe becomes more than a pasta side dish or simple luncheon entrÈe with the addition of steamed broccoli rabe and sautÈed Italian-seasoned soy sausages.  As accompaniments, slice ripened tomatoes for a salad garnished with croutons, fresh basil leaves and perhaps slices of fresh mozzarella, and serve with wedges of toasted focaccia.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf Afghan bread - (14 oz)
                        = (or 12-oz pkg pita loaves)
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1 1/4          pound  spinach -- rinsed, stemmed,
                        and cut into thin strips
  1                cup  canned fava beans -- rinsed, drained
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Zahtar -- to taste
  1                     container herb-flavored soy cream cheese -
  4        tablespoons  toasted sesame seeds - (to 5)

Preheat oven to broil.

Open up and flatten Afghan bread loaf and slice into 2-ounce sections; there will be one leftover section.  Sprinkle with water and heat under broiler for about 30 seconds until softened.  Remove from oven.

Meanwhile, take rinsed spinach with water still on leaves and place in large pot.  Add 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, and steam spinach over medium heat about 5 minutes, or until wilted, taking care not to scorch.  Remove from heat, press firmly with tongs to press out excess water and drain carefully.  Chop spinach and separate into 6 equal-sized portions.

Mash fava beans coarsely with olive oil, 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, zahtar, salt and pepper.  Divide into 6 equal-sized portions.

Using about 2 tablespoons per serving, spread bread slices with soy cream cheese.  Then spread with mashed fava beans, covering the cream cheese well, and top with equal portions of well-drained spinach -- if not well-drained, spinach could turn bread soggy.  Garnish with sesame seeds and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 330 Cal; 12g Prot; 16g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 38g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 510mg  Sod.; 7g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  The slight acidity of the vinegar; the nuttiness of sesame oil, sesame seeds and zahtar; and the fresh taste of spinach match well with Isabel Estate Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc.

Comments:  Afghan bread and the seasoning zahtar are sold at Middle Eastern markets and some well-stocked supermarkets.  For the bread, you may substitute pita loavesóplan to use the two-ounce size, one loaf per serving.  As an alternate to zahtar, use your favorite seasoning mix, one that has plenty of flavor.  Dried fruits such as dates, raisins and apricots, plus hot tea, complement this simple, light meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
     1/2           cup  fine cornmeal
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  cold unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1                     extra-large egg
     1/3           cup  heavy cream or half-and-half -- plus
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream or half-and-half
                        === FILLING ===
  2                     red apples
  1                     green apple
                        = (preferably Granny Smith)
  1                     pear
                        = (preferably Bosc or Anjou)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  fresh or frozen cranberries -- or more as desired

To make pastry:  Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar and salt in food processor fitted with steel blade.  Use sharp knife to cut butter into thin slices while still cold, then lay butter on top of dry ingredients in food processor.  Pulse several times until butter is evenly distributed and mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add egg and pulse once or twice until just incorporated, then pulse in enough cream to bring dough together.  Remove dough from food processor and press together into one mass.

Divide dough into 2 uneven pieces, about two-thirds and one-third.  Form each into ball, and flatten each ball into thick disk.  Place each disk between 2 sheets of wax paper, and roll until about 1/8-inch thick.  Ease larger circle into 9- or 10-inch pie pan and trim edges.  Cut smaller circle into strips about 1/2-inch wide.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

To make filling:  Slice apples and pear thinly.  Transfer to bowl and drizzle with lemon or lime juice and toss with grated lemon zest.  Combine cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugars and salt in bowl, sprinkle onto fruit and toss to coat.

Arrange fruit in crust so skins show, and sprinkle cranberries over top.  Arrange dough strips on top in criss-cross pattern to form lattice topping.

Place filled tart on baking tray and bake in lower half of oven about 40 minutes, or until light golden on top and around edges.  Cool at least 15 minutes before slicing tart.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings (one 10-inch tart).

Per Serving: 430 Cal; 6g Prot; 17g Total Fat (10 Sat. Fat); 65g Carb.; 80mg  Chol; 240mg  Sod.; 5g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Beginning of the day, end of the day, beginning of the meal and end of the meal.  All of these options suggest pouring and enjoying Champagne.  Pop open a bottle of MoÎt & Chandon White Star.

Comments:  This rustic fruit tart, with cornmeal-based crust and lattice top, looks like dessert but is a perfect breakfast pastry.  Good in winter made with a combination of tangy apples and sweet pears, it is also a winning dish in summertime with peaches and blackberries or blueberries.  This tart tastes especially good with a dollop of crËme fraÓche on the side.  For a fancier look, glaze the crust with an egg wash and a sprinkling of sugar before baking.

                     Artichoke Heart And Quinoa Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  pecans -- toasted
  1                cup  uncooked quinoa
  2              heads  Belgian endive -- leaves separated,
                        and rinsed
  2               cups  artichoke hearts -- halved, quartered
  2              pints  cherry or grape tomatoes
  2                     shallots -- thinly sliced

Heat large skillet over medium, and dry-roast pecans, stirring continuously to prevent scorching, until fragrant and slightly browned.  Remove from heat and set aside to cool.

Combine quinoa with 2 1/2 cups water in large saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium.  Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking grains, stirring occasionally, until tender, for 15 to 20 minutes.  Scoop quinoa into strainer, rinse under cold water, drain well and set aside.

Meanwhile, layer dinner plates with endive leaves.  In separate mixing bowl, combine artichoke hearts, cherry tomatoes and sliced shallots.  When quinoa is cool, stir grain and vegetables together, and dress as desired, tossing to combine.  Arrange mixture on endive leaves, garnish with toasted pecans and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 440 Cal; 13g Prot; 24g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 51g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 85mg  Sod.; 15g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Somewhat bitter-tasting foods, such as the Belgian endive, plus toasted nuts and the nutty flavor of artichokes combined with a mild-flavored cooked grain gussie up nicely with a flavorful vinaigrette or dressing.  Such a dish pairs well with a fine-tasting Sauvignon Blanc.  Try the Jean Reverdy Sancerre Vignoble de la Reine Blanche.

Comments:  For this vegetable-bedecked grain salad, a garnish of crisped pecans and drizzles of your favorite herbed or mustard-flavored vinaigrette or other salad dressing transforms a drab dish into a sparkling entrÈe.  Such a mild grain complements assertive ingredients, so feel free to experiment with other vegetable choices or even flavored tempeh or seasoned tofu.  Toasted pita triangles and wedges of hot apple tart topped with ice cream or whipped cream make perfect partners for this meal.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Frittatas                       Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil - (to 3)
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                     medium-sized onion -- peeled, sliced
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2                     large stalks ruby chard
  2             medium  potatoes -- scrubbed, unpeeled,
                        and thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  dried rosemary
     1/2      teaspoon  dried sage
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  8              large  eggs
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  diced GruyËre cheese

Remove and mince chard leaves and cut stems in 1/2-inch-long pieces.  Maintain leaves and stems in separate containers, and set aside.

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in 10-inch skillet over medium heat.  Add butter, and when melted, toss in onions.  Cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat, about 5 minutes, then reduce heat to low, add 1/2 teaspoon salt and cover skillet.  Cook 20 minutes more, or until onions are soft.

Stir in potatoes and herbs.  Cover and cook about 10 minutes, stirring intermittently, or until potato slices are tender.

Add chard stems and sautÈ about 2 minutes more.  Stir in chard leaves and garlic and cook another minute, or until leaves are wilted but still bright green.  Remove pan from heat.

Break eggs into large bowl, add remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and beat well with whisk.  Add vegetables, black pepper to taste and cheese.  Stir until evenly distributed.  Clean and dry skillet and return to burner over medium heat.  Preheat broiler.

When skillet is hot again, add remaining olive oil, wait about 30 seconds, and swirl to coat pan.  Pour in vegetable-egg mixture and cook undisturbed over medium heat, 3 to 4 minutes, or until bottom of eggs have firmed.

Transfer skillet to broiler, and broil about 3 minutes, or until frittata is firm in center.  Remove from broiler, and run knife around edge to loosen frittata.  Slide or invert onto large, round plate, and serve hot, warm or at room temperature, cut into wedges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 300 Cal; 16g Prot; 20g Total Fat (7 Sat. Fat); 17g Carb.; 310mg  Chol; 590mg  Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Lining up food textures with wine textures affords diners better food and wine pairings.  In this case, the full-bodied mouth feel of potatoes, eggs, GruyËre, butter and resinous herbs calls for a full-on Chardonnay: Try Fetzer Vineyards Barrel Select Chardonnay.

Comments:  A frittata is a thick Italian omelet full of vegetables, herbs and cheese.  Unlike many other egg dishes, frittatas can be made ahead and reheated or served cold or at room temperature.  This dish reheats well in the microwave and can keep refrigerated in a tightly sealed container for up to one week.  For a lower-fat version, cut back on the amount of cheese you use.

Wine Suggestions:  Lining up food textures with wine textures affords diners better food and wine pairings.  In this case, the full-bodied mouth feel of potatoes, eggs, GruyËre, butter and resinous herbs calls for a full-on Chardonnay: Try Fetzer Vineyards Barrel Select Chardonnay.

Comments:  A frittata is a thick Italian omelet full of vegetables, herbs and cheese.  Unlike many other egg dishes, frittatas can be made ahead and reheated or served cold or at room temperature.  This dish reheats well in the microwave and can keep refrigerated in a tightly sealed container for up to one week.  For a lower-fat version, cut back on the amount of cheese you use.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  firm eggplant - (abt 1 lb)
     1/4           cup  tahini
  12            ounces  silken tofu
  2              large  garlic cloves -- crushed
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh coriander leaves
  2              dozen  pita loaves -- quartered
  3             quarts  combo raw and cooked vegetables - (to 4) -- for dipping
                        = (such as cucumbers, carrot sticks, bell
                        peppers, celery, radishes, baby carrots,
                        broccoli pieces and sugar snap peas, cut
                        into serving size pieces)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Oil cookie sheet.

Cut eggplant in half, and place cut-side down on cookie sheet.  Bake until soft, about 45 minutes.  Scrape softened eggplant flesh into blender.  Process until smooth.  Add tahini, tofu and seasonings, and process until smooth.

Just before serving, stir in coriander leaves and heat eggplant mixture to boiling.  Transfer eggplant mixture to fondue pot or crockpot.  Keep fondue warm over alcohol burner or in crockpot on lowest setting.  Serve with accompaniments.

Per Serving: 150 Cal; 4g Prot; 12g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 7g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 300mg  Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Syrah-based wines from the Middle East make nice companions for this fondue: Try QupÈ Cellars Syrah Colson Canyon Vineyard.

Comments:  The flavor here captures the essence of the Middle Eastern eggplant classic, baba ghanoush.  Consider such traditional accompaniments that go so well with eggplant, such as olives and cucumbers.

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- cleaned of grit
     1/2           cup  chopped green garlic
                        = (or 4 cloves regular garlic)
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  30                    baby carrots -- peeled, blanched
     1/2         pound  watercress -- well rinsed
  3                     Belgian endives -- sliced
  1                cup  Tarragon Vinaigrette -- (see recipe)

Make a confit of mushrooms and garlic by braising them slowly in olive oil for 15 to 30 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, and set aside to cool.

When cool enough to combine, add remaining ingredients to mushrooms and garlic, toss and serve.

Comments:  The sweetish late-harvest Riesling vinegar in the Tarragon Vinaigrette recipe is a key element to the success of this salad, so make no substitutes.  Look for the vinegar at gourmet food stores or other specialty food stores.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dried tri-colored or plain orzo
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1              large  leek -- thinly sliced
  2                     zucchini -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  chunky marinara sauce

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  shredded low-fat mozzarella
                        Pizza or Italian spice mix -- to taste
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly oil heatproof baking dish.

Heat water in covered saucepan.  When at a rapid boil, cook orzo until almost tender, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat oil in skillet over medium heat and sautÈ garlic, leeks and zucchini slices for about 10 minutes, stirring often.

Drain orzo and place in baking dish.  Stir in marinara sauce, salt and pepper and spice mix.  Top with half the cheese.

Arrange zucchini and leek slices on top of orzo, and top with remaining mozzarella.

Bake for 15 minutes, or until mozzarella melts.  During last 5 minutes, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.

Wine Suggestions:  The Russian River Valley is an important wine-growing sub-region of Sonoma County, California.  One winery there is named for the function its building had at the turn of the 19th century: The Hop Kiln Winery.  Try the Hop Kiln Winery Russian River Valley Primitivo Vineyard Zinfandel.

Description:
  "This simple dish comes together in minutes and calls for a light soup or tossed green salad and hot Italian bread with olive oil for dunking.  It also makes a great buffet party dish, as it can feed a group when served with other fare."

Categories    : Dairy Free                      Egg Free
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  small white beans
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin sesame or olive oil
  2               cups  eggplant -- cut small dice
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  12            ounces  couscous
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  Pomegranate Vinegar -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  pomegranate arils
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh coriander
                        Salt -- to taste

Pour boiling water over beans and soak overnight.  Next day, drain beans and cook until tender in salted water to cover, about 25 minutes.  Drain and reserve.

Place sesame oil in large skillet or wok and heat until it begins to smoke.  Stir-fry eggplant for about 5 minutes, or until tender, then add sesame seeds.  Continue to stir-fry until sesame seeds begin to turn color, then add garlic.  Stir and continue cooking for 1 minute, then remove from heat and set aside.

To cook couscous, bring 2 1/2 cups water to boil in large saucepan.  Add couscous and let mixture come to a full boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover and continue cooking for 1 minute or until all liquid absorbed.  Stir with fork to fluff, then pour into serving bowl.

To make vinaigrette:  Whisk together oil and vinegar and pour over hot couscous.  Stir well, then add beans and eggplant.  Add pomegranate arils and chopped fresh coriander, adjust seasonings and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Per Serving: 530 Cal; 16g Prot; 19g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 76g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 10mg  Sod.; 13g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  This dish has a great deal of body and texture underlined by the brightness of the pomegranates.  A lighter red wine, such as Beaujolais, with good fruit, low-to-medium acid and a slight bit of oakiness would match well.  Try RÈgniÈ, Grand Cru, Maison de Lamartin.

Comments:  The most delicate beans for this dish are the tiny white rice beans or the Italian heirloom variety known as fagioli del Pergatorio.  Unfortunately, these are not available in all parts of the country.  The best substitute is the Italian cannelloni bean, which can be found in most supermarkets.  For the eggplant, choose Thai long green or other long, slender eggplants.  They cook quickly and absorb less oil than the larger-fruited eggplants.

Place sesame oil in large skillet or wok and heat until it begins to smoke.  Stir-fry eggplant for about 5 minutes, or until tender, then add sesame seeds.  Continue to stir-fry until sesame seeds begin to turn color, then add garlic.  Stir and continue cooking for 1 minute, then remove from heat and set aside.

Wine Suggestions:  This dish has a great deal of body and texture underlined by the brightness of the pomegranates.  A lighter red wine, such as Beaujolais, with good fruit, low-to-medium acid and a slight bit of oakiness would match well.  Try RÈgniÈ, Grand Cru, Maison de Lamartin.

Comments:  The most delicate beans for this dish are the tiny white rice beans or the Italian heirloom variety known as fagioli del Pergatorio.  Unfortunately, these are not available in all parts of the country.  The best substitute is the Italian cannelloni bean, which can be found in most supermarkets.  For the eggplant, choose Thai long green or other long, slender eggplants.  They cook quickly and absorb less oil than the larger-fruited eggplants.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onion - (1 large)
  6               cups  vegetarian baked beans - (two 28-oz cans)
  6                     tofu hot dogs -- cut 1/2" chunks
  2          teaspoons  mustard
                        === CORNMEAL BISCUIT TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  fine yellow cornmeal
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  4        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut 1/4" pieces
     3/4           cup  buttermilk

In 4-quart Dutch oven or flameproof casserole, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 8 minutes.  Stir in beans, tofu dogs, mustard and salt and pepper to taste.  Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, while you prepare topping.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  In medium bowl, mix flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and baking soda.  Cut in butter with pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Make well in dry ingredients.  Add buttermilk all at once.  Stir just until mixture is blended and dough pulls together.  Let dough sit 2 minutes.

Dust dough with flour and transfer to floured work surface.  Knead 4 or 5 times, then pat into circle as large as the top of Dutch oven.  Using sharp knife, cut dough into 2-inch squares.  Place dough squares over hot beans.

Bake until topping is lightly golden, about 20 minutes.  Let cool at least 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried coriander
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped (1 1/2 cups)
  1              large  green bell pepper -- diced (1 3/4 cups)

Comments:  The vegan cornbread topping on this spicy bean chili gives it just the right touch and may be used in other recipes, such as Beans And Franks Pot Pie (see recipe).  Serve with guacamole and thinly sliced romaine lettuce dressed with a lime vinaigrette.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Several dried corn husks -- soaked in warm
                        water briefly until pliable (optional)
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
  4              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  regular or low-fat milk
  4             ounces  Monterey Jack or Pepper Jack cheese -- grated
  3             ounces  fresh creamy goat cheese
                        = (or low-fat or regular cream cheese)
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  blue cornmeal, preferably stone-ground
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  dried sage

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Grease 12-muffin tin.  If using corn husks, tear lengthwise into strips about 3/4- to 1-inch wide at widest point.  Lay two strips overlapping in an ëX' in each muffin cup, with long ends jutting out above pan.

Cream butter and sugar with mixer or food processor.  Add eggs, milk and cheeses, mixing well after each addition.  Sift together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt and sage.  Spoon dry mixture into batter about one-third at a time, mixing just until combined after each addition.

Scoop batter into prepared muffin tin, rounding at top of each muffin.  Bake for 22 to 24 minutes, until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 12 muffins.

Per Serving: 280 Cal; 8g Prot; 18g Total Fat (11 Sat. Fat); 23g Carb.; 115mg  Chol; 400mg  Sod.; 1g Fiber.

Comments:  Blue cornmeal gives these muffins a distinctive color and a natural nuttiness.  Substitute yellow or white cornmeal for the blue, if necessary.  If possible, scoop the batter over strips of dried corn husks to present the muffins more imaginatively.  You can find husks in Mexican food sections or Hispanic markets.  For a complementary topping, serve the muffins with sage-infused honey.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7               cups  vegetable broth
     1/2         pound  butternut squash -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  1 3/4           cups  arborio rice
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  dry white wine
  3               cups  chopped Swiss chard leaves
     3/4           cup  chopped canned plum tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh sage
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
     1/4           cup  grated soy Parmesan or Romano cheese -- (optional)

In large saucepan, bring broth to a boil.  Drop squash into boiling broth, reduce heat and simmer until squash is tender, but still firm, about 3 minutes.  Remove squash with slotted spoon and set aside.  Reduce heat and let broth simmer.

In large, deep skillet, combine oil and shallots.  Place over medium heat and stir to cook without browning, about 2 minutes.  Add rice and salt.  Stir until rice is coated with oil.  Add wine and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring, until rice absorbs wine.

Ladle 1/2 cup of simmering broth into skillet and stir until absorbed.  Continue with remaining broth, adding 1/2 cup at a time and letting each addition be absorbed by rice before adding more liquid, about 25 minutes total.

Add chard and stir until wilted.  Stir in squash, tomatoes, sage and parsley.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Stir in cheese if using and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 433 Cal; 7g Prot; 7g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 75g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 540mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  All this dish needs is some warm crusty bread.  For the most efficient use of time, heat the broth while you cut the shallots and herbs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  cumin seeds
                        = (or 1 tspn ground cumin)
  2               cups  unsalted peanuts -- preferably raw
  2             medium  onions -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3                     carrots -- peeled, diced
  4                     celery ribs -- diced
  2          teaspoons  grated fresh ginger
                        = (or 1 tspn ground ginger)
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cayenne -- (optional)
     1/8      teaspoon  dried thyme
  6               cups  vegetable stock or water
  1              large  butternut squash -- peeled, and
                        cut in 1" chunks - (4 to 6 cups)
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat oil in stock pot over medium heat.  When hot, add cumin and peanuts; sautÈ until peanuts begin to brown and cumin is fragrant.  Increase heat to medium-high, and add onions, garlic, carrots, celery and seasonings.  Cook until vegetables are soft.

Add stock and squash, and cook until squash is very soft.

PurÈe mixture in blender or food processor, and return to pot.  Add lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.  Serve hot.

Wine Suggestions:  One of the great reasons to drink Riesling is because it is such a good wine to pair with almost any dish.  And because Riesling comes from many countries and is made in many styles, it's pretty difficult not to find one to pair with holiday fare such as this Butternut Squash-Peanut Soup.  Experiment!  But if you wish a nonalcoholic beverage, drink apple cider.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2         medium  onions -- peeled, chopped
  1                cup  diced Cubanelle peppers or poblano chiles
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  pure ground chili powder
  2                     yellow summer squash - (abt 6" long) -- diced
  2               cups  fresh or frozen corn kernels
                        = (from 2 large ears)
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1 1/4            cup  cooked pinto beans
     1/2           cup  grated Monterrey Jack or cheddar cheese -- (optional)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Lime wedges -- for serving

Heat skillet over medium heat 1 to 2 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, wait about 30 seconds, then swirl to coat pan.

When hot enough to sizzle bread crumbs, add onion, chiles, salt and chili powder, then cook, stirring frequently, 5 minutes, or until vegetables become soft and onions turn slightly golden.

Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil, squash, corn, garlic and beans, and continue to cook, stirring gently to avoid breaking beans, about 5 minutes more, or until squash is just tender.  Remove pan from heat.

Sprinkle in grated cheese, if using, and stir to distribute as it melts.  Add black pepper.  Serve hot, warm or at room temperature with wedge of lime per serving.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Per Serving: 220 Cal; 6g Prot; 8g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 65g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 650mg  Sod.; 10g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Even for those whose business it is to make wine, sometimes beer is better.  Randall Grahm, proprietor and vitizen of Bonny Doon Vineyard in Santa Cruz, California, is attributed with the quote, "It takes a lot of good beer to make good wine."  Try Fordham Brewing Company Helles Lager.

Comments:  This flavorful dish makes a delightful luncheon entrÈe, a perfect partner for warmed flour tortillas.  To underscore the bold, Southwestern flavors, top the cooked squash with salsa and garnish with chopped fresh coriander.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     fresh poblano chiles
  4        tablespoons  orange juice
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
  1                     firm ripe avocado -- peeled, pitted,
                        and cubed
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh jalapeÒo - (to 2)
     1/3           cup  chopped scallions
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh coriander

                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  crumbled feta cheese

Preheat broiler.  Line large baking pan with aluminum foil.

Broil chiles, turning as needed, until skins blister and blacken, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool.

Pull off skins and discard.  Slit chiles lengthwise through one side and scoop out and discard seeds and veins, leaving stems intact.

In mixing bowl, combine orange and lime juices.  Place avocado cubes in bowl.  Add jalapeÒo, scallions, fresh coriander and pomegranate arils.  Stir, then season mixture with salt.

Place chiles on plates, slit-side up.  Spoon equal amounts of salad into each chile.  Sprinkle cheese over top and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 170 Cal; 4g Prot; 10g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 21g Carb.; 10mg  Chol; 115mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Smoky peppers and tangy pomegranate arils combine well with California's Pedroncelli's Vintage Selection Zinfandel Rose.

Description:
  "As this recipe illustrates, pomegranates can complement many kinds of foods -- and with these chiles they create an appealing appetizer for a fall or winter meal."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  carrots - (1 1/2 cups purÈe)
  12            ounces  silken tofu
  1 1/2           cups  ground roasted unsalted cashews - -- (10 oz whole)
     1/2           cup  rice or soy milk -- as needed
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  1              pound  tempeh -- cubed
  1              pound  Thai-flavored baked tofu -- cubed
  3             quarts  combo raw and cooked vegetables - (to 4) -- for dipping
                        = (such as bell peppers, celery,
                        radishes, broccoli pieces and sugar snap
                        peas, cut into serving size pieces)
  2                     loaves crisp bread -- cubed
  2              dozen  crisp bread sticks

Peel, slice and cook carrots until soft.  Drain, and purÈe in batches in blender until very smooth.

Add tofu, ground cashews and 1/4 cup rice milk to carrot mixture and process until blended; do this in batches, if necessary.  Add salt, pepper and remaining rice milk, and process again.  Add lime juice and mix well.  Set aside.

Heat oil in skillet and sautÈ tempeh until crisp and brown.  Set aside.  Repeat with baked tofu.  Keep warm until serving time or reheat in oven.

Before serving, place carrot-cashew mixture in saucepan and heat over medium until boiling.  Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Thin with more rice milk, if needed.

Transfer carrot-cashew mixture to fondue pot or crockpot.  Keep fondue warm over alcohol burner or in crockpot on lowest setting.  Serve with selection of accompaniments.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 200 Cal; 7g Prot; 13g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 16g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 610mg  Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  The German word "trocken" indicates dry wines and the word "sp‰tlese" indicates later-harvest, slightly sweet wines.  For this fondue: Hans Lang Weissburgunder Sp‰tlese Trocken.

Comments:  This beautifully colored fondue is best with large, fresh organic carrots because they have so much flavor.  You will find assorted flavors of baked tofu and tempeh from which to choose, so select your favorite.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (15 oz) -- chopped, and
                        juices reserved
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        = (or vegetable broth)
  3             medium  red potatoes - (1 lb)
  1              large  celery root - (abt 12 oz)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (to 3)
  1             medium  red onion -- quartered, and
                        sliced - (1 1/2 cups)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2              small  celery stalks -- chopped - (1 cup)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
                        = (or 1 tspn dried basil)

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Slice potatoes 1/4-inch thick.  Peel celery root; slice in quarters and then cut quarters into 1/4-inch slices.

Add salt to taste to boiling water, then add potatoes and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove potatoes to a bowl, then add celery root to boiling water and cook until just tender, about 4 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove celery root to bowl with potatoes.  Reserve cooking liquid.

In medium skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onion, garlic, celery and basil and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add wine, increase heat and cook to reduce wine by half, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Add tomatoes and their juices plus 1/2 cup of reserved cooking liquid.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Grease a 2-quart baking dish.  Ladle half of the tomato mixture in bottom of prepared pan.  Make a layer of alternating potato and celery root slices, season to taste with pepper.  Repeat, using remaining potato and celery root slices.  Cover with remaining tomato mixture.  Cover and bake until potatoes and celery root are tender, about 45 minutes.  Remove gratin from oven and let stand 10 minutes before serving.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 245 Cal; 5g Prot; 4g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 41g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 261mg  Sod.; 7g Fiber.

Comments:  This gratin is rich with aroma and flavor.  It's great for dinner served with a mixed greens salad topped with roasted red peppers and olives.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  pecan pieces
  1              large  orange - (10 to 12 oz)
  1                     bag fresh or frozen cranberries - (12 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  pure ground mild red chile - (to 1)
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar - (to 3/4)

Toast pecans in dry skillet over medium until warm and fragrant.  Place in bowl of food processor with chopping blade.

Zest orange and add peel to food processor.  Cut white pith from orange with small knife.  Discard pith and seeds, and cut orange into several chunks.

Add orange, cranberries, ground chile and 1/2 cup sugar to processor, and chop coarsely.  Taste and add more sugar as needed, but relish should be refreshingly tart.  Chill at least 30 minutes and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 130 Cal; 1g Prot; 5g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 22g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 0mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  Cranberries contribute bright color and tingling taste to any holiday spread.  Here they get a little extra zip from some ground red chile, preferably New Mexican, and more crunch from pecans that flourish in southern New Mexico.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed
  2 1/2           cups  Chardonnay
                        = (or other dry white wine)
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  water
  1              pound  GruyËre cheese -- shredded - (4 cups)
  1              pound  Emmenthaler cheese -- shredded - (4 cups)
  2        tablespoons  Kirsch -- (optional)
  1                     loaf French bread - (to 2) -- cubed
  1                     loaf unsliced pumpernickel -- cubed
  2              dozen  bread sticks

Rub inside of saucepan with garlic; repeat with fondue pot or crockpot.  Pour in wine and heat over low until it simmers.

Mix cornstarch with water, stirring to make paste, and stir into wine.  Increase heat to medium, and cook until wine mixture boils and begins to thicken, stirring often.  Reduce heat to low.

Combine cheeses and, using generous handfuls at a time, stir into wine until cheese melts.  Repeat, adding cheese and stirring until cheese is gone and mixture becomes smooth, about 10 minutes.

Stir in Kirsch, if using, and transfer melted cheese to fondue or crockpot and serve.  Keep fondue warm over alcohol burner or in crockpot on lowest setting.  Serve with accompaniments.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 510 Cal; 33g Prot; 34g Total Fat (21 Sat. Fat); 5g Carb.; 115mg  Chol; 340mg  Sod.; 0g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  When a recipe calls for wine as an ingredient, try cooking with the wine you will drink with the finished dish -- in this case, Chardonnay.  In addition to the bread, offer Chardonnay-friendly foods for dipping, such as mushrooms, squashes, roasted peppers and potatoes.

Description:
  "The Swiss traditionally cook this classic on the stovetop, then transfer the cheese to a heatproof pottery bowl on the table."

Wine Suggestions:  When a recipe calls for wine as an ingredient, try cooking with the wine you will drink with the finished dish -- in this case, Chardonnay.  In addition to the bread, offer Chardonnay-friendly foods for dipping, such as mushrooms, squashes, roasted peppers and potatoes.

The Swiss traditionally cook this classic on the stovetop, then transfer the cheese to a heatproof pottery bowl on the table.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  egg whites -- room temperature
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch -- plus
                        extra for dusting
     1/2      teaspoon  vinegar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === TOPPING ===
                        Heavy cream -- for whipping
  3               cups  mixed assorted fruit
                        = (such as sliced strawberries, kiwi and
                        whole raspberries and blueberries)

Preheat oven to 250 degrees.  Lightly grease baking sheet, then cover with parchment paper.  Dust parchment paper with cornstarch.

Reserve 1/3 cup sugar and sift together with cornstarch.  Using 8-inch-round cake pan, trace circle onto parchment paper.  Put egg whites into very clean and dry metal or copper bowl.  Using hand or stand mixer, whisk egg whites on medium speed until frothy.

Increase mixer speed and begin to gradually add sugar, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, reserving cornstarch-sugar mixture to add last.  Keep whisking as sugar is added.  When glossy and stiff, fold in vinegar and vanilla.

Mound egg whites high onto parchment paper and smooth to fill circle.  Bake 1 1/2 hours.  Exterior should be crunchy and light brown, but middle will remain soft.  Crack open oven door and cool completely.

Whip cream in chilled bowl, spread over meringue and top with assorted fruit 30 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 239 Cal; 3g Prot; 11g Total Fat (7 Sat. Fat); 33g Carb.; 40mg  Chol; 55mg  Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Comments:  Named after the Russian ballet star Anna Pavlova, this delicate dessert stars a puffy meringue, whipped cream and fresh fruit.  To bake, simply mound beaten whites high on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet sprinkled with cornstarch.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     fresh mild green Mexican (Anaheim) or
                        poblano chiles
  2        tablespoons  unrefined corn oil
                        = (or other vegetable oil)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              large  onion -- minced
  3               cups  corn kernels scraped from the cob
                        = (abt 6 medium fresh or frozen ears)
  3               cups  regular milk
                        = (or low-fat milk)
  12            ounces  russet baking potato - (to 14 oz) -- peeled, diced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt -- or more to taste
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
     1/4           cup  pepitas (shelled pumpkin seeds) -- dry-roasted

Roast and peel green chiles as described in sidebar.  Set aside.

To prepare chowder:  Heat oil and butter in large, heavy saucepan over medium.  Stir in onion, and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.  In blender, purÈe 1 cup corn with 1 cup milk.  Pour mixture into pan and add remaining milk with remaining corn, potato and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.

Reduce heat to medium-low and cook 15 to 20 minutes, or until potato is tender.  Adjust heat, if necessary, to keep soup from boiling.  Stir in cream and heat through.  Add more salt, if desired, and pepper.  Ladle into shallow bowls.  Top with green chiles.  Scatter pepitas over soup, if using.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 270 Cal; 6g Prot; 15g Total Fat (8 Sat. Fat); 29g Carb.; 40mg  Chol; 490mg  Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Corn plus potatoes plus smoked peppers plus dairy equals a Chardonnay every time.  With the chowder and the blue cornmeal muffins, select a full-bodied and oaky Chardonnay.

Comments:  Save the last of summer's ears of sweet corn in your freezer to make a version of this chowder for Thanksgiving Day.  Any corn on the cob will work, but the Silver Queen variety is favored.

                           Couscous With Fruit

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     box instant couscous - (7 to 9 oz)
     1/2           cup  raisins
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1              large  zucchini -- cubed
  1 1/3           cups  canned chickpeas -- drained, rinsed
  1                cup  fresh or frozen green peas
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  chopped pitted dates
  1                cup  cashews
     1/2           cup  minced parsley
                        Mint leaves -- for garnish

Using a large saucepan, cook grains with raisins according to package directions and with no added fat.

Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in skillet over medium heat and when hot, add garlic and sautÈ until golden.  Add cayenne, paprika and zucchini and sautÈ 7 to 10 minutes.  Stir in chickpeas and green peas, and season to taste.

Stir vegetable mixture into cooked couscous.  Spoon into large serving dish, making well in center.  Fill well with dates and cashews, and garnish dish with parsley and mint leaves.  Serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Servings: 530 Cal; 15g Prot; 19g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 80g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 370mg  Sod.; 9g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Zinfandel pairs well with intensely flavored dried fruits like tomatoes, figs and olives.  The addition to the couscous of paprika, zucchini and mild spice definitely beckons to Zinfandel.  Try a Rubus Amador County Old Vines Zinfandel for a perfect pairing.

Comments:  An adaptation of the Moroccan classic dish, this Americanized version melds sweet with savory and just a tinge of heat.  Part of its charm lies with its handsome presentation, which shows off its many textures and colors.  Feel free to make your own adaptations using golden raisins instead of black ones, and summer squash, fava beans or trimmed green beans for the zucchini and chickpeas.  This meal-in-one calls for accompaniments of toasted pita triangles and a spicy hot or chilled tea, plus something exotic for dessert, such as a wedge of baklava or a dish of rose-scented Persian ice cream.

Wine Suggestions:  Zinfandel pairs well with intensely flavored dried fruits like tomatoes, figs and olives.  The addition to the couscous of paprika, zucchini and mild spice definitely beckons to Zinfandel.  Try a Rubus Amador County Old Vines Zinfandel for a perfect pairing.

Comments:  An adaptation of the Moroccan classic dish, this Americanized version melds sweet with savory and just a tinge of heat.  Part of its charm lies with its handsome presentation, which shows off its many textures and colors.  Feel free to make your own adaptations using golden raisins instead of black ones, and summer squash, fava beans or trimmed green beans for the zucchini and chickpeas.  This meal-in-one calls for accompaniments of toasted pita triangles and a spicy hot or chilled tea, plus something exotic for dessert, such as a wedge of baklava or a dish of rose-scented Persian ice cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  uncooked cracked wheat bulgur
  2               cups  vegetable stock
  1              large  leek -- well rinsed,
                        and thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2         pound  shiitake or other wild mushrooms
  6             ounces  Italian-flavored baked tofu
  1               head  fennel -- trimmed, cored,
                        and thinly sliced, for garnish

Heat 2 tablespoons oil over high heat.  When hot, stir in cracked wheat.  Stir for 2 minutes until grains are coated with oil.  Add vegetable stock and stir until well blended.  Cover, reduce heat to medium, and cook for about 10 minutes.  Check, and if cooking too quickly, reduce heat to low and set lid askew.

Meanwhile, heat remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil in second skillet over medium heat.  When hot, sautÈ leek, garlic, mushrooms and tofu.  Cook until mushrooms lose liquid and soften, about 5 minutes.

Stir mushroom mixture into cracked wheat.  Place in serving bowl or on plates and garnish with sliced fennel.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Suggestions:  Depending on your ingredients, this pilaf could be full-bodied, so a fruit-driven Shiraz would be a good match.  If your stock is light, consider a leaner, French-style Pinot Noir with some aging.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY TOPPING ===
  1 2/3           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  8        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut small pieces
  4 1/2    tablespoons  ice-cold water
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onion - (1 large)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  4          teaspoons  curry powder
  5               cups  cauliflower florets - (1 head)
  1 1/2           cups  diced peeled all-purpose potato
  1                cup  frozen peas
  1 3/4           cups  vegetable broth
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  canned crushed tomatoes
                        = (or tomato puree)
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  2 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour

Make pastry:  In food processor, combine flour, sugar, salt and baking powder and pulse on/off until blended.  Add butter and pulse on/off until mixture resembles fine crumbs.  Add 3 tablespoons ice water.  Pulse on/off until mixture is evenly dampened.  Sprinkle with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons water and process until dough forms large crumbs and can be easily packed.

Transfer dough to work surface and form into ball.  Knead dough 2 or 3 times, then place on large sheet of plastic wrap.  Flatten into 3/4-inch thick disk.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour.

Lightly grease 10- or 11-inch deep-dish pie pan and set aside.

In 5-quart Dutch oven or flameproof casserole, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, 8 to 9 minutes.  Stir in garlic and curry powder, reduce heat to low and cook, stirring, 1 minute.

Add vegetables, broth and salt and stir to mix well.  Bring mixture to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 4 minutes; stir in tomatoes.

In small bowl, mix sour cream and flour until smooth.  Stir into vegetable mixture and simmer, uncovered, until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer vegetables to prepared pie pan and let cool 15 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  On sheet of lightly floured wax paper, roll pastry into circle just slightly larger than pie plate.  Invert pastry over pie pan, then peel off paper.  Tuck edges of pastry inside edge of pan.  Poke steam vents in pastry with knife.  Bake until pastry is golden, 50 to 60 minutes.  Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Categories    : Egg Free                        Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  cucumber -- peeled, chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
  1         tablespoon  chopped red onion
  2        tablespoons  plain low-fat yogurt
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  3             medium  fresh beets - (1 1/2 lbs)
                        Lettuce leaves -- for serving

In medium bowl, combine cucumber, dill, onion, yogurt and vinegar; mix well.  Cover and chill until ready to use.

Leave root and 1 inch of stem on beets; scrub with brush.  Place in medium saucepan and cover with water.  Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 45 minutes.  Drain and rinse with cold water.  Drain again and let cool.  Trim off roots and rub off skins.  Cut beets into 1/4-inch slices.

Arrange beets evenly on each of 4 lettuce-lined plates.  Top each serving with 1/4 cup cucumber mixture.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 93 Cal; 4g Prot; 1g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 20g Carb.; 1mg  Chol; 139mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Comments:  For an attractive presentation, use a combination of red and yellow beets in this dish.  Choose beets that are smooth and firm; small ones are generally sweeter.  If greens are still attached, they should look fresh, not wilted.  Cut green tops off one inch above the root.  Rinse and dry the greens well and enjoy them steamed or raw in salads.  Store beets up to one month in the refrigerator.

Transfer dough to work surface and form into ball.  Knead dough 2 or 3 times, then place on large sheet of plastic wrap.  Flatten into 3/4-inch thick disk.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Meanwhile, make filling.  Bring medium pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes, carrots, corn and peas; boil 5 minutes.  Drain vegetables and transfer to medium bowl.

In medium saucepan, melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter over medium heat.  Add onion and celery and cook, stirring often, until onion has softened, 8 to 9 minutes.  Stir in oil and flour and cook over low heat, stirring, 1 minute.  Stir in vegetable broth.  Increase heat to medium.  Cook, stirring, until mixture thickens, about 2 minutes.  Stir in milk and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Pour sauce over vegetables and stir to mix well.  Season with thyme and salt and pepper to taste.

Transfer vegetables to 9 1/2- or 10-inch deep-dish pie pan; smooth top.  Let cool 15 minutes.  On a sheet of lightly floured wax paper, roll pastry into circle just slightly larger than pie pan.  Invert pastry over pie pan and peel off paper.  Tuck edges of pastry inside edge of pan; poke several steam vents in crust with knife.  Bake until pastry is golden, 50 to 60 minutes.  Let stand briefly before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Description: This is like the one you remember from childhood, only without the chicken.  The baking powder in the pastry gives it a light, flaky top.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     shallot -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
                        Leaves from 10 sprigs parsley -- chopped
  1              pound  mixed dried heirloom beans -- cooked, drained
                        = (such as flageolets, scarlet runner
                        beans, cranberry beans, lima beans and
                        navy beans)
  3                     heirloom or any fresh tomatoes -- chopped
                        = (or equivalent of canned organic
                        tomatoes)
     1/2           cup  vegetable stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  truffle butter
  10                    basil leaves -- torn

Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Add shallot, garlic and parsley, and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.

Add beans and tomatoes.  Cook, stirring, until tomatoes cook down and become fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes.  Add water, and season to taste.  Stir in truffle butter and basil, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 310 Cal; 18g Prot; 5g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 50g Carb.; 5mg  Chol; 35mg  Sod.; 19g Fiber; 6g Sugar.

Wine Suggestions:  Three types of heirloom tomatoes may not be the major ingredients in this dish, but they do control its acidity and contribute to its overall mouth feel.  Pairing this seasonal stew with a wine that can meet the acid, such as Zinfandel or Chianti/Sangiovese, will make for a good match.

Comments:  This composition combines several varieties of old-fashioned legumes that make a colorful mix in the cookpot.  Several of the varieties may require different cooking times, so be sure to adjust your schedule accordingly so that all the beans are cooked through before you assemble the stew.  Look for truffle butter at gourmet food stores, or make your own by stirring truffle shavings into softened butter and setting it aside for several hours so the truffle flavor infuses the butter.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  chickpeas or 1 1/2 cups
                        cannellini beans -- soaked overnight
                        = (or combination of both)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- peeled, chopped
  2                     carrots -- peeled, chopped
  2                     celery ribs -- chopped
  4              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh sage
  2          teaspoons  marjoram
  2               cups  diced canned plum tomatoes
  8               cups  water or vegetable stock -- or as needed
     3/4           cup  uncooked farro
  2               cups  chopped cooked greens -- (optional)
  2          teaspoons  salt -- plus
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for garnish
                        Parmesan cheese -- for garnish

Pick over dried chickpeas and/or beans to remove any debris.  Rinse well and cover with water to soak overnight.  Drain, cover with 5 cups cold water again.  Bring to a boil, cook for about 5 minutes, turn off heat and let sit for an hour.  Drain.

Heat olive oil in large saucepan over medium heat, add chopped vegetables and herbs and sautÈ for 8 minutes.  Add chickpeas or beans, tomatoes, water or stock and 2 teaspoons salt, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, for about 1 hour, or until chickpeas or beans are tender.  Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper.  For creamier soup, purÈe 1 cup chickpea mixture and add back to pan.

Cook farro in separate saucepan in large quantity of boiling, salted water.  When al dente, drain and add to soup.  Add optional cooked greens.  Stir well, and simmer soup 15 minutes more.  Stir often to prevent scorching.  Ladle into soup bowls and top with olive oil, grated Parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Servings: 400 Cal; 14g Prot; 16g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 51g Carb.; 5mg  Chol; 230mg  Sod.; 14g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  The full-bodied texture of the chickpeas and farro pairs with a Cabernet Sauvignon.  Try Concha Y Toro Casillero del Diablo Cabernet Sauvignon.

Comments:  This farro-and-bean soup, or zuppa di farro, is a meatless -- and simpler -- version of the famous Abruzzese soup called "Le Virtu," a combination of assorted grains, vegetables and meats, plus farro or dried small pasta.  A meal-in-a-bowl, this can be prepared ahead of time.

To prepare farro, cook grains, covered, in 4 cups lightly salted water over medium-low heat.  Start checking for doneness after 15 minutes.  If not all the water has been absorbed, drain farro in a strainer and cool.  Kamut will take 45 to 50 minutes to soften.

Season with olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper.  Fold in diced red onion, chopped red pepper, celery or fennel, diced cucumbers, tomatoes and beans.  Add chopped parsley, basil or mint.  Garnish with chopped hard-boiled eggs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Servings: 440 Cal; 15g Prot; 18g Total Fat (3 Sat. Fat); 55g Carb.; 105mg  Chol; 1220mg  Sod.; 15g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Salads based on raw foods dressed with vinaigrette are best paired with Sauvignon Blanc.  To highlight the crisp freshness of the cucumber, bell pepper and tomato, try Casa Lapostelle Sauvignon Blanc.

Comments:  Cooked grains are ideal candidates for main course salads because they're filling and provide a neutral base for other livelier and more assertive ingredients.  Use either farro or Kamut in this salad and only the most flavorful tomatoes.  For a vegan version, omit the hard-boiled eggs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GARDEN ROLLS ===
  1 1/2         ounces  dried cellophane or
                        bean thread noodles - (to 2 oz)
  6                     rice paper wrappers
  6             pieces  red leaf lettuce -- rinsed, dried,
                        and stem end trimmed
  1                cup  shredded carrots
  1              bunch  fresh coriander -- rinsed
  4             ounces  Asian-seasoned baked tofu
  6                     thin scallions -- green ends slivered
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  crunchy peanut butter
  1         tablespoon  Asian chili paste -- or to taste

Soak noodles in boiling water to cover, about 7 minutes, or until softened.  Drain, rinse in cold water and drain again.  When cool, divide into 6 equal-sized portions.

Assemble ingredients in separate piles on work surface, cutting tofu into thin slices for total of 12 pieces.  Starting with first roll, quickly wet rice paper wrapper in warm water, and place flat on work surface.  Place 1 piece leaf lettuce on wrapper and layer on top shredded carrots, leafy sprigs fresh coriander, 2 strips tofu and 1 portion noodles.  Wrap up roll tightly, starting at nearest rounded edge, taking one turn.  Fold in left edge over filling, leaving right edge open.  Continue rolling wrapper tightly into neat packet.  Insert scallion into unwrapped edge of roll so green end protrudes like plume.  Repeat process with remaining ingredients.  Set aside rolls on serving platter, and cover with damp paper towels until ready to serve.

To mix dipping sauce, stir all ingredients until well mixed.  Place in serving dish, and pass with garden rolls.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Garden Rolls Per Serving: 314 Cal; 19g Prot; 7g Total Fat (1g Sat. Fat); 45g Carb; 0mg Chol; 340mg Sod; 6g Fiber

Dipping Sauce Per Serving: 200 Cal; 4g Prot; 6g Total Fat (1g Sat. Fat); 32g Carb; 0mg Chol; 1310mg Sod; 2g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Fragrant fresh herbs and greens, tender raw veggies, some sort of spiciness and a tofu product match well with Riesling.  Try this fabulous effort between a US winery and a German winemaker: Ch‚teau Ste. Michelle Eroica Dr. Loosen Riesling.

Comments:  Inspired by the delicious garden, or salad, rolls from Vietnam -- this Americanized version retains the concept but calls for a different approach, including the use of scallions instead of garlic chives, cellophane noodles instead of rice vermicelli and baked tofu instead of shrimp.  Serve the rolls with the classic Chinese cold sesame noodles, and finish up with fresh fruit and fortune cookies.  Of course, hot jasmine tea is perfect with dessert.

                        = (or 1 cup shredded peeled celery root)
  1             medium  yellow onion -- very thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley
     1/4           cup  soymilk or water
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

In large bowl, combine pastry flour, soy flour, if using, and baking powder.  Place shredded vegetables, onion and parsley in bowl, and toss with flour mixture to cover vegetables uniformly.  Add soymilk, salt and pepper, and mix thoroughly.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Spoon batter by heaping tablespoons into pan, taking care not to overcrowd.  Flatten with metal spatula to ensure even cooking.

Cook patties on one side until golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Turn over with metal spatula and cook other side for 3 more minutes.  Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with remaining mixture, and add more oil as needed.  Serve hot with Spiced Apple Topping (see recipe) and vegan sour cream.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Per Serving: 105 Cal; 3g Prot; 3g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 15g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 285mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber; 3g Sugar.

Comments:  A takeoff on the popular potato pancake, these luscious latkes bring together various flavorful vegetables sweetened by the Spiced Apple Topping (see recipe).  You can make these ahead, refrigerate and reheat later.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  dry white wine
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed
  2          teaspoons  dried basil
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  water
  2             pounds  shredded Italian cheeses
  2        tablespoons  minced sun-dried tomatoes -- (optional)
  1                     loaf crisp Italian bread
  2              dozen  bread sticks
  3             quarts  combo raw and steamed vegetables - (to 4)
                        = (such as baby carrots, bell pepper
                        strips, asparagus, broccoli and cherry
                        tomatoes, cut into serving size)

Pour wine into saucepan and heat over low until simmering.  Add garlic, basil, oregano and crushed red pepper, and cook for 2 minutes more.

Mix cornstarch with water, stirring to make paste, and stir into wine.  Increase heat to medium and cook until mixture boils and thickens.  Reduce heat to low.

Combine cheeses and, using generous handfuls at a time, stir into wine until cheese melts.  Repeat, adding cheese and stirring until cheese is gone and mixture becomes smooth, about 3 minutes.  Stir in sun-dried tomatoes.

Transfer cheese mixture to fondue pot or crockpot and serve.  Keep fondue warm over alcohol burner or in crockpot on lowest setting.  Serve with accompaniments.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 430 Cal; 26g Prot; 29g Total Fat (18 Sat. Fat); 10g Carb.; 90mg  Chol; 850mg  Sod.; 0g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  This fondue is an interpretation of the classic Italian salad of mozzarella, fresh basil and tomato.  But with a possible blend of so many disparate cheeses in differing quantities, a low-acid, fruit-forward white wine such as a Riesling will be most pleasant here.

Comments:  Supermarkets offer busy fondue cooks many shortcuts: a variety of bagged, preshredded cheeses; prepped vegetables; and packaged bread sticks, so dinner can be on the table in 15 minutes.  If you have plenty of time to spare, shred your own cheeses -- a mixture of mozzarella, Fontina, provolone, Romano, Parmesan or Asiago cheeses for a total of eight cups.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  water or vegetable stock
  1 3/4           cups  flavorful ale
  1              large  potato -- cubed, unpeeled
  1              large  onion -- peeled, diced
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  8             ounces  meatless soy sausage -- crumbled
  1              bunch  kale - (abt 1 lb) -- finely julienned
  1 1/2           cups  canned lentils -- drained, rinsed
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red peppers
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring water and ale to a boil in large stockpot over medium heat.  Add potato cubes and onions.

Heat oil in skillet over medium heat and brown garlic.  Reduce heat to medium-low, add crumbled sausage and sautÈ about 7 minutes, or until browned.  Or cook according to package directions.

Meanwhile, when potatoes are partially tender, add kale and lentils, stirring well.  Season with crushed red pepper, salt and pepper.

When sausage is browned, stir into soup.  Cook 5 minutes more and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 530 Cal; 31g Prot; 8g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 80g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 330mg  Sod.; 21g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Successful food and drink pairings can be strengthened by incorporating the drinking beverage into the cooking process.  In other words, drink what you cook with.  Following the recipe, a flavorful ale is called for, so try the Mendocino Brewing Company Red Tail Ale.

Comments:  Putting an American spin on the Portuguese soup Caldo Verde, this version calls for a dash of flavor-boosting crushed red peppers.  The meatless sausage substitutes for the traditional Portuguese chouriÁo sausage.  For another level of flavor, start off with vegetable stock instead of water.  The best accompaniments for this entrÈe soup: hot onion or garlic bread and plenty of strong, black coffee.  Stewed fruit sparked with cinnamon or a smooth flan would make a fitting conclusion.

  3              large  red onions -- sliced thin
  2          teaspoons  granulated sugar -- (optional)
  1 1/2           cups  uncooked kamut, spelt or farro
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        Chopped parsley for garnish -- (optional)

Rinse lentils, place in saucepan and cover by 2 inches with salt water.  Bring to a boil.  Cover pan, reduce heat to low and cook until lentils are tender but not soft, about 20 minutes.

To make caramelized onions:  Heat butter and oil in large sautÈ pan or skillet, and sautÈ onions and sugar if using, stirring often, until deep golden brown, about 30 minutes.  When almost done, season with salt, pepper, cinnamon and cumin.  Stir well.  Drain on paper towels to crisp.

Cook grain in 4 cups salted water until al dente, 15 to 45 minutes, depending upon grain.  Drain well.  Add to lentils and toss to combine.  Heat through, making certain that all liquids have been absorbed.  Stir in half the onions.  Season to taste.  Top with remaining onions.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Servings: 410 Cal; 14g Prot; 14g Total Fat (4 Sat. Fat); 59g Carb.; 15mg  Chol; 65mg  Sod.; 17g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Pinot Noir, Syrah and RosÈ wines would all pair nicely with this dish because of the lentils, sweetness of the onions and the aromatics.  Try Chateau Mas Neuf Costieres de Nimes.

Comments:  This recipe is related to those famous Middle Eastern pilafs in which lentils are combined with a cooked grain and caramelized onions: Made with rice, it's called mujaddara, with bulgur, it's imjadra.  But you can make a fine variation with Kamut, spelt or farro.  Green lentils are best because they hold their shape, as will black "beluga" lentils.  The onions must be caramelized but not burned -- red onions work best because they have more sugar.

  1 1/4           cups  sweet potato purÈe
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
                        === TOPPING ===
  1                cup  sour cream

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease 10-inch springform pan and set aside.

To make filling:  Reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees.  Beat cream cheese and sugars in bowl until creamy.  Add egg and egg yolk and beat well.  Beat in sweet potato purÈe, cinnamon and cloves.  Turn mixture into cooled crust and bake for 1 1/2 hours or until set.  Remove from oven and increase heat to 350 degrees.

Wine Suggestions:  Serving wine with dessert is a wonderful way to heighten the end of the meal.  This cheesecake's earthy, aromatic flavors will pair well with port.  Try Yalumbe Museum Release Antique Reserve Tawny Port.

Comments:  You may replace the maple sugar with light brown sugar and substitute vanilla extract for the maple extract.

                       Mediterranean Ragout Pot Pie

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dairy Free                      Egg Free
                Main Dish                       Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- peeled, halved,
                        and sliced - (2 cups)
  1              large  green pepper -- seeded, and
                        cit into strips - (1 cup)
  1             medium  eggplant -- cut 1" cubes
  1             medium  zucchini -- cut 1" cubes
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2               cups  canned crushed tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried basil
  1                can  artichoke hearts - (14 oz) -- drained, quartered
     1/2           cup  chopped olives - (2 1/4 oz)
  8                     sheets phyllo dough -- cut slightly
                        larger than your pan

In large saucepan, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil over medium heat.  Add onion and pepper and cook, stirring often, until onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes.  Stir in eggplant, zucchini, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and cook, stirring once or twice, until eggplant has softened, about 7 minutes.  Stir in tomatoes, parsley and basil.  Cover and simmer 5 minutes; remove pan from heat.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Grease shallow 2-quart casserole.  Spread artichoke hearts over bottom of prepared casserole; sprinkle with olives.  Spoon vegetable mixture into casserole and smooth top.

Place one sheet of phyllo over vegetables.  Brush thoroughly with some of the remaining oil and tuck edges of phyllo inside edge of pan.  Repeat with remaining sheets of phyllo, brushing and tucking each one.  Poke several steam vents in top of pie with paring knife.  Bake until topping is golden brown, about 35 minutes.  Let cool no more than 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 200 Cal; 4g Prot; 10g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 26g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 295mg  Sod.; 6g Fiber.

Comments:  The phyllo dough on this ratatouille-like ragout gives it a light, crisp topping.  Cool 10 minutes before servingñbut not much longer as the heat from below will wilt the phyllo.  If you care to use cheese, sprinkle some freshly grated Parmesan over the filling before you add the first layer of phyllo.

In large saucepan, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil over medium heat.  Add onion and pepper and cook, stirring often, until onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes.  Stir in eggplant, zucchini, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and cook, stirring once or twice, until eggplant has softened, about 7 minutes.  Stir in tomatoes, parsley and basil.  Cover and simmer 5 minutes; remove pan from heat.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Grease shallow 2-quart casserole.  Spread artichoke hearts over bottom of prepared casserole; sprinkle with olives.  Spoon vegetable mixture into casserole and smooth top.

Place one sheet of phyllo over vegetables.  Brush thoroughly with some of the remaining oil and tuck edges of phyllo inside edge of pan.  Repeat with remaining sheets of phyllo, brushing and tucking each one.  Poke several steam vents in top of pie with paring knife.  Bake until topping is golden brown, about 35 minutes.  Let cool no more than 10 minutes before serving.

Comments:  The phyllo dough on this ratatouille-like ragout gives it a light, crisp topping.  Cool 10 minutes before servingñbut not much longer as the heat from below will wilt the phyllo.  If you care to use cheese, sprinkle some freshly grated Parmesan over the filling before you add the first layer of phyllo.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SWEET POTATOES ===
  3              large  sweet potatoes
     1/4           cup  orange juice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- (optional)
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === VEGETABLE FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     onions -- peeled, diced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, diced
  1              pound  soy burger meat -- crumbled
                        = (or 4 vegan burgers)
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Saffron strands -- (optional)
  4                     tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
                        = (or 3 1/4 cups diced canned tomatoes)
  1                cup  vegetable stock
  1               head  cauliflower
  1              large  or 2 small zucchini -- cut 1" cubes
                        = (or other squash)
  1               head  broccoli -- cut bite size
     1/8           cup  raisins -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  slivered almonds
                        === WHITE POTATOES ===
  3             pounds  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" to 2" chunks
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil ovenproof 10- by 15-inch baking dish.

Bake sweet potatoes until soft, about 1 hour.  Remove from oven; set aside to cool.  When cool enough to handle, peel and mash with orange juice, spices and olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper.

To make vegetable filling:  Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  When hot, add onions, garlic, carrots, soy meat and spices.  Cook mixture for about 7 minutes, or until soy meat is browned and crusty but not burnt.

Reduce heat to medium, and add tomatoes, stock and cauliflower.  When mixture is warmed through, add zucchini, broccoli, raisins and almonds.  If needed, heat mixture in two batches.  Transfer mixture to baking dish.  Cover loosely with foil, and bake for 30 to 45 minutes.

To make white potatoes:  Combine potatoes and salt in large pot with water to cover by 3 inches.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and cook potatoes for 10 minutes more, or until tender.  Remove from heat and drain potatoes, reserving 2 cups of cooking liquid.  Mash potatoes with olive oil, then slowly add 1 cup cooking liquid, or enough to give potatoes a moist, fluffy consistency.  Season with salt and pepper.

Fill two large pastry bags, one with mashed white potatoes and one with mashed sweet potatoes.  Remove baking dish from oven.  Pipe decorative design on top of pie, alternating colors for drama.

Return casserole to oven for 15 minutes or until potatoes are heated through.  Just before serving, place under broiler, and cook until crust is lightly browned.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Per Serving: 290 Cal; 10g Prot; 9g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 48g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 600mg  Sod.; 9g Fiber; 13g Sugar.

Wine Suggestions:  North African cuisine is distinguished by many characteristics of Mediterranean cuisine, with a heavier emphasis on aromatic spices, nuts and dried fruits.  This dish is a perfect example.  An off-dry, fruity Riesling would pair well.

Description:
  "This dish takes its flavors from traditional Mediterranean vegetable tagines, but seals them in a festive crust fashioned from mashed white and sweet potatoes squeezed through a chef's piping bag or spooned on artistically in alternating rows."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  whole cumin seeds
  2          teaspoons  whole coriander seeds
  1           teaspoon  whole fennel seeds
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

In heavy, dry skillet over medium-high heat, toast cumin, coriander and fennel seeds until fragrant, about 3 minutes.  (Be careful not to burn spices.)  Immediately transfer seeds to spice grinder (an inexpensive coffee grinder will do) or mortar and pestle and grind with cinnamon, ginger and red pepper flakes.

Return spices to skillet.  Add oil and heat just until oil is warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes.  Strain oil through a fine-meshed strainer lined with cheesecloth and store in tightly closed jar.

This recipe yields about 1/4 cup.

Description:
  "Just a drizzle of this spicy oil added to beans, grains or vegetables will turn them into exciting fare."

In heavy, dry skillet over medium-high heat, toast cumin, coriander and fennel seeds until fragrant, about 3 minutes.  (Be careful not to burn spices.)  Immediately transfer seeds to spice grinder (an inexpensive coffee grinder will do) or mortar and pestle and grind with cinnamon, ginger and red pepper flakes.

Return spices to skillet.  Add oil and heat just until oil is warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes.  Strain oil through a fine-meshed strainer lined with cheesecloth and store in tightly closed jar.

  2          teaspoons  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
  1                can  diced tomatoes with green chiles - (14 oz)
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1                can  navy beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  1                can  pinto beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1                     scallion, white and light green part -- cut 1/2" pieces
                        Cilantro -- for garnish

Comments:   While stew is simmering, make some quick-cooking brown rice.  Saute broccoli florets with garlic.  Top chili with a dollop of salsa.  If you like your chili extra picante, drizzle in a few drops of hot sauce or chili puree at the end.  Feel free to substitute your favorite combination of mushrooms for the ones listed here.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Omelets                         Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  sliced portobello mushrooms
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              bunch  greens
                        = (such as watercress, dandelion or
                        arugula)
  6              large  eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red peppers -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  grated fontina cheese

Wipe sliced mushroom caps with damp towel and scrape off and discard black gills from underneath caps.  Heat large skillet and, when hot, add 2 tablespoons oil.  SautÈ portobello slices, cooking until slightly soft but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove from heat and set aside.

Rinse greens well, shake off excess water and chop into small, uniform pieces.

Beat 6 eggs in large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste and crushed red pepper, if using.  Fold in grated cheese and chopped greens.

Heat remaining oil in skillet.  When hot, pour in eggs, cooking until bottom sets, tipping skillet so uncooked eggs run to the pan.  When egg mixture is firm and bottom golden, heap portobello slices on one side of omelet and flip other side over top to cover.  Slide onto serving plate or slice in skillet and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Per Serving: 580 Cal; 33g Prot; 45g Total Fat (13 Sat. Fat); 12g Carb.; 665mg  Chol; 460mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  If you are serving this omelet for dinner, accompany it with a still Chardonnay such as Hogue Columbia Valley Chardonnay.  If you're serving it for brunch, accompany it with a Chardonnay-based sparkling wine such as Pol Roger Non-Vintage Brut.

Comments:  This is a basic, simple family brunch or lunch main dish that welcomes a side salad and toasted onion bagels.  As with any omelet, you can vary the filling to suit the occasion, substituting fried potato cubes for the mushrooms and a generous sprinkling of minced parsley for the greens.  Or you can give this dish an Asian flavor by using fresh coriander with the eggs and stir-fried bean sprouts accented by soy sauce for the filling.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  paper-thin strips red onion
     1/2           cup  lemon juice
  6              large  Valencia oranges - (abt 4 lbs)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  Pomegranate Vinegar -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  diced pared cucumber - (1 med)
  1                cup  pomegranate arils
  4             ounces  black oil-cured olives - (abt 1 cup)
                        = (preferably Moroccan)
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped mint

About 1 hour before making salad, place onion slices in bowl and marinate in lemon juice.  Peel oranges and cut into thin, round slices with very sharp knife.  Cut rounds in half and pick out seeds.

Place oranges in large work bowl, drain onion of all excess liquid and add onion to oranges.  Sprinkle mixture with pepper.  Combine oil and vinegar to make the vinaigrette.

Pour over oranges, cover and set aside in cool place to infuse for 30 minutes.

Add cucumber, pomegranate arils and olives.  Adjust seasoning, then scatter mint over top and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 220 Cal; 3g Prot; 11g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 31g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 125mg  Sod.; 6g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  RosÈ and blush wines, such as American white Zinfandels, are a good beverage choice when pairing with foods that are fruity, acidic, spicy and complex, such as this salad.

Comments:  The inspiration for this salad is North Africa, where pomegranates are used in a variety of creative ways.  The salad's secret is its startling interplay of flavors: the tartness of the fruit, the onion -- the infusion of the onion is an important step, so do not skip it -- and most importantly, the saltiness of the olives.  The lemon removes the sharpness of the raw onion and colors it pink, an important visual note in the salad's appearance.

                   Oven-Dried Tomatoes And Olive Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  Roma tomatoes - (to 5)
                        Olive oil -- for drizzling
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 275 degrees.

Remove stems and slice tomatoes in half lengthwise.  Gently squeeze out seeds with fingers.  Place cut-side up on baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil and season to taste.

Bake for 3 to 4 hours, or until slightly shriveled and softened.  Remove from oven, place in large jar, cover with olive oil, seal jar and refrigerate for up to 3 weeks time.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 80 Cal; 1g Prot; 5g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 7g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 15mg  Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Kalamata olives call for a light Zinfandel and oil- or dry-cured olives, a Cabernet Sauvignon.

Comments:  This simple recipe calls for oven-drying tomatoes, preferably the meaty Roma variety.  After drying and marinating in olive oil, these can become the basis for many dishes calling for tomatoes.  Select the desired amount as the basis for this salad, garnish with olives such as NiÁoise, Kalamata or oil-cured varieties, lemon zest and a sprinkling of fresh herbs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  potatoes -- unpeeled, cubed
                        = (preferably Peruvian blue potatoes)
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2             medium  onions -- peeled, chopped
  1                cup  minced Cubanelle peppers or poblano chiles
  1                     red bell pepper -- chopped
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic - (to 2)
     3/4           cup  grated Monterrey Jack or
                        cheddar cheese - (packed) -- optional
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1                cup  lightly-toasted peanuts -- coarsely chopped
                        Minced fresh coriander or parsley
                        Lemon wedges -- for squeezing

Place potatoes in large saucepan, add water to cover and bring to boil.  Cook until just tender, 10 to 12 minutes, then drain and set aside.

Heat large skillet over medium heat.  When hot, add 2 tablespoons olive oil, wait about 10 seconds, then swirl to coat pan.  Add half of cooked potatoes, spreading them into single layer.  Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

After 5 minutes, sprinkle in about 1/8 teaspoon salt and turn potatoes over.  Spread into single layer again and cook another 5 minutes.  Cook 1 to 2 minutes more, then transfer to plate.  Repeat procedure with remaining potatoes, using 2 tablespoons oil and another 1/8 teaspoon salt or to taste.

After cooking potatoes, wipe pan with damp paper towel.  Return pan to heat and, when hot, add remaining oil.  Wait 10 seconds, then swirl to coat pan.

Add onions and sautÈ over medium heat for 5 to 8 minutes, or until golden.  Add chiles, bell peppers and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Continue to cook, stirring often, for another 5 minutes.

Return potatoes to pan with garlic and stir into onion mixture.  Cook over medium heat for 2 minutes more.  Sprinkle in lemon juice during last few minutes of cooking.

Serve hot or warm, topped with peanuts and minced fresh coriander or parsley.  Tuck in lemon wedges alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Suggestions:  Dishes featuring potatoes, butter, garlic, peppers or mild chiles and cheese, if you decide to use it, will pair well with Chardonnay.  Try changing the garnishes on this dish to filberts and basil for even better alignment with Chardonnay.  Once again, consider something as take-charge as the Fetzer Vineyards Barrel Select Chardonnay.  If you want a change of pace from wine for this dish, you may want to consider such chilled fruit juices as guava, passion fruit or mango.  And for a final flourish, consider hot, spiced tea or hot cocoa whipped with heavy cream.

Comments:  This dish features a traditional Peruvian combination of potatoes and peanuts and will be even more authentic if you make it with Peruvian blue potatoes, available in farmers' markets and in some grocery stores.  Other types of potatoes will also work.

Wine Suggestions:  Dishes featuring potatoes, butter, garlic, peppers or mild chiles and cheese, if you decide to use it, will pair well with Chardonnay.  Try changing the garnishes on this dish to filberts and basil for even better alignment with Chardonnay.  Once again, consider something as take-charge as the Fetzer Vineyards Barrel Select Chardonnay.  If you want a change of pace from wine for this dish, you may want to consider such chilled fruit juices as guava, passion fruit or mango.  And for a final flourish, consider hot, spiced tea or hot cocoa whipped with heavy cream.

Comments:  This dish features a traditional Peruvian combination of potatoes and peanuts and will be even more authentic if you make it with Peruvian blue potatoes, available in farmers&apos; markets and in some grocery stores.  Other types of potatoes will also work.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  graham cracker crumbs
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
                        === FILLING ===
  2                     containers whipped cream cheese - (8 oz ea
  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-grated orange zest
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  3        tablespoons  pomegranate juice -- plus
     1/2           cup  pomegranate juice
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1 1/2           cups  pomegranate arils

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

To make Crust:  In 9 1/2-inch springform pan, place crust ingredients and blend until combined well.  Press mixture over bottom and up sides.

To make Filling:  In large mixing bowl, beat filling ingredients on high until fluffy, about 5 minutes.  Pour filling into crust, and bake in middle of oven for 20 minutes, or until cheesecake just sets in center; it continues to firm while cooling.  Transfer cake to rack and cool, about 3 hours.

To make Topping:  Dissolve cornstarch in 3 tablespoons pomegranate juice.  Heat remaining pomegranate juice and sugar over medium and bring to a boil.  Stir in cornstarch mixture and heat, stirring constantly, over medium until liquid thickens.  Stir in pomegranate arils.  Pour mixture into bowl and set inside larger bowl filled with ice and cold water.  Stir until cool.  Spread over top of chilled cheesecake.  Chill at least 2 hours.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 420 Cal; 6g Prot; 28g Total Fat (16 Sat. Fat); 38g Carb.; 160mg  Chol; 320mg  Sod.; 0g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  For creamy, fruity desserts, consider drinking a late-harvest Riesling.  The wines are labeled Auslese, Beerenauslese and Eiswein.  Try the magic from German winemaker Egon M¸ller.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         large  onion -- peeled, minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     fresh serrano chiles -- seeded, minced
  2        tablespoons  fresh coriander leaves
                        Juice from 1 lime
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  ripe avocados -- peeled, pitted
  1         tablespoon  pomegranate juice
  3        tablespoons  pomegranate arils

Combine onion, garlic, chiles and coriander leaves in mixing bowl.  Add lime juice and salt, and set aside.

Place avocados in another bowl and mash with fork, slowly adding pomegranate juice.  Fold in onion mixture, keeping texture coarse.  Gently fold in pomegranate arils and serve immediately, or place avocado pits on top of guacamole to keep it from darkening, cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 130 Cal; 2g Prot; 10g Total Fat (1 Sat. Fat); 10g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 200mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  The buttery texture of the avocados paired with corn chips and a bit of spice call for a Chardonnay that is not too dry or too acidic.  Try Tryptic Colombia Valley Chardonnay.

Comments:  This unusual dish makes an eye-catching appetizer or salad for a casual meal infused with Southwestern flavors.  Serve with warm corn or flour tortillas or a colorful assortment of red, blue and yellow corn chips.

Per Serving: 390 Cal; 12g Prot; 20g Total Fat (4 Sat. Fat); 49g Carb.; 160mg  Chol; 580mg  Sod.; 11g Fiber; 8g Sugar.

Wine Suggestions:  Chile has made great headway in the wine world, and many of its wines today are very good.  With this savory pudding, try Condor Barrel Fermented Chardonnay.

Comments:  This robust and colorful entrÈe captures Southwestern flavors in a fall main course that calls for warm fresh flour or corn tortillas, a light tossed salad with avocados and a dessert of cinnamon or caramel ice cream.  Baked taco chips are healthy options because they do not require fat for deep-frying.  Plan to use one or all of the topping choices to bolster the pudding's subtle flavors.

         Roasted Beets With Baby Arugula And Crottin De Chavignol

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    baby beets -- scrubbed
  2                     Crottin de Chavignol rounds -- (see comments)
  2            bunches  baby arugula -- well rinsed
     1/4           cup  toasted walnut halves
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
                        White balsamic vinegar -- for drizzling

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Trim beet greens to 1/4 inch above beets.  Place beets in large baking pan and cover bottom of pan with about 1/4 inch water.  Cover pan tightly with foil, and bake beets until tender, or 30 to 45 minutes.

Remove from oven, and allow beets to cool.  Slice off stem ends and, holding beets with a damp towel, slip off skins.  Quarter beets, and set aside.

Cut cheese rounds in half crosswise to form two disks each.  Place cheese on baking pan, and heat under broiler until warm.  Remove from heat.

Line serving dish with arugula, and arrange beets on top.  Arrange cheese disks over beets, and sprinkle on nuts.  Drizzle with olive oil and vinegar, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 270 Cal; 12g Prot; 14g Total Fat (7 Sat. Fat); 27g Carb.; 40mg  Chol; 680mg  Sod.; 8g Fiber; 16g Sugar.

Wine Suggestions:  Some foods that pair well with Pinot Noir are beets, goat cheeses -- including feta and other assertive cheeses -- bitter greens and walnuts, all of which are in this salad.  Try Duck Pond Willamette Valley Estate Grown Pinot Noir.

Comments:  Be sure to use the special French goat cheese called for, which is noted for its full flavor and unusual shape.  You may also use another high-quality goat cheese.  If you cannot find baby beets, select the smallest ones available in your marketplace.

                       Roasted Morels With Shallots

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dairy Free                      Egg Free
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         pound  morels
  3                     shallots - (to 4)
                        = (or 2 medium onions, peeled and
                        cut into wedges)
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly grease roasting pan with 1 teaspoon olive oil.

Gently wipe morels with damp cloth to remove grit and slice off most of stem.  Halve mushrooms lengthwise and arrange cut sides down in roasting pan.

Arrange shallots around or over mushrooms.  Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with remaining olive oil.  Roast for 10 to 15 minutes, or until mushrooms are fragrant and softened.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Per Serving: 60 Cal; 1g Prot; 4g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 3g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 0mg  Sod.; 0g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Earthy mushrooms pair well with Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.  Pairing the mushrooms with potatoes and some extra butter -- or cream if making them into a soup -- tips the scales toward Chardonnay.  Try Michel Delorme Pouilly-Fuisse Le Vieille Vigne de la Marechaude.

Comments:  Most cookbooks suggest cooking morels -- relatives of the prized truffle and gourmets' delight -- in cream to bring out their heavenly flavor, but oven-roasting does even more for them.  Delicious as a topping for rice or mashed potatoes, you can also make it into a divine soup by purÈeing it in a blender with hot water and some half-and-half.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly grease roasting pan with 1 teaspoon olive oil.

<DirT>
Gently wipe morels with damp cloth to remove grit and slice off most of stem.  Halve mushrooms lengthwise and arrange cut sides down in roasting pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange shallots around or over mushrooms.  Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with remaining olive oil.  Roast for 10 to 15 minutes, or until mushrooms are fragrant and softened.  Serve immediately.

Wine Suggestions:  Earthy mushrooms pair well with Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.  Pairing the mushrooms with potatoes and some extra butter -- or cream if making them into a soup -- tips the scales toward Chardonnay.  Try Michel Delorme Pouilly-Fuisse Le Vieille Vigne de la Marechaude.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Most cookbooks suggest cooking morels -- relatives of the prized truffle and gourmets&apos; delight -- in cream to bring out their heavenly flavor, but oven-roasting does even more for them.  Delicious as a topping for rice or mashed potatoes, you can also make it into a divine soup by purÈeing it in a blender with hot water and some half-and-half.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  low-fat milk
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  diced onions
     1/4           cup  diced red peppers
     1/2           cup  peas
  2              large  white mushrooms -- rinsed, and
                        grit removed
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  freshly grated Jarlsberg cheese
                        = (or other low-fat Swiss-style cheese)
  1             Sprigs  fresh thyme or chives -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in 5- or 6-inch-round baking dish preheated in oven.  Meanwhile, beat together eggs, milk and flour until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  When butter is melted, pour egg mixture into baking dish and place in oven.

Heat 1 teaspoon butter in skillet over medium heat.  When hot, sautÈ onions until translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add red peppers and peas, and cook 2 minutes more.  Remove mixture from heat and set aside.

Thinly slice mushroom caps and stems.  Heat remaining 2 teaspoons butter in skillet over medium heat.  When hot, sautÈ mushrooms 5 minutes, or until browned.  Add wine and cheese, return onion mixture to skillet, season with salt and pepper and cook 2 to 3 minutes more.

Bake pancake for 15 minutes.  When puffed and golden, remove from oven, heap savory mixture into center, garnish with fresh thyme or chives and serve -- pancake may deflate slightly as it cools.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Per Serving: 980 Cal; 42g Prot; 65g Total Fat (37 Sat. Fat); 49g Carb.; 580mg  Chol; 410mg  Sod.; 7g Fiber; 15g Sugar.

Wine Suggestions:  For many people, the ideal alcoholic beverage for brunch is a bubbly sparkling wine.  When mixed with fresh orange juice and a splash of orange-flavored liqueur such as Triple Sec, it's called a Mimosa.  Plain or mixed, a moderately-priced bubbly would pair well with these pancakes.  Try Australia's Seaview Brut.

Description:
  "This showy, oven-baked pancake, often referred to as a "Dutch Baby," makes a complete meal-in-one, and calls only for fresh fruit and cheese as accompaniments."

Add cheese and, using generous handfuls at a time, stir into beer until cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes.  Repeat until cheese is gone.  Stir in green chiles.

Transfer cheese mixture to fondue pot or crockpot.  Keep fondue warm over alcohol burner or in crockpot over lowest setting.  Serve with accompaniments.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 560 Cal; 31g Prot; 41g Total Fat (21 Sat. Fat); 13g Carb.; 120mg  Chol; 690mg  Sod.; 0g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Cook with beer?  Drink beer?  Dos Equis beer is a fine Mexican product available in a light Special lager and a medium-bodied Vienna-style Amber lager.  If you want to try other Mexican beers, look for such labels as Superior, Negra Modelo -- they also brew Corona -- PacÌfico, Carta Blanca and Tecate.

Comments:  Flavorful Pepper Jack cheese needs little help to make it taste wonderful.  The pickled jalapeÒos may be eaten as a relish or dipped in the fondue and are especially suited to those who like fiery foods.  Use fresh corn or flour tortillas, if available, and at serving time, place tortilla wedges in baskets lined with a damp napkin or dish towel.  Warm in the microwave for 20 seconds and set out smaller baskets filled with tortilla chips.  For festive color, garnish fondue with chopped red peppers.

  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1 1/2         pounds  soy cheese -- shredded
  1                     loaf rye bread -- cubed
  1                     loaf seven-grain bread -- cubed
  3             quarts  combo raw and cooked vegetables - (to 4) -- for dipping
                        = (such as carrot sticks, bell peppers,
                        celery, radishes, baby carrots, broccoli
                        pieces and sugar snap peas, cut into

Heat oil in skillet and sautÈ tempeh until crisp and brown.  Remove from heat and set aside.  Repeat with baked tofu.  Keep warm until serving time, or reheat in oven.

Mix cornstarch into 1/4 cup wine or rice milk.  Place remaining liquid in saucepan, whisk in cornstarch mixture and heat over medium.  Bring to a boil, and add garlic, salt, cayenne, pepper and lemon juice.  Return to a boil, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.

Add cheese and, using generous handfuls at a time, stir into wine until cheese melts, about 6 minutes.  Repeat until cheese is gone.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 130 Cal; 4g Prot; 1g Total Fat (0 Sat. Fat); 8g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 390mg  Sod.; 0g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Wines with low acid, a bit of sweetness and preferably no barrel-aging are matches for mild cheeses.  Kabinett or Sp‰tlese Rieslings fit: Try Selbach-Oster Zeltinger Schlossberg.

Comments:  You may use any soy cheese for this fondue, but different brands melt differently and some may not melt completely.  Soy cheeses also come in varying flavors, so choose your preference.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CARAMEL ==
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        === CUSTARD ===
  2               cups  purÈed pumpkin
  2               cups  half-and-half
  5              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  3        tablespoons  dark rum
                        = (or 2 tspns vanilla extract)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        === GARNISH ===
  3        tablespoons  pine nuts - (to 4) -- lightly toasted
                        Chunky Fresh Cranberry Relish -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Place eight 8-ounce custard cups or ramekins in roomy baking pan, without crowding.

To prepare Caramel:  Place sugar in small heavy saucepan or skillet.  Heat over low, watching carefully as sugar melts into golden-brown syrup.  Do not stir unless sugar is melting unevenly.  When sugar turns medium brown, immediately remove pan from heat, and carefully pour about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon melted sugar into bottom of each cup.  Sugar syrup firms up almost immediately, so work fast.

To make Custard:  Combine all custard ingredients in large saucepan and heat over medium-low.  Whisk about 1 minute, until mixture is well blended and starts to froth around rim.  Remove from heat when mixture is warm throughout.  Do not boil.

Divide mixture evenly among cups nearly to rims.  Pour warm water into pan around cups, enough to cover bottom one-third of cups; refill if needed.  Bake for 1 hour and 45 minutes, until custard is firm and slightly raised.  Remove cups from oven and water bath.  Cool at room temperature for about 20 minutes.  Cover cups and refrigerate overnight, or a minimum of 3 hours.

Just before serving, uncover cups and run small knife around outside edge of each cup.  Cover cup with serving plate, invert and give brief shake.  Custard should drop to plate.  Repeat with remaining cups.  Garnish with pine nuts and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 340 Cal; 7g Prot; 11g Total Fat (5 Sat. Fat); 48g Carb.; 165mg  Chol; 200mg  Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  If there are no other competing desserts offered, you could match this flan with a tawny port such as Graham's Ten Years Old Tawny.  Or try a Sauternes such as Peter Lehmann Nobel Semillon Sauternes.

Comments:  PiÒones is the local name for pine nuts.

Description:
  "This is a perfect holiday dessert because it actually tastes better made a day ahead, freeing up the oven and your time on Thanksgiving morning for other dishes."

Wine Suggestions:  If there are no other competing desserts offered, you could match this flan with a tawny port such as Graham&apos;s Ten Years Old Tawny.  Or try a Sauternes such as Peter Lehmann Nobel Semillon Sauternes.

Comments:  PiÒones is the local name for pine nuts.

<Desc>
This is a perfect holiday dessert because it actually tastes better made a day ahead, freeing up the oven and your time on Thanksgiving morning for other dishes.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  sweet potatoes
  2              large  bell peppers
                        = (1 red and 1 yellow or orange)
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter or margarine
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cumin -- or more to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  Pepper Jack cheese - (6 oz)
  1                cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice -- or more to taste
  2        tablespoons  minced white onions
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh coriander

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line large baking pan with aluminum foil.

Prick sweet potatoes and place in prepared pan.  Bake for about 1 1/2 hours or until soft in center.  Remove from oven, but leave oven on.

Meanwhile, seed and dice peppers and set aside.  Cut potatoes in half lengthwise; alternatively, make slit down center but not through skin, leaving thin wall of flesh to retain shape.  Scoop out flesh from potato, either half or whole.  Place jackets back on baking sheet.

Using fork, mash potato flesh, leaving it chunky, with butter, cumin and salt to taste.  Scoop mixture back into potato jackets, distributing mixture evenly.  Sprinkle stuffed potatoes with cheese and peppers, reserving some peppers for final garnish.  Bake in oven until cheese melts.

Meanwhile, mix sour cream with lime juice and set aside.  Garnish with remaining peppers, onions, fresh coriander and lime-flavored sour cream.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 550 Cal; 15g Prot; 37g Total Fat (22 Sat. Fat); 42g Carb.; 100mg  Chol; 350mg  Sod.; 6g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  This recipe mostly calls for Chardonnay, but the high presence of lime and fresh coriander might pose a conflict, so go for one that is leaner rather than one that is full-bodied and woody.  Try Chablis A.O.C. Corine Perchaud.

Comments:  These can be entrÈes or side dishes.  For a variation, roast, seed and peel peppers.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  pineapple juice
     1/4           cup  white vinegar
  4        tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  cashews -- (optional garnish)
     1/2         pound  extra-firm tofu -- cubed
  3 1/2           cups  fresh pineapple cubes
                        = (abt 1 medium pineapple)
     1/2         pound  snow peas -- trimmed
  1                     red bell pepper -- cut long thin strips
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger

To make sauce:  Combine pineapple juice, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar and cornstarch, and mix well.  Heat in small saucepan until slightly thick, and set aside.

Heat oil in large wok over medium and, when hot, add cashews, and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and set aside.  Add tofu, pineapple cubes and snow peas, and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add red bell pepper, garlic and ginger, and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add sweet-and-sour sauce, stirring to mix well, and stir-fry for 2 minutes more.

Remove from heat, garnish with cashews, if using, and serve alone or over rice or noodles.

Wine Suggestions:  Match a wine with the tartness of the vinegar and sweetness of the pineapple to highlight the acidity in wine.  Try a Riesling or Gamay.

Comments:  Delicious served on its own, this generously portioned stir-fry also works well as a topping for Asian rice or egg noodles.  Accompany this with vegetarian dumplings and finish with a delicate fruit sorbet.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  2                     egg yolks -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  cooked farro -- cooled
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  low-fat or whole milk ricotta
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
  2              large  eggs -- separated
                        Grated zest 1 lemon -- (optional)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  plumped golden raisins -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

To make crust:  In bowl of food processor, or with your fingertips, combine flour and butter until crumbly.  Separate eggs, reserving whites for filling, and add sugar, egg yolks and lemon zest, and pulse until mixture combines well.  It will not form ball as dough too soft and rich.

Press half pastry onto bottom of 9-inch springform pan so it's very thin.  Snap on side of pan, and press remaining dough up sides as thinly as possible.

To make filling:  Combine farro, milk, ricotta, sugar, flour, egg yolks, salt, lemon zest, nutmeg and raisins, if using, in bowl.  Beat 4 egg whites until stiff and fold into cheese mixture.  Spoon into crust.

Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until almost set.  It sets up as it cools.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Servings: 610 Cal; 18g Prot; 24g Total Fat (13 Sat. Fat); 18g Carb.; 200mg  Chol; 140mg  Sod.; 7g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Late-harvest dessert wines are complex in every way.  Pairing this dolce with a late-harvest wine heightens the viscosity, the bouquet and the subtle acid of both the dessert and the wine.  Cap your meal with a chilled bottle of Inniskillin Niagara Peninsula Vidal Icewine.

Comments:  This comes from the Gargfagnana region above Lucca.  Although not traditional, the addition of half cup plumped golden raisins is delicious.  This dish can be made many hours in advance.

To make crust:  In bowl of food processor, or with your fingertips, combine flour and butter until crumbly.  Separate eggs, reserving whites for filling, and add sugar, egg yolks and lemon zest, and pulse until mixture combines well.  It will not form ball as dough too soft and rich.

<DirT>
Press half pastry onto bottom of 9-inch springform pan so it&apos;s very thin.  Snap on side of pan, and press remaining dough up sides as thinly as possible.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make filling:  Combine farro, milk, ricotta, sugar, flour, egg yolks, salt, lemon zest, nutmeg and raisins, if using, in bowl.  Beat 4 egg whites until stiff and fold into cheese mixture.  Spoon into crust.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until almost set.  It sets up as it cools.

Wine Suggestions:  Late-harvest dessert wines are complex in every way.  Pairing this dolce with a late-harvest wine heightens the viscosity, the bouquet and the subtle acid of both the dessert and the wine.  Cap your meal with a chilled bottle of Inniskillin Niagara Peninsula Vidal Icewine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This comes from the Gargfagnana region above Lucca.  Although not traditional, the addition of half cup plumped golden raisins is delicious.  This dish can be made many hours in advance.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3             medium  carrots -- peeled, diced
  1              large  yellow onion -- peeled, chopped
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  4               cups  vegetable stock
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
  1              pound  sweet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  1                     herb bundle
                        = (abt 30 stems fresh parsley and 6 to 10
                        stems fresh thyme)
  5             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        stems and caps separated
  1                cup  tomato purÈe
  6                     scallions -- trimmed, minced fine
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- or more to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne -- or to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat 4 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium heat.  Add carrots and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until onions are translucent.  Remove from heat, add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, just until garlic releases its fragrance.

Add vegetable stock, wine, sweet potatoes, herb bundle, shiitake stems and tomato purÈe and bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat to low and cook 30 minutes, or until potatoes and carrots are soft.  Discard herb bundle and shiitake stems.

Meanwhile, prepare topping:  Heat remaining butter in skillet over medium heat.  Add scallions and cook for 2 to 5 minutes, or until softened.  Dice shiitake caps, add to skillet, and cook and stir until tender, about 3 minutes.  Set aside.

Use slotted spoon to transfer solids from saucepan to bowl of food processor, reserving cooking liquid.  PurÈe vegetables until very smooth, adding 1/2 cup stock, if necessary.  Return purÈe to saucepan and stir to mix.  Add 1/2 cup cream and heat through.  Add white pepper and cayenne.  Adjust seasonings and serve with shiitake-scallion garnish.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving: 290 Cal; 4g Prot; 19g Total Fat (12 Sat. Fat); 24g Carb.; 60mg  Chol; 200mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  If you're in the mood for a red wine, go for Pinot Noir.  Otherwise, choose a white wine with low enough acidity to meet the creaminess of the soup, but with enough fruit to highlight the earthiness of the tubers and fungus.  Try Trimbach Pinot Blanc.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  extra-firm tofu - (about)
  2             medium  sweet potatoes -- peeled
  1              pound  baby bok choy -- washed, drained
     3/4         pound  broccolini -- ends trimmed
  6                     scallions -- trimmed
  5        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  dark sesame oil
  4        tablespoons  mirin
  3        tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
                        = (preferably low-sodium)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
  3             slices  peeled fresh ginger - (1/4" ea) -- minced
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper -- (optional)

Slice tofu in half horizontally and place on several layers of paper towels.  Lay several more sheets paper towels on top of tofu and press out excess moisture.  Cut tofu into 1/2-inch-long slices.  Set aside.

Cut sweet potatoes lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Stack slices and cut into 1/2-inch-long slices on diagonal.  Set aside.  Trim ends of bok choy and discard.  Cut stalks and leaves into 1-inch-wide slices on diagonal.  Set aside.  Cut broccolini into 1-inch-long slices on diagonal.  Set aside.  Cut scallions (white and about 4 inches green) into 1-inch-long slices on diagonal.

Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon sesame oil in very large skillet or wok over medium heat.  Add sweet potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 10 minutes, or until almost cooked through.  Remove from pan.

Meanwhile, mix mirin, vinegar, soy sauce and cornstarch and set aside.  Heat remaining vegetable oil and sesame oil in skillet or wok and add tofu.  Cook about 3 minutes on each side or until light golden brown.  Set aside and keep warm.

Combine bok choy, broccolini and scallions, returning sweet potatoes and tofu to skillet, and stir-fry for 2 minutes more, or until crisp-tender.  Add ginger and garlic and cook 1 minute longer or until just fragrant.  Add mirin mixture and cook about 30 seconds, or until slightly thickened.  Sprinkle with crushed red pepper, if desired.

Serve vegetable mixture hot over rice or noodles with soy sauce, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 generous servings.

Per Serving: 450 Cal; 16g Prot; 26g Total Fat (4 Sat. Fat); 37g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 900mg  Sod.; 5g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Every ingredient in this recipe pairs well with Pinot Noir, especially if you choose to serve it with the whole wheat pasta option.  Try Steele Wines Carneros Pinot Noir.

Comments:  The naturally sweet potatoes are a foil for the mild bitterness of the bok choy.  Serve with jasmine rice or whole wheat noodles.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4         pound  unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- diced
  1                cup  golden raisins -- (optional)
  1 1/4           cups  buttermilk -- plus
  2        tablespoons  buttermilk
  1                cup  sweet potato purÈe
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten with
  2        tablespoons  milk
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Grease large baking sheet and set aside.

Combine flour, sugars, nutmeg, baking powder, baking soda and salt in large bowl.  Add butter and cut it in until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add raisins, toss to mix and set aside.

Beat 1 1/4 cups buttermilk and the sweet potato purÈe in separate bowl until well combined.  Add sweet potato mixture to flour mixture and mix just until dough begins to stick together; if dough seems dry, add remaining 2 tablespoons buttermilk.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and pat into two 6-inch rounds about 1 1/2 inches thick.  Cut each round in half, then cut each half into 3 triangles for 12 pie-shaped pieces.  Place scones on baking sheet about 1/2 inch apart.  Brush tops with egg wash.

Bake for 20 minutes, then sprinkle with sugar topping, if desired.  Bake for 10 to 15 minutes more.  Remove from oven and serve for breakfast, brunch or with dinner.

This recipe yields 12 scones.

Pour in enough reserved potato water (3 to 3 1/2 cups) to cover.  Bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 35 minutes.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              small  leeks - (abt 1 lb) -- roots and ends
                        trimmed
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     partly thawed 9" deep-dish pie shell
     1/4         pound  mixed wild mushrooms
                        = (such as oyster and shiitake)
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  whole milk
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  grated cheddar cheese - (lightly packed)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Rinse leeks well and drain.  Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Using fingers, push slices into rings.  Set aside.

Heat large skillet over medium heat and, when warm, add olive oil.  Reduce heat to medium-low, add leeks and cook for about 5 minutes, or until leeks begin to soften and glisten.  Remove from heat and set aside.

Using fork, prick pie crust all over and prebake about 20 minutes, or until brown.

Meanwhile, thinly slice mushroom caps and chop stems.  Reheat leeks and add mushrooms, cooking over medium-low for about 15 minutes, or until very soft and fragrant.

Remove pie crust from oven and pour leek-mushroom mixture into crust.  Beat together eggs, milk, salt and pepper, and pour over vegetables.

Sprinkle grated cheese over top and bake until set and flecked with brown spots, about 30 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Per Serving: 270 Cal; 9g Prot; 16g Total Fat (5 Sat. Fat); 22g Carb.; 120mg  Chol; 320mg  Sod.; 0g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  The shiitake mushroom and creamy, milky, cheesy base of the quiche are companionable with Chardonnay-based wines that are rich yet mildly acidicóbut try something less common.  Viognier is a white wine variety of the northern RhÙne area of France that is fruity and aromatic and takes well to barrel fermentation.  Try Bonterra Vineyards Organically Grown Mendocino County Viognier.

Comments:  Select two different varieties of wild mushrooms for this simple quiche.  Making this with a purchased "deep dish" frozen pie shell gets dinner on the table fast, without fuss.  Like all quiches, this is as good at room temperature as it is warm.

  1                cup  buttermilk
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
                        extra for frying
     1/2           cup  nonfat cottage cheese
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  shredded sweet potato
  1                cup  shredded onion
     1/4           cup  minced parsley

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  applesauce

Combine buttermilk, eggs and oil in mixing bowl and beat.  Stir in cottage cheese and flour, mixing together well.  Stir in vegetables, parsley, salt and pepper; mix well.

Heat about 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Using 1/4 cup measure, spoon batter into skillet, making 2 cakes at a time.  Cook cakes on one side until golden, then flip to cook underside.  Add more oil as needed.

When both sides are golden, remove cakes to dish lined with paper towels.  Repeat with remaining batter until used up.  Serve pancakes and pass with applesauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 440 Cal; 13g Prot; 14g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 66g Carb.; 110mg  Chol; 230mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  These savory pancakes would make a nice addition to any brunch buffet, in which case you should consider a not-too-dry sparkling wine.  If an onion or mushroom topping is added, try Bonterra Vineyard's Organically Grown North Coast Chardonnay.

Comments:  A complete meal-in-one, these pancakes partner well with a tossed salad and a simple fruit dessert.  If you want a sweet, dessert-like dish, use maple syrup, honey or even a fruit butter such as apple butter.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 3)
  1              large  onion -- diced
  5                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  2                     fresh bay leaves
  10            sprigs  fresh thyme
     1/2         pound  Arborio rice
  1                cup  Chablis
                        = (or other white wine)
  3               cups  mushroom stock -- (3 to 4)
                        = (or vegetable stock)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              bunch  basil -- stemmed, and
                        leaves julienned
  1              bunch  parsley -- stemmed, chopped
     1/4         bunch  fresh thyme -- stemmed, and
                        leaves chopped
  3               cups  roasted wild mushrooms -- halved
                        = (preferably shiitake)
     1/4         pound  Parmesan cheese -- grated

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium heat.  When hot, add onion, garlic, bay leaves and thyme.  Cook, stirring, until onion is translucent.  Add rice and slowly cook until rice is hot and grains separate.  Add more oil if needed.

Add white wine and cook slowly to reduce liquid, stirring constantly.  Add mushroom stock, 1 cup at a time, and continue to cook and stir constantly.  When each addition of stock is totally absorbed, add next cup stock, and continue to cook and stir until rice is just cooked through.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Add chopped herbs and roasted mushrooms, and stir to mix in well.  Stir in cheese.  Transfer risotto mixture to sheet pan and allow to cool.

Shape risotto mixture into four equal-sized cakes.  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  When hot, sautÈ rice cakes, heating through on both sides and serve.  Accompany with scoop of Vegetable Succotash on the side (see recipe).

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 550 Cal; 20g Prot; 17g Total Fat (7 Sat. Fat); 72g Carb.; 20mg  Chol; 760mg  Sod.; 7g Fiber; 4g Sugar.

Wine Suggestions:  Pinot Noir has many faces: the fruity face, the firm face, the gregarious face, the reserved face, the French face, the American face.  Fortunately, mushrooms are equally varied, allowing for more precise food-wine pairings here.  An earthy risotto with full-flavored mushrooms such as shiitakes calls for a rich American Pinot.  If you are aiming for a milder palate, select a wine with a lighter taste such as a leaner Burgundy.

Comments:  The very popular Arborio rice from Italy cooks up into the popular rice dish, risotto -- a main course that lends itself to a variety of seasonings.  The trick to a successful dish is the long, slow cooking required so that the rice grains can slowly absorb the liquid and become tender.

            Wild Mushroom-Spinach Roulade With Red Chile Sauce

Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHILE SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2         small  onion -- peeled, minced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/4           cup  pure ground mild red chile -- plus
  2        tablespoons  pure ground mild red chile
  2               cups  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === ROULADE ===
  6              large  eggs -- separated
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  pure ground mild red chile
  1 1/2           cups  regular, soy or low-fat milk
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated aged Monterey Jack cheese
                        = (or Parmesan cheese)
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/4         pounds  spinach, preferably crinkly variety -- rinsed, stemmed
  1 3/4         pounds  porcini, cËpes, or other meaty
                        wild mushrooms
                        = (or 1 1/2 lbs portobello and 1/2 oz
                        dried mushrooms)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  2              large  shallots -- minced
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  pure ground mild red chile
     1/2           cup  whipping cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
                        Additional whipping cream -- for brushing on
                        top of roulade
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Fresh herb sprigs
                        Fresh mushroom slices

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line baking sheet with parchment or wax paper.  Spray paper evenly with nonstick vegetable spray.

To make Sauce:  Heat oil in saucepan over medium.  Add onion and garlic, and sautÈ until onion is limp.  Stir in chile and water, 1 cup at a time.  Add salt and bring sauce just to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, and cook about 20 minutes, or until it drops off spoon easily and smoothly.

To make Roulade:  Beat egg whites with mixer until smooth peaks form, firm but not dry.  Whisk yolks together lightly in medium mixing bowl.  Set both aside.

Heat butter in large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Stir flour, salt and chile into butter gradually.  Cook, stirring frequently, until thickened and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes.  Whisk in milk slowly, and increase heat to medium-high.  Cook until lightly thickened, about 4 more minutes.  Remove from heat.  Gradually whisk about 1 cup hot milk mixture into egg yolks.  Pour yolk mixture back into remaining milk mixture, whisking continually.  Stir in cheese.

Fold egg whites gently into yolk-milk mixture.  Spoon mixture onto baking sheet covered with paper, smoothing and tucking into corners.  Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 15 minutes, when it may exhibit minor surface cracks.  Let roulade cool on baking sheet.  Turn off oven, unless baking roulade immediately after assembly.

To make Filling:  Place spinach in large saucepan with water still clinging to leaves.  Cover and steam until just wilted.  Transfer to colander, and let spinach leaves cool to room temperature.

If using dried mushrooms in filling, cover with 1 cup hot water, and soak them briefly until soft.  Save soaking liquid, leaving any grit behind.  Chop fresh and dried mushrooms very finely, preferably in food processor, in 2 batches.  Heat butter in large skillet over medium.  Stir in shallots and mushrooms, and sautÈ until mushrooms have given up their liquid, and liquid has evaporated from skillet, about 20 minutes.  If using dried mushrooms, add soaking liquid to skillet.  Add salt, ground chile and cream, and continue cooking until liquid evaporates and mushrooms begin to stick to pan, about 10 minutes.  Stir in sour cream, and remove from heat.  Spoon mushroom mixture over egg mixture.

When spinach is cool enough to handle, squeeze out liquid and chop coarsely.  Sprinkle spinach evenly over mushrooms.  Spinach leaves tend to cling, but separate them, if possible, so that spinach thoroughly covers roulade surface.

To roll up roulade:  Begin rolling from short side, using parchment for support and carefully pulling paper away as it is rolled.  Transfer roulade with large spatula to plastic wrap and tightly roll it up.  Refrigerate overnight.  If you wish to bake roulade immediately after assembly, it is not necessary to wrap and refrigerate it.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Oil baking sheet.

Unwrap roulade and arrange it in center of sheet.  Brush with whipping cream.  Bake for about 15 minutes, until heated through, slightly puffed and golden brown.  Cool for about 10 minutes.

To serve, present roulade whole.  Then using sharp knife, cut roulade into thin rounds, enough to serve 2 slices per person.  Spoon small pools of sauce on each plate, overlap 2 roulade slices over sauce and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Per Serving: 370 Cal; 14g Prot; 28g Total Fat (15 Sat. Fat); 17g Carb.; 225mg  Chol; 800mg  Sod.; 4g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  Here's a dish that works equally well with Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, and for all the same reasons: earthy mushrooms, mild spices, and spinach.  Try Scotchmans Hill Bellarine Peninsula Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.

Comments:  You can prepare and assemble the sauce, filling and roulade ahead to fit better into your holiday cooking schedule.  You can keep the sauce warm if you plan to prepare and serve the roulade immediately; however, the sauce can be cooled and refrigerated for up to two days, then reheated shortly before serving.  In either case, add a little warm water if the sauce becomes overly thick.  Presentation is very important, so arrange the roulade whole on a decorative platter, and surround it with herbs and mushroom slices.  Then slice and serve at the table.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  crushed roasted tomatoes - (1 lge can)
  2 1/2           cups  whole fire-roasted tomatoes - (1 lge can)
  2               cups  precooked wild rice
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- for frying
  1            package  flavored tempeh - (8 oz) -- cubed
  6             ounces  baby spinach -- rinsed
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             ounces  mini baguette
  8             ounces  firm goat cheese
                        Basil leaves -- for garnish

Combine tomatoes in large saucepan, using spoon to stir together and to slightly break up whole tomatoes.  Add wild rice, and heat mixture over medium-low.

Meanwhile, heat olive oil in large skillet over medium-low.  When hot, add cubed tempeh, and sautÈ, stirring often, until crisp and browned.  Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.

Add spinach, oregano and garlic to tomato mixture and season to taste.

To make the croutons:  Cut mini baguette into 12 equal slices, allowing 3 slices per serving.  Cut goat cheese into 12 slices, layer on bread and broil until cheese softens and bread toasts.

Just before serving, stir tempeh cubes into stew.  To serve, ladle stew into four large soup bowls.  Garnish with basil leaves and toasted goat cheese croutons.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 740 Cal; 40g Prot; 36g Total Fat (16 Sat. Fat); 66g Carb.; 60mg  Chol; 660mg  Sod.; 11g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  The tomatoes, the grains and the goat cheese are the controlling flavors.  Look for a wine to meet the acid in the tomatoes and to stand up to the goat cheese.  Try Antinori Chianti Classico Tenute Marchese Antinori Riserva.

Comments:  This luscious, nourishing stew stars several complementary flavors -- roasted tomatoes, wild rice and goat cheese -- with fried, cubed tempeh as an embellishment.  Note that tempeh is available in many different flavors, so pick one that brings some garden-fresh flavors to the stew.  Look for the precooked wild rice sold in foil packets in specialty food stores.  Serve this substantial entrÈe with a toasted baguette and a simple, light dessert such as poached pears.  This recipe is generous enough to serve up to six people.

            Wild Rice Pancakes With Mushrooms And Goat Cheese

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  12            medium  mushrooms - (1 1/2" dia)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  4              large  eggs
     1/3           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  4                     scallions -- minced
  1                cup  cooked wild rice
  5             ounces  crumbled goat cheese
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Nonstick vegetable spray -- as needed
                        Butter for the pan -- (optional)
                        === OPTIONAL TOPPINGS ===
                        Sour cream or yogurt
                        Flat-leaf parsley
                        Minced chives
                        Fire-Roasted Pepper Salsa -- (see recipe)
                        Chive blossoms

Heat skillet over medium heat, about 1 minute.  Add olive oil and mushrooms and cook 5 minutes.  Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook 5 minutes more.  Stir in garlic and lemon juice and remove pan from heat.

Beat eggs in bowl.  Whisk in flour and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Stir in cooked mushrooms, including all juices.  Add scallions, wild rice, goat cheese and black pepper, and stir until well combined.

Wipe out skillet and return to medium heat.  After 1 to 2 minutes, spray lightly with nonstick vegetable spray and add butter, if using.

When pan is hot enough to sizzle bread crumb, using 1/2-cup measure, scoop up batter and pour into hot pan.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until pancakes are golden.

Serve hot, warm or at room temperature with one or more of toppings suggested above.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 330 Cal; 19g Prot; 19g Total Fat (9 Sat. Fat); 21g Carb.; 240mg  Chol; 830mg  Sod.; 2g Fiber.

Wine Suggestions:  The two red wine grapes of Burgundy are Pinot Noir and Gamay, the latter used for Beaujolais.  Wild rice, goat cheese and earthy mushrooms match well with a Beaujolais, such as Morgon, Grand Cru, Anne-Marie Perret, Domaine des Grand Cras.

Comments:  You can speed preparation of this dish by purchasing preprepared wild rice, available in foil packets at some specialty food stores.

                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  tempeh - (8 oz)
     1/4           cup  shoyu or soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  maple syrup -- plus
  1           teaspoon  maple syrup
  4        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  4              whole  garlic cloves -- plus
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  4             slices  fresh ginger
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped red onion - (1 small)
     1/2      teaspoon  prepared mustard
  2          teaspoons  minced jalapeÒo pepper
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  3            bunches  fresh arugula
  1             medium  ripe mango -- peeled, sliced

Cut tempeh into 12 even strips.  In large saucepan, combine 2 cups water, shoyu, 1 tablespoon maple syrup, 2 tablespoons lime juice, whole garlic cloves and ginger slices.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Add tempeh, lower heat and simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes.

Remove tempeh from liquid and set aside.  Add chopped onion to liquid and cook 1 minute.  Remove with slotted spoon and place in small bowl.  Discard garlic and ginger.  Drizzle 1 tablespoon lime juice over onion, toss to coat and set aside.

In small bowl, whisk together remaining 1 tablespoon lime juice, 1 teaspoon maple syrup, mustard, minced garlic, jalapeÒo, and 2 tablespoons oil.  Set dressing aside.

Remove long stems from arugula, wash and dry leaves well, and place in metal bowl.  Peel and slice mango into 3/4-inch slices; set aside in separate dish.

In medium nonstick skillet, heat remaining 1 teaspoon oil over medium-high heat.  Add tempeh and cook until browned, about 2 minutes on each side.

Toss arugula with dressing to coat.  Place bowl over pot of simmering water to make a double boiler.  Toss greens over the heat until they warm and just begin to wilt, about 2 minutes.  Divide arugula onto plates and arrange mango and tempeh over greens.  Sprinkle with reserved chopped onion and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving: 211 Cal; 8g Prot; 10g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 23g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 67mg  Sod.; 3g Fiber.

Comments:  To round out the meal, serve polenta on the side.  Slice packaged polenta into coins.  Broil each side a couple of minutes until browned.

Description:
  "Here's a new way to serve tempeh that's full of flavor.  As a bonus, the bright colors make this a beautiful dish.  The recipe can easily be doubled."

     2/3           cup  vegetable oil
  1                cup  barley malt or molasses
     1/8           cup  vinegar
                        === ICING ===
     1/3           cup  confectioner's sugar
                        Cold water
                        Lemon juice
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
                        Orange peel or almonds

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Grease and flour 10-cup bundt pan.

To make fruitcake:  In large mixing bowl, mix flour, baking powder, soda, salt and spices until well combined.  Add all fruits and nuts to flour mixture, and toss until well coated.

Blend together applesauce, oil, barley malt and vinegar.  Working quickly, mix wet ingredients into dry, stirring only until mixed thoroughly.  Pour batter into pan and place in center of oven.

Bake for 1 1/2 hours, or until done.  Cool cake completely on rack.

Meanwhile, to make icing:  Place confectioner's sugar in bowl, and whisk in enough cold water to form thick paste.  Add 2 to 3 drops lemon juice.  Drizzle icing over cake in swirls or an attractive pattern, add garnish if desired and serve.

This recipe yields 18 servings.

Per Serving: 450 Cal; 7g Prot; 17g Total Fat (2 Sat. Fat); 69g Carb.; 0mg  Chol; 210mg  Sod.; 5g Fiber; 41g Sugar.

Wine Suggestions:  Not every year is a vintage year for Port, but 1997 was just such a stellar year.  For over 200 years, the House of Sandeman has been making world-class Port originating in Spain and Portugal.  Try a vintage Port or Sandeman's Founder's Reserve Port.

Comments:  Try to find fruits dried without added sugar when making this holiday fruitcake.  The cake slices more easily if made two or three days in advance.  Decorate the cake as fancifully as desired.
