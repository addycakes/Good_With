  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  raisins
  4 1/2           cups  apple cider
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  1             medium  onion -- diced - (abt 1 cup)
  3                     celery stalks -- split lengthwise,
                        and cut into 1/4" slices
  3        tablespoons  pine nuts
  8             ounces  mortadella -- cut 1/4" dice
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped pitted green olives
  2                     apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and diced
  6                     fresh sage leaves -- chopped
  6               cups  day-old sourdough bread in 1" cubes -- crusts removed
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To plump the raisins, combine them with the apple cider in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Immediately remove from the heat and set aside.

In a large, nonreactive saucepan or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the onion, celery, and pine nuts.  Cook, stirring occasionally, without coloring, 6 to 8 minutes.

Add the mortadella, olives, apples, and sage and cook 5 more minutes.

Strain the raisins, reserving the cider, and add the raisins to the saucepan.  Stir in the bread cubes, season with the salt and pepper, and add reserved cider.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer, covered for 15 minutes.  Stir thoroughly, cover, and continue cooking for an additional 15 minutes.  The stuffing will be very moist.  Serve hot.  The stuffing can be kept hot and held for up to 1 hour in a bain-marie.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  pure maple syrup
  6                     firm-ripe Bosc pears with stems
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  Calvados -- or to taste
                        = (or other apple brandy)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1                cup  chilled heavy cream

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Put syrup in a shallow bowl.  Put a thin slice from bottom of each pear so that the pears will stand upright.  Dip and roll each pear in maple syrup to coat completely, reserving remaining syrup.  Transfer pears as coated to a 9- by 2-inch square baking pan, standing them upright.

Sprinkle pears with 2 tablespoons sugar, holding by stems and tilting to coat sides.  Stir lemon juice, 2 tablespoons Calvados, and butter into reserved syrup and pour around pears in pan.

Bake pears, uncovered, in middle of oven until undersides are tender when pierced with a knife, about 30 minutes.

Beat cream with remaining tablespoon sugar and remaining tablespoon Calvados with an electric mixer until it holds soft peaks.

Divide pears and syrup among plates and serve warm, with whipped cream on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     phyllo sheets - (17" by 12") -- covered with 2
                        overlapping pieces plastic wrap and
                        then a damp kitchen towel
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  2                     firm-ripe bananas
  2             ounces  fine-quality bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
                        Lightly-sweetened whipped cream -- as an accompaniment

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Arrange 1 phyllo sheet on a work surface with a short side of phyllo nearest you, keeping remaining sheets covered, and brush with some butter.  Top phyllo with 3 more sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter.  Arrange bananas 1 above the other, horizontally, on lower third of phyllo, leaving a 1-inch border on both sides (trim bananas if too long).  Sprinkle chocolate over bananas, then fold sides of phyllo toward middle (over ends of bananas).  Fold bottom edge of phyllo over bananas and roll up bananas in phyllo.

Transfer strudel, seam-side down, to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or to a buttered baking sheet, then brush strudel with beaten egg.  Cut 4 (1/2-inch-long) steam vents diagonally along top of strudel with a sharp knife.  Bake in middle of oven until golden, about 12 to 15 minutes.  Cool slightly on a rack, then dust with confectioners' sugar.

Spread the tortillas with half the chicken mixture and half the Monterey Jack, spoon about 1/2 cup of the remaining sauce over the mixture, and cover it with 4 of the remaining tortillas in one layer.  Spread the tortillas with the remaining chicken mixture and the remaining Monterey Jack, top the mixture with 1/2 cup of the remaining sauce, and cover it with the remaining 4 tortillas.  Pour the remaining sauce evenly over the tortillas and sprinkle it with the Parmesan.

Bake the enchiladas, covered with foil, in the middle the oven for 15 minutes, remove the foil, bake the enchiladas, uncovered, for 5 to 10 minutes more, or until the cheese is bubbling.

Mexican-Style Tomato Sauce:  In a blender, puree the tomatoes with the onion, the garlic, and the chiles.

In a large skillet, heat the oil over moderately-high heat until it is hot but not smoking, add the tomato puree, and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.

Season the sauce with salt and black pepper.  (Makes 2 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        === PATE ===
  1              pound  best-quality bittersweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
                        = (or 12 oz semisweet plus 4 oz
                        unsweetened chocolate)
     3/4           cup  ruby port
     3/4           cup  chopped unsalted macadamia nuts
                        = (or almonds)
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2 1/2           cups  chopped plums - (abt 1 lb)
                        = (or pitted cherries)
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  ruby port
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        === TOPPING ===
  1                cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  sifted powdered sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract

Prepare the Pate:  Line a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper or foil; set aside.  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over low heat.  Add the wine and whisk to blend.  Remove from the heat and stir in the nuts.  Cool to room temperature.

Whip the cream until soft peaks form.  Gently fold the chocolate mixture into the whipped cream.

Pour into lined loaf pan, cover, and refrigerate overnight or at least 3 hours.  (The pate can be made up to 5 days in advance.)

Prepare the Sauce:  Melt the butter in a saute pan over medium heat.  Add the plums and saute until the plums begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the sugar and cook until the sugar begins to caramelize, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the wine and simmer over low heat until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the nutmeg.  (The sauce can be prepared and refrigerated up to 24 hours in advance.  Serve at room temperature.)

Prepare the Topping:  Whip the cream until soft peaks form.  Sprinkle in the sugar and vanilla and whip just to blend.

To serve:  Use a warm knife to slice the pate into 1/2-inch slices.  Top each serving with plum sauce and whipped cream.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         ounces  semisweet chocolate
  5             ounces  mascarpone - (abt 1 cup)
     1/8      teaspoon  almond extract
  1              large  loaf pan-baked panettone or brioche
  3                     eggs
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
  2 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (to 3)
                        Powdered sugar -- for garnish

Chop the chocolate into small bits and set aside.

Mix together the mascarpone and almond extract and set aside.

Cut the panettone or brioche into 16 equal slices discarding the ends.  Remove the crust squaring the slices off as much as possible.  Lay 8 slices of brioche out on the work surface.  Spread the mascarpone mixture on the slices, then sprinkle over the chocolate bits.  Cover with the remaining slices of brioche to create sandwiches.  You may wrap the sandwiches up in plastic film and refrigerate for a few hours or proceed with recipe.

In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, vanilla, and 1 1/2 cups of the heavy cream.  Set aside.  Whip the remaining cup of heavy cream into stiff peaks, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large nonstick skillet over moderate heat.  Dip each sandwich into the egg mixture to saturate the bread allowing any excess to drip back into the bowl.  Transfer to the skillet.  Dip and add only as many sandwiches as fit into the skillet in 1 layer.

Saute gently until the bottom is golden, about 3 minutes.  With a spatula turn the sandwiches and continue to saute until the second side is golden and the chocolate in the center has melted.

Transfer the sandwiches to a warm platter as they are done.  Add more butter to the skillet and continue to dip the sandwiches in the egg mixture and saute them until all the sandwiches are cooked.

Serve the sandwiches on individual dessert plates and garnish with a dollop of whipped cream and a dusting of confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            slices  supermarket white bread - (abt 1/2 loaf)
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1              large  egg yolk
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  hot pepper sauce
  7          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  celery seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  fresh cooked Dungeness crabmeat -- picked over for
                        bits of shell and cartilage with
                        claw meat and large pieces left whole
     1/4           cup  chopped onions
     1/4           cup  chopped seeded green bell peppers
     1/4           cup  chopped seeded red bell peppers
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (about) -- for pan frying
                        Green Cocktail Sauce -- (see recipe)
  4                     lemon wedges - (to 8)

Tear up the white bread and pulse the pieces in a food processor to make fine, soft crumbs.  (You should have about 6 cups crumbs.)  Remove the bread crumbs to a shallow pan and mix in 1/2 cup of the chopped parsley (reserving the remaining 1/4 cup for the crabcake mixture).  Set aside.

In a food processor, combine the egg yolk, lemon juice, Worcestershire, hot pepper, mustard, paprika, thyme, celery seeds, and black pepper and pulse to combine.  With the motor running, slowly add the oil through the feed tube in a steady stream until the mixture emulsifies and forms a mayonnaise.  Remove the mayonnaise from the food processor and refrigerate.

Place the crabmeat in a cheesecloth-lined sieve set over a bowl.  Pull the cheesecloth tightly around the crabmeat and squeeze out as much juice as possible.  Place the chopped onions and bell peppers in a sieve set over a bowl and use your hands to squeeze out as much juice as possible.  In a large bowl, combine the onions and bell peppers with remaining 1/4 cup parsley.  Add the chilled mayonnaise and crabmeat and toss lightly to combine.  Add 1 cup of the bread crumbs-parsley mixture and combine.  Do not overwork the mixture or the crabcakes may get gummy.  Gently form 8 patties and roll the patties lightly in the remaining bread crumb-parsley mixture.  Leave the crabcakes in the pan of the bread crumbs until you saute them.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Using a nonstick saute pan and butter as needed, panfry the crabcakes, in batches, until golden brown on both sides and place them on a baking sheet as they are browned, put them in the oven until they are heated all the way through, 5 to 8 minutes.

Serve 1 crabcake as an appetizer or 2 as an entree.  Serve with a ramekin of Green Cocktail Sauce and a lemon wedge.

This recipe yields 8 appetizer or 4 main-dish servings.

Cook's Note:  The crabcakes hold together better if prepared a day ahead and stored in the refrigerator before cooking.  Store them in the pan of bread crumbs, covered with plastic wrap.

                           Eggplant Parmigiana

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy Vita Greco
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     eggs - (to 3)
  1         tablespoon  grated Parmesan
  2          teaspoons  dried parsley
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
  2               cups  bread crumbs
  2             medium  eggplants -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
                        Olive oil -- to fry eggplant
                        Vita Greco's Gravy to cover -- (see recipe)
                        Grated mozzarella -- as needed

Amounts of all ingredients would depend on how many pieces of eggplant you are preparing.

Beat together the eggs, cheese, parsley, pepper, and garlic powder.  Some people put the peeled, sliced eggplant in a colander with a heavy object on top, so it can drain somewhat.  It's been known to be less tart, then.  I don't do this any longer, because I found little or no difference in tartness.

Dip the sliced eggplant pieces into the egg mixture and then into the bread crumbs, so that they're nicely coated.  Fry each piece in olive oil until very brown on both sides.  This is important.  If the eggplants are not thinly cut or if they're not browned enough, the taste of the entire dish is not right.  Both hands have to be working to get a good system going for this, and I use a medium to high flame.  At certain intervals, I stop and dump the oil, wash the pan, and begin with a clean pan.  This makes a big difference.

As the eggplant pieces are done, you can drain them on a paper towel and then place them in a baking pan.  When you have enough for one layer, coat the layer generously with tomato sauce.  On top of that, sprinkle grated mozzarella generously.  Keep repeating layers.  Make sure the sides of your pan get some sauce, too.

Now, I freeze this before baking.  When I defrost it, I bake it as usual, and it's great.  But if you want to eat it now, bake it in a preheated 350 degree oven until the cheese melts and the sauce is bubbly.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Espresso Chile Glazed Ham

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy Tom Douglas
Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham                             Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Half of a fully cooked ham - (abt 8 lbs)
  1              quart  fresh orange juice
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest
  1                cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1                cup  coffee-flavored liqueur
  1         tablespoon  Chinese chile paste with garlic
                        = (or sambal olek)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2              shots  brewed espresso - (abt 1/4 cup total)
                        = (or 1 tbspn instant espresso powder)
                        === SERVING SUGGESTION ===
                        Etta's Cornbread -- (see recipe)

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Cut the thick layer of fat and the skin from the ham and discard.  Place the ham in a roasting pan.  For easier cleanup, line the pan with aluminum foil, because the glaze will drip off and burn on the bottom of the pan.  Roast the ham for 1 hour.

While the ham is roasting, make the glaze.  Combine the orange juice and zest, brown sugar, liqueur, chile paste, and pepper in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer the mixture until is reduced by about half and is as thick as maple syrup, about 35 minutes.  Whisk in the espresso or espresso powder.  You should have almost 2 cups of glaze.  You are going to use half of this glaze to brush the ham while it is roasting and reserve the other half for brushing on the ham after it is sliced.

After the first hour of cooking, brush the ham with the glaze.  Roast for another hour, brushing with the glaze every 15 minutes.  Since the ham is already cooked, you just need to warm it all the way through.  Check for an internal temperature of 130 to 140 degrees using an instant-read thermometer.  Remove the ham from the oven when it is nicely browned and warmed through.

To serve:  We like to serve this with warm cornbread.  For a lovely presentation, slice half the ham and arrange the slices up against the unsliced part on a big platter.  Brush the slices with the remaining glaze.

This recipe yields 16 or more servings.

Cook's Note: The glaze can be made a few days ahead and stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator.

Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  shelled pistachios
  6                     phyllo sheets -- thawed if frozen
  3        tablespoons  light brown sugar - (packed) -- or to taste
  1              small  peach
  2               cups  assorted berries
  4        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4           cup  sour cream

Preheat oven to 375 degrees and butter 8 (1/2-cup) muffin cups.

Melt 4 tablespoons butter and cool.  In a shallow baking pan toast pistachios in middle of oven, shaking pan occasionally, until golden, about 10 minutes.  Cool nuts and finely chop.

On a work surface stack 3 phyllo sheets and cut out 4 (6-inch) squares (for a total of 12 single-sheet squares), discarding scraps.  Repeat with other 3 phyllo sheets.

Stack phyllo squares between 2 sheets of waxed paper and cover with a kitchen towel.  Line each buttered muffin cup with 1 phyllo square, pressing into bottom (don't worry if pastry rips).  Fold in pastry overhang, brush inside and edges with some melted butter.

In a small bowl, stir together 2 tablespoons nuts and 2 tablespoons brown sugar.  Sprinkle bottom of each pastry shell with 1/2 teaspoon nut-sugar mixture.  Make 2 more layers of phyllo, butter, nuts, and sugar in same manner.  Bake shells in middle of oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Carefully lift shells out of pan and transfer to a rack to cool slightly.

While shells are baking, cut peach into 1/2-inch-thick wedges and halve wedges crosswise.  In a bowl toss peach and berries with honey, lemon juice, and vanilla and let stand at room temperature, stirring occasionally, at least 15 minutes.

In a small bowl stir together sour cream and remaining brown sugar, to taste.  Just before serving, divide sour-cream mixture among shells and with a slotted spoon fill shells with fruit.  Drizzle fruit and serving plates with some of remaining fruit juices in bowl.  Sprinkle remaining nuts over tartlets.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  ground shortbread cookies
                        = (from two 5 1/3-oz packages)
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1 1/2      teaspoons  unflavored gelatin
  2        tablespoons  milk
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped crystallized ginger
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  sour cream

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Make shell:  Blend ground shortbread, sugar, and butter in a food processor until mixture begins to clump together.  Press onto bottom and up side of tart pan.  Bake in middle of oven 15 minutes, then cool in pan on a rack.

Make ginger cream:  Sprinkle gelatin over milk in a small bowl and let stand 1 minute to soften.  Transfer to a saucepan and cook with ginger, sugar, lemon juice, salt, and 1 cup heavy cream over moderate heat, stirring, until sugar and gelatin are dissolved.  Cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.

Whisk sour cream in a large bowl until smooth.  Beat remaining cup heavy cream in another bowl with an electric mixer until it just holds soft peaks and fold into sour cream.

Gently fold ginger milk into whipped cream until combined well.  Pour into crust and chill until set, at least 8 hours.  Dust tart with confectioners' sugar and serve with berries.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     garlic cloves
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  coarse salt
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     leg of lamb - (7 to 8 lbs) -- trimmed of fat,
                        boned, and butterflied by butcher
                        = (4 to 4 3/4 lbs boneless)
  1                     lemon

Finely chop garlic and in a small bowl stir together with remaining herb-rub ingredients.  Secure loose flaps of meat, by runnning 2 long metal skewers lengthwise and 2 skewers crosswise through the lamb, bunching the meat together.

Put lamb in a large dish and with tip of a sharp small knife held at a 45-degree angle, cut 1/2-inch-deep slits all over lamb, rubbing herb mixture into slits and all over lamb.  Marinate lamb at room temperature 1 hour.

Prepare grill.

Lightly pat lamb dry.  On a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals grill lamb about 10 minutes on each side, or until an instant-read thermometer horizontally inserted into thickest part of meat registers 125 degrees for medium-rare.  (Alternatively, roast lamb in a roasting pan in middle of a 425 degree oven about 25 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer horizontally inserted into meat registers 125 degrees for medium-rare.)

Transfer lamb to a cutting board.  Halve and seed lemon.  Squeeze juice over lamb and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 15 minutes.

Cut lamb into slices and serve with any juices that have accumulated on cutting board.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

     3/4         pound  large shrimp - (abt 12)
     3/4         pound  sea scallops - (abt 18)
                        Avocado Salsa -- (see recipe)

To make Scallion Oil:  Chop enough scallions (including greens) to measure about 1 1/4 cups and in a blender puree with oil and salt and pepper to taste until smooth.  Pour puree through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on solids.  Discard solids.  Scallion oil may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring oil to room temperature before using.

In a large saucepan cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1-inch and simmer until just tender, about 7 minutes.  In a colander drain potatoes and rinse under cold water to stop cooking.  Pat potatoes dry.  Potatoes may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Halve potatoes lengthwise.  In a bowl, toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper.

Peel and devein shrimp.  Remove tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary.  Pat shellfish dry and in a bowl toss with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and salt and pepper to taste.  Prepare grill.

Grill potatoes, cut-sides down, on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until lightly charred.  Grill shrimp and scallops 2 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through and golden brown.  (Alternatively, saute potatoes and shellfish in a lightly oiled non-stick skillet in batches over moderately-high heat.)

Spoon Avocado Salsa onto centers of 6 plates and mound mesclun on top.  Arrange shellfish and potatoes around salsa.  Drizzle shellfish and potatoes with some scallion oil.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  6                     lemongrass stalks - (bottom 5" only) -- coarsely chopped
  1                     inch galangal piece (thawed if frozen) -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  3                     fresh 1 1/2" Thai chiles to 5, or 2
                        fresh jalapeÒo chiles -- trimmed, and

                        = (seed chiles if a milder flavor is
                        desired)
  4                     kaffir lime leaves (fresh or frozen)

  2               cups  drained canned white beans
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced, and
                        mashed to a paste with
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  8                     loin lamb chops, 1" thick -- boned and tied
                        All-purpose flour -- seasoned with
                        Salt -- and also
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- for dredging
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped shallot -- plus
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped shallot - (abt 4 large)
     1/2           cup  dry red wine

     1/4           cup  heavy cream -- plus

To the skillet, add shallots and remaining garlic paste, and cook over moderately-low heat, stirring, until softened.  Deglaze skillet with wine over high heat, scraping up browned bits, and boil until reduced by about half.  Stir in mustard, broth, and cream and simmer until thickened.  Stir in parsley.

Divide puree between 4 plates and top with lamb and sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  chipotle in adobo
                        = (including some liquid)
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  2        tablespoons  pomegranate molasses
     1/2      teaspoon  toasted cumin seeds
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1              pinch  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  orange zest
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
                        === PORK ===
  1                     boneless pork loin roast - (abt 3 lbs) -- wrapped and tied
                        with some fat left on
  2                     garlic cloves -- slivered
                        Fresh thyme sprigs -- plus extra,
                        for garnish
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Ground cumin -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  dry white wine -- or less as needed
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  chopped dried mission figs
  1                     orange -- segmented
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme
                        Watercress sprigs -- for garnish
                        Orange peel curls -- for garnish

To Make the Sauce:  Mix the chipotle chile and orange juice in a mini-food processor until pureed.  Add the next 9 marinade ingredients, pulsing to combine.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut small slits in the roast, cutting with the grain and insert garlic slivers and an equal number of thyme sprigs.  Rub the roast liberally with salt, pepper, and ground cumin.

In a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed roasting pan, combine butter and olive oil.  When bubbling, add the roast to the pan and turn to brown on all sides (about 8 minutes).  Add 1/2 cup wine and the onion to the pan and place in the oven.  After 20 minutes, start basting the roast with the sauce.  Continue to baste until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees, about 1 hour total.

Transfer the roast to a carving board, tent with foil and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes before carving.

Meanwhile, spoon off any excess fat from the pan then deglaze with 1/4 cup wine; when bubbling add the sauce mixture, plus chopped figs, orange segments and 1 teaspoon fresh minced thyme.  Simmer gently for about 10 minutes, until the figs are soft.  Remove from the heat and puree using an immersion blender.  There should be some chunks remaining in the "marmalade".

To Serve:  Remove twine and slice pork 1/2-inch thick.  Top slices with a generous spoonful of the sauce and garnish with thyme sprigs, or for a buffet, present the whole roast on a nest of watercress (or arugula) and orange peel curls.  Add the marmalade to each serving as your carve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Cook's Note:  It is very important that there is a thin layer of fat on the roast and that it is all natural -- not water and nitrate "plumped".

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREPES FOR MANICOTTI ===
  1                cup  flour
  1                cup  milk
  1                     egg -- beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === RICOTTA FILLING ===
  2             pounds  ricotta
  8             ounces  fat-free cream cheese
  2                     eggs
  1                     Handful chopped fresh parsley
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  grated mozzarella
  2               cups  Vita Greco's Gravy -- (see recipe)

To make Crepes:  Mix ingredients together and stir until smooth.  Drop by spoonfuls or 1/4 cup of mixture onto a hot, lightly greased nonstick 6-inch pan.  Crepes should form and become dry almost instantly as you swirl the pan and its contents.  Turn crepe over to cook other side quickly.

Remove cooked crepe to waxed paper to cool.  They can be stacked with waxed paper between each and then placed in the freezer until you're ready to fill them.  This makes about 9 crepes that can be filled with more than just ricotta.  Use for cannelloni, blintzes, etc.

To make Ricotta Filling:  Whip all of the ricotta filling ingredients together.  Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each crepe, then roll up, and tuck in the ends.

Spread a little Vita Greco's Gravy on the bottom of a baking pan to evenly coat the pan.  Then, arrange manicotti in pan loosely and cover with sauce.  Bake at 425 degrees, when the sauce bubbles, serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === TOMATO GRAVY ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  4                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  2               cans  chicken stock - (14 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  flour
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (14 oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
                        === FRIED ONIONS ===
  3              large  Spanish onions -- peeled, halved,
                        and thinly sliced
  1              quart  milk
  1              pound  all-purpose flour
  2             quarts  canola oil

To make Meatloaf:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl, mix chopped meat, bread crumbs, eggs, bouillon broth, Parmesan, and chopped parsley.  Mix well with a wooden spoon until all the ingredients are well incorporated.  Form into a loaf shape and place on a sheet pan coated with nonstick vegetable spray.

Place in oven and cook for 45 minutes, or until meatloaf has an internal temperature of 160 degrees.

To make Tomato Gravy:  In a large saucepan, heat butter over medium-high heat.  Allow butter to foam and begin to brown.  Add smashed garlic and allow garlic to brown slightly.  Add chicken stock and tomato paste and cook for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sprinkle in flour and stir constantly, forming a roux to cook for approximately 10 to 12 minutes until golden brown.

Add 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and all tomatoes.  Simmer for 30 minutes and finish with salt, pepper and oregano.  Serve atop the meatloaf.

To make Fried Onions:  Heat a large, deep pot of oil to 350 degrees.  Soak onions in milk for a minimum of 10 minutes.  When oil is hot, drain onions and dredge in flour, making sure to remove excess flour.

Plunge onions a batch at a time (there should be 3 batches) into hot oil and fry until extremely golden brown and crispy.  Remove from fryer and place on a paper towel to drain.  Serve atop dressed meatloaf.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  garlic head
  1 1/2         pounds  small red potatoes
                        = (abt 1 1/2" in dia ea)
     1/4           cup  water
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4         pound  haricots verts
                        = (or regular green beans)
  1                     red bell pepper
     1/2                English cucumber
  10                    kalamata olives
                        = (or other brine-cured black olives)
  2               cans  solid white tuna in water - (6 oz ea)
     1/3           cup  crumbled feta - (abt 2 oz)

Separate garlic cloves, leaving skins intact.  In a large kettle cover potatoes with salted water by 2 inches and add garlic.  Simmer potatoes and garlic until potatoes are just tender, about 20 minutes.

Drain potatoes and garlic in a colander and, when cool enough to handle, cut potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick slices.

Peel garlic and in a blender puree with water, vinegar, oil, mustard, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Potatoes may be prepared and dressing made 1 day ahead and chilled separately, covered.

Cut beans into 1-inch pieces.  Have ready a bowl of ice and cold water.  In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook beans until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes for haricots verts or 6 minutes for regular green beans.  In a colander drain beans and plunge into ice water to stop cooking.  Pat beans dry.

Cut bell pepper into 1/4-inch dice and halve cucumber lengthwise.  Seed cucumber and diagonally cut into 1/4-inch thick slices.  Pit and chop olives.  Vegetables and olives may be prepared up to this point 4 hours ahead and chilled separately, covered.

Drain tuna and transfer with potatoes, beans, bell pepper, cucumber, and olives to a large bowl.

Just before serving, toss salad with dressing and crumble feta on top.

This recipe yields 4 main course servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2 1/2    tablespoons  mild honey
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
     2/3           cup  sliced almonds
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fine-quality candied
                        orange peel
  8             ounces  fine-quality bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Boil sugar, butter, honey, and cream in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until creamy and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in almonds and orange peel (batter will be thin).

Drop level 1/2 teaspoons of batter about 2 inches apart on parchment-lined baking sheets.  (Batter will thicken as it cools; you may need to reheat for last few batches.)  Bake in batches in middle of oven until golden brown and bubbly, 8 to 10 minutes.  (Cookies will look runny at this point.)

Cool cookies on sheets on racks until firm enough to be lifted, about 2 minutes, then transfer with a metal spatula to racks to cool completely.  (The cookies are very delicate; if they become too brittle to lift easily, return to oven to soften, about 1 minute.)

Melt chocolate in a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally, then remove top of double boiler or bowl from heat.  Dip about 1/3 of each cookie into chocolate, then transfer to a parchment-lined tray.  Let stand until chocolate is set, about 1 hour.

This recipe yields ?? cookies.

Cook's Note:  Cookies keep, layered between sheets of waxed or parchment paper (do not overlap) and chilled in an airtight container, 1 week.

                     Mushroom-Stuffed Brie En Croute

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  minced onion
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1            package  frozen puff pastry sheets - (17 1/4 oz) -- thawed according
                        to package directions
  1                     chilled Brie wheel - (14 to 17 oz)
  1              large  egg
                        === ACCOMPANIMENT ===
                        French bread slices or crackers

In a 9- to 10-inch heavy skillet, cook onion in butter over moderate heat, stirring, until softened.  Add mushrooms, sherry, nutmeg, and salt and pepper, to taste, and saute over moderately-high heat, stirring, until the liquid that the mushrooms give off is evaporated.  Cool mushroom mixture.

On a lightly floured surface roll out 1 sheet of pastry into a 13-inch square and, using Brie as a guide, cut out 1 round the size of the Brie.  Cut out a mushroom shape from scraps for decoration.

Horizontally halve Brie.  Roll out remaining sheet of pastry into a 13-inch square and transfer to a shallow baking pan.  Center the bottom half of Brie, cut-side up, on pastry square and spread mushroom mixture on top.  Cover mushroom mixture with remaining half of Brie, cut-side down.  Without stretching pastry, wrap it snugly up over Brie and trim excess to leave a 1-inch border of pastry on top of Brie.

In a small bowl, lightly beat egg and brush onto border.  Top Brie with pastry round, pressing edges of dough together gently but firmly to seal.  Brush the top of pastry with some egg and arrange pastry mushroom on it.  Lightly brush mushroom with some egg, being careful not to let egg drip over edge of mushroom (which would prevent it from rising).  With back of a sharp small knife, gently score side of pastry with vertical marks, being careful not to cut through dough.  Chill Brie, uncovered, 30 minutes.  Brie may be made up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, loosely covered.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Bake Brie in middle of oven until pastry is puffed and golden, about 20 minutes.  Let Brie stand in pan on a rack 15 minutes and transfer with a spatula to a serving plate.

Serve Brie with bread or crackers.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

            Pears Stuffed With Roquefort And Walnuts In Pastry

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  crumbled Roquefort - (3 1/2 oz) -- chilled
                        = (or other crumbly blue cheese)
  6        tablespoons  fresh bread crumbs -- lightly toasted,
                        and cooled
     1/3           cup  chopped walnuts - (1 oz) -- toasted, and
                        finely chopped
  4              small  firm-ripe Anjou pears with stems
  1              slice  firm white sandwich bread
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry - (1/2 lb) -- thawed
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Mash together cheese, bread crumbs, and walnuts together with a fork; add pepper, to taste.  Freeze mixture just until firm, about 10 minutes.

Scoop out center of bottom of each pear with large end of a melon-ball cutter, then continue to remove core to make a 1/4-cup cavity.  Fill each cavity evenly with cheese mixture and seal bottom with a small piece of bread.

Roll out pastry 1/16-inch thick into a 15-inch square on a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin.  Cut dough into quarters to make 4 equal pieces.

Stand 1 pear in center of a pastry square and brush pear all over with egg.  Bring 1 corner of pastry up toward top of pear, pressing it against pear to adhere.  Repeat with adjacent corner, then generously brush extending pastry fold with egg before pressing closely against side of the pear.  Repeat process with remaining 2 corners.  Fold top points of pastry 1/4-inch down and brush with egg.  Transfer wrapped pear to a buttered large shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan and chill while wrapping remaining pears (make sure pears are 5 inches apart in baking pan).

Chill wrapped pears 30 minutes.

Bake pears in middle of oven 20 minutes, or until fruit is just tender when pierced with a knife and pastry is golden and cooked through (pastry will shrink a bit).  Cool pears at least 15 minutes before serving warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                            Perfect Rib Roast

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy Pam Anderson
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     three-rib standing rib roast - (7 lbs)
                        = (the first cut, aged if possible, set
                        at room temperature for up to 3 hours,
                        and tied)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Adjust oven rack to low position and preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Heat a large roasting pan over 2 burners set at medium-high heat.  Place roast in hot pan and sear on all sides until nicely browned and about 1/2 cup of fat has rendered, 6 to 8 minutes.

Remove roast from pan.  Set a wire rack in pan; set roast on rack.  Generously season meat with salt and pepper.

Place roast in oven and roast until a meat thermometer registers 130 degrees for medium-rare, about 3 1/2 hours.  If roast is done sooner than you expect, simply turn oven as low as possible (preferably 150 to 170 degrees) and let stand until ready to serve.

Transfer roast to a cutting board, with rib bones perpendicular to board.  Using a carving fork to hold roast in place, cut along rib bones to sever meat from bones.  Set roast cut-side down and carve meat across grain into 3/4 to 1-inch-thick slices.

Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     red or yellow bell peppers, large
                        poblano chiles, or a combination
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  minced onion
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced garlic
  1                cup  coarse cornmeal or polenta
  3 1/2           cups  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  fresh or drained canned corn kernels
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh basil
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
     3/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
     1/2           cup  shredded Gruyere

Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and ribs.  Slice each chile in half from stem end to blossom end.  Arrange in a shallow, buttered baking dish.

Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion softens, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the cornmeal and stir to mix.  Slowly pour in the chicken broth, stirring to combine.  Add the cream, corn, basil, cilantro, salt, and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan.  Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the polenta becomes thick, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Fill the bell peppers with the polenta.  Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan and the Gruyere.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden and bubbling.  Serve hot.  (The peppers can be stuffed and baked the preceding day.  To serve, bring to room temperature and reheat at 350 degrees, for about 12 minutes).

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Mushrooms


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  country-style Italian bread -- (1/2" diagonally)
                        === MARINADE ===
  5        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  6              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 2 tspns dried thyme, crumbled)
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh portobello mushrooms -- stems trimmed
                        flush with caps
                        === GORGONZOLA BUTTER ===
  2             ounces  Gorgonzola - (abt 1/4 cup) -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened
                        === RED PEPPER VINAIGRETTE ===
  1                     red bell pepper -- roasted
                        = (or 1/3 cup chopped drained bottled
                        roasted red peppers)
  1         tablespoon  white-wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  water
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Fresh thyme leaves

Make the bruschetta:  Grill the bread on an oiled rack set about 4 inches over glowing coals for 1 minute on each side.

Make Marinade:  In a small bowl whisk together marinade ingredients.  Put half of mushroom caps and half of marinade in each of 2 large sealable plastic bags, arranging mushroom caps in 1 layer, and seal bags, pressing out excess air.  Marinate mushrooms at room temperature, turning bags over several times, at least 1 and up to 2 hours.

Prepare grill.

Remove mushrooms from marinade and grill 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until tender.  (Alternatively, mushrooms may be grilled in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately-high heat.)  Transfer mushrooms with tongs to a cutting board and slice thin.

Spread 1 side of bread with gorgonzola butter.

Arrange warm mushrooms on toasts and spoon vinaigrette over each bruschetta.  Garnish with thyme.

Make Gorgonzola Butter while mushrooms are marinating:  On a plate with a fork mash gorgonzola and butter together until blended well.

Make Red Pepper Vinaigrette:  In a blender blend vinaigrette ingredients with salt and pepper, to taste until smooth and emulsified.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

To roast peppers:  Using a long-handled fork char peppers over an open flame, turning, until skins are blackened, 2 to 3 minutes.  (Or broil peppers on rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 2 inches from heat, turning every 5 minutes, until skins are blistered and charred, 15 to 25 minutes.)  Transfer peppers to a bowl and let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle.  Keeping peppers whole, peel them, starting at blossom end.  Cut off tops and discard seeds and ribs.  (Wear rubber gloves when handling chilies.)

Make the bruschetta:  Grill the bread on an oiled rack set about 4 inches over glowing coals for 1 minute on each side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make Marinade:  In a small bowl whisk together marinade ingredients.  Put half of mushroom caps and half of marinade in each of 2 large sealable plastic bags, arranging mushroom caps in 1 layer, and seal bags, pressing out excess air.  Marinate mushrooms at room temperature, turning bags over several times, at least 1 and up to 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare grill.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove mushrooms from marinade and grill 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until tender.  (Alternatively, mushrooms may be grilled in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately-high heat.)  Transfer mushrooms with tongs to a cutting board and slice thin.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread 1 side of bread with gorgonzola butter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange warm mushrooms on toasts and spoon vinaigrette over each bruschetta.  Garnish with thyme.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make Gorgonzola Butter while mushrooms are marinating:  On a plate with a fork mash gorgonzola and butter together until blended well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make Red Pepper Vinaigrette:  In a blender blend vinaigrette ingredients with salt and pepper, to taste until smooth and emulsified.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To roast peppers:  Using a long-handled fork char peppers over an open flame, turning, until skins are blackened, 2 to 3 minutes.  (Or broil peppers on rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 2 inches from heat, turning every 5 minutes, until skins are blistered and charred, 15 to 25 minutes.)  Transfer peppers to a bowl and let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle.  Keeping peppers whole, peel them, starting at blossom end.  Cut off tops and discard seeds and ribs.  (Wear rubber gloves when handling chilies.)

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2              small  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2             medium  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" dice
                        = (or use left over cooked potatoes)
  3               cups  chicken broth
  1                cup  water
     1/4         pound  chorizo -- thinly sliced

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Idaho potatoes -- peeled, sliced
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              large  Spanish onions -- peeled, and
                        diced medium
  3             medium  leeks -- cleaned, chopped
  1                     bouquet garni
                        = (cheesecloth packet containing, parsley,
                        peppercorns, bay leaf, and thyme sprigs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1 1/2        bunches  watercress -- cleaned, stems
                        removed, and coarsely chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh bay scallops
                        = (rock shrimp or crabmeat can be
                        substituted)
                        Chopped chives -- for garnish

In a medium saucepan, cover 1/2 of the potatoes with cold water and a pinch of salt.  Bring to a boil and blanch until tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat, drain and reserve.

In a large pot over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the onions and leeks and stir.  Cover the pot and saute the onions and leeks until they are translucent, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.

Uncover, and add the raw potatoes, the bouquet garni, salt and pepper, chicken stock and cream, and stir.  Bring the soup to a simmer over medium heat, uncovered.  Simmer until the potatoes are soft, cooking for about 15 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Using a blender, puree the soup in batches.  Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper.  Return the soup to the pot, add the blanched potatoes, and place over medium heat.  When the soup begins to simmer, add the watercress and scallops, and cook for 30 seconds, stirring once.  Ladle the soup into hot bowls and sprinkle with chives.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Pumpkin Flan With Meringue

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  water
  6              large  eggs
  3               cups  canned solid-pack pumpkin
                        = (slightly less than two 15-oz cans)
  1                can  cream of coconut - (15 oz)
  1                can  sweetened condensed milk - (14 oz)
  1                can  evaporated milk - (12 oz)
                        === FOR MERINGUE ===
  4              large  egg whites
  1                cup  sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a dry heavy saucepan, cook sugar over moderately-low heat, stirring slowly with a fork (to help sugar melt evenly), until melted and pale golden.  Cook caramel, without stirring, swirling pan, until deep golden.  Pour caramel into a 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish and tilt dish to coat bottom.  Cool caramel.

Melt butter and cool.  In a large bowl, whisk together flour and water until smooth and whisk in butter and remaining flan ingredients until smooth.  Pour custard into baking dish and put dish in a larger baking pan.  Add enough water to pan to reach halfway up side of dish and bake custard in middle of oven 1 hour, or until set.  Remove dish from pan and keep temperature at 350 degrees.

Make the meringue:  In a bowl, with an electric mixer beat whites until they just hold soft peaks.  Gradually beat in sugar and beat meringue until it holds stiff, glossy peaks.

Spread meringue evenly over custard and bake in middle of oven (not in a water bath) until golden, about 5 minutes.  Cool dessert on a rack.  Chill dessert until cold, about 4 hours, and up to 1 day.  Cut dessert into squares.

This recipe yields 8 to 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     miniature pumpkins - (3 1/2" to 4" dia)
                        = (preferably Jack-Be-Little)
  1 1/4           cups  diced (1/4") peeled seeded
                        fresh sugar or cheese pumpkin
  2               cups  chicken stock
  2               cups  water
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     3/4           cup  Arborio rice
  1              ounce  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano - (1/3 cup)
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Roast whole miniature pumpkins in a small roasting pan with 1/2-inch water, tightly covered with foil, until very tender, 45 to 50 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Cut out tops and reserve, then scoop out seeds.  Discard water from roasting pan, then return pumpkin shells to pan and keep warm, covered with foil.

Meanwhile, make risotto while pumpkins roast:  Cook diced pumpkin in a medium saucepan two-thirds full of simmering water until tender, 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain in a colander.

Bring stock and 2 cups water to a simmer in a small saucepan and keep at a bare simmer.

Cook onion in oil in a 2- to 2 1/2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes.  Add rice and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Add 1 cup simmering stock and cook at a strong simmer, stirring constantly, until stock is absorbed.

Continue simmering, adding stock 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and letting each addition be absorbed before adding the next, until rice is tender and creamy-looking but still al dente, about 18 minutes total.  (There may be broth left over.)

Remove from heat and stir in diced pumpkin, cheese, and butter, stirring until butter is melted.  Season with salt and pepper, and cover to keep warm.

Put each pumpkin shell on a plate, fill with risotto, and cover with reserved tops.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  blanched whole almonds
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar
  1 1/4           cups  cold unsalted butter - (2 1/2 sticks) -- cut into pieces
  3 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour

  1              large  egg
  2 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2               cups  raspberry jam
  3        tablespoons  milk - (about)
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar - (about)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  4               cups  dry red wine (preferably German)
  1                cup  water
  2 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1              small  yellow onion -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  10                    peppercorns
  2                     medium whole bay leaves
  4                     whole cloves
                        === SAUERBRATEN ===
  3             pounds  boneless top round roast with
                        a thin outer layer of fat
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter or margarine
  2                     medium-size carrots -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  2              large  yellow onions -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  sweet sherry
     1/2           cup  medium-dry red wine (preferably German)
  1                cup  seedless raisins
  1         tablespoon  red currant jelly - (to 2)
                        = (or orange marmalade) -- if needed to mellow
                        the tartness of the gravy

For the Marinade:  Bring all ingredients to a fairly rapid boil in an uncovered medium-size heavy saucepan over moderate heat and cook 5 minutes.

For the Sauerbraten:  Place the beef in a large, heatproof, nonmetallic bowl.  Pour in the hot marinade and cool to room temperature.  Add the parsley, turn the beef in the marinade, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 4 days, turning the beef in the marinade every 8 hours.

On the 5th day, remove the beef from the marinade and pat it dry.  Strain the marinade, reserving both liquid and solids.  Rub the beef with half the salt and pepper, then dredge with flour.

Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium-size heavy kettle over moderate heat, add the beef and brown well on all sides; this will take 8 to 10 minutes.  Transfer the beef to a plate, pour off and discard all casserole drippings, then add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the casserole and melt over moderate heat.  Add the carrots, onions, and reserved marinade solids and saute, stirring often, for 5 minutes.  Return the beef to the casserole, add 2 cups of the reserved marinade and the tomato paste, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Adjust the heat so the marinade bubbles gently, cover the kettle with a round of foil, set the lid in place, then simmer the sauerbraten 3 1/2 to 4 hours, turning occasionally, until tender.  Carefully replace the foil and kettle lid each time you turn the meat.

As soon as the sauerbraten is tender, remove it to a large plate and cover loosely with foil to keep warm.  Skim as much fat as possible from the marinade, then strain it, discarding the solids.  Return the marinade to the casserole, add the remaining reserved marinade along with the sugar, sherry, red wine, and raisins and boil, uncovered, over high heat for 5 to 7 minutes, until reduced by half and of good gravy consistency.  Taste, and if the gravy is too sour, smooth in 1 to 2 tablespoons of the jelly.  Season the gravy with the remaining salt and pepper.

To serve:  Slice the sauerbraten across the grain and about 1/4-inch thick, arrange on a large heated platter, overlapping the slices slightly, and smother with the gravy.  Pass any extra gravy separately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  1              small  quince -- (optional), cored,
                        and coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh parsley with stems
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh sage leaves
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
     1/2      teaspoon  juniper berries
     1/4      teaspoon  celery seed
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted
                        === GRAVY ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  apple cider
  2               cups  chicken stock
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a pot large enough to hold the turkey, combine all of the brine ingredients and stir.  Add the turkey to the pot, cover, and refrigerate for 8 to 10 hours.  Remove the turkey from the pot, discard the brine, and rinse the turkey thoroughly under cold water.  Pat dry.

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.

Combine the onion, celery, apple, parsnip, quince, herbs, and spices in a bowl and toss.  Spoon into the cavity of the turkey.

Truss the turkey, tying its legs together tightly with kitchen twine.  Place the turkey on a roasting rack set in a large roasting pan.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil, place in the oven, and roast for 2 1/2 hours.

Uncover the turkey and reserve the foil.  Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees.  Brush the turkey with half of the melted butter and cook for 30 minutes.  Brush on the remaining butter and continue cooking for about 1 hour and 15 minutes longer, basting every 30 minutes, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 150 degrees.  (The internal temperature will rise 10 degrees while the turkey rests).

Transfer the turkey to a cutting board.  Pour off the fat from the roasting pan.  Spoon the vegetables from the cavity of the turkey into the pan; cover the turkey loosely with the reserved foil, and let rest for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Gravy:  Add the butter to the roasting pan with the vegetables.  Place the pan over medium heat, using 2 burners if necessary.  Use a wooden spoon to stir and brown the vegetables lightly, 3 to 4 minutes.

Add the flour and cook for 3 more minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in the cider, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced and thickened, 2 to 3 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pan to release the turkey drippings.

Transfer the gravy to a 3-quart saucepan, add the chicken stock, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the gravy has thickened, about 10 minutes.  Pour any juices that have accumulated around the turkey into the pan and continue cooking for 1 more minute.  Season with the salt and pepper.  Strain the gravy into a warm sauceboat.

Carve the turkey and serve with gravy.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

           Roasted Striped Bass With Chive And Sour Cream Sauce

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR SAUCE ===
     2/3           cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  water
  4          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh chives
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR FISH ===
  6             pieces  striped bass fillet with skin - (5 oz ea)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     lemon -- cut into 6 wedges
  2             ounces  onion sprouts  - (2 cups)
                        = (or garlic chive sprouts)
                        Spicy Garlic Potatoes And Zucchini -- (see recipe)

For the Sauce:  Blend sour cream, water, juice, salt, and chives in a blender until mixture just turns pale green.  Season with pepper.

For the Fish:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Remove any pin bones from fish with tweezers or needle-nose pliers and pat fish dry with paper towels.  Score skin in several places with a thin sharp knife to prevent fish from curling (do not cut through flesh) and season fish with salt and pepper.

Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking, then sear fish, skin-sides down, in 2 batches until skin is golden brown and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes (fish will not be fully cooked).  Transfer, skin-sides up, to an oiled shallow baking pan.

Roast fish, uncovered, in middle of oven until just cooked through, 7 to 8 minutes.

Spoon 3 tablespoons sauce onto each of 6 plates and top with Spicy Garlic Potatoes And Zucchini.  Squeeze 1 lemon wedge over each fillet, then place fish, skin-sides up, over vegetables.  Top fish with sprouts.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TERIYAKI SAUCE ===
  1              piece  fresh gingerroot - (abt 2")
     2/3           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)
                        = (or medium-dry Sherry)
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  sugar
                        === SALMON ===
  4                     salmon steaks, 1/2" thick
  4                     carrots
  2                     onions
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        === GARNISH ===
  4                     scallion greens -- cut decoratively

To make Teriyaki Sauce:  Peel and chop ginger to yield 3 tablespoons.  In a small saucepan simmer sauce ingredients, stirring until sugar is dissolved, until reduced to about 1 cup and cool to room temperature in a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water.

In a baking dish large enough to just hold salmon steaks in 1 layer, marinate salmon in sauce, turning to coat, 15 minutes.

While salmon is marinating, cut carrots in half and slice into 1/4-inch slices.  Peel onions and slice into 1/4-inch slices.

In a large saucepan of boiling salted water, blanch vegetables 2 minutes, or until crisp-tender, and drain in a colander.  Transfer vegetables to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking and drain well.

In a 10-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) heat oil over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Transfer salmon to skillet with a metal spatula, letting excess sauce drip off and reserving, and reduce heat to moderate.  Saute salmon, turning once, until just cooked through and browned well, about 2 1/2 minutes on each side, and transfer to 2 plates.

Pour off oil and cook vegetables, stirring, 1 minute.  Add reserved sauce and boil, stirring, 1 minute, or until thickened.

Spoon vegetables and sauce over salmon and garnish with scallion greens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  6             ounces  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems discarded,
                        and caps chopped coarse - (abt 1/2 cup)

                        = (abt 1 1/2 lbs total)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === CREAMED MUSHROOMS ===
  1              large  shallot -- minced
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/2         pound  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems discarded,
                        and caps chopped coarsely
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  white-wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
                        = (or a rounded 1/4 tspn dried
                        rosemary, crumbled)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

In a shallow baking pan, drizzle oil over shiitakes and toss to coat.  Roast mushrooms, stirring once or twice, 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden.  Keep oven at 450 degrees.

Mince the roasted shiitakes and in a shallow bowl, stir together with bread crumbs and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Have ready in separate shallow bowls seasoned flour and egg.

Working with 1 chicken breast at a time, dredge in flour, shaking off excess, and dip in egg, letting excess drip off.  Coat chicken with mushroom mixture, gently knocking off excess, and transfer to a plate.  Chicken may be prepared up to this point 2 hours ahead and chilled, uncovered, on a rack.

In a 12-inch non-stick skillet, heat oil over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking and saute chicken until golden, about 1 minute on each side.  Transfer chicken with tongs to baking pan and roast in middle of oven 10 minutes, or until just cooked through.

Make Creamed Mushrooms while chicken is roasting:  Wipe out skillet and cook shallot in butter over moderately-low heat, stirring, until softened.  Add shiitake and salt and pepper, to taste, and saute over moderately-high heat, stirring, until mushrooms are softened and browned lightly.  Stir in wine, vinegar, and rosemary and boil until all liquid is evaporated.  Add cream and simmer, stirring, until thickened slightly, about 1 minute.  Season mixture with salt and pepper.

Serve chicken with creamed mushrooms.

In a 2-quart heavy saucepan cook onion and chicken legs in butter over moderate heat, stirring, 5 minutes.  Drain tomatoes and measure 1 cup packed, reserving remainder for another use.  Stir tomatoes into chicken mixture with water, cayenne, to taste, and cumin and simmer, covered, 1 hour.

Working over pan, pull meat off bones with tongs, returning it to pan, and discard bones.  Simmer chicken mixture, uncovered, until most liquid is evaporated, about 20 minutes.  Stir in salt and cool chicken mixture.  Chicken mixture may be made 1 day ahead and cooled completely before being chilled, covered.  Bring mixture to room temperature before proceeding.

Halve cucumber lengthwise and crosswise and seed.  Cut pieces lengthwise into very thin strips.  In a bowl toss cucumber with 1 tablespoon lime juice and season with salt and pepper.  Halve, peel, and pit avocado.  Cut avocado into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  In a small bowl toss avocado with remaining lime juice and season with salt and pepper.

Cut 1-inch off 1 edge of each tortilla.  On a work surface arrange 1 tortilla with cut edge farthest from you and smear a small piece of avocado lengthwise along cut edge of tortilla (this will help the "wrap" hold together).

Spread about 1/4 of the chicken mixture across lower fourth of tortilla about 1-inch from bottom.  Top chicken mixture with 1/2 cup cilantro sprigs.  Top cilantro with 4 or 5 avocado slices and top avocado with about 1/4 of the cucumber

Beginning with bottom edge, tightly roll up tortilla and arrange seam-side down on work surface.  Make 3 more wraps with remaining tortillas, chicken mixture, cilantro, avocado, and cucumber.  Wraps may be made 6 hours ahead and chilled, individually wrapped in plastic wrap.  Serve chilled or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2             pounds  small yellow-fleshed potatoes
                        = (preferably fingerling)
  5              large  garlic cloves -- smashed

Transfer potatoes with a slotted spoon to a bowl, then add zucchini to oil in skillet and saute over moderately-high heat, stirring, until hot, about 1 minute.  Return potatoes to skillet and stir in salt.

  3        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  3        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  honey
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- toasted

  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  1           teaspoon  dark brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne -- or more, to taste
                        === SALAD ===
     1/2         pound  bacon -- sliced
                        = (abt twelve 1/4"-thick slices)
  12              cups  spinach leaves - (loosely packed) -- washed well, dried,
                        stems trimmed
  6               cups  frisee - (loosely packed) -- stems trimmed,
                        washed, dried, and torn bite-size pieces
     2/3           cup  thinly-sliced red onions
  3              small  pears -- halved, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
  6            bunches  grapes - (small bunches)

Honey Sesame Vinaigrette:  Whisk together the vinegar, mustard, honey, sesame seeds, garlic, and salt and pepper, to taste, in a bowl.  Gradually whisk in the oil.  Set aside.

Curried Cashews:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

On a baking sheet, toast the cashews until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, combine the melted butter, rosemary, curry powder, brown sugar, salt, and cayenne in a bowl.  Add the toasted cashews while they are still hot and toss with a rubber spatula so they are thoroughly coated with the spices and butter.  Leave the oven on to cook the bacon.

Salad:  Put the bacon on a baking sheet, place it in the oven, and cook until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove the bacon from the pan and cut the slices into 1-inch pieces.  Keep the bacon warm.

Tear spinach into pieces if leaves are large.  In a large bowl, combine the spinach, frisee, red onions, and sliced pears.  Toss with enough vinaigrette to coat everything well.

Divide the salad among 6 plates.  Garnish each salad with pieces of warm bacon and spiced cashews.  Set a grape cluster on the side of each salad.

The bacon can be cooked ahead, stored in the refrigerator, and reheated.  The cashews can be cooked early in the day and stored at room temperature.  The vinaigrette can be stored refrigerated, tightly covered, for several days.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- softened
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  2              large  egg yolks
  3 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten with
  2          teaspoons  water -- for egg wash
                        Green decorating sugar -- as needed
                        Candied cherries -- sliced thin

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a bowl with an electric mixer, cream the butter with the granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, add the salt, the vanilla, and the egg yolks, and beat the mixture until it is smooth.  Add the flour and beat the dough until it is just combined.  Pack the dough into a cookie press fitted with the wreath disk and press cookies about 1-inch apart onto cool, ungreased baking sheets.

Brush the cookies lightly with the egg wash, sprinkle them with the decorating sugar, and arrange the cherry slices decoratively on them.  Bake the cookies in batches in the middle of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges are pale golden.

Transfer the cookies to racks and let them cool.  (Do not let the cookies cool on the sheets.)  The cookies may be made 2 months in advance and kept frozen in airtight containers.

This recipe yields 120 cookies.

Comments:  Spritz cookies-from the German Spritzen, meaning "to squirt", are formed into fanciful shapes when the dough is piped through a cookie press.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cloves
     1/2           cup  well-chilled heavy cream
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  dark corn syrup
                        Sliced almonds -- for garnish

Into a large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, and spices.  In a medium bowl with an electric mixer beat cream until it just holds stiff peaks.  In another large bowl beat butter and sugar until mixture is light and fluffy.  On low speed, beat in corn syrup and whipped cream, beating until cream is just combined.  Add flour mixture and beat until combined well.  Form dough into a disk.  Chill disk, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 2 hours, and up to 2 days.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Cut dough into quarters and work with 1 quarter at a time, keeping remaining dough covered and chilled.  Using a rolling pin with cover dusted with flour, roll out dough into a round on a floured pastry cloth, rolling dough as thin as possible (less than 1/8-inch thick and about 14 inches in diameter) and with assorted 2 to 3-inch cutters cut out cookies.  Carefully transfer cookies as cut to ungreased baking sheets with a metal spatula, arranging them about 1/2-inch apart, and top each with an almond slice.  Reroll scraps and cut out more cookies in same manner.

Bake cookies in batches in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until cookies puff and then collapse slightly, about 6 minutes.  Cool cookies on sheets 1 minute and transfer with metal spatula to racks to cool completely.  Make more cookies with remaining dough in same manner.  Cookies keep in airtight containers at room temperature 1 week.

This recipe yields 150 cookies.

  60                    shao mai wrappers (round wrappers) -- see * Note,
                        thawed if frozen
                        Cornstarch -- for dusting
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  minced scallion

     2/3           cup  minced cabbage
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh coriander
  1              large  egg -- beaten lightly
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  nam pla -- see * Note
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  white-wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2           teaspoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  shredded fresh mint leaves
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh coriander
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        Coriander sprigs -- for garnish

* Note:  Available at Oriental and Southeast Asian markets, specialty foods shops, and many supermarkets.

Make the Filling:  In a bowl, combine well the scallion, the pork, the ginger, the bell pepper, the cabbage, the garlic, the oil, the soy sauce, the coriander, the egg, and salt and pepper, to taste, and chill the filling for at least 1 hour or overnight.

Put about 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of 1 of the wrappers and moisten the edge of the wrapper.  Gather the edge of the wrapper up and around the filling and form a waist with the wrapper, pushing the dumpling from the bottom and keeping the filling level with the top of the wrapper.  (The filling should not be enclosed.)  Continue to make dumplings with the remaining wrappers and filling in the same manner and arrange them in 1 layer on a baking sheet lined with waxed paper dusted lightly with the cornstarch.  (The dumplings may be prepared up to this point 8 hours in advance and kept uncovered and chilled or 1 month in advance and kept covered tightly and frozen.  If the dumplings are frozen, do not thaw them in advance.)

In a large non-stick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it fry half the dumplings, flat-sides down, over moderately-high heat for 1 minute, or until the undersides are golden.  Add 1/2 cup water and steam the dumplings, covered, over moderate heat for 3 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through.  (If using frozen dumplings, fry them, frozen, for 1 minute, or until the undersides are golden, and steam them, adding 3/4 cup water per batch, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through.)  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet and cook the remaining dumplings in the same manner.  Garnish the dumplings with the coriander sprigs and serve them with the sauce.

Make the Sauce:  In a bowl whisk together the nam pla, the lime juice, the vinegar, the sugar, the gingerroot, the mint, the coriander, salt and pepper, to taste.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Make the Filling:  In a bowl, combine well the scallion, the pork, the ginger, the bell pepper, the cabbage, the garlic, the oil, the soy sauce, the coriander, the egg, and salt and pepper, to taste, and chill the filling for at least 1 hour or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put about 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of 1 of the wrappers and moisten the edge of the wrapper.  Gather the edge of the wrapper up and around the filling and form a waist with the wrapper, pushing the dumpling from the bottom and keeping the filling level with the top of the wrapper.  (The filling should not be enclosed.)  Continue to make dumplings with the remaining wrappers and filling in the same manner and arrange them in 1 layer on a baking sheet lined with waxed paper dusted lightly with the cornstarch.  (The dumplings may be prepared up to this point 8 hours in advance and kept uncovered and chilled or 1 month in advance and kept covered tightly and frozen.  If the dumplings are frozen, do not thaw them in advance.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large non-stick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it fry half the dumplings, flat-sides down, over moderately-high heat for 1 minute, or until the undersides are golden.  Add 1/2 cup water and steam the dumplings, covered, over moderate heat for 3 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through.  (If using frozen dumplings, fry them, frozen, for 1 minute, or until the undersides are golden, and steam them, adding 3/4 cup water per batch, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through.)  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet and cook the remaining dumplings in the same manner.  Garnish the dumplings with the coriander sprigs and serve them with the sauce.

  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- sliced
  1                can  tomato paste - (6 oz)
  3               cans  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        A few pinches sugar
  1                     handful chopped fresh Italian parsley
  8                     basil leaves
                        A few pinches grated Locatelli Romano
  1                can  tomato sauce - (15 oz)
  2               cups  water

Prepare the Meats:  In a large skillet, brown all the meats in the olive oil.  There is no need to cook the meats all the way through.  Remember to pierce the sausage before cooking to allow fats and water to be released.  Set meats aside.

Prepare Meatballs:  Combine all ingredients except the olive oil in a large bowl.  Form the meatballs with your hands (there should be about 12).  Fry in the olive oil over medium heat until browned, but not cooked all the way through.  Set aside.

Prepare the Gravy:  Saute garlic in the olive oil in the same skillet used to saute the meats.  Add tomato paste and cook for a few minutes.  In a large saucepot, combine the remaining ingredients except the meats and the tomato paste-garlic mixture and simmer.

When the mixture begins to bubble, add all the meats and the meatballs and the tomato paste-garlic mixture.  Stir about every 15 minutes, being sure to scrape the bottom of the pot to prevent burning and sticking.  If the gravy seems too thick, add a little water at a time.  Simmer for about 3 hours, keeping the lid of the pot slightly askew to prevent condensation of the gravy.

This recipe yields about 1 quart.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CRUST ===
  1                cup  slivered almonds
  2               cups  graham cracker crumbs - (7 oz)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
                        === FOR FILLING ===
  8             ounces  fine-quality white chocolate
  4           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- softened
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  4              whole  large eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  2               cups  fresh raspberries - (11 oz)
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Fresh raspberries -- for garnish

Make Crust:  Finely grind almonds and crumbs in a food processor and add butter, blending until combined.  Press over bottom and 2/3 up side of a 10-inch springform pan.

Make Filling:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Melt chocolate in double boiler or a large metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring until smooth, and remove from heat.

Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer at medium speed until fluffy, then beat in sugar.  Add whole eggs and yolks, 1 at a time, beating well at low speed and scraping down bowl after each addition.

Beat in flour and vanilla until just combined, then add melted chocolate in a slow stream, beating until filling is well-combined.

Arrange berries in 1 layer over crust and pour filling into crust.  Bake in the middle of the oven until cake is set 3 inches from edge but center is still wobbly when pan is gently shaken, 45 to 55 minutes.

Run a thin knife around edge of cake to loosen, then cool completely in pan on a rack.  (Cake will continue to set as it cools.)  Serve at room temperature or chilled.

This recipe yields 1 (10-inch) cheesecake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR MUSHROOM FILLING ===
  3               cups  water
  2             ounces  dried porcini mushrooms - (abt 1 cup)
  2             pounds  fresh white mushrooms
  2              large  zucchini - (abt 1 lb)
  1              large  onion
  3                     garlic cloves
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  6        tablespoons  sherry
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  5               cups  whole milk
  4 1/2         ounces  freshly-grated Parmesan - (abt 1 1/2 cups)
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        === LASAGNE ===
  18                    sheets dry no-boil lasagne, 7" by 3 1/2" - -- (abt 1 lb)
     1/2         pound  freshly-grated mozzarella - (abt 2 cups)
  1 1/2         ounces  freshly-grated Parmesan - (abt 1/2 cup)

Make Filling:  In a small saucepan bring water to a boil and remove pan from heat.  Stir in the porcini.  Soak the porcini 20 minutes.  Lift out the porcini, squeezing out excess liquid, and reserve soaking liquid.  In a sieve, rinse the porcini to remove any grit and pat dry.  Chop the porcini and transfer to a large bowl.  Simmer reserved soaking liquid until reduced to about 1/4 cup.  Pour liquid through a sieve lined with a dampened paper towel into bowl with the porcini.

Quarter white mushrooms and in a food processor pulse in 3 batches until finely chopped.  Cut zucchini into 1/4-inch dice.  Chop onion and mince garlic.

In a 12-inch heavy skillet heat 1 tablespoon butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and cook 1/3 white mushrooms with 2 tablespoons sherry, stirring, until liquid mushrooms give off is evaporated and they begin to brown.  Add mushroom mixture to the porcini.  Cook remaining mushrooms in 2 batches in butter with remaining sherry in same manner and add to the porcini mixture.

In skillet cook zucchini in 1 tablespoon butter until tender and stir into the porcini mixture.  In skillet cook onion in remaining tablespoon butter, stirring, until softened.  Stir in garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Stir onion into mushroom mixture until combined.  Filling may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.

Make Sauce:  In a 3-quart heavy saucepan melt butter over moderately-low heat and whisk in flour.  Cook roux, whisking, 3 minutes and whisk in milk.  Bring sauce to a boil, whisking constantly, and simmer, whisking occasionally, 3 minutes.  Stir in Parmesan, mustard, and salt.  Remove pan from heat and cover surface of sauce with waxed paper.  Sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring sauce to room temperature before proceeding.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees and butter a 13- by 9-inch (3-quart) baking dish.

Assemble Lasagne:  Spread 1 1/4 cups sauce in baking dish and cover with 3 pasta sheets, making sure they don't touch each other.  Spread one third filling over pasta sheets in dish and top with 3 more pasta sheets, gently pressing down layers to remove air pockets.  Top pasta sheets with 1/3 mozzarella.  Continue layering in same manner with sauce, pasta sheets, filling, and mozzarella, ending with mozzarella (dish will be filled to rim).  Spread remaining sauce over top and sprinkle with Parmesan.

On a foil-lined large baking sheet, bake lasagne in middle of oven until bubbling and golden, about 45 minutes.  Let lasagne stand 20 minutes.  Lasagne may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring lasagne to room temperature and reheat before serving.
