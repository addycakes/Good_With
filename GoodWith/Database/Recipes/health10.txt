Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           servings  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/2           cup  yellow masa corn flour
  1           teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  1              pound  red snapper fillets, -- cut 2" pieces
  8             medium  corn tortillas -- buy a few extra in
                        case some break
  1               head  romaine lettuce -- outer leaves
                        removed and remaining leaves sliced into
                        1/4" strips
  5             medium  red radishes -- thinly sliced
  2             medium  scallions -- thinly sliced
  10            medium  cherry tomatoes -- quartered
     1/4           cup  shredded red cabbage
     3/4           cup  low-fat plain yogurt
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1           teaspoon  canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  fresh cilantro sprigs -- for garnish

Preheat broiler to high.  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil (or nonstick aluminum foil) and coat with cooking spray (helps to make fish crispy).

Place corn flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic powder and paprika in a large bowl; mix to combine.  Add snapper to corn flour mixture and toss to coat

Place seasoned fish on prepared baking sheet and lightly coat tops of fish with cooking spray.  Broil until crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.

Meanwhile, wrap tortillas in aluminum foil and place in oven to warm; place on rack furthest from heat source.

To make salad, combine lettuce, radishes, scallions, tomatoes and cabbage in a medium bowl; set aside.

To make sauce, combine yogurt, lime juice and chipotle peppers in a blender; blend until smooth.

To assemble, place a tortilla on a plate.  Top with 2 to 3 pieces of fish, 1/2 cup of salad and 2 tablespoons of sauce; roll up and repeat with remaining ingredients.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 2 filled tortillas per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 7

Comments:  This casual street food is everywhere in Baja, Mexico.  The fish is usually deep-fried, but we oven-fried it for a healthier crunch.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  15 1/2        ounces  canned chickpeas -- rinsed, drained
     1/4           cup  chopped onions
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley or cilantro
  1             medium  garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  2           teaspoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  Tribe of Two Sheiks Sesame Tahini -- or other brand
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  8             pieces  lettuce
  4              large  wheat pitas

Combine chickpeas, onion, parsley, garlic, cumin, coriander, salt and baking soda in a food processor or blender.  Process until mixture is coarsely pureed and transfer to large bowl.  Stir in flour; shape mixture into 4 large patties and let stand for 15 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Add patties and cook until golden brown, flipping once, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer skillet to oven and bake 10 minutes more.

Meanwhile, whisk together tahini, water and lemon juice in a small bowl.

To assemble sandwiches, place 2 lettuce leaves inside each pita, add 1 falafel patty and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of tahini dressing.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 6

Comments:  Enjoy this usually 'sinful' street food by oven-baking it instead of deep-frying.  The addition of fresh lemon juice and water to the tahini makes a wonderful lightened-up sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  corn on the cob -- kernels removed with
                        a knife - (abt 2 cups)
  1 1/2           cups  shredded green cabbage
  1             medium  sweet red pepper -- chopped
  1             medium  green pepper -- chopped
     1/2        medium  red onion -- chopped
  1             medium  celery stalk -- chopped
  1                cup  apple cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  table salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  ground turmeric
     1/3           cup  sugar substitute -- or to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  yellowfin tuna, abt 1" thk - (four 6-oz st
                        = (or other type of tuna)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2 1/2    tablespoons  Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning
                        Blends Blackened Redfish Magic
                        = (or similar blackening seasoning)

To make chow chow, place corn, cabbage, red and green pepper, onion and celery in a large saucepan.  Mix together vinegar, salt, dry mustard, turmeric and sugar substitute in a small bowl; pour over vegetables and bring to a boil.  Immediately reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently for 15 minutes; allow to cool.

Meanwhile, preheat grill (or coat a large skillet with cooking spray and place over high heat).

Wash and dry fish; rub fish all over with oil.  Place seasoning on a plate and dredge fish in seasoning on all sides to coat.  (Note: To make your own blackening seasoning, combine together 1 tablespoons sweet paprika, 2 teaspoon finely minced fresh thyme (or 2/3 teaspoon dried thyme), 2 teaspoon finely minced fresh oregano (or 2/3 teaspoon dried oregano), 2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon white pepper, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon garlic powder and 1 teaspoon onion powder.)

Grill fish for 4 minutes on one side; flip and grill for another 2 to 5 minutes depending on thickness and desired degree of doneness (cook for longer for more well-done).  (Note: Reduce heat slightly if seasoning begins to burn.)

This recipe yields 4 servings; 1 piece of fish and about 1 cup of chow chow per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 7

Comments:  This traditional American relish recipe has endless variations: you can add pearl onions, green tomatoes, cauliflower, green beans, cucumber or even snap beans.  Cut back on the cayenne if you cannot handle a lot of heat.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1 1/4         pounds  uncooked boneless skinless chicken breast -- cut 16 strips total
                        = (or 1 1/4 lbs boneless skinless
                        tenderloins)
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  fat-free margarine
  4          teaspoons  hot pepper sauce -- or to taste
     1/2           cup  fat-free blue cheese dressing
  4             medium  celery stalks -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 4 sticks each

Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat.

Place chicken on a plate and sprinkle with salt and paprika.  Add chicken to skillet and cook, turning occasionally until lightly browned and cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Add garlic; reduce heat to low, stir and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Remove skillet from heat; stir in margarine and hot sauce until margarine melts.  Serve chicken with blue cheese dressing and celery on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 4 pieces of chicken, 4 celery sticks and 2 tablespoons of dressing per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  Take the spiciness of this kid-favorite dish down a notch by adding just a few drops of hot sauce to the mixture.  Fat-free ranch instead of the fat-free blue cheese adds even more to the cool factor.

Consider using reduced-fat dressing for children; not fat-free.

  1              pound  mushrooms -- sliced (abt 6 cups)
  1 1/2           cups  fat-free chicken broth
  1                cup  fat-free skim milk
  4          teaspoons  arrowroot powder
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  dried tarragon
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt -- or more to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or more to taste
     1/4           cup  fat-free sour cream
  3               cups  cooked chicken breast -- cut bite sized
  1                cup  frozen peas and carrots -- thawed
  3        tablespoons  Kraft Non-Fat Grated Cheese Topping -- or other brand

Cook noodles according to package directions with added salt; drain and set aside.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Coat a 9- by 13-inch pan with cooking spray.

Heat 1 tablespoon of margarine and vinegar together in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add mushrooms; cook until soft, stirring, about 5 minutes.  Remove mushrooms and set aside.

Whisk broth, milk and arrowroot together in a medium-size saucepan until smooth.  Stir in remaining tablespoon of margarine; set over medium heat.  Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until thickened and boiling, about 8 minutes.  Stir in thyme, tarragon, salt and pepper.  Remove sauce from heat; stir in sour cream.

Combine cooked noodles, chicken, mushrooms, peas and carrots, and sauce together in a large bowl.  Pour into prepared pan; sprinkle with grated topping.  Bake until bubbling and hot, and top is starting to brown, about 20 minutes.  Slice into 8 pieces and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                         Corn And Cucumber Salsa

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Salsa

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pieces  corn on the cob -- kernels removed
  1              large  cucumber -- peeled, cut in
                        half lengthwise, seeded and sliced
                        1/2"-thk pieces
     1/3           cup  diet Italian salad dressing
     1/4           cup  chopped red onion
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes

Combine all ingredients in a bowl.  Serve chilled or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings; about 1/2 cup per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 1

Comments:  This spicy salsa is sure to awaken any sleeping taste buds.  Fresh corn adds a sweet punch, but you can use frozen corn instead during winter.

Flavor Booster:  For a zesty change, brush cucumber slices with chili powder and sprinkle with fresh lime juice.  Set aside 10 minutes before using in the salsa.  Omit the red pepper flakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           servings  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- minced
  2             medium  scallions -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped snow peas
  6             ounces  canned crabmeat -- drained
  4             ounces  light cream cheese
  2          teaspoons  low-sodium soy sauce
  24                    wonton wrappers - (half of 12-oz pkg)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.

Heat oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat.  Add garlic, scallions and snow peas and sautÈ until just tender, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in crabmeat, cream cheese and soy sauce with a wooden spoon; mix gently to combine.

Place wonton wrappers on a flat surface.  Drop crab mixture by teaspoonfuls onto the center of each wrapper.  Dip a finger into water and use it to moisten edges of wrapper; fold over one corner of wrapper to make a triangle and press sides together to seal.  Create decorative lines along the edges of the wontons by pressing the tines of a fork along the bottom edge of each wonton.

Transfer filled wontons to prepared baking sheet and coat with cooking spray.  Bake until wontons are golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings; 4 crab rangoon per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  Crunchy wontons stuffed with a savory combination of crabmeat, cream cheese and vegetables.  Who would ever believe you can enjoy eating these and still lose weight?

Serve with reduced-sodium soy sauce mixed with chopped scallions or prepared sweet-and-sour or duck sauce, if desired.  Just make sure to account for any increase in PointsÆ values.

Spoon a generous teaspoon of filling onto each triangle, leaving bare pastry at top and bottom of triangle.  Roll each triangle from wide end to narrow tip.

Spread out rolled wedges on prepared cookie sheet.  Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Remove from oven and let sit 5 minutes.

Move rugalach close together so they are just touching each other.  Place powdered sugar in a sieve and dust over rugalach.  (Note: These cookies taste best served warm.  Reheat for 5 minutes in a preheated 325 degrees oven.  Do not microwave ñ it will toughen the dough.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  canola oil -- divided
  1              pound  sole - (four 4-oz fillets)
  2             pieces  fresh ginger root - (abt 2" ea) -- peeled, and
                        cut into thin matchsticks
  2        tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce -- divided
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger root
  8             ounces  bok choy, baby-variety -- cut in half
                        lengthwise and washed in cold water

Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; add 1 tablespoon of oil.  Place fish in skillet and cook, gently flipping fillets so they do not break apart, about 2 to 3 minutes per side; remove fish to a plate and cover to keep warm.

Add remaining tablespoon of oil to same skillet.  When hot, add ginger matchsticks; cook for 3 minutes, turning once.  Add 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and cook until all liquid is absorbed; remove ginger from skillet.

Off heat, coat skillet with cooking spray; add garlic and minced ginger and cook for 30 seconds.  Add bok choy and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes; stir in remaining tablespoon of soy sauce.

To serve, place 1/2 cup of bok choy in the center of 4 plates.  Top each with 1 piece of fish and 2 tablespoons of crispy ginger.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  Sole, a quick-cooking, mild fish, is topped with slightly spicy, pan-fried ginger for a perfect flavor combo.  Bright green bok choy adds a wonderful color contrast.

Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; add 1 tablespoon of oil.  Place fish in skillet and cook, gently flipping fillets so they do not break apart, about 2 to 3 minutes per side; remove fish to a plate and cover to keep warm.

<DirT>
Add remaining tablespoon of oil to same skillet.  When hot, add ginger matchsticks; cook for 3 minutes, turning once.  Add 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and cook until all liquid is absorbed; remove ginger from skillet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Off heat, coat skillet with cooking spray; add garlic and minced ginger and cook for 30 seconds.  Add bok choy and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes; stir in remaining tablespoon of soy sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, place 1/2 cup of bok choy in the center of 4 plates.  Top each with 1 piece of fish and 2 tablespoons of crispy ginger.

Comments:  Sole, a quick-cooking, mild fish, is topped with slightly spicy, pan-fried ginger for a perfect flavor combo.  Bright green bok choy adds a wonderful color contrast.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  2             medium  leeks, white parts only -- chopped
  8             medium  ripe beefsteak tomatoes - (abt 3 lbs) -- cored, chopped
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1              piece  bay leaf
  4               cups  vegetable broth
  12            ounces  fat-free evaporated milk
     1/4    tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme -- for garnish

Coat a large saucepan with cooking spray and set pan over medium heat.  Add leeks and sautÈ until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes, thyme and bay leaf; cook until tomatoes break down, about 5 minutes.

Add broth and bring to a simmer; reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and remove bay leaf.

Working in batches, puree tomato mixture in a blender until smooth (be careful not to splatter hot liquid).  Return puree to saucepan and set pan over low heat.  (Or puree in saucepan using an immersion blender.)  Add milk and simmer 1 minute to heat through.  Remove from heat and stir in basil; season to taste with salt and pepper.  Garnish with thyme and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings; about 1 1/2 cups per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 2

Comments:  We kept calories and fat low in this normally sinful recipe by using vegetable broth and evaporated skim milk instead of whole milk or heavy cream.  When tomatoes are out of season, substitute two 14-ounce cans of diced tomatoes.

  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped onion
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
  4               cups  fat-free chicken broth
  4             pieces  corn on the cob -- kernels removed
                        with a knife - (abt 3 cups)
     1/2         pound  uncooked red potatoes - (abt 2 large) -- peeled, chopped
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  table salt
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro or scallion
     1/4           cup  plain fat-free yogurt
     1/4           cup  diced tomato

Heat oil in a large saucepan.  Add onion; cover and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add curry powder and cook 30 seconds until fragrant.

Add broth, corn, potatoes, lemon juice and salt to saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes; remove from heat.

In a blender, food processor or with an immersion (handheld) blender, puree mixture (in batches if necessary), until smooth.  Strain through a fine mesh sieve, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible, into a bowl.  Serve hot, or cover and refrigerate up to 2 days.

To serve, stir cilantro or scallions into soup.  Spoon into bowls and top with about 2 teaspoons each of yogurt and tomato.  Garnish with additional chopped cilantro or scallions, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings; about 1 1/4 cups per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 2

Comments:  Relish the taste of sweet summer corn in this uniquely-flavored soup.  It can be served hot or cold and can be made vegetarian by using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  grated ginger root
  1             medium  leek (white part only) -- coarsely chopped
  4 3/4         ounces  frozen apple juice concentrate -- undiluted
  3              large  Golden Delicious apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into eighths
  3             pounds  butternut squash -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into chunks

     1/2           cup  fat-free half-and-half

Combine ginger, leek and apple juice concentrate in a large pot; cover and simmer until leeks are tender, about 10 minutes.  Add apples, squash and 1 cup of broth; cover and simmer until very tender, about 1 hour.

PurÈe soup in pot using a hand-held immersion blender.  Or purÈe soup in a blender in small batches (be careful not to splatter the hot liquid) and return the purÈed soup to the pot.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3           servings  butter-flavor cooking spray
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  4              large  peaches -- peeled, halved,
                        and pit removed

Lightly coat grill grate with cooking spray (off-heat).  Heat grill to medium-high heat.

Sprinkle cinnamon evenly over cut sides of peaches.  Spray each peach half with cooking spray.

Place peaches on grill, cut-side down.  Grill until browned and slightly softened, about 5 minutes.  (For best results, do not move the peaches during grilling; this will ensure the attractive grill marks and keep the peaches from sticking to the grill.)

Turn peaches over and grill on other side for about 3 minutes more.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 2 peach halves per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 1

Comments:  Grilling peaches caramelizes them and brings out that 'peach pie filling' flavor.  Serve some up on Labor Day for a light post-barbecue dessert.

Lightly coat grill grate with cooking spray (off-heat).  Heat grill to medium-high heat.

<DirT>
Sprinkle cinnamon evenly over cut sides of peaches.  Spray each peach half with cooking spray.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place peaches on grill, cut-side down.  Grill until browned and slightly softened, about 5 minutes.  (For best results, do not move the peaches during grilling; this will ensure the attractive grill marks and keep the peaches from sticking to the grill.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn peaches over and grill on other side for about 3 minutes more.  Serve warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings; 2 peach halves per serving.

Comments:  Grilling peaches caramelizes them and brings out that &apos;peach pie filling&apos; flavor.  Serve some up on Labor Day for a light post-barbecue dessert.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  white mushrooms -- stems trimmed
  8             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed
  8             ounces  oyster mushrooms -- tough stems removed
  3        tablespoons  miso -- mellow-white variety
  4        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  teriyaki sauce
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             medium  leeks (white and light green parts only) -- chopped (abt 2 cups)
  4             medium  corn on the cob -- kernels removed
                        with a knife (abt 2 1/4 cups kernels)
     1/4           cup  diced 1/4" sweet red pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh  thyme
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)

Soak twelve 8-inch wooden skewers in water for about 20 minutes.  (Or use metal skewers.)

Place 1 of each kind of mushroom on each of the twelve skewers.  Place skewers in a large baking pan; set aside.

Place miso, water and teriyaki sauce in a small bowl; mix well.  Pour miso mixture over mushrooms; turn skewers to coat and let marinate for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, prep corn and leeks.  Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add oil and leeks; cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add corn and red pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 minutes more.  Season mixture with salt and pepper; stir in parsley and thyme and set aside until ready to serve.

Preheat grill or coat a stovetop grill pan with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat.  Grill skewers, turning once, about 3 minutes per side.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 3 skewers and about a heaping 3/4 cup of corn-leek relish per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  Miso, a Japanese fermented soybean paste, is both salty and somewhat sweet.  It goes wonderfully with smoky, grilled mushrooms and fresh sweet corn.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sherry cooking wine
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt
  2             pounds  portobello mushrooms -- stems removed
                        = (small or baby mushrooms)
  1              piece  corn on the cob -- kernels removed
  2             medium  plum tomatoes -- chopped
  6                     black olives -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro

Mix together vinegar, sherry, oil, sugar and salt.  Remove 2 tablespoons of vinegar mixture for basting portobellos; reserve the rest for the corn salsa.

Preheat grill.  Off heat, coat grill rack with cooking spray.  Place mushrooms, stem-side up, on grill.  Brush lightly with vinegar mixture; cook 2 minutes.  Turn mushrooms; brush with remaining vinegar mixture and grill until tender, about 2 to 3 minutes more.  Remove from grill; allow to cool about 5 minutes.

Mix together corn, tomatoes, olives, cilantro and reserved vinegar mixture.  Cut mushrooms into 1/2-inch-thick slices; top with salsa.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 3 to 4 slices of mushroom and 1/3 cup of salsa per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 2

Comments:  Juicy, sweet corn, cut straight from the cob, makes this salsa the perfect topping for grilled mushrooms.  Serve this vegetarian dish on its own, paired with flank steak or as a topping for open-faced burgers.

Comments:  Juicy, sweet corn, cut straight from the cob, makes this salsa the perfect topping for grilled mushrooms.  Serve this vegetarian dish on its own, paired with flank steak or as a topping for open-faced burgers.

                Grilled Swordfish With Seasoned Asparagus

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1         tablespoon  canned tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1             medium  garlic clove -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2         pounds  swordfish steaks - (four 6 oz steaks)
  1              pound  asparagus -- trimmed
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  lemon pepper seasoning -- or to taste

Combine soy sauce, lime juice, 1 tablespoon of oil, tomato paste, parsley, garlic, oregano and black pepper together in a small bowl.  Place fish in a glass dish; pour soy sauce mixture over fish.  Marinate fish in refrigerator for 30 minutes and then turn fish over; marinate for 30 minutes more.

Preheat grill to medium.  Place asparagus in a large bowl; drizzle with remaining tablespoon of oil and season to taste with salt and lemon pepper seasoning.

Place a large piece of aluminum foil on a flat surface.  Wrap asparagus in foil and grill asparagus for 30 minutes.  (Or place asparagus in a pan, cover and cook on grill.)  Add fish to grill after asparagus has cooked for about 15 to 20 minutes.  Cook fish until it easily breaks apart with fork, flipping once, about 10 to 14 minutes total; serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 1 swordfish steak and 1/4 of asparagus per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 8

Comments:  The marinade in this light, tasty dish also works well with cod or halibut.  Grilled corn or peppers can be used instead of asparagus, too.  Try it out on Labor Day.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  bluefin tuna
                        = (four 5-oz fillets cut abt 1 1/4" thick)
  4           servings  olive oil cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2              small  shallots - (or 1 large) -- chopped
  1                cup  fat-free creamer
                        = (such as fat-free half-and-half)
  4          teaspoons  grainy mustard
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest

Preheat grill to medium.  Coat tuna with olive oil cooking spray; sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon of pepper, or to taste.  Grill 4 to 6 minutes per side, until desired degree of doneness.

Meanwhile, brown butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add shallots and cook until they begin to brown, about 1 minute.  Reduce heat to medium and add half-and-half; cook until slightly thickened and mixture coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.  Stir in mustard; remove from heat and stir in dill, zest, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon of pepper.

Serve sauce hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 1 tuna fillet and about 2 tablespoons of sauce per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 6

Comments:  Yellowfin tuna, excellent for grilling, is available all year long but is most plentiful during the summer months.  Top it with our mustard-dill sauce, and your taste buds will go wild!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts - -- (four 4-oz pieces)
  4             slices  crusty white bread or Italian bread
  2           servings  olive oil cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  4             medium  ripe tomatoes -- chopped
  2               cups  arugula -- washed, trimmed
     1/2           cup  soft tofu
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1              large  garlic clove -- chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped basil
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste

Prepare coals for grill.

Spray chicken breasts and bread with olive oil cooking spray.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.

Grill chicken on both sides until done, about 6 minutes per side.  Grill bread on both sides until nicely toasted.  Set chicken and bread aside to cool.

In large bowl, toss together tomatoes and arugula.

To make dressing, blend tofu, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, basil and salt in a blender until smooth.

Add dressing to tomatoes and arugula and toss.

Cut bread into cubes and toss with tomato salad.  Season to taste with pepper.

Slice chicken breasts into long, thin pieces.  Divide salad among 4 plates and top each with sliced chicken.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  This hearty adaptation of a traditional Italian bread salad uses a dressing made creamy with soft tofu.  The tofu not only enhances the texture of the dressing, but is nutrient-dense as well.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  asparagus -- tough ends snapped
                        off
  2        tablespoons  fat-free chicken broth -- use a
                        highly-flavored broth if possible
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated ginger root
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  minced scallions
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Bring 1 to 2 inches of water to a boil in a medium skillet.  Place asparagus in skillet, reduce heat to medium and cook until asparagus are crisp-tender, about 6 to 8 minutes; drain well.

Place asparagus in a large glass bowl.  Combine broth, ginger, lemon juice, scallion, salt and pepper together in a cup; pour over asparagus.  Set aside for 30 minutes to marinate.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 1/4 of asparagus per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 0

Comments:  This lemon-ginger marinade is also excellent with broccoli rabe, a bold-tasting member of the broccoli family.  Cook it as you would the asparagus.

This recipe can be doubled or tripled for larger gatherings.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  margarine
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  2              large  egg whites
     1/3           cup  fat-free skim milk
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  honey
  3        tablespoons  powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, beat margarine with an electric mixer on medium-high speed for 30 seconds.  Add sugar, zest, baking powder and baking soda; beat until combined, scraping sides of bowl occasionally.  Add egg whites, milk and lemon juice; beat until combined.  Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer and then stir in remaining flour by hand.

Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls, 2 inches apart, onto 2 ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake until edges are lightly browned, about 12 minutes.  Transfer cookies to a wire rack and let cool.  Repeat with remaining cookie dough.

Brush tops of each cookie with a touch of honey just before serving and then sprinkle with powdered sugar; stack in a single layer to prevent sticking.

This recipe yields 24 servings; 2 cookies per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 2

Comments:  Ensure the start to a sweet Jewish New Year with these honey-glazed cookies for Rosh Hashanah.  The addition of lemon zest and juice gives them an exciting flavor twist.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        extra for rolling out dough
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3        tablespoons  reduced-calorie margarine -- chilled, cut up
  2        tablespoons  water or 3 tbspns (depending on dough)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Combine flour and sugar in a large bowl or food processor.  Add margarine and process, or mix together with your fingers, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, and process, or mix, until a manageable dough forms; turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 12-inch circle.

Press dough into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan or removable-bottom tart pan; prick the bottom all over with a fork, cover dough with foil and fill with dried beans or rice.

Bake 10 minutes.  Remove beans and foil and bake until crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes more.  Remove from oven and cool completely on a wire rack.

This recipe yields 8 servings; 8 slices per crust.

PointsÆ Value: 2

Comments:  Our renovated crust works with any filling.  If you need an uncooked crust, eliminate the cooking step and fill and bake as directed in your recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2           cups  cooked macaroni -- kept warm
     3/4           cup  fat-free mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  fat-free sour cream
  3        tablespoons  sweet pickle relish
  1             medium  sweet red pepper -- diced
  1             medium  green pepper -- diced
  1             medium  carrot -- diced
     1/4           cup  minced red onion
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste

While macaroni is still warm, place in a large bowl.  Add mayonnaise, sour cream and relish; toss to coat.  Add peppers, carrot and onion; toss to combine.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Serve warm or chilled.

This recipe yields 12 servings; about 1/2 cup per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 2

Comments:  Substitutes for high-fat mayonnaise and sour cream help give this salad its classic flavor, without the classic fat content.

Flavor Booster:  Put a little heat in traditional macaroni salad by blending 1 teaspoon wasabi powder into the sour cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/3         ounces  pretzels miniature twists - (abt 2 cups)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  reduced-calorie margarine
  6             ounces  frozen concentrate limeade -- slightly thawed

     1/2         ounce  orange-flavored liqueur
  1           teaspoon  lime zest

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a food processor or blender, crush pretzel twists until crumbs form.  Add sugar; pulse until combined.  Add margarine and mix well.  With machine running, add 2 tablespoons of limeade concentrate; process until well-mixed.

Spoon mixture into an ungreased 9-inch pie plate.  With back of a spoon, press mixture firmly into bottom and up sides of pan to form a pie shell.  Bake until set, about 5 minutes; place in freezer for 10 minutes to cool.

Meanwhile, in a clean food processor or electric mixer, combine ice cream, remaining limeade concentrate, tequila and liqueur; process or mix until just blended.  Spoon ice cream mixture into cooled pie shell and sprinkle with lime zest.  Freeze for 2 hours before cutting into 8 slices.

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  uncooked barley
  2           servings  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1 1/2         pounds  portobello mushrooms -- caps sliced
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  dried sage
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  fat-free sour cream
  1         tablespoon  horseradish sauce -- or to taste

Combine barley and 2 1/4 cups of water in a medium saucepan.  Set pan over high heat and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, cover and cook until all liquid is absorbed and barley is tender, about 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and set pan over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms and cook until mushrooms are tender and all liquid evaporates, about 5 to 7 minutes; transfer mushrooms to a food processor or large bowl.

When barley is finished cooking, add to food processor with mushrooms; add egg, sage, salt and pepper.  Pulse on and off, or mash with a fork, until well blended.

Shape mixture into 4 equal patties, about 1 inch thick each.  Transfer patties to a plate, cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes (and up to 24 hours).

Preheat broiler.  Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.

Place burgers on prepared baking sheet and broil until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.  (Note: To grill burgers on an outdoor grill and prevent them from falling through grate, first cover grill grates with foil and then poke some holes in foil to let out smoke.)

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine sour cream and horseradish.  Mix until well blended.

Serve each burger with 2 tablespoons of horseradish cream spooned on top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  Look out frozen veggie burgers, you've got some competition.  These hearty burgers are made with earthy portobello mushrooms, barley and sage ñ a unique vegetarian combination.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  navel oranges
  1              pound  scallops
  3        tablespoons  chopped mint leaves
  4             medium  ripe tomatoes -- chopped
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste

Using a grater (or zester), grate enough peel from 2 oranges to yield 2 tablespoons of zest; put 1 tablespoon in each of 2 medium bowls.

Peel remaing 4 oranges, remove pits and cut segments into 1/2-inch chunks.  Add chunks to one bowl of zest, cover and refrigerate until needed.

Squeeze juice from zested oranges and add it to the remaining bowl of zest.  Stir in scallops and 1 1/2 tablespoons of mint; cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.

Prepare coals for grill.

Add tomatoes and remaining mint to the orange chunks; season to taste with salt and pepper.

Thread scallops evenly onto 4 wooden skewers and grill until done, about 5 minutes.  Spoon 1/4 of the tomato salad onto each of 4 plates and top with a skewer of scallops.  (Note: Soak skewers in water for 30 minutes before using to prevent burning.)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  This dish is delicious with rice to soak up the juice from the salad.  Chunks of chicken breast or firm-fleshed fish such as haddock make excellent substitutions for the scallops.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  peaches -- sliced
  6 1/3    tablespoons  sugar -- divided
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
  3        tablespoons  reduced-calorie margarine
     1/2           cup  fat-free skim milk

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a large saucepan, combine peaches, 1/3 cup of sugar (5 1/3 tablespoons), cornstarch, lemon juice and cinnamon; toss to coat peaches.  Set pan over medium heat and bring to a boil; cook until mixture thickens, about 1 minute.  Remove pan from heat; transfer mixture to an 8-inch square baking pan.

To make the topping, combine flour, remaining tablespoon of sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl.  Work in margarine with a fork until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add milk; stir until flour mixture is evenly moistened.

Drop 8 tablespoons of topping mixture over peach mixture.  Bake until topping is golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Cut into 8 pieces and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  Take advantage of sweet summer peaches with our delicious cobbler.  It's even more flavorful when made with white-variety peaches.

Flavor Booster:  Enhance the peach flavor by swapping 1 teaspoon of almond extract for the lemon juice.  And stir 2 tablespoons of sliced almonds into the topping, if desired (does not affect PointsÆ Value).

Place shrimp, swordfish and clams on hot grill.  Cover and cook clams 3 to 5 minutes, or until shells open (discard any that don't); shrimp 5 to 6 minutes, turning skewers once, until just cooked through; and swordfish 7 to 8 minutes, turning once, until just cooked through.  Remove fish to serving plates; sprinkle with parsley if desired and serve with lemon wedges.  Pour sauce into 4 small cups and serve alongside as a dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 3 shrimp, 4 1/2 to 5 ounces of swordfish, 3 clams and 1/4 cup of sauce per serving.

Heat outdoor grill.  Skewer shrimp onto 4 metal skewers (if using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes first to prevent burning).  Brush shrimp and swordfish with oil and then sprinkle with salt and pepper.

<DirT>
Place shrimp, swordfish and clams on hot grill.  Cover and cook clams 3 to 5 minutes, or until shells open (discard any that don&apos;t); shrimp 5 to 6 minutes, turning skewers once, until just cooked through; and swordfish 7 to 8 minutes, turning once, until just cooked through.  Remove fish to serving plates; sprinkle with parsley if desired and serve with lemon wedges.  Pour sauce into 4 small cups and serve alongside as a dipping sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings; about 3 shrimp, 4 1/2 to 5 ounces of swordfish, 3 clams and 1/4 cup of sauce per serving.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  peaches -- diced
  1             medium  jalapeÒo pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and finely chopped (do not touch seeds
                        with your bare hands)
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  14 3/4        ounces  canned red salmon -- drained, and
                        broken into small chunks
  1             medium  scallion -- finely chopped
  2 1/2      teaspoons  lemon zest
  1              large  egg -- beaten
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3 1/2    tablespoons  dried bread crumbs -- whole-wheat variety

To prepare salsa, combine peaches, jalapeÒo and lemon juice in a medium bowl; add sugar and mix well.  Stir in salt and cilantro and toss gently to mix; set aside.

Preheat grill.

To prepare burgers, mash salmon bones with the back of a fork.  Combine salmon, scallion, lemon zest, egg, black pepper and bread crumbs in a medium bowl; mix well.  Shape salmon mixture into four 1-inch-thick patties.

Gently place burgers in a grill basket or on a grill rack and grill at medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes.  Flip burgers and grill until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes more.  Serve salmon burgers with peach salsa on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 1 burger and about 1/2 cup of salsa per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  Canned salmon is much cheaper and involves much less prep work than fresh salmon.  It's perfect for burgers and you get a big calcium boost from the bones, too.

The burgers can be broiled instead of grilled, if desired.  Coat a broiler rack with cooking spray, preheat broiler and broil 4 inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes per side.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  sweet red pepper
                        diced fine -- divided
  1              small  yellow pepper -- finely diced
     3/4        medium  jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, minced
                        = (don't touch seeds with bare hands)
  1         tablespoon  white vinegar
                        = (or red balsamic vinegar)
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2             medium  trimmed scallions -- minced, divided
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh cilantro
  14 1/2        ounces  canned salmon -- drained
  1              small  celery stalk -- finely chopped
  1             medium  shallot -- minced
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  fat-free mayonnaise
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper or ancho chili powder
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)

To make salsa, combine 1 cup of diced red pepper, yellow pepper, jalapeÒo, vinegar, 1/8 teaspoon of salt, 1/8 teaspoon of pepper, 1 minced scallion and cilantro in a medium bowl; set aside to allow flavors to blend.

Place salmon in large mixing bowl and mash with back of a spoon.  (It is not necessary to pick out the bones.)  Stir in remaining scallion, remaining red pepper, celery, shallot, egg, mayonnaise, cayenne pepper, remaining 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper and remaining 1/8 teaspoon of salt; mix well.

Coat a large skillet with cooking spray; heat skillet over medium heat.

Loosely pack a 1/4-cup measuring cup with salmon mixture; turn measuring cup ingredients out onto skillet and press down on salmon cake with a spatula until it is about 3/4-inch thick; repeat to make 8 salmon cakes total.  Cook salmon cakes for 3 minutes on first side; gently turn over and cook until golden on second side, about 2 to 3 minutes more.  (Be careful not to crowd salmon cakes; cook in 2 batches if necessary.)

This recipe yields 4 servings; 2 salmon cakes and about 1/2 cup of salsa per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  These savory fish cakes are just as tempting if you substitute two (7-ounce) cans of tuna for the salmon.  Ancho chili powder gives the salmon a slightly smoky flavor; the cayenne is hotter.

  1              large  egg -- beaten
  1             medium  egg white
     1/4           cup  fat-free mayonnaise
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1            serving  cooking spray

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Drain crab well.  Place in a bowl and break up any large chunks.  Add jalapeÒo and next 8 ingredients.  Mix well.

Coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.  Scoop up crab by 1/3-cupfuls and shape into 8 patties.  Place on baking sheet allowing 1-inch between each crab cake.  Bake until edges of crab cakes turn slightly golden, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare sauce by combining remaining ingredients in a bowl.  Stir well.

Remove crab from oven and serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 2 crab cakes and 2 tablespoons of sauce per serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  sweet red pepper -- quartered
  3           servings  olive oil cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1                cup  fresh parsley leaves - (loosely-packed)
     1/2           cup  fat-free mayonnaise
  7             medium  scallions -- chop 1, and slice
                        the others into 6 pieces each
  2          teaspoons  lemon zest -- freshly grated
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1             medium  garlic clove
  36             large  fresh shrimp -- peeled
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat grill or grill pan.  Coat red pepper with cooking spray.  Grill, turning as needed, until lightly charred and tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.

To make sauce, place grilled pepper, parsley, mayonnaise, 1 chopped scallion, lemon zest, lemon juice and garlic in a food processor.  Pulse until mixture is blended and ingredients are finely chopped; set aside.

Thread 3 pieces each of shrimp and sliced scallions onto each of 12 metal skewers.  (Note: If you're using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes before use to prevent charring.)  Lightly coat shrimp and scallions with cooking spray; sprinkle with salt and black pepper.

Grill skewers, turning once, until shrimp are just cooked through, about 2 to 4 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings; 2 skewers and about 2 tablespoons of sauce per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 1

Comments:  Grilled red pepper, scallions and lemon transform fat-free mayo into a colorful, flavorful dipping sauce for shrimp.  Short on time?  Substitute water-packed roasted peppers for the grilled one.

Preheat grill or grill pan.  Coat red pepper with cooking spray.  Grill, turning as needed, until lightly charred and tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make sauce, place grilled pepper, parsley, mayonnaise, 1 chopped scallion, lemon zest, lemon juice and garlic in a food processor.  Pulse until mixture is blended and ingredients are finely chopped; set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Thread 3 pieces each of shrimp and sliced scallions onto each of 12 metal skewers.  (Note: If you&apos;re using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes before use to prevent charring.)  Lightly coat shrimp and scallions with cooking spray; sprinkle with salt and black pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grill skewers, turning once, until shrimp are just cooked through, about 2 to 4 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings; 2 skewers and about 2 tablespoons of sauce per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 1

<DirT>
Comments:  Grilled red pepper, scallions and lemon transform fat-free mayo into a colorful, flavorful dipping sauce for shrimp.  Short on time?  Substitute water-packed roasted peppers for the grilled one.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4           servings  Eden Kombu - (1/2 of 7" piece per serving)
                        = (or other brand)
  2               cups  water
  2               cups  fat-free chicken broth
  1              pound  jumbo shrimp -- shelled, and cut
                        lengthwise in half each (keep slightly
                        frozen for easier slicing)
  4              heads  baby-variety bok choy -- separated into
                        individual leaves
                        = (or 6 cups thinly-sliced broccoli
                        stalks)
  2               cups  dried shiitake mushrooms -- thinly sliced
  1              large  yellow summer squash - (or 2 small) -- trimmed, sliced thin
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  fresh minced chives

Rinse kombu sheets under cold running water.  Place kombu in a large bowl and submerge in cold water for 15 minutes; drain.

Combine 2 cups of water and broth in a medium saucepan; add kombu and bring to a simmer.  Once simmering, remove and discard kombu.  Pour broth mixture into a fondue pot, slow cooker or chafing dish; keep at a simmer over low heat.  (Note: Kombu, a type of seaweed, is often available in supermarkets' ethnic foods sections or at natural food stores.  It gives the broth a slightly fish-like taste.  If desired, omit the kombu and use 3 cups of chicken broth and 1 of cup water for a more mild-flavored broth.)

To serve, divide shrimp, boy chok, mushrooms and squash among 4 serving plates.  Stir together soy sauce, lemon juice and chives in a small bowl; leave in 1 bowl or divide sauce among 4 smaller bowls.

Using a skewer, fondue fork or other long-handled fork, swirl shrimp and vegetables, one piece at a time, through broth until cooked through, about 1 to 3 minutes.  Dip cooked shrimp or vegetables into sauce and eat.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 3 cups per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  This Japanese, fondue-like dish is perfect for a small dinner party.  You can use 1 pound of very thinly sliced chicken breast and thin carrot or asparagus strips for variety, if desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  uncooked Yukon Gold potato
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
                        = (or 1 large shallot)
  4             pieces  corn on the cob -- kernels removed
                        with a knife
  1                cup  diced sweet red pepper
  4             ounces  Canadian-style bacon -- diced
  2               cups  fat-free skim milk
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce -- or to taste

Puncture potato in several places with a fork; microwave on high power until tender, turning over once, about 8 minutes.  Allow to cool; peel and mash.

Meanwhile, coat a large saucepan with cooking spray.  Add celery, onion, corn and red pepper; sautÈ over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes.  (Note: Feel free to substitute your favorite fresh vegetables like asparagus and broccoli for the red pepper.  Or to save time, substitute 2 cups of frozen corn and 1 cup of frozen, diced bell pepper for the fresh corn and red pepper.)

Stir bacon and milk into saucepan; stir in mashed potato and mix well.  Season with salt, pepper and hot pepper sauce; stir to combine.  Cover and simmer 10 minutes (do not allow to boil).

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 1/2 cups per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  There's nothing like freshly-picked sweet corn.  We highlight it in this chowder along with buttery-tasting Yukon Gold potatoes and smoky Canadian bacon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  sole - (four 5-oz fillets)
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  14 1/2        ounces  canned diced tomatoes with garlic and
                        onion
  1           teaspoon  dried tarragon
  2               cups  cooked white rice
  1                cup  chopped green chilies

Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and set pan over medium-high heat.

Season both sides of sole with salt and pepper; add fillets to pan. Cook until golden, about 1 to 2 minutes per side.  Add tomatoes and tarragon and simmer until fish is fork-tender, about 2 minutes.  Serve sole and tomato sauce with rice on the side.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  golden variety beets - (abt 4 med) -- scrubbed, and
                        the tops removed
  4             medium  tomatoes -- cut 1/4" wedges
                        = (different colors or heirloom if
                        possible)
  1             medium  ripe Haas avocado -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1              small  red onion -- cut in half, and
                        sliced into thin half moons
  4           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4           teaspoon  red wine vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chives

Place a medium saucepan filled with water over high heat.  Add beets, bring back to a boil and reduce heat to medium; simmer until beets pierce easily with the point of a sharp knife, about 25 minutes.

Remove beets from pan and place under cold running water until cool enough to handle.  Peel beets with a vegetable peeler and cut into 1/2-inch wedges; place beets in a large bowl.

Add tomato, avocado, onion, oil, vinegar, salt and pepper to bowl; toss to combine.  Top mixture with basil and chives and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 1/4 cups per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  This gorgeous-looking salad is a feast for both the eyes and the mouth!  Look for golden beets at your local health food store or produce market (they're sweet as can be and won't dye your hands red).

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              small  uncooked new red potatoes -- quartered
     1/2         pound  green snap beans -- trimmed
     1/3           cup  reduced-sodium chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  4                     Boston lettuce leaves
  6             ounces  canned chunk white tuna in water -- drained, flaked
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained
  8                     olives -- sliced in half
                        = (use nicoise if available)

Place potatoes in a large saucepan and pour enough water over them to cover by 2 inches.  Set pan over high heat and bring water to a boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer 6 minutes.  Add green beans and cook until potatoes are fork-tender and green beans are crisp-tender, about 1 to 2 minutes more; drain and transfer vegetables to a large bowl.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together broth, vinegar, mustard and oil; season to taste with salt and pepper.  Add half of dressing to potatoes and green beans; toss to coat.

Place 1 lettuce leaf on each of 4 plates.  Top each with 1/4 of potato-green bean mixture, 1 1/2 ounces of tuna, 1/2 tablespoon of capers and 4 olive halves.  Drizzle each with 1/4 of remaining dressing.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  This classic salad seems harmless, but the truth is it's often drowning in fat.  Lighten your niÁoise up by creating your own dressing using broth, vinegar, mustard and just a touch of oil.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  zucchini
  4             ounces  yellow summer squash
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- plus
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2             medium  ripe tomatoes -- coarsley chopped

  8             medium  salt-cured black olives
     1/4         ounce  pine nuts - (abt 2 1/2 tspns) -- toasted

Trim ends of zucchini and squash.  With cheese planer, cut both vegetables lengthwise into thin, long strips.  With a knife, cut strips lengthwise into thinner, fettuccine-like strips.  In bowl, toss zucchini and squash with lemon juice and 1/8 teaspoon salt.  Set aside 5 minutes.

In food processor, combine tomatoes, 6 basil leaves, oil and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Process until coarsely chopped.

Drain any liquid in zucchini mixture and divide among two serving plates; top each with half the tomato dressing, olives and pine nuts.  Garnish with remaining fresh basil leaves and serve.

Comments:  Once prepared, this dish should be served promptly, as cut zucchini will release water upon standing and lose some of its crisp texture.
