                        === PINEAPPLE ===
  1                     pineapple - (abt 4 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, quartered
                        lengthwise, and cored
     1/3           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour 9- by 5- by 3-inch metal loaf pan.  Finely grind almonds with flour, baking soda, and salt in processor.

Using electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in large bowl until blended.  Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, just to blend.  Stir in sour cream, lemon peel, and almond extract.  Stir in flour mixture just until blended.  Transfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top.

Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 38 minutes.  Cool on rack 15 minutes; turn out cake.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool completely.  Wrap in plastic and store at room temperature.  Rewarm unwrapped cake slightly in microwave.)

For Vanilla Cream:  Whisk all ingredients in small bowl to blend.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

For Pineapple:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place pineapple in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Whisk brown sugar, 1/3 cup pineapple juice, cloves, and cinnamon in small bowl to blend.  Pour juice mixture over pineapple.  Roast until pineapple is tender and juices brown, turning and basting pineapple with juices every 20 minutes and adding more pineapple juice by tablespoonfuls as needed to prevent burning, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  (Can be made 3 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm in 375 degrees oven for 10 minutes before continuing.)

Cut warm pineapple crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices.  Cut warm cake into 8 pieces.  Place 1 slice of cake on each of 8 plates.  Spoon pineapple and juices atop cake, top with vanilla cream, and serve.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12       tablespoons  butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- divided
  2             pounds  onions -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme - (packed)
  4          teaspoons  fine sea salt -- divided
     2/3           cup  water
     2/3           cup  dry white wine
  4          teaspoons  sugar
  2 1/2         pounds  Yukon Gold, yellow Finn, or
                        German Butterball potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4"-thick rounds
  2             pounds  Granny Smith, Pippin, or

                        cored, cut into 1/4"-thick slices

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass or ceramic baking dish.

Melt 6 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add onions, thyme, and 2 teaspoons salt; sautÈ until onions are translucent, about 10 minutes.  Increase heat to medium-high; sautÈ until onions are tender and begin to color, about 8 minutes longer.

Remove from heat.  Add remaining 6 tablespoons butter, 2/3 cup water, wine, and sugar to skillet; stir and swirl skillet to combine.  Bring to boil.  Cool onion mixture to lukewarm.

Combine potatoes, apples, remaining 2 teaspoons salt, and onion mixture in large bowl; toss gently to blend.  Transfer to prepared baking dish, spreading evenly.  Cover dish with parchment paper, then cover with foil, shiny-side down.

Bake gratin until potatoes are tender, about 55 minutes.  Uncover and bake until top browns and juices bubble thickly, about 20 minutes longer.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Let stand uncovered at room temperature.  Rewarm, loosely covered with foil, in 300 degrees oven for 20 minutes.)  Let gratin stand 15 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This gratin is unusual for having no cream or cheese ó letting the lovely seasonal flavors of the produce shine through.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  butter -- (2 sticks)
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  4               cups  fresh breadcrumbs -- made from
                        crustless French bread
  2 1/2           cups  chopped fresh parsley
                        = (from 2 to 3 large bunches)
  2                     center-cut beef tenderloin roasts - -- (abt 2 1/2 lbs ea)
  20                    to 24 bacon slices - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
                        Canola oil -- as needed

Melt butter in large pot over medium heat.  Add garlic; sautÈ 2 minutes.  Add breadcrumbs.  SautÈ until golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Remove from heat; mix in parsley.  Season stuffing with salt and pepper.  Cool completely.

Starting at 1 long side, cut each tenderloin lengthwise almost in half, stopping about 1/2 inch from opposite long side.  Open tenderloins like books.  Sprinkle cut sides with salt and pepper.  Pack half of stuffing on 1 side of each tenderloin.  Fold plain side over stuffing.

Slightly overlap half of bacon slices on sheet of parchment paper, forming rectangle equal in length to 1 tenderloin.  Place tenderloin at 1 edge, across bacon ends.  Using parchment as aid, roll up tenderloin in bacon.  Using kitchen string, secure bacon around tenderloin, tying at 1 1/2-inch intervals, then tie once lengthwise.  Repeat with remaining bacon and tenderloin.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Wrap tenderloins and refrigerate.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before continuing.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Pour enough oil into large skillet to coat bottom; heat over high heat.  Add 1 tenderloin.  SautÈ until bacon is brown, turning often, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to rimmed baking sheet.  Repeat with second tenderloin.  Roast until thermometer inserted into center of each registers 130 degrees to 135 degrees for medium-rare, about 30 minutes.  Transfer to platter.  Let stand 15 minutes.  Cut off strings.  Cut tenderloins into 1/2-inch-thick slices.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     black cod fillets with skin - (6 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  good-quality sweet Sherry
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, flattened
     1/4           cup  panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)*
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  PimentÛn de La Vera**
                        = (Spanish smoked paprika)
                        Coarse kosher salt
                        Roasted Sweet-And-Sour Onions -- (see recipe)

* Available in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets and at Asian markets.

** Available at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and by mail from La Tienda (888-472-1022; tienda.com).

Using sharp knife, make three 1/4-inch-deep, 2 1/2-inch-long diagonal cuts in skin of each fish fillet.  Arrange fillets in single layer, skin side up, in 15- by 10- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Pour Sherry and 1/4 cup olive oil over; sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper.  Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 6 hours, turning occasionally.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Combine butter and garlic in heavy medium saucepan.  Cook over medium heat until butter melts and garlic begins to brown, about 12 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Discard garlic clove.  Add panko to butter (mixture will bubble); cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Add lemon juice; remove from heat.  Stir in pimentÛn.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover to keep warm while preparing fish.

Remove fish from marinade and drain.  Sprinkle fish with coarse salt.  Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Add fish fillets, skin side down, and cook until lightly browned, about 1 minute.  Turn fillets over; place skillet in oven and roast until fish is just opaque in center, about 2 minutes.

Spoon Roasted Sweet-and-Sour Onions into center of 6 plates.  Top each serving with 1 fish fillet.  Spoon sauce over and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Many of us first tasted this rich, buttery fish (also known as butterfish or sablefish) at Japanese restaurants.  It's often lacquered in a sweet miso glaze ó a combination credited to famed sushi master Nobu Matsuhisa.  It was only a matter of time before chefs everywhere discovered its succulence and versatility, comparable to Chilean sea bass.  Now they're pairing it with everything from truffles to the Spanish flavors in this dish.

Whisk cream and chocolate until smooth.  Mix sesame seeds and corn syrup in small bowl to coat; stir into chocolate mixture.  Let cool to lukewarm.  Stir in butter.  Cover and let stand at room temperature overnight to set.

For Ginger Syrup:  Place 1 cup water, sugar, and ginger in small saucepan.  Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into pan; add bean.  Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Simmer 2 minutes; remove from heat.  Let stand at room temperature 1 hour for flavors to blend.

Strain syrup into small bowl.  Chop ginger.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate ginger and syrup separately.)

For Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour three 8-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides.  Line bottoms with parchment paper.

Whisk 2 cups boiling water, cocoa powder, and reserved chopped ginger in medium heatproof bowl.  Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in large bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar and butter in large bowl until fluffy, about 1 minute.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating until incorporated after each addition.  Beat in vanilla extract.  Add flour mixture in 4 additions alternately with cocoa mixture in 3 additions, beginning and ending with flour mixture.  Divide batter among prepared cake pans; smooth tops.

Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool in pans 5 minutes.  Turn cakes out onto racks; cool completely.  (Cakes can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Wrap with plastic wrap and store at room temperature.)

For Whipped Cream Frosting:  Beat cream in large bowl until soft peaks form.  Add sugar, vanilla, and ginger.  Beat until stiff peaks form.

Using long serrated knife, trim rounded tops off cakes to create flat surface.  Place 1 cake layer, cut-side up, on plate.  Brush top with 1/3 cup ginger syrup.  Spread half of ganache over top of cake.  Place second layer, cut-side up, atop first layer.  Brush with 1/3 cup syrup; spread with remaining ganache.  Top with third cake layer.  Brush with remaining syrup.  Spread sides and top with whipped cream frosting.  Sprinkle top with black sesame seeds.  Refrigerate until ganache is set, about 4 hours.  Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  2             ounces  black French PÈrigord truffles* -- fresh or jarred
     1/2           cup  Tuscan-style extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  1                cup  Cabernet Sauvignon
                        = (or other dry red wine)
  2        tablespoons  Banyuls vinegar**
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
                        Coarse kosher salt -- to taste
                        === STEAKS ===
  4                     New York strip steaks, abt 1 1/4" thk - -- (12 oz ea)
                        = (preferably Wagyu)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2          teaspoons  coarse kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  very coarsely-ground black pepper

* Jarred black truffles from the PÈrigord region in southern France are available from dartagnan.com.

** Banyuls vinegar, made from the sweet French wine of the same name, is available at specialty foods stores and by mail from Surfas (310-559-4770; surfasonline.com).

For Vinaigrette:  Thinly slice truffles, then dice finely.  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in small skillet over medium heat.  Add shallots; sautÈ 2 minutes.  Add truffles and sautÈ until aromatic, about 1 minute.  Place shallot mixture in small bowl.

Boil wine in heavy small saucepan until reduced to 2 tablespoons, about 10 minutes.  Add to shallot mixture.  Whisk in vinegar and thyme.  Gradually whisk in remaining 7 tablespoons oil.  Season vinaigrette to taste with coarse salt.  (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

For Steaks:  Pat steaks dry.  Brush 1 tablespoon oil over both sides of steaks.  Sprinkle with coarse salt and coarsely ground black pepper.  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in each of 2 heavy large skillets over high heat.  Add 2 steaks to each skillet and cook to desired doneness, about 2 minutes per side for rare to medium-rare (instant-read thermometer inserted into center of steaks registers 120 degrees to 125 degrees).  Transfer steaks to platter; cover with foil to keep warm.  Let rest 5 minutes.

Place steaks on plates.  Spoon vinaigrette over and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Accompaniment                   Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              whole  green cardamom pods
  1              pound  slab bacon -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  pomegranate molasses
     1/2           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
     1/3           cup  fresh pomegranate seeds

Stir cardamom in small skillet over medium heat until pods are lightly browned, about 4 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Crack pods; remove seeds.  Crush seeds in mortar with pestle or in spice mill; reserve.

Bring medium saucepan of water to boil.  Add bacon and cook 30 seconds.  Drain.  Combine bacon and broth in same saucepan.  Bring to boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently until almost all liquid is absorbed, about 35 minutes.  Wipe away any grease from pan.  Add pomegranate molasses, then pine nuts, pomegranate seeds, and crushed cardamom seeds to pan.  Bring to simmer; cook until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Season with pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  We have a renewed appreciation for the beauty, taste, and health-giving properties of the pomegranate lately, and its molasses (made by cooking the juice down to a sweet-tart syrup) delivers just what we are looking for in an ingredient these days: bold, clear, complex flavor.  Used in this go-with for the chops, it brings new meaning to "sweet-and-sour pork."  Pomegranate molasses is available at some supermarkets and Middle Eastern markets and by mail from Adriana's Caravan (800-316-0820; adrianascaravan.com).

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  campanelle (trumpet-shaped pasta) or
                        fusilli (spiral-shaped pasta)
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon peel
  1            package  baby spinach - (6 oz - abt 4 cups)
     3/4           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted
  1              pound  burrata cheese -- cut into 1" chunks

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, melt butter with oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add garlic; sautÈ until soft, about 2 minutes.  Add lemon juice and lemon peel.

Drain pasta; transfer to large bowl.  Place spinach and almonds atop hot pasta.  Pour hot lemon mixture over spinach.  Toss until spinach is wilted, about 1 minute.  Divide pasta among plates.  Top with burrata cheese, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Burrata is a luscious Italian cheese made by mixing cream and unspun mozzarella curds together (for a texture similar to ricotta): the mixture is then inserted into the center of a ball of fresh mozzarella.  It can be found in some supermarkets, at specialty foods shops, and at Italian markets.  Substitute fresh mozzarella if you can't find burrata.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  diced (1/2") peeled celeriac (celery root)
                        = (from abt one 18-oz celeriac)
  1                     russet potato - (12 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" chunks - (abt 2 1/2 cups)
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)

Cook celeriac in large saucepan of boiling salted water 15 minutes.  Add potato and boil until celeriac and potato are very tender, about 15 minutes longer.  Drain.  Return to same saucepan; stir over medium-high heat until any excess liquid in pan evaporates, about 2 minutes.  Add cream and butter; mash until mixture is almost smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Market Tip:  Celeriac (celery root) is a variety of celery cultivated for its large root instead of its stalks.  It has a mild flavor reminiscent of celery and parsley.  Choose meduim-size, firm celeriac with few knobs and rootlets, and no soft spots, which indicate decay.

           Chicken And Mushroom Pie With Phyllo-Parmesan Crust

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  dried porcini mushrooms - (1/2 oz)
  1                cup  hot water
  9        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  1              pound  assorted fresh mushrooms -- sliced
                        = (such as crimini, stemmed shiitake, and
                        button mushrooms)
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth
     3/4           cup  Riesling wine
                        = (or other fruity white wine)
  2             ounces  thinly-sliced prosciutto -- cut thin strips
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch -- mixed with
     1/2           cup  water
  12                    sheets fresh phyllo pastry or frozen -- thawed
  2             pounds  skinless boneless chicken thighs -- excess fat removed,
                        and thighs quartered
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley
     1/2           cup  finely-grated Parmesan cheese

Combine dried porcini and 1 cup hot water in small bowl; let stand until porcini are soft, about 20 minutes.  Drain porcini, reserving liquid.

Melt 3 tablespoons butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add fresh mushrooms and garlic; sautÈ until mushrooms are browned, about 8 minutes.  Add porcini, porcini soaking liquid (leaving any sediment behind), broth, wine, prosciutto, lemon peel, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer uncovered 20 minutes to blend flavors.  Whisk cornstarch mixture to combine and add to skillet; stir until mixture thickens slightly, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Season sauce to taste with more salt and pepper, if desired.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly, then cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Melt 6 tablespoons butter in small saucepan; remove from heat.  Place 1 phyllo sheet on work surface (cover remainder with sheet of plastic wrap, then damp towel).  Brush phyllo sheet with some of melted butter.  Using both hands, gently scrunch buttered phyllo sheet into loose ball, about 2 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter; set on work surface.  Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets and melted butter.

Bring mushroom sauce to boil.  Mix in chicken and parsley.  Transfer mixture to 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass or ceramic baking dish.  Cover hot filling with phyllo balls.  Sprinkle Parmesan over.  Bake 15 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees; bake until phyllo is golden and chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes longer.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Quick Trick:  Phyllo pastry dough is scrunched to form the pretty "biscuits" that top this pot pie.

Goes Great With:  Mashed potatoes flecked with chopped fresh parsley or tarragon.

What To Drink:  Chardonnay or Merlot.

Comments:  Boneless chicken thighs give a moist result, but chicken breasts work well, too.  Mix wild mushrooms with cultivated button mushrooms for a deeper flavor.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  mini semisweet chocolate chips - (8 oz) -- divided
  2              large  egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  sweetened flaked coconut

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.  Place 1 cup chocolate chips in microwave-safe bowl; microwave on low setting at 10-second intervals until chocolate is melted, stirring occasionally.  Cool just to room temperature.

Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and salt in medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add sugar, then vanilla, beating until whites are thick and glossy.  Fold in melted chocolate and coconut, then remaining 1/3 cup chocolate chips.

Drop batter by heaping teaspoonfuls onto prepared sheets, spacing 1 1/2 inches apart.  Bake cookies 10 minutes.  Reverse sheets.  Bake until tops are dry and cracked and tester inserted into centers comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 10 minutes longer.  Cool cookies on sheets on racks.  Store airtight at room temperature up to 2 days.

This recipe yields about 30 cookies.

When my sons were younger I made her chocolate macaroons and pancakes all the time.  I don't make them quite as often as I used to, but they're still a hit with my husband."

                        === CANDIED ORANGE PEEL ===
  1                     orange
  1                cup  sugar -- divided
     3/4           cup  water
                        === POTS DE CR»ME ===
     2/3           cup  whole milk
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  Grand Marnier
                        = (or other orange liqueur)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated orange peel
  4             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  4              large  egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  sugar
                        Lightly-sweetened whipped cream

For Candied Orange Peel:  Using vegetable peeler, remove orange part of peel from orange in long strips.  Cut peel lengthwise into 1/8-inch-wide strips.  Stir 3/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup water in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 2 minutes.  Add orange peel; simmer 15 minutes.

Place remaining 1/4 cup sugar in small bowl.  Using slotted spoon, remove peel from syrup and transfer to sugar.  Toss to coat.  Cool, tossing occasionally.  Cover bowl and let stand at room temperature overnight.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep covered.)

For Pots De CrËme:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bring milk, cream, Grand Marnier, vanilla, and grated orange peel to boil in heavy medium saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and stir until melted and smooth.  Whisk yolks and sugar in medium bowl until pale yellow, about 2 minutes.  Whisk egg mixture into chocolate mixture.  Strain into 2-cup measuring cup.

Divide mixture between two 8-ounce custard cups.  Place cups in small baking dish.  Add enough water to baking dish to come halfway up sides of cups.  Cover dish tightly with foil.  Bake until custard is set, about 40 minutes.  Remove cups from water in dish.  Place in refrigerator uncovered until cool.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, about 6 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)  Top with whipped cream, garnish with candied orange peel, and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  The creamiest, most intense chocolate pudding you'll ever taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GANACHE ===
  4             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  1                cup  heavy whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  dark rum
                        === COCONUT-MERINGUE LAYER ===
  1 1/2           cups  unsweetened shredded coconut* - -- (abt 4 1/2 oz)
     2/3           cup  sugar -- divided
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6              large  egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
                        === GLAZE ===
  12            ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  1                cup  heavy whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  1                cup  unsweetened wide-shred coconut* -- lightly toasted
                        = (aka coconut chips)

* Available at some supermarkets and natural foods stores.

For Ganache:  Place chocolate in medium metal bowl.  Bring cream to simmer in small saucepan.  Pour cream over chocolate; whisk until chocolate is melted and smooth.  Whisk in rum.  Cover and chill at least 6 hours.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)

For Coconut Meringue Layer:  Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 325 degrees.  Line 17- by 11-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.  Mix coconut, 1/3 cup sugar, flour, and salt in medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add remaining 1/3 cup sugar; beat until stiff but not dry.  Fold coconut mixture into meringue just until incorporated.  Spread meringue evenly over parchment on prepared sheet, covering completely.  Bake until light golden and just springy to touch, about 20 minutes (meringue will be soft).  Cool completely on baking sheet.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover tightly with foil; store at room temperature.)

For Glaze:  Place chocolate in medium metal bowl.  Bring cream to simmer in small saucepan.  Pour cream over chocolate; whisk until chocolate is melted and smooth.  Whisk in rum.  Let glaze stand at room temperature until thickened and spreadable, about 1 hour.

Place sheet of waxed paper on work surface.  Cut around edges of meringue to loosen.  Invert meringue onto waxed paper.  Peel off parchment.  Cut meringue crosswise in half, then cut lengthwise in thirds, forming six 8 1/2- by 3 2/3-inch rectangles.  Cut piece of cardboard into 8 1/2- by 3 2/3-inch rectangle; cover cardboard with foil.  Place 1 meringue rectangle on cardboard.

Using electric mixer, beat ganache just until lighter-colored and firm enough to spread.  Using offset spatula, spread 3 generous tablespoons ganache evenly over meringue.  Top with second meringue rectangle; press to adhere.  Spread 3 tablespoons ganache over.  Repeat procedure with 3 more meringue rectangles and remaining ganache.  Top with remaining meringue rectangle.  Chill cake until ganache is firm, about 1 hour.

Place cake on rack set over rimmed baking sheet.  Spread top and sides of cake with some of glaze.  Chill 30 minutes.

Place bowl with remaining glaze in skillet of barely simmering water and rewarm just until instant-read thermometer inserted into glaze registers 90 degrees.  Pour glaze over top of cake, allowing glaze to drip down sides, spreading evenly over sides.  Using spatula, scoop up excess glaze on sheet; spread over sides of cake to cover.  Press toasted coconut onto glaze over bottom 1 inch of cake.  Transfer cake to platter.  Chill until glaze is set, at least 1 hour.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep chilled.  Let cake stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving.)

Using serrated knife, cut cake crosswise into 8 slices.  Transfer to plates.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  In this version of the classic Parisian g‚teau, layers of soft coconut meringue alternate with a dark chocolate and rum ganache filling.

Do-aheads: ganache, 2 days; meringue, 1 day; marjolaine, 1 day.

Comments:  Donna Knowlton of Atlanta, Georgia, writes: "As the oldest of five children growing up in rural West Virginia, I was always helping in the kitchen.  My husband is a doctor and works long hours, but we still like sharing a meal at the end of the day.  I don't want to be in the kitchen late at night making something complicated, so I rely on dishes that can be ready in minutes."

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  unpeeled whole heirloom potatoes
  3             ounces  crumbled Gorgonzola cheese or
                        La Fourme d'Ambert blue cheese
     1/2           cup  pecans -- toasted, chopped
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cups  baby arugula - (packed)

Place potatoes in large pot.  Pour enough cold water over to cover; salt generously.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are just tender, 20 to 40 minutes (depending on variety).  Drain.

Return potatoes to pot.  Using large wooden spoon, coarsely crush potatoes in pot.  Add cheese, nuts, and oil.  Stir in arugula and toss to blend.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer to bowl and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  As with tomatoes, the profusion of heirloom varieties of potatoes at farmers' markets has helped us rediscover them as a seasonal ingredient in a rainbow of flavors, colors, and textures.  This recipe is the perfect vehicle for trying any number of them.  Nutty, creamy La Ratte fingerlings are a favorite of French chefs.  German Butterballs, as their name suggests, are soft and buttery.  For even cooking, choose potatoes that are about the same size.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lemons
     1/2           cup  water
  4          teaspoons  coarse kosher salt
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  crËme fra‰che or sour cream
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh dill - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh cilantro - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarsely-crushed cumin seeds
  12             small  fingerling potatoes - (abt 14 oz) -- halved lengthwise
  3             ounces  thinly-sliced smoked salmon -- cut 1/2" by 2 1/2"
                        strips
  1              ounce  caviar
                        Fresh small dill sprigs

Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (yellow part only) from lemons.  Simmer peel, 1/2 cup water, and 4 teaspoons kosher salt in heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat until salt dissolves.  Reduce heat to low and simmer until liquid is reduced to 2 tablespoons and peel is tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Transfer peel with liquid to jar.  Add lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil.  Refrigerate at least 1 day and up to 1 week.

Drain peel; mince.  Stir crËme fra‰che, minced dill, cilantro, and 1 tablespoon minced peel in small bowl.  Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours.

Set rack at lowest position in oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Brush nonstick baking sheet with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil and cumin in large bowl.  Add potatoes; toss to coat.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Arrange potatoes, cut-side down, on baking sheet and roast until tender and cut sides are brown, about 12 minutes.  Cool slightly.

Arrange potato halves, cut-side up, on platter.  Top each with 1 teaspoon crËme fra‰che, 1 salmon strip, and 1/2 teaspoon caviar.  Garnish with dill sprigs.

This recipe yields 24 potato halves.

Comments:  Preserved lemon, an essential ingredient in Moroccan cooking, is made by pickling lemons in salt, lemon juice, and olive oil.  Here, preserving just the peel (begin at least a day ahead) is an easy way to add an exciting note to the crËme fra‰che.

Market Tip:  Our choice to top the potatoes is American caviar ó still indulgent but not endangered.  Order it from petrossian.com or tsarnicoulai.com.

For cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 14- by 10- by 1-inch rimmed baking sheet.  Line sheet with parchment; butter paper.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until smooth.  Add sugar and eggs; beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Mix in next 4 ingredients.  Beat in flour alternately with sour cream in 2 additions each.  Gradually add hot coffee; mix until smooth (batter will be thin).

Pour batter into prepared pan.  Bake cake until toothpick inserted into center comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 25 minutes.  Cool cake in pan on rack.  Cover and chill until cold, about 4 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.)

For chocolate fudge pots:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Place chocolate in bowl.  Bring cream and salt just to boil in medium saucepan.  Pour over chocolate; whisk until melted.  Whisk yolks and sugar in bowl to blend; whisk in hot chocolate mixture.  Transfer mixture to same saucepan.  Cook over medium-low heat until slightly thickened, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes (do not boil).

Divide chocolate custard among ten 1/3-cup ramekins (about 1/4 cup in each).  Place ramekins in large roasting pan.  Add enough water to pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.  Cover pan tightly with foil.  Bake until custards are almost set, about 37 minutes.  Remove ramekins from pan; cool 15 minutes.  Chill uncovered until cold, about 3 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.)

For cherry compote:  Stir cherries and 2/3 cup sugar in large saucepan over medium heat 2 minutes.  Add wine; simmer until slightly reduced, about 4 minutes.  Drain cherries over medium bowl; return juices to saucepan and reserve cherries in same bowl.  Boil juices until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 8 minutes.  Pour over cherries; cool.

For serving:  Using 3-inch-diameter cookie cutter and dipping edges of cutter into cocoa powder, cut 10 rounds from cold cake.  Let cakes come to room temperature.  Using electric mixer, whip cream and 1 teaspoon sugar in bowl until peaks form.  Pour kirsch into 10 small glasses.  Place 1 cake, 1 chocolate fudge pot, spoonful of cherries, whipped cream, and glass of kirsch on each of 10 plates and serve.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  fresh ricotta cheese - (2 lbs)
  2               cups  powdered sugar
  1                cup  mascarpone cheese*
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     3/4           cup  minced crystallized ginger
     3/4           cup  minced dried tart cherries
  4             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  25                    purchased cannoli shells
                        Chopped pistachios
                        Additional powdered sugar

* Italian cream cheese; available at many supermarkets and Italian markets.

Working in 2 batches, blend first 5 ingredients in processor until smooth; add ginger and cherries and process until finely chopped and well incorporated.  Using on/off turns, mix in chocolate just until blended (do not puree).  Transfer filling to large bowl.  (Filling can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before continuing.)

Working in batches, transfer filling to pastry bag without tip.  Pipe into shells.  Sprinkle ends with pistachios.  Chill at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours.  Sift powdered sugar over cannoli and serve.

This recipe yields 25 cannoli.

Comments:  For best results, use fresh ricotta, which is sold at Italian delis and specialty cheese shops.  Avoid packaged brands that include gelatin and preservatives, as these can be watery and have a grainy texture.  Prepared cannoli shells are sold at Italian markets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
                        additional for molds -- all room temperature
  2        tablespoons  loose tea or tea from 2 tea bags
                        = (preferably Earl Grey tea)
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  1              pinch  salt
  2              large  eggs
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-grated lemon peel - (packed)

Line small sieve with 2 layers of damp cheesecloth and set sieve over small bowl.  Melt 5 tablespoons butter in saucepan over low heat.  Mix in tea.  Let stand 10 minutes, then pour into sieve.  Twist cheesecloth tightly around tea mixture, releasing tea-flavored butter into bowl.

Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into medium bowl.  Using electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar in large bowl until thick, about 4 minutes.  Add honey, vanilla, and lemon peel; beat 1 minute longer.  Gently fold in dry ingredients, then tea-flavored butter.  Press plastic wrap onto surface of batter; chill batter at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Brush twelve 3- by 2-inch madeleine molds with butter.  Dust with flour; tap out excess.  Place pan on baking sheet.  Drop 1 scant tablespoon batter into each mold (batter will spread while baking, filling molds completely).

Bake madeleines until golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 10 minutes.  Sharply rap pan on work surface to loosen madeleines, then turn out onto rack.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 12 madeleines.

Comments:  These little scallop-shaped cakes are a classic teatime treat in France.

Baking Tip:  Silicone madeleine molds need no buttering and flouring ó and their flexibility makes unmolding a cinch (you can actually turn them inside out).  Put the mold on a baking sheet so that it will be easy to get the flexible pan in and out of the oven.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whole milk
  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  sugar
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, cooled
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  small or medium-size pitted prunes - -- (abt 6 oz)
     1/2           cup  water
     1/3           cup  raisins
     1/4           cup  Armagnac or other brandy
                        Powdered sugar -- as needed

Combine milk, eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, butter, vanilla, and salt in blender jar.  Blend 1 minute.  Add flour and pulse just until blended, scraping down sides of jar.  Cover and chill in jar at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

Combine prunes, 1/2 cup water, and raisins in heavy small saucepan.  Cook over medium heat until fruit is softened and water is almost evaporated, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Turn off heat.  Pour brandy over fruit.  Using long match, ignite brandy.  Let flames burn off, shaking pan occasionally.  Transfer fruit to small bowl.  Cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and let stand at room temperature.)

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Butter 8-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides.  Line bottom with parchment or waxed paper.  Butter paper.  Dust pan with flour, shaking out excess; place on baking sheet.

Reblend batter until smooth, about 5 seconds.  Pour into prepared cake pan.  Drop prunes and raisins into batter, distributing evenly.  Bake cake on baking sheet until sides are puffed and brown and knife inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour.  Cool cake completely in pan on rack.

Place piece of parchment or waxed paper on flat plate.  Sift powdered sugar onto paper.  Run knife around cake in pan to loosen.  Invert pan onto paper, releasing cake.  Remove pan; peel off paper.  Place serving plate over cake and invert.  Dust top of cake with additional powdered sugar.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A far is a custardy pudding cake, similar to a clafouti but with a dense, smooth, flan-like texture.  This one, studded with brandy-soaked prunes and raisins, is the signature pastry of Brittany, served for breakfast as well as dessert.

Comments:  A far is a custardy pudding cake, similar to a clafouti but with a dense, smooth, flan-like texture.  This one, studded with brandy-soaked prunes and raisins, is the signature pastry of Brittany, served for breakfast as well as dessert.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  2                     vanilla beans -- split lengthwise
  2               cups  whole milk
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        === MERINGUES ===
  2               cups  whole milk
  4              large  egg whites
  1              pinch  salt
     1/4           cup  sugar
                        === CARAMEL ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water

For Sauce:  Scrape seeds from vanilla bean halves into heavy small saucepan; add beans.  Add milk and bring to simmer over medium-high heat.  Remove from heat, cover, and steep 10 minutes.

Whisk yolks and sugar in heavy medium saucepan until thick, about 2 minutes.  Gradually whisk in warm milk mixture (including vanilla beans).  Stir over medium-low heat until custard thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 9 minutes (do not boil).  Strain custard into small bowl.  Cover and chill until cold, at least 3 hours and up to 2 days.

For Meringues:  Lay smooth kitchen towel on work surface.  Pour milk into medium (10-inch) skillet.  Bring milk to simmer over medium heat.

Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl until foamy.  Add salt and beat until whites hold soft peaks.  Add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until whites are stiff and glossy.  Scoop some meringue (about twice the size of an egg) onto large oval spoon.  Using another large spoon and gently transferring meringue from spoon to spoon, shape meringue into smooth oval.  Drop oval into milk.  Quickly shape 2 or 3 more meringues, dropping each into milk.  Simmer meringues 1 minute.  Using heatproof rubber spatula, turn meringues over in milk.  Simmer 1 minute longer (meringues will puff up while poaching).  Using slotted spoon, transfer meringues to towel (meringues will deflate slightly as they cool).  Repeat process, shaping and then poaching enough meringues to make total of 12.  Transfer meringues to waxed-paper-lined baking sheet.  Refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.

For Caramel:  Stir sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and bring to boil, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush to dissolve any sugar crystals.  Boil until syrup is pale golden color, occasionally swirling pan, about 6 minutes.  Remove pan from heat.  Let syrup cool until thick enough to fall from tines of fork in ribbons, about 8 minutes.  (If caramel becomes too thick, rewarm slightly over low heat, stirring constantly.)

Spoon some sauce into center of each plate.  Arrange 2 meringues on each.  Dip fork into caramel and wave back and forth over meringues so that caramel comes off in strands that harden like threads, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Œles flottantes, puffy clouds of softly poached meringue floating on a vanilla custard sauce, may look ethereal on the plate, but this is really a homey French farmhouse dessert.  It was probably devised to make ingenious use of fresh farm eggs and milk, plus a little sugar.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SQUID AND BATTER ===
  1 1/2         pounds  frozen cleaned small squid -- thawed, drained
                        = (bodies and tentacles; or 1 pound fresh)
  1 1/2           cups  all purpose flour -- divided
  1 1/2           cups  rice flour* -- divided
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  unseasoned rice vinegar
  1           teaspoon  peanut oil
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/4           cups  water -- or more if needed
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        === SALAD ===
  4               cups  frisÈe lettuce - (abt 2 heads)
  2               cups  cubed (1/2") peeled seeded fresh papaya
     1/2           cup  whole roasted salted cashews
  6                     fresh water chestnuts -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced into rounds
     1/3           cup  thin strips of peeled fresh ginger
                        Spicy-Sour Dressing -- (see recipe)
                        Toasted sesame seeds -- as needed

* Available at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and natural foods stores.

For Squid And Batter:  Cut squid bodies into 1/2-inch-thick rounds.  Place all squid in large sieve set over bowl.  Refrigerate at least 1 hour to drain well.

Place 1 cup flour, 1 cup rice flour, soy sauce, vinegar, peanut oil, and sugar in large bowl.  Gradually add 1 1/4 cups water, whisking until batter is smooth.  If necessary, whisk in more water by teaspoonfuls until batter reaches heavy cream consistency.  Let batter stand at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours at room temperature, whisking occasionally.

Mix remaining 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup rice flour in large bowl.  Add squid.  Toss until squid is coated, separating pieces.  Turn mixture into another sieve and shake off excess flour.  Sprinkle squid generously with salt, tossing in sieve.  Mix coated squid into batter.

Pour oil into heavy large saucepan to depth of 1 1/2 inches.  Attach clip-on deep-fry thermometer and heat oil over medium-high heat to 350 degrees to 360 degrees.  Working in batches and stirring often with tongs to separate pieces, drop squid into oil.  Fry until crisp and brown, about 4 minutes per batch.  Using slotted spoon, transfer squid to paper towels.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

For Salad:  Combine frisÈe, papaya, cashews, water chestnuts, and ginger in large bowl.  Add enough dressing to coat lightly.  Divide salad among plates, mounding in center.

Pile squid atop salad on each plate.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Serve, passing remaining dressing separately.

This recipe yields 6 small servings.

Market Tip:  Fresh water chestnuts are sold at Asian markets.  If unavailable, use a large melon baller to cut out spheres of jicama, then slice into rounds.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all purpose flour
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  5        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1                cup  whipping cream -- plus
  3        tablespoons  whipping cream
     1/3           cup  raspberry jam -- more or less
                        = (do not use seedless)
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  rose water -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in large bowl.  Add butter; rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles fine meal.  Gradually add 1 cup cream, mixing until dough comes together.

Turn dough out onto sheet of foil; pat to 1/2-inch thickness.  Using 3-inch heart-shaped or round cookie cutter, cut out scones.  Gather scraps; pat to 1/2-inch thickness and cut out additional scones.

Using floured knife, start at point of each heart and cut horizontally halfway through scones; fill with 1 generous teaspoon jam (jam will show at edges).  Transfer to baking sheet.  Bake scones until brown, about 18 minutes.  Transfer to rack; cool scones until slightly warm.

Meanwhile, mix powdered sugar, remaining 3 tablespoons cream, and rose water in bowl to blend.  Spread glaze over scones.  Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 12 scones.

Comments:  Rose water lends a subtle floral flavor to the scones; it can be found at some supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and Middle Eastern markets.

Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  all purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  whole milk
  4              large  eggs -- separated
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- melted
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        Additional melted butter
                        Pure maple syrup

Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in large bowl to blend.  Whisk milk and egg yolks in medium bowl to blend.  Whisk milk mixture into dry ingredients.  Add 2 tablespoons melted butter and whisk until batter is smooth.

Beat egg whites in another medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add sugar, beating until stiff but not dry.  Fold whites into batter in 2 additions.

Heat nonstick griddle or large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Brush generously with additional melted butter.  For each pancake, fill 1/4 cup measuring cup half full and drop batter onto griddle.  Cook pancakes until bottoms are brown, about 3 minutes.

Using spatula, turn pancakes over and cook until bottoms are brown and pancakes are cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to plates.  Serve warm with syrup.

This recipe yields about 28 pancakes.

Comments:  Bev writes: "Many of our favorite family recipes come from my mother-in-law, Hannah, who was a wonderful cook.  When my sons were younger I made her chocolate macaroons and pancakes all the time.  I don't make them quite as often as I used to, but they're still a hit with my husband."

The fluffy texture of these tender pancakes comes from folding beaten egg whites into the batter.

Comments:  Bev writes: &quot;Many of our favorite family recipes come from my mother-in-law, Hannah, who was a wonderful cook.  When my sons were younger I made her chocolate macaroons and pancakes all the time.  I don&apos;t make them quite as often as I used to, but they&apos;re still a hit with my husband.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
The fluffy texture of these tender pancakes comes from folding beaten egg whites into the batter.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BRINE ===
  6             quarts  cold water -- divided
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  fine sea salt
  8              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  6                     Turkish bay leaves -- crumbled
  4                     juniper berries*
  2          teaspoons  whole black peppercorns
                        === PORK ===
  1                     center-cut 6- to 6 1/2-lb pork rib roast -- well-trimmed
                        = (8-bone; about 12" to 14" long)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  whole black peppercorns -- crushed in mortar
                        with pestle or in resealable plastic bag
                        with mallet

* Available in the spice section of most supermarkets.

For Brine:  Combine 1 quart water and all remaining ingredients in medium saucepan.  Bring to boil, stirring until sugar and salt dissolve.  Pour brine into wide pot or container large enough to hold pork (3- to 4-gallon capacity).  Add remaining 5 quarts cold water; stir to blend.  Let stand until brine is cool to touch, about 1 hour.

For Pork:  Place pork on work surface. Trim off all but 1/4-inch layer of fat from roast.  Turn roast over so that rib bones point up.  Using boning knife and starting where meat meets rib bones, gradually cut loin away from rack of bones, leaving 2 inches of meat attached to bones (do not cut meat off bones completely).  Tie meat back onto bones with kitchen string at 2-inch intervals.  Place roast in brine, submerging pork completely and weighing down with heavy pot if necessary.  Cover and refrigerate 5 days.

Remove pork from brine; discard brine.  Rinse pork under cold running water for 5 minutes to reduce saltiness; pat dry with paper towels.  Place pork on rack set over sheet of foil; let stand at room temperature 2 hours.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Place pork on rack in large roasting pan.  Mix thyme and crushed peppercorns in small bowl; sprinkle mixture over pork.  Roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into center of pork registers 140 degrees, about 1 hour.  Remove from oven.  Let roast rest 30 minutes (internal temperature of roast will increase 5 to 10 degrees).

Remove kitchen string from roast.  Cut meat into slices and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The pork is prepared for roasting like a prime rib of beef; you can follow the method here or have your butcher do it for you.  For best results, start brining the pork five days before you plan to roast it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  golden raisins
     1/3           cup  warm whole milk -- (105 to 115 degrees)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
  1 2/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs
  1              large  egg yolk
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/2" cubes,
                        and at room temperature
                        Powdered sugar -- as needed

Place raisins in small microwave-safe bowl.  Cover with water.  Microwave on high 1 minute.  Let stand until cool.

Stir milk and yeast in large bowl of heavy-duty mixer to blend.  Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 8 minutes.  Attach dough hook.  Add flour and salt to bowl; beat on low speed until blended, scraping sides of bowl often.  Whisk eggs and yolk in small bowl to blend.  Gradually add eggs to dough, beating on low speed until just blended.  Add 3 tablespoons sugar, increase speed to medium, and beat until dough is smooth, scraping sides and bottom of bowl often, about 5 minutes.  Reduce speed to medium-low.  Add butter, 1 cube at a time, beating to incorporate each (dough will be very soft).  Scrape dough off sides of bowl and dough hook.  Beat dough until well-blended and pulling away from sides of bowl, about 8 minutes.

Remove bowl from mixer.  Drain raisins.  Stir raisins into dough.  Scrape dough into medium bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour 30 minutes.  Using rubber spatula, turn dough over several times in bowl to deflate.  Cover again and chill 2 hours, turning to deflate if dough rises.  Cover tightly and keep refrigerated overnight.

Generously butter 8- to 9-cup kouglof mold.  Roll chilled dough between palms and work surface to 12- to 15-inch rope and place around center post in prepared mold.  Cover mold with plastic wrap and let dough rise until almost level with top edge, about 3 hours.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Bake kouglof uncovered until golden brown on top and tester inserted near center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.  Cool in pan 2 minutes.  Turn out onto rack and cool.

Sift powdered sugar over kouglof.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This lightly sweet brioche is the coffee cake of Alsace (where it is also known by its German name, kugelhopf).  It can be baked in an eight- or nine-cup crown-shaped kouglof (or kugelhopf) mold, a fluted ring mold, or a tube or Bundt pan.  While the cake is best on the same day it is baked, leftovers are delicious toasted.

                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  linguine
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2               cans  chopped clams in juice - (6 1/2 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  18             small  clams -- scrubbed
                        = (such as Manila or tiny littleneck)
     1/4           cup  whipping cream

Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain pasta.

Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add garlic and sautÈ until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add canned clams with juice, basil, tarragon, and parsley.  Add fresh clams.  Cover; reduce heat to medium and cook until clams open, about 6 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer fresh clams to plate (discard any clams that do not open).

Test-Kitchen Tip:  The size of clams can vary, so larger ones may take a minute or two longer to cook.

Comments:  Anitra writes: "I'm a perfume detective who hunts down hard-to-find and discontinued scents.  One of the benefits of running my business from home is that I get to cook every day.  I usually make dishes that I've relied on for years, like this linguine recipe.  It takes just minutes to prepare, and as recipes go, it's practically foolproof."

  1                     blood orange, Cara Cara orange, or

  2                     mahi-mahi fillets - (6 oz ea)

Using small sharp knife, cut peel and white pith from orange.  Working over small bowl, cut between membranes to release segments.  Add avocado, onion, jalapeÒo, and lime juice to oranges in bowl; stir gently to blend.  Season salsa to taste with salt.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  Meyer lemons
  5               cups  water
  5 1/2           cups  sugar -- more or less
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  1              pinch  salt

Working on large plate to catch juice, cut lemons in half lengthwise, then very thinly crosswise.  Discard seeds.  Pack enough lemons and any juice to measure 2 1/2 cups.  Transfer to large nonreactive pot.  Add 5 cups water; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium; simmer 10 minutes.  Remove from heat; let stand uncovered overnight.

Measure lemon mixture (there should be about 5 1/2 cups).  Return to same pot.  Add equal amount of sugar (about 5 1/2 cups).  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Add pinch of salt.  Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves.

Attach clip-on candy thermometer.  Maintaining active boil and adjusting heat to prevent boiling over, cook until temperature reaches 230 degrees, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.  Cool to room temperature.  Transfer to jars.  Cover and chill.  (Can be made 2 weeks ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Bring to room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields about 4 1/2 cups.

             Muscovy Duck Breasts With Pomegranate-Wine Sauce

Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1 1/2           cups  minced shallots - (abt 8 large)
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/4           cups  dry white wine -- divided
     3/4           cup  dry red wine
  2               cans  low-salt chicken broth - (14 oz ea)
  1                can  low-salt beef broth - (14 oz)
     3/4           cup  fresh orange juice
  2        tablespoons  pomegranate molasses*
  3          teaspoons  minced fresh marjoram -- divided
  1                     fresh bay leaf
  4             pounds  boneless Muscovy duck breasts
                        = (4 to 8 breast halves, depending on
                        size)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour

* Available at some supermarkets and Middle Eastern markets, and by mail at adrianascaravan.com.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add shallots; sautÈ until golden brown, about 18 minutes.  Add garlic; sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add 1 cup white wine and 3/4 cup red wine.  Boil until most of liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes.  Add both broths, orange juice, pomegranate molasses, 1 teaspoon marjoram, and bay leaf; boil until mixture is reduced to 2 cups, about 20 minutes.  Discard bay leaf.  (Sauce can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Set rack at lowest position in oven; preheat to 450 degrees.  Rub meat side of duck breasts with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 2 teaspoons marjoram.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Working in batches, sear breasts, skin-side down, in heavy large skillet over high heat until skin browns and fat is rendered, about 8 minutes.

Transfer duck breasts, skin-side down, to rimmed baking sheet.  Drain all but 1 1/2 tablespoons fat from skillet; reserve skillet.  Roast duck until thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 145 degrees for medium-rare, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring sauce to simmer.  Rewarm duck fat in reserved skillet over medium heat.  Add flour; stir 1 minute.  Gradually whisk in sauce.

Transfer duck breasts to cutting board.  Pour off all fat from baking sheet.  Add 1/4 cup white wine to sheet and scrape up browned bits; add to sauce.  Simmer sauce 3 minutes to blend flavors.  Season with salt and pepper.  Thinly slice duck breasts and divide among 8 plates.  Drizzle with sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Muscovy duck is the leanest of all domesticated duck breeds, yet tender and full-flavored.  This technique makes it even leaner by first rendering the fat from the skin (which also makes it deliciously crisp).  If you don't find Muscovy duck in stores, order it online from dartangnan.com or grimaud.com.

Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced shallot
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried crushed red pepper
  2              large  Dungeness crabs -- cooked, cleaned,
                        and cracked - (abt 4 1/4 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme -- divided
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley -- divided
     1/2           cup  blood orange juice
                        = (or regular orange juice)
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated blood orange peel
                        = (or regular orange peel)

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Melt butter with oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Stir in garlic, shallot, and dried crushed red pepper.  Add crabs; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon chopped thyme and 1 tablespoon chopped parsley over crabs.  Stir to combine.  Place skillet in oven and roast crabs until heated through, stirring once, about 12 minutes.

Using tongs, transfer crabs to platter.  Add orange juice and peel to same skillet; boil until sauce is reduced by about half, about 5 minutes.  Spoon sauce over crabs.  Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon thyme and 1 tablespoon parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  The buttery sauce that coats the crabmeat and the shells is part of the pleasure of this dish; to really enjoy it, dispense with the utensils and just eat the crab with your hands.  Serve with a green salad dressed with tarragon vinaigrette and plenty of crusty sourdough bread.

Dungeness Crab:  These large crabs are prized for their sweet, tender meat.  They're named for Dungeness, Washington, where they were first harvested commercially, but they are caught in the Pacific Ocean all the way from Alaska to Mexico.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PEARS ===
  4               cups  water
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  3             medium  firm-but-ripe Bosc pears - (abt 7 oz ea) -- peeled
                        === CRUST ===
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
     1/4           cup  blanched slivered almonds
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  9        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick plus 1 tbspn) -- room temperature
  1              large  egg yolk
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
                        === ALMOND FILLING ===
     2/3           cup  blanched slivered almonds
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  7        tablespoons  sugar
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- room temperature
  1              large  egg
                        Powdered sugar -- (optional)

For Pears:  Bring 4 cups water, sugar, and lemon juice to boil in large saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Add pears.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until pears are very tender, turning occasionally, about 20 minutes.  Cool pears in syrup.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

For Crust:  Blend powdered sugar, almonds, and salt in processor until nuts are finely ground.  Add butter and blend until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally.  Mix in egg yolk.  Add flour.  Using on/off turns, blend until dough comes together in clumps.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic and chill at least 3 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

For Almond Filling:  Finely grind almonds and flour in processor.  Mix in 7 tablespoons sugar, then butter, blending until smooth.  Mix in egg.  Transfer filling to medium bowl.  Cover and chill at least 3 hours.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Roll out chilled dough on floured sheet of parchment paper to 12-inch round, lifting and turning dough occasionally to free from paper.  Using paper as aid, turn dough into 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom; peel off paper.  Seal any cracks in dough.  Trim overhang to 1/2 inch.  Fold overhang in, making double-thick sides.  Pierce crust all over with fork.  Freeze crust 10 minutes.

Line crust with buttered foil, buttered-side down, then fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake crust until sides are set, about 20 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Bake crust until sides are golden and bottom is set, pressing with back of fork if crust bubbles, about 10 minutes longer.  Cool crust in pan on rack.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Spread almond filling evenly in crust.  Stem pears and cut each in half lengthwise; scoop out cores.  Cut each half crosswise into thin slices.  Gently press each pear half to fan slices but keep slices tightly overlapped.  Slide spatula under pears and arrange atop filling like spokes of wheel with narrow ends in center.

Bake tart until golden and tester inserted into center of filling comes out clean, about 55 minutes.  Cool tart in pan on rack.  Push pan bottom up, releasing tart from pan.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)  Cut tart into wedges; sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This is my friend Paule Caillat's recipe, with its meltingly tender all-butter crust.  Instructions for poaching fresh pears are included, but if you want to save time, do what Paule and other French women in a hurry do ó use canned pear halves.  Just drain the canned pears, dry them very well, and carry on.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     pork tenderloins - (1 lb ea)
  2 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary -- divided
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4              large  shallots -- chopped
     3/4           cup  diced dried apples
     1/4         pound  kumquats -- quartered, seeded
     1/2           cup  fresh cranberries or frozen -- thawed
  1 1/2           cups  low-salt chicken broth
     1/2           cup  dry white wine

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Sprinkle pork with 2 teaspoons rosemary, salt, and pepper.  Heat oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Add pork (cut to fit, if necessary) and sautÈ until brown, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer pork to plate.  Add shallots to skillet and sautÈ until brown, about 4 minutes.  Add apples, kumquats, and cranberries; stir until fruit mixture is heated through, about 1 minute.  Add broth, wine, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon rosemary.  Boil 1 minute.  Return pork and any juices to skillet, turning to coat with sauce.

Place skillet in oven and roast pork until thermometer inserted into center registers 145 to 150 degrees, about 25 minutes.  Transfer pork to platter; let stand 10 minutes.  If thicker sauce is desired, boil juices in skillet until reduced enough to coat spoon.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Slice pork crosswise and spoon sauce over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Gemma Sanita Sciabica of Modesto, California, writes: "My husband's family produces olive oil, and I'm the company's recipe developer.  We often hear from customers who love our oil but complain that they don't have the time to cook.  Their comments inspired me to share my favorite recipes, which show just how simple great Italian food can be."

Test-Kitchen Tip:  To prevent spoilage, place kumquats in resealable plastic bag lined with paper towels and chill.  They'll stay fresh up to two weeks.

     1/2         pound  red beets - (abt 3 medium)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  butter
  1 1/2      teaspoons  olive oil
  1                     leek, white and pale green parts only -- chopped
  1              small  onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped
     1/8      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2               cups  water
  1              small  bay leaf
  1                     fresh thyme sprig
  1                     fresh parsley sprig
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  crËme fraÓche or sour cream

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Wrap beets in foil and roast until tender when pierced with fork, about 1 hour.  Cool.  Peel beets.  Cut 1/4 of 1 beet into 1/4-inch cubes; reserve for garnish.  Cut remaining beets into 1/2-inch pieces.

Melt butter with oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add leek, onion, and celery and cook until beginning to brown, stirring frequently, about 13 minutes.  Stir in ginger, allspice, white pepper, and 1/2-inch beet pieces.  Cook until vegetables begin to stick to bottom of pot, stirring frequently, about 7 minutes.

Add 2 cups water, bay leaf, thyme sprig, and parsley sprig.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 25 minutes.  Remove bay leaf, thyme sprig, and parsley sprig.  Cool soup slightly.

Working in batches, puree soup in blender with cream.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly, cover, and refrigerate.)

Gently rewarm soup (do not boil).  Divide between 2 bowls.  Garnish each with 1 tablespoon crËme fraÓche.  Sprinkle with reserved beet cubes.

To garnish soup, spoon two tablespoons crËme fraÓche into one corner of a resealable plastic bag. Cut tip off corner and pipe heart atop each serving of soup.

This recipe yields 2 first-course servings.

What To Drink:  Pour brut or rosÈ Champagne throughout the meal, or pair the soup with a light red wine (try an Oregon Pinot Noir) and the Oven Roasted Dungeness Crab with a fragrant dry white, such as Viognier or New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  1         tablespoon  whole coriander seeds
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  2        tablespoons  white balsamic vinegar
  1              small  garlic clove -- peeled
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === PESTO ===
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
  1              bunch  fresh cilantro - (abt 2 cups) -- coarsely chopped
  1              bunch  fresh chives - (abt 1/3 cup) -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  fresh mint leaves - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  chopped seeded jalapeÒo chile
  1              small  garlic clove -- peeled
  1           teaspoon  coarse kosher salt - (scant)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
                        === BEETS ===
  2             pounds  baby beets - (abt 1" dia)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Coarse kosher salt -- as needed
  6               cups  assorted red baby lettuces
                        = (such as red oak leaf and lolla rossa)

For Vinaigrette:  Stir coriander in small skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 4 minutes.  Cool.  Coarsely grind coriander in mortar with pestle or in spice mill.  Transfer to small bowl.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet over medium heat.  Add shallots; sautÈ until soft, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to bowl with coriander.  Add vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper.  Gradually whisk in 7 tablespoons oil.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill; discard garlic after 1 hour.  Let vinaigrette stand at room temperature 1 hour before using.)

For Pesto:  Puree first 9 ingredients in blender until smooth.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Reblend before continuing.)  Whisk in lime juice.

For Beets:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Wash and dry beets.  Cut off beet greens 1 inch from top of beets; reserve for another use.  Rub beets with oil.  Place light-colored beets in 1 roasting pan and red beets in another; sprinkle with coarse salt.  Cover pans tightly with foil.  Roast until beets are just tender, about 55 minutes.  Cool slightly.

Using towel, rub off peel and stems from beets.  Cut beets in half.  Place light-colored beets and red beets in 2 separate bowls.  Toss beets in each bowl with 2 tablespoons vinaigrette.  Let stand 30 minutes.  Toss lettuces in bowl with some of vinaigrette to coat lightly; divide among plates and top with beets.  Drizzle pesto around salads and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Our youth culture has even reached the green market: Baby vegetables are among the most sought-after produce, whether we buy them because they are sweeter and more tender than their full-grown counterparts or just because they look great on the plate.  Seek out golden yellow, chioggia (an Italian heirloom variety that has white and pink rings inside), and Albino beets at farmers' markets.

                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  1              pound  large carrots - (abt 4) -- peeled, and

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  20                    cherry tomatoes -- halved
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar

  1                cup  bottled clam juice
     1/2           cup  Riesling wine
                        = (or other fruity white wine)
     1/4      teaspoon  saffron threads - (loosely packed)
  1              pinch  dried crushed red pepper
  1         tablespoon  butter
                        === FISH ===
  4                     monkfish fillets - (7 to 8 oz ea)
                        = (or halibut fillets)
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme

                        Fresh basil sprigs -- (optional)

For Sauce:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.  Combine tomatoes, basil leaves, oil, vinegar, and sugar in medium bowl; toss to blend.  Spread tomato mixture in single layer on prepared sheet; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast until tomatoes are slightly shriveled, about 40 minutes.

Add butter and stir until melted.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Rewarm over medium heat before serving.)

For Fish:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Line another rimmed baking sheet with parchment.  Arrange fish on parchment; brush fish with oil.  Sprinkle fish with thyme, lemon peel, salt, and pepper.  Roast fish, without turning, until just opaque in center, about 10 minutes for monkfish and 6 minutes for halibut.

Spoon Celeriac Mash onto 4 plates.  Top each with 1 fish fillet.  Spoon sauce over.  Garnish with basil sprigs, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  sugar snap peas
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Fleur de sel
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives

Preheat broiler.  Line large baking sheet with foil.  Toss peas with oil on prepared baking sheet.  Spread peas in single layer.  Broil until just crisp-tender and beginning to brown in spots, stirring once with spatula, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to bowl.  Sprinkle with fleur de sel, then chives, and serve.

Comments:  The simplest of preparations and a sprinkling of fleur de sel ó a delicate sea salt ó are the only enhancements these naturally crisp sweet peas need.  Fleur de sel is sold at cookware stores, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

     1/4           cup  pine nuts -- toasted

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Wrap each onion tightly in foil.  Place onions in roasting pan and roast until very tender when pierced with knife, about 1 1/2 hours.  Cool.  Trim and remove onion peel.  Halve onions lengthwise, then slice thinly lengthwise.

Transfer to medium bowl.  Add vinegar and lemon juice and toss to blend.  Let onion mixture stand at room temperature at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.

Combine 1/2 cup vermouth and currants in small saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Remove from heat.  Cover and let steep at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.

Stir currant mixture, oil, and 1 tablespoon vermouth into onion mixture.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before continuing.)  Stir in pine nuts.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     refrigerated pie crusts - (one 15-oz pkg) -- room temperature
  1 1/2         pounds  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/3" cubes
  9        tablespoons  sugar -- divided
     1/2           cup  gingersnap cookie crumbs
     1/3           cup  orange marmalade
     1/3           cup  golden raisins
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
  1         tablespoon  whipping cream

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish with 1 pie crust.  Mix apples, 8 tablespoons sugar, cookie crumbs, marmalade, raisins, and orange peel in large bowl.  Spoon filling into crust-lined dish.  Top with remaining crust.  Press crust edges together to seal; crimp edge decoratively.  Cut 1-inch hole in center.

Blend cream and 1 tablespoon sugar in small bowl; brush over crust.  Bake pie until crust is golden and filling bubbles thickly, about 45 minutes.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Evelyn Herring of Laguna Woods, California, writes: "My mother was raised in Scotland and learned to cook at a time when quality ingredients were hard to come by.  She had to be imaginative, often substituting ingredients and improvising recipes.  My own cooking has become Americanized over the years, but I still rely on her recipes.  They're easy and always taste as good as the first time I tried them."

Crushed gingersnap cookies, marmalade, and raisins set this pie apart from the American version.

Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  6        tablespoons  Banyuls vinegar* -- divided
                        = (or Sherry wine vinegar)
  1                     shallot -- thinly slivered
  12            ounces  assorted red and green chicories
                        = (such as radicchio, red and green
                        Belgian endive, escarole hearts, and
                        frisÈe)
  24             large  sea scallops
  3        tablespoons  water

* Banyuls vinegar is a rich, oak-aged vingear (made from the naturally sweet wine of the same name) from the south of France.  It can be found at specialty foods stores and online at chefshop.com.

Whisk 2/3 cup oil, 3 tablespoons vinegar, and shallot in small bowl to blend.  Season vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper.

Very thinly slice radicchio and endive; tear escarole and frisÈe into 2-inch lengths.  Place in large bowl.  (Vinaigrette and slaw can be made 6 hours ahead.  Chill dressing; let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before using.  Place damp kitchen towel over slaw and chill.)

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper.  Working in batches, add scallops to skillet and cook until golden and just opaque in center, about 1 1/2 minutes per side.

Rewhisk vinaigrette; pour over slaw and toss to coat.  Divide slaw among 8 plates.  Arrange 3 scallops atop slaw on each plate.  Add remaining 3 tablespoons vinegar to same skillet along with 3 tablespoons water.  Bring to boil over medium heat, scraping up any browned bits and dissolving any caramelized juices.  Drizzle juices over scallops.

This recipe yields 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  The delicate, tendriled texture of frisÈe is essential to the slaw.  Round out the lettuce mix with a selection of chicories.

What To Drink:  Barbera d'Alba from the Piedmont region of Italy pairs well with this first course.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  orange juice
     1/2    tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2           cups  all purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2           cup  chilled unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- diced
  2          teaspoons  sesame seeds
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated orange peel - (packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-grated lemon peel - (packed)
                        Whipping cream -- as needed

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.

Whisk egg, orange juice, and lemon juice in small bowl to blend.  Whisk flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in large bowl to blend; add butter.  Rub in with fingertips until coarse meal forms.  Mix in sesame seeds, orange peel, and lemon peel.  Add egg mixture and toss until moist clumps form, adding cream by tablespoonfuls if dough is dry.  Turn dough out onto floured work surface.  Knead gently for several turns until dough comes together.

Roll dough out on floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness.  Using 2-inch round cutter, cut dough rounds.  Gather dough scraps and reroll, cutting out more rounds.  Arrange on prepared sheets.  Bake until firm to touch and cooked through but pale, about 15 minutes.

This recipe yields about 32 crakers.

Comments:  Evelyn writes: "My mother was raised in Scotland and learned to cook at a time when quality ingredients were hard to come by.  She had to be imaginative, often substituting ingredients and improvising recipes.  My own cooking has become Americanized over the years, but I still rely on her recipes.  They're easy and always taste as good as the first time I tried them."

These savory treats, called biscuits in Scotland, go well with cocktails or tea.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2          teaspoons  dry mustard
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
  3        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  12             large  eggs
  6             slices  brioche loaf or egg bread, 3/4" thk -- lightly toasted,
                        and each slice cut in half on diagonal
  8             ounces  thinly-sliced smoked salmon (not lox)
  3              large  egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
                        Fresh dill sprigs -- (optional)

Combine shallots and mustard in medium saucepan.  Gradually whisk in wine.  Boil over high heat until mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup, whisking often, about 10 minutes.  Whisk in cream.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Fill large bowl with cold water.  Bring large skillet of water to boil; add vinegar.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Working with 6 whole eggs at a time, crack eggs open and add to simmering water.  Cook until whites are set, about 3 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer 1 egg at a time to cold water.  Reserve skillet with vinegar water.  (Can be prepared 1 hour ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.)

Place 2 toast triangles on each of 6 plates.  Top with salmon.  Bring vinegar water to simmer.  Transfer cream sauce to top of double boiler over simmering water.  Whisk 3 raw egg yolks into cream sauce.  Whisk constantly until sauce thickens and instant-read thermometer inserted into sauce registers 160 degrees, about 4 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Add chopped dill and whisk 1 minute.

Using slotted spoon, gently transfer poached eggs, 1 at a time, from bowl of cold water to skillet of simmering vinegar water.  Cook eggs until warm, about 30 seconds.  Using slotted spoon, transfer 1 poached egg to each toast triangle.  Spoon sauce over.  Garnish with dill sprigs, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  If you prefer, the eggs can be fried instead of poached.  Do-ahead steps make this dish very manageable ó even for six.  The sauce can be prepared the day before.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
  1 1/2           cups  sliced lemongrass* - (6 stalks)
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  unseasoned rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  sugar

  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped shallots (2 to 3 large)
     1/2           cup  chopped peeled fresh ginger
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced kumquats -- seeded
  1                     red Thai chile -- sliced thin rounds
                        === CHICKEN ===
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  4          teaspoons  turmeric
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  3                     boned chicken halves
                        = (from 3 1/3 lb chickens; or 3 boneless
                        chicken breast halves with skin and 6
                        boneless chicken thighs with skin)
                        Chopped fresh cilantro -- for serving

* Available in the produce section of some supermarkets and Asian markets.

For dressing:  Bring first 5 ingredients to boil in medium saucepan over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Cool lemongrass syrup; strain into small bowl.

Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat.  Add shallots and ginger; sautÈ 5 minutes.  Add kumquats and lemongrass syrup; simmer 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Mix in chile; cool.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

For chicken:  Place large rack on large rimmed baking sheet.  Mix sugar, turmeric, and cayenne in small bowl.  Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt and generous amount of spice mixture.  Arrange chicken, skin-side down, on rack.  Let stand at room temperature 2 hours or cover and chill overnight.

Preheat broiler.  Broil chicken halves on rack on baking sheet until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.  Turn chicken over and broil until skin is charred, about 5 minutes, or broil chicken parts 1 minute, then turn and broil until skin is charred, about 5 minutes.  Remove from broiler.

Set oven temperature at 450 degrees.  Roast chicken on rack on same sheet until cooked through, about 25 minutes for halves and 14 minutes for parts.

Transfer chicken halves to board.  Cut each into 4 pieces, or cut each chicken breast in half and leave thighs intact.  Arrange chicken on platter.  Spoon dressing over; sprinkle with cilantro.

This recipe yields 6 small servings.

Comments:  If using chicken halves, ask the butcher to bone them for you.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  ground Aleppo pepper*
  1         tablespoon  Hungarian sweet paprika
  2          teaspoons  coarse kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  whole Malabar black peppercorns -- freshly ground**
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh sage
  4                     kurobuta/Berkshire bone-in rib pork chops -- (1 1/4" to 1 1/2" th
                        abt 10 to 12 oz ea)
  5        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Braised Bacon, Pomegranate, And
                        Pine Nut Relish -- (see recipe)

* Ground Aleppo pepper from Syria has a moderate heat level and tastes slightly sweet.  It is available at some specialty foods stores and by mail from Surfas (310-559-4770; surfasonline.com).

** Malabar peppercorns, from the coast of western India, are especially pungent and zesty.  They are available in the spice section of some supermarkets and by mail from The Spice Hunter(800-444-3061; spicehunter.com).

Mix Aleppo pepper, paprika, coarse salt, ground Malabar pepper, and fresh sage in small bowl.  Brush pork on both sides with 2 tablespoons oil.  Sprinkle generously with all of spice mixture; press to adhere.  Spread flour on plate.  Dredge pork in flour; shake off excess.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Add pork and cook until brown, 3 minutes per side.  Transfer skillet to oven and bake until instant-read thermometer inserted into center of pork registers 145 degrees, about 10 minutes.

Serve pork with Braised Bacon, Pomegranate, and Pine Nut Relish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Once upon a time, pork chops had flavor.  Legend has it that over 300 years ago, Oliver Cromwell sampled some delicious pork in Berkshire, England.  In the 19th century, the Berkshire breed was refined in the United States and Japan (where it is known as kurobuta).  A revived interest in this heirloom pork, with its higher fat content and therefore juicier meat, lets modern-day diners enjoy pork the way it was meant to be.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPICED SUGARPLUMS ===
     1/2           cup  pitted prunes - (packed)
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  Calvados
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
                        === APPLES ===
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/4           cup  sugar
  4             medium  Granny Smith apples - (abt 2 lbs) -- peeled, quartered,
                        and cored
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry - (half 17.3-oz p -- thawed
                        = (preferably all-butter)
                        === CALVADOS CREAM ===
  8              large  egg yolks
     2/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  4          teaspoons  sugar
     2/3           cup  Calvados
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream

For Sugarplums:  Stir first 4 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Cover and simmer until prunes are very soft, about 15 minutes.  Uncover and simmer over low heat until mixture is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 4 minutes.  Add Calvados and spices; mash prunes in pan into thick jam-like spread.  (Can be prepared 1 week ahead.  Cover with plastic and refrigerate.)

For Apples:  Melt butter in heavy medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add sugar and cook until sugar melts and turns deep amber, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.  Add apples and cook until just tender and browned, shifting and turning apples occasionally, about 12 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Cool in skillet.

Roll pastry out on lightly floured surface to thin 13- by 13-inch square.  Using 4-inch-round cookie cutter, cut out 8 rounds.  Transfer rounds to parchment-lined heavy large baking sheet.  Using fork, pierce pastry rounds all over, leaving 1/3-inch border around edge.  Chill pastry until firm, about 15 minutes.

Spread 1 slightly rounded tablespoon of sugarplum mixture evenly over center of each round, leaving 1/3-inch border.  Slice each apple quarter into 5 thin wedges.  Fan out 10 apple slices atop sugarplum mixture on each round, forming rosette.  Reserve any juices in small bowl.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover tartlets and any juices separately and refrigerate.)

For Calvados Cream:  Whisk yolks, 2/3 cup sugar, and Calvados in medium bowl.  Set bowl over pan of gently boiling water.  Whisk constantly until mixture thickens and candy thermometer registers 165 degrees, about 5 minutes.  Cool, stirring occasionally.  Whip cream until soft peaks form.  Fold cooled egg mixture into whipped cream.  Cover and refrigerate.  (Calvados cream can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

Position rack in upper third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Drizzle each tartlet with reserved juices and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon sugar.  Bake until crust is deep golden brown, about 18 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature with Calvados cream.

This recipe yields 8 tartlets.

Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  grapeseed oil or olive oil -- divided
  2          teaspoons  Thai red curry paste* -- more or less
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1                cup  canned unsweetened coconut milk*
  1                cup  low-salt chicken broth
  2               cans  straw mushrooms - (5.95 oz ea) -- drained
  3                     kaffir lime leaves
                        = (or 2 tspns grated lime peel)
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce*
                        = (such as nam pla or nuoc nam)
  1         tablespoon  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  6                     cherry tomatoes -- quartered
  2                     Cornish game hens - (1 1/3 lbs ea) -- thawed if frozen,
                        halved lengthwise, backbones removed
                        Fresh basil leaves
  1              Small  fresh or dried red chiles** -- (optional garnish)

* Sold in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets and at Asian markets.

** Use any type of small fresh or dried chiles you find in the produce section or spice section of the supermarket.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add curry paste and tomato paste and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes.  Add coconut milk, broth, mushrooms, kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, and brown sugar; bring to simmer.  Remove from heat.  Add cherry tomatoes.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Sprinkle hens with salt and pepper.  Add hens to skillet and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side.

Transfer hens to 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass or ceramic baking dish.  Pour sauce over.  Bake uncovered until hens are cooked through, about 35 minutes.

Transfer hens to shallow serving bowl; tent with foil.  Skim fat from sauce.  Pour sauce into large skillet; boil 5 minutes.  Pour sauce over hens.  Garnish with basil and chiles, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Goes Great With:  Long-grain rice cooked with a few cardamom pods and grated lemon peel and sautÈed spinach.

What To Drink:  Sp‰tlese Riesling or Oregon Pinot Noir.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  Curry pastes vary in strength and spiciness from brand to brand, so start by using one teaspoon if you prefer a milder sauce.

Comments:  The delicious sauce has the complex, aromatic flavors of a Thai curry, but is very easy to prepare, thanks to purchased curry paste (now sold in many supermarkets).  Look for fresh or frozen kaffir lime leaves ó whose beautiful fragrance is the signature of many Thai dishes ó at Asian markets.  If unavailable, don't use dried ones; substitute grated lime peel instead.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Goes Great With:  Long-grain rice cooked with a few cardamom pods and grated lemon peel and sautÈed spinach.
</DirT>
<DirT>
What To Drink:  Sp‰tlese Riesling or Oregon Pinot Noir.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Test-Kitchen Tip:  Curry pastes vary in strength and spiciness from brand to brand, so start by using one teaspoon if you prefer a milder sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The delicious sauce has the complex, aromatic flavors of a Thai curry, but is very easy to prepare, thanks to purchased curry paste (now sold in many supermarkets).  Look for fresh or frozen kaffir lime leaves ó whose beautiful fragrance is the signature of many Thai dishes ó at Asian markets.  If unavailable, don&apos;t use dried ones; substitute grated lime peel instead.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GINGERSNAP CRUST ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
  1 1/2           cups  ground gingersnap cookies - (abt 7 1/4 oz)
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
                        === CHEESECAKE ===
  4           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  1                cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick) -- melted
  5              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === CARAMEL TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1                cup  heavy whipping cream
                        === GARNISH ===
  4                     English toffee candy bars - (1.4 oz ea) -- chopped
                        = (such as Heath or Skor bars)

For gingersnap crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray bottom of 9-inch springform pan with 2 1/2-inch-high sides with nonstick spray.  Stir ground cookies, butter, and sugar in medium bowl until moist clumps form.  Press cookie mixture firmly onto bottom of prepared pan.  Wrap outside of pan with 3 layers of heavy-duty foil.  Bake crust until firm and beginning to darken, about 14 minutes.  Cool crust.  Maintain oven temperature.

For cheesecake:  Beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl until smooth.  Beat in butter, then eggs, 1 at a time, until just blended.  Beat in vanilla.  Pour batter over crust in pan.  Place springform pan in large roasting pan.  Add enough hot water to come halfway up sides of springform pan.  Bake cake uncovered until filling is puffed around edges and moves slightly in center when pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour 10 minutes.  Remove pan from water; remove foil.  Place hot cheesecake uncovered in refrigerator overnight.

For caramel topping:  Stir sugar, water, and lemon juice in large saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil without stirring until mixture turns deep amber, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush, about 9 minutes.  Add cream (mixture will bubble).  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer until reduced to 1 1/4 cups, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Chill until thickened but still pourable, about 15 minutes.

Spoon caramel over top of cake just to edges (do not allow caramel to drip down sides).  Garnish top edges with chopped English toffee.  Chill at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours.

Run knife around pan sides to loosen cake; release pan sides.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  "Each year we receive hundreds of reader requests for recipes from restaurants around the world.  And this past year there was a clear favorite ó cheesecake.  One of the best we tested is from Zoom in Park City, Utah.  Here's their delicious version. ó The Editors

At the restaurant, this is served with roasted pears.  The cake needs time to set up in the refrigerator overnight, so begin making it at least one day ahead.

  4               cups  whipping cream -- divided
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  15             whole  black peppercorns
  5              large  garlic cloves -- crushed, divided
  5             pounds  long slender russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/8"-thick slices
  3                     fresh black truffles -- sliced paper-thin
                        = (or three 1/3-oz jars whole black
                        truffles)

Combine 2 cups cream, chopped thyme, black peppercorns, and 3 garlic cloves in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to simmer over medium heat.  Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 15 minutes.  Add remaining 2 garlic cloves.  Cover; simmer 5 minutes.  Strain cream into bowl.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Arrange 1/4 of potatoes in even layer in dish.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Scatter 1/4 of truffle slices over.  Spoon 1/4 of cream over.  Repeat 3 more times, sprinkling any truffle liquid from jars over potato layers.  Pour 2 cups cream over.  Press potatoes firmly to compact.  Cover dish with foil.

Comments:  Fresh black truffles are worth the splurge.  They are available at some specialty foods stores and from Urbani Truffles (215-699-8780; urbanitruffles.com).  Black truffles in jars are sold at specialty foods stores and Italian markets; the most flavorful are European winter black truffles.

     1/4           cup  fresh thyme leaves
  1         tablespoon  coarse kosher salt

Bring reserved oil-lemon marinade to boil; boil 2 minutes.  Place 1 veal chop on each of 4 plates.  Divide shallot-tomato mixture among plates.  Spoon Soft Polenta alongside.  Drizzle with oil-lemon marinade.  Garnish with arugula and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Harold J. Bigley of New York, New York, writes: "A few months ago I went to a party in The Hamptons catered by Loaves & Fishes in Sagaponack.  The veal chops with polenta were outstanding.  Could you get the recipe?"

Ask your butcher to french (trim the fat from) the bone end of the veal rib chops.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  plain whole-milk yogurt
  1                cup  sugar
  3              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon peel - (packed)
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  lemon, orange, or grapefruit marmalade -- for glaze
  1           teaspoon  water

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Generously butter 8 1/2- by 4 1/2- by 2 1/2-inch metal loaf pan.

Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into medium bowl.  Combine yogurt, sugar, eggs, lemon peel, and vanilla in large bowl; whisk until well blended.  Gradually whisk in dry ingredients.  Using rubber spatula, fold in oil.  Transfer batter to prepared pan.  Place pan on baking sheet.

Place cake on baking sheet in oven and bake until cake begins to pull away from sides of pan and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.  Cool cake in pan on rack 5 minutes.  Cut around pan sides to loosen cake.  Turn cake out onto rack.  Turn cake upright on rack and cool completely.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Wrap and store at room temperature.)

Stir marmalade and 1 teaspoon water in small saucepan over medium heat until marmalade melts.  Brush hot mixture over top of cake.  Let glaze cool and set.  Cut cake crosswise into slices.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Like so many homemade French desserts, this pound cake, tenderized with yogurt instead of butter, is utterly simple and versatile: Enjoy a slice for breakfast with a steaming cup of coffee, or serve it after dinner with fruit coulis or whipped cream.
