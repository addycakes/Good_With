Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GARLIC MASHED POTATOES ===
  2             pounds  red potatoes
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  cream
  3        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  garlic cloves
                        === SAUTEED ONIONS AND MUSHROOMS ===
     1/2         pound  yellow onions -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut 1/4" julienne strips
     1/2         pound  sliced mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Granulated garlic -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Black pepper -- to taste
                        === SIRLOIN STEAK SHILLET ===
  2 3/4         pounds  sirloin steak -- cut 8 pieces,
                        = (approximately 5 1/2 oz ea)
  8             slices  mozzarella cheese

For the Garlic Mashed Potatoes:  Place a single layer of garlic cloves on a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil and wrap tightly.  Roast in 400 degree preheated oven for approximately 45 minutes or until soft.  Unwrap and let cool until touchable.  Peel cloves and mash with potatoes when they are ready.

Wash and rinse potatoes under cold water.  It is not necessary to peel potatoes, unless you desire.

In large sauce pan (or pot), bring red potatoes to a slow boil for approximately 20 minutes.  The exact time depends on the size of the potatoes used.  For faster cooking, cut into smaller pieces.  Internal temperature should be 205 degrees.  Remove from heat and drain in colander.

In pan or bowl, combine potatoes, peeled and roasted garlic cloves, and all other ingredients and mash with a potato masher.

Return mashed potatoes to low heat, if necessary, to bring them to a serving temperature of 165 degrees.

For the Sauteed Onions And Mushrooms:  Melt butter in skillet over medium heat and add onions and seasonings.  SautÈ and stir until lightly caramelized.

Add sliced mushrooms and stir, as needed to avoid burning, until hot.

For the Sirloin Streak Skillet:  Grill steaks to desired degree of doneness.  Melt two slices of mozzarella cheese over two shingled steaks for each plate.  Top with SautÈd Onions And Mushrooms, and serve with Garlic Mashed Potatoes on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2 1/2         pounds  beef chuck -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped yellow onions
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh garlic
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  Burgundy wine
  2          teaspoons  chicken base
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     cheesecloth
  1           teaspoon  thyme leaves
  3 1/4           cups  water
  2               cups  potatoes in 1/2" cubes
  1 1/4           cups  carrots in battonnet strips
  1                cup  frozen green peas
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley -- minced
  1                cup  pearl onions
  1                     fresh parsley stem

Preheat oven to 240 degrees.

Heat 1/2 of oil in large oven-proof Dutch oven on stove at medium-high heat.  Dredge beef cubes with salt and peeper.  Add meat in Dutch oven and brown on all sides.  Meat should cook until it begins to turn dark brown.  DO NOT allow meat to burn.  Remove meat and reserve.

Heat remainder of oil in Dutch oven.  Add onions and sautÈ until they begin to brown.  Add garlic and continue to cook for 30 seconds.  DO NOT cook garlic for more than 30 seconds, as it will burn.  Stir in flour and cook until lightly colored (3 to 4 minutes).

Wrap bay leaves and thyme in cheesecloth and tie off end.

Add wine, scraping up any residue stuck to bottom of Dutch oven.  Mix chicken base with hot water (1 teaspoon base to each cup of water).  Add chicken stock, bay leaves, and thyme and bring to a simmer.

Add meat and return to a simmer.  Cover and place in oven at 240 degrees for one hour.  Add remaining water and allow to simmer for another 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch cubes.  Peel carrots and cut into 1- by 1/4-inch strips.  Twenty minutes before stew is finished, steam potatoes and carrots for 10 minutes.  Stir cooked vegetables into stew.  Add peas and pearl onions, cover and allow to stand for 5 minutes.

Stir in parsley and remove bay leaves.  Garnish with fresh parsley.  Annie Grogan's Irish Soda Bread (see recipe) goes well with this dish.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HERBED RANCH SALSA ===
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/4           cup  diced seeded tomato - (abt 1/2 tomato)
  2        tablespoons  minced onion
  1         tablespoon  white vinegar
  1           teaspoon  fresh minced cilantro
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground black pepper
  1              pinch  dried dill
                        === POTATOCAKES ===
  4             medium  red potatoes - (abt 1 lb) -- with skins
     1/4           cup  shredded cheddar cheese
     1/4           cup  shredded monterey jack cheese
  2        tablespoons  shredded parmesan cheese
  1                     green onion -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  minced fresh cilantro
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
                        === BREADING ===
     2/3           cup  unseasoned breadcrumbs (Progresso is good)
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  dried dill
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1                cup  milk
  2               cups  shortening - (to 3) -- for frying

Boil potatoes for 25 to 30 minutes or until mostly soft, but still slightly firm.  Be careful not to overcook these boys.  Your potatocakes will hold together best when the potatoes aren't totally mushy.

As the potatoes boil make your herbed ranch salsa by combining all of the ingredients in a small bowl.  Cover and chill this sauce until you need it.

Drain the potatoes and mash them with the skin on in a medium bowl.  You don't need a completely smooth consistency for the potatoes.  There should be some small chunks of potato in there.  Add the remaining ingredients for the potatocakes and mix well.

Combine breadcrumbs with flour and 1/2 teaspoon dill in a large bowl.  Combine beaten egg and milk in another large bowl.  Measure about 1/3 cup of the potato mixture into your hands and shape it into a patty about the size of a hamburger patty.  Drop the potato mixture into the breading mixture, then into the egg and milk, then back into the breading, being sure to cover the entire surface of the potatocake with the breading.

Arrange the potatocake on a plate and repeat the process with the remaining potato mixture.  Cover and chill the potatocakes for about 1 hour, so that they'll be sure to stick together when fried.

Heat up the shortening in a skillet over medium/low heat.  You should have about 1 inch of shortening in the pan.  Fry the potatocakes in the oil for 2 to 4 minutes or until golden brown, then drain on a rack or paper towels.

Serve potatocakes with a bit of herbed ranch salsa poured over the top.

This recipe yields 6 potato cakes.

Comments:  The menu from this popular west coast eatery claims this is the best-selling appetizer on board.  That's pretty good for such a huge menu that includes dozens of amazing appetizer selections.  Make these clones with three different cheeses, lightly bread 'em, and serve 'em up with herb ranch salsa as a pre-meal appetizer or as a great side dish to just about any entree.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ROASTED GARLIC MAYONNAISE ===
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
  1               head  garlic
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  lemon juice
  1               dash  salt
                        === TOMATO RELISH ===
  1             medium  tomato -- diced (abt 1/2 cup)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced (abt 1 tspn)
  1           teaspoon  minced onion
  2                     basil leaves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === ARTICHOKE ===
  1              large  artichoke
  1         tablespoon  butter -- melted

Roast the head of garlic by preheating your oven to 325 degrees.  Cut the top off of a head of garlic and cut the bottom (the root end) so that the garlic will sit flat.  Remove most of the papery skin from the garlic, but leave just enough to hold the garlic together.  Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the garlic, then place it in a small oven-safe casserole dish.  Cover it with a lid or aluminum foil and bake for 1 hour or until the garlic begins to brown.

While the garlic is roasting prepare the tomato relish by combining all of the ingredients in a small bowl.  Stir well, then cover and refrigerate until needed.

Prepare the artichoke by cutting about an inch off the top with a sharp knife.  Use scissors to clip the thorny tips off of all the outer leaves so no one gets poked.  Cut the artichoke in half down through the middle, then bring some water to a boil in a large saucepan to steam the artichokes.

The water should be a couple inches deep in the pan, but not so much as to cover the artichokes.  If you have a steamer, that will work as well.  When the water is simmering, add the artichokes, cover, and steam for 40 to 45 minutes or until the artichoke is tender.  Preheat your barbecue grill to high heat.

Squeeze about 1 tablespoon of roasted garlic from the head and combine it with the mayo, lemon juice and salt.  Stir well.

When the steamed artichokes are cool enough to handle, use a spoon to scrape out the fuzzy choke inside each half.  Brush melted butter over the entire surface of each steamed artichoke half and place each half, flat-side down on the preheated grill.  Grill for 4 to 6 minutes or until dark charring marks appear on the face of each half.

Serve grilled-side up with Tomato Relish (strain the liquid from the relish before serving) and Roasted Garlic Mayonnaise on the side.

This recipe yields 2 servings as an appetizer.

Comments:  For quite some time now I've been searching for the chain restaurant with the best recipe for roasted artichokes, and I think I've finally found it.  The Cheesecake Factory came close there, but with roasted garlic mayonnaise and delicious tomato relish that comes alongside this dish, Claim Jumper takes the prize.  This recipe is for just one artichoke, but feel free to add another if more than a couple hungry mouths await.  Just be sure to double up on the tomato relish.

Roast the head of garlic by preheating your oven to 325 degrees.  Cut the top off of a head of garlic and cut the bottom (the root end) so that the garlic will sit flat.  Remove most of the papery skin from the garlic, but leave just enough to hold the garlic together.  Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the garlic, then place it in a small oven-safe casserole dish.  Cover it with a lid or aluminum foil and bake for 1 hour or until the garlic begins to brown.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the garlic is roasting prepare the tomato relish by combining all of the ingredients in a small bowl.  Stir well, then cover and refrigerate until needed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare the artichoke by cutting about an inch off the top with a sharp knife.  Use scissors to clip the thorny tips off of all the outer leaves so no one gets poked.  Cut the artichoke in half down through the middle, then bring some water to a boil in a large saucepan to steam the artichokes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The water should be a couple inches deep in the pan, but not so much as to cover the artichokes.  If you have a steamer, that will work as well.  When the water is simmering, add the artichokes, cover, and steam for 40 to 45 minutes or until the artichoke is tender.  Preheat your barbecue grill to high heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Squeeze about 1 tablespoon of roasted garlic from the head and combine it with the mayo, lemon juice and salt.  Stir well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the steamed artichokes are cool enough to handle, use a spoon to scrape out the fuzzy choke inside each half.  Brush melted butter over the entire surface of each steamed artichoke half and place each half, flat-side down on the preheated grill.  Grill for 4 to 6 minutes or until dark charring marks appear on the face of each half.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve grilled-side up with Tomato Relish (strain the liquid from the relish before serving) and Roasted Garlic Mayonnaise on the side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 servings as an appetizer.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatloaf


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1                     green onion -- minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  minced green bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  grated carrot
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1                cup  milk
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
  1 1/2         pounds  ground chuck
     3/4         pound  ground pork
  1                cup  bread crumbs (such as Progresso)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  ketchup -- plus an additional
     1/4           cup  ketchup -- for top

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

SautÈ green onion, garlic, green pepper, and carrot in vegetable oil over medium heat for a couple minutes.

Combine beaten eggs with milk, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder in a medium bowl.

Mix bread crumbs and flour into ground chuck and ground pork with your hands.  Add egg and milk mixture, sautÈed veggies, 1/4 cup ketchup and mix it up using your hands.  Get in there and squish it all around for a while.  Enjoy yourself.

Press the mixture into a meat loaf pan (the kind of pan with drainage holes in the bottom) or a large loaf pan.  Bake for 30 minutes, then spread 1/4 cup of ketchup over the top of the meatloaf and bake it for another hour.  Let it sit for a bit after you remove it from the oven before you slice it to serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Here's a great meatloaf recipe to add to your impressive mealtime repertoire.  This luscious loaf combines ground chuck with ground pork along with bread crumbs, green onion, garlic, carrots and green pepper for one of the best flavor experiences you'll get from a good old American loaf of meat.  Use one of those perforated nesting meatloaf pans if you've got it so that the fat drains out into the pan below.  If you don't have one a regular loaf pan will still work fine.  But use a large one.  This recipe makes big, beefy portion.

                           Honeybaked Ham Glaze

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham                             Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fully-cooked shank half ham -- bone-in
                        = (pre-sliced is best)
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground clove
     1/8      teaspoon  paprika
  1               dash  ground ginger
  1               dash  ground allspice

First you must slice your ham.  Use a very sharp knife to cut the ham into very thin slices around the bone.  Do not cut all the way down to the bone or the meat may not hold together properly as it is being glazed.  You want the slices to be quite thin, but not so thin that they begin to fall apart or off the bone.  You may wish to turn the ham onto its flat end and cut around it starting at the bottom.  You can then spin the ham as you slice around and work your way up.

Mix the remaining ingredients together in a small bowl.

Lay down a couple sheets of wax paper onto a flat surface, such as your kitchen counter.  Pour the sugar mixture onto the wax paper and spread it around evenly.

Pick up the ham and roll it over the sugar mixture so that it is well coated.  Do not coat the flat end of the ham, just the outer surface which you have sliced through.

Turn the ham onto its flat end on a plate.  Use a blow torch with a medium-size flame to caramelize the sugar.  Wave the torch over the sugar with rapid movement, so that the sugar bubbles and browns, but does not burn.  Spin the plate so that you can torch the entire surface of the ham.  Repeat the coating and caramelizing process until the ham has been well-glazed (don't expect to use all of the sugar mixture).  Serve the ham cold or re-heated, just like the real thing.

This recipe yields 1 holiday ham.

Comments:  TSR has discovered that the tender hams are delivered to each of the 300 HoneyBaked outlets already smoked, but without the glaze.  It is only when the ham gets to your local HoneyBaked store that a special machine thin-slices the tender meat in a spiral fashion around the bone.  One at a time, each ham is then coated with granulated sugar that has been mixed with spices -- a blend that is similar to what might be used to make pumpkin pie.  This sweet coating is then caramelized with a blowtorch by hand until the glaze bubbles and melts, turning golden brown.  If needed, more of the sugar-coating is added, and the blowtorch is fired up until the glaze is just right.  It is this careful process that turns the same size ham that costs 10 dollars in a supermarket into one that customers gladly shell out 3 to 4 times as much to share during this holiday season.  For this clone recipe, we will re-create the glaze that you can apply to a smoked/cooked bone-in ham of your choice.  Look for a ham that's pre-sliced.  Otherwise you'll have to slice it yourself with a sharp knife, then the glaze will be applied.  To get the coating just right you must use a blowtorch.  If you don't have one, you can find a small one in hardware stores for around 15 bucks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  ground dried New Mexico or
                        California chilies
  3        tablespoons  salad oil
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  2                     whole cloves
  1                     dried bay leaf -- broken into pieces
  1              pound  boned skinned firm-flesh fish such as
                        halibut, mahi mahi, or rock fish
  6                     flour tortillas
                        Shredded cabbage
                        Fresh lime juice
                        === CILANTRO JALAPENO MAYONNAISE ===
  1 3/4           cups  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  distilled white vinegar
  1                     fresh jalapeÒo chili -- rinsed, stemmed,
                        with seeds removed
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled
     1/2           cup  fresh cilantro - (lightly packed)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === PICO DE GALLO ===
  2               cups  diced tomatoes
     1/2           cup  finely-diced onion
  2        tablespoons  minced jalapeÒo chilies
     1/4           cup  minced fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
                        Salt -- to taste

In a large bowl, mix ground dried chilies, oil, pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt, garlic powder, cayenne, cumin, cloves and bay leaf.  Rinse fish and pat dry.  Add to bowl and turn to coat with marinade; cover and chill at least 1 hour or up to 1 day, mixing several times.

Lift fish from marinade and arrange pieces in a single layer in a 9- by 13-inch pan.  Discard marinade.  Broil fish 4 to 5 inches from heat until opaque but still moist-looking in center of thick part of fish (cut to test), about 5 minutes for 1/2-inch-thick pieces.  With a slotted spatula, transfer fish to towels to blot oil, then set on a platter.  Cut fish along the grain into 1/2-inch slices, season to taste with salt.

Serve wrapped in flour tortilla with shredded cabbage, Lone Star Pico de Gallo and Lone Star Cilantro-Jalapeno Mayonnaise and a squeeze of lime juice.

For Cilantro JalapeÒo Mayonnaise:  Combine all ingredients except salt; mix until smooth.  Add salt to taste.

For Pico De Gallo:  In a bowl combine all except salt.  Add salt to taste.

This recipe yields 6 tacos.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  Panera sourdough bread in 1/2" cubes
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
     1/2           cup  chopped celery -- stalks and leaves
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
     3/4     teaspoons  dried sage
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  melted butter - (to 1/2)
     1/2           cup  your favorite additions
                        = (such as chopped pecans, chopped water
                        chestnuts, toasted sliced almonds,
                        currants, wild rice, gently sautÈd
                        chopped oysters)

To make the bread cubes, start with 1/2 loaf of leftover bread.  Remove the crusts and cut the bread into 1/2-inch cubes until you have about 3 cups.  Spread cubes out on a cutting board and allow them to dry, if possible overnight.

The next day, place the bread cubes in a large bowl.  Add onion, celery, thyme, sage, pepper and your favorite secret ingredient.  Toss until they are well mixed.  Add the melted butter, using the larger amount if you like your stuffing very moist, and toss gently.

Stuff your 3 to 4 pound chicken or turkey and roast as directed.  To prepare stuffing on its own, place it in a shallow baking dish, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.  If the stuffing dries out, you may wish to add a little chicken broth as it cooks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Panera Asiago cheese bagels -- halved
                        Butter -- as needed
  8                     eggs -- poached
  8             slices  ham or Canadian bacon
     1/2           cup  hollandaise sauce -- (see below)
                        Sliced tomatoes or red pepper -- (optional)
                        === QUICK HOLLANDAISE SAUCE ===
  2                     egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  boiling water
  1                cup  butter - (2 sticks) -- melted, hot
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  minced herbs -- (optional)
                        = (such as parsley, thyme or tarragon)

Toast the bagel halves and spread with butter, if desired.  Warm the ham or bacon in a skillet, and arrange two slices on top of each bagel half to cover.  Layer the tomatoes or red pepper on top of the ham, if you're using these ingredients.  Next, gently place two poached eggs on top of the ham or vegetables.  Drizzle about one tablespoon of Hollandaise Sauce over each egg and serve immediately while everything is hot.  Serve the remaining hollandaise sauce in a bowl as an accompaniment.

To poach an egg:  Fill a saucepan or a deep skillet with enough water so that the eggs can float.  The larger the pan, the more eggs can be cooked at one time.  The eggs should float in the water without touching each other as they cook.  Add 1 tablespoon of vinegar for every quart of water used.  This helps to set the eggs.  Heat the water to a simmer (185 degrees).  Tiny bubbles will appear in the water.  Break each egg into a saucer.  If the yolk is not broken, gently slide the whole egg into the water and poach for 3 to 5 minutes.  The whites will be set but the yolk will still be runny.  Remove the egg from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on a towel.

For the Quick Hollandaise Sauce:  Place egg yolks in the blender.  Blend at low speed until thoroughly mixed.  While the motor is running, slowly add the boiling water, followed by the hot butter.  The butter should be added very slowly in the thinnest stream possible.  When the butter is completely incorporated, add the lemon juice, salt and herbs if you're using them.  If the sauce is too thick, add a few drop of boiling water.  The sauce will hold as you poach the eggs and prepare the other ingredients.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Toast the bagel halves and spread with butter, if desired.  Warm the ham or bacon in a skillet, and arrange two slices on top of each bagel half to cover.  Layer the tomatoes or red pepper on top of the ham, if you&apos;re using these ingredients.  Next, gently place two poached eggs on top of the ham or vegetables.  Drizzle about one tablespoon of Hollandaise Sauce over each egg and serve immediately while everything is hot.  Serve the remaining hollandaise sauce in a bowl as an accompaniment.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To poach an egg:  Fill a saucepan or a deep skillet with enough water so that the eggs can float.  The larger the pan, the more eggs can be cooked at one time.  The eggs should float in the water without touching each other as they cook.  Add 1 tablespoon of vinegar for every quart of water used.  This helps to set the eggs.  Heat the water to a simmer (185 degrees).  Tiny bubbles will appear in the water.  Break each egg into a saucer.  If the yolk is not broken, gently slide the whole egg into the water and poach for 3 to 5 minutes.  The whites will be set but the yolk will still be runny.  Remove the egg from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on a towel.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Quick Hollandaise Sauce:  Place egg yolks in the blender.  Blend at low speed until thoroughly mixed.  While the motor is running, slowly add the boiling water, followed by the hot butter.  The butter should be added very slowly in the thinnest stream possible.  When the butter is completely incorporated, add the lemon juice, salt and herbs if you&apos;re using them.  If the sauce is too thick, add a few drop of boiling water.  The sauce will hold as you poach the eggs and prepare the other ingredients.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  Asiago cheese bread
  3                     ripe tomatoes
     1/3           cup  fresh basil leaves
  2              large  garlic cloves -- halved crosswise
  4        tablespoons  olive oil - (to 6)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Slice the tomatoes thinly.  Cut or tear the basil leaves into thin strips.  Using your oven broiler or barbecue, grill the bread slices about 5 inches from the heat source, turning them once until they are light brown on both sides.

Rub the cut garlic halves over one side of the bread; the toasted surface will grate the garlic into the bread.  Brush the slices with olive oil and top with tomato slices and basil leaves.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 8 slices.

Slice the tomatoes thinly.  Cut or tear the basil leaves into thin strips.  Using your oven broiler or barbecue, grill the bread slices about 5 inches from the heat source, turning them once until they are light brown on both sides.

Rub the cut garlic halves over one side of the bread; the toasted surface will grate the garlic into the bread.  Brush the slices with olive oil and top with tomato slices and basil leaves.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

       Panera / Saint Louis Bread Co's Grilled Gruyere On Asiago Br

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  Asiago Cheese Bread from Panera Bread -- sliced 1" thick
  1              ounce  dry white wine
                        Dijon-style mustard
  4             ounces  Gruyere cheese -- sliced
  2                     Roma tomatoes -- thinly sliced
     1/2         small  onion -- thinly sliced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Toast the sliced Asiago Cheese Bread in a toaster, on the grill, or under the broiler.

For each sandwich, moisten the bottom piece of toasted bread with wine using a pastry brush or your fingertips.  Next, spread mustard on bottom piece of bread, then add one fourth of the cheese, tomato, and onion.  Grind a generous amount of pepper over the sandwich and top with another slice of toasted bread.

Return the sandwich to the grill or broiler until the cheese is melted.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 sandwiches.

Comments:  Swiss Gruyere is a cow's milk cheese named for the valley of the same name in the canton of Fribourg.  We've created the perfect gourmet grilled cheese sandwich by pairing the sweet, nutty flavor of Gruyere with the robust tang of our Asiago Cheese Bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRILLED STEAK ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1 1/2         pounds  one-inch-thick beef tenderloin -- (abt 6 steaks)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GIANT CROUTON ===
  1                     sourdough baguette
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Blue cheese sprinkles -- (optional)
                        === SALAD ===
  1                     bag baby spinach leaves - (10 oz)
  1               head  red leaf lettuce
  1                can  mandarin oranges - (16 oz)
  1                cup  crumbled blue cheese - (abt 4 oz)
     3/4           cup  sliced almonds - (abt 3 oz)
     1/2        medium  red onion -- sliced thin rings
                        Panera Bread Poppyseed Salad Dressing -- as needed

Grilled Steak:  Rub both sides of each steak lightly with vegetable oil, and then season with salt and pepper.  Grill steaks on one side, turn and finish grilling to desired doneness.  (About 5 minutes on each side for medium rare.)  Transfer steaks to platter to stand until cool, about 15 minutes.  Cover and refrigerate until well chilled.  Just before serving, slice each steak diagonally into thin pieces.

If you prefer, coat the bottom of a large, heavy skillet with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and place over medium-high heat.  When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the steaks and cook on both sides to desired doneness.  (About 5 minutes on each side for medium rare.)  Prepare the steaks for serving as above.

Giant Crouton:  Cut bread into slices 3/4- to 1-inch thick.  Place the slices in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake slowly in a 300 degree oven until they are lightly browned and crisp (approximately 25 to 30 minutes).  For extra flavor, lightly brush each slice with olive oil after they have baked for 15 minutes.  If you wish, sprinkle blue cheese crumbles over the slices for the last minute or so of baking, just until the cheese softens.

Salad:  Mix all the salad ingredients in a large salad bowl.  Add dressing and toss to coat.  Divide salad equally and arrange on six plates.  Top with slices of grilled beef.  Add a giant crouton to the side of each plate and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Jazz up summer dining with this entrÈe salad featuring succulent grilled tenderloins of beef, crisp greens, oranges and nuts, and our own Poppyseed Salad Dressing.  Crunchy Sourdough croutons are a harmonious complement.

Stir the mustard and horseradish into the mayonnaise until will-blended.  Taste and add more mustard or horseradish, if you prefer.  Set aside for 20 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.

To use:  Cut a sourdough baguette in half horizontally.  Place it cut-side up on a baking sheet and broil, watching carefully, for 1 to 2 minutes, until it is toasted to your specifications.  Spread the horseradish/mustard sauce on both sides of the toasted bread, then add lettuce, sliced onions and tomatoes.  Pile on thin slices of roast beef, reassemble the baguette, and cut into sandwich servings.  One baguette should make 3 to 4 sandwiches, depending on your appetite.

This recipe yields 1 3/4 cups of sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     Rosemary and Onion Focaccia -- split horizontally
     1/2           cup  Panera Bread Dipping Sauce for Bread
  1              pound  hard Italian salami -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  fresh baby spinach leaves
  1                     red onion -- thinly sliced
     3/4         pound  Provolone cheese -- thinly sliced

Spread dipping sauce on the top and bottom of the focaccia.  Arrange half of the cheese slices on the bottom piece of the focaccia.  Add a layer of the spinach, salami, red onion and the other half of the cheese.  Place the top of the focaccia on the sandwich and cut the sandwich in quarters.

Spray a large, heavy skillet with nonstick cooking spray and heat over medium heat.  Add the sandwiches to the pan.  Press down frequently and firmly with the back of a spatula, until the bread is toasted, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Carefully turn the sandwiches over and heat the other sides, again pressing firmly with the spatula for an additional 3 to 4 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 sandwiches.

  5        tablespoons  olive oil

  2        tablespoons  thin-sliced basil leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
  2               cups  crushed tomatoes in thick puree
  1 1/4         pounds  vine-ripened tomatoes - (abt 4) -- diced
  2               cups  low-sodium chicken broth

                        Fiesta Bread -- cut into 1" cubes
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a large saucepan, heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil over moderately-low heat.  Add onion, bell pepper, garlic, chopped basil, and oregano.  Stirring occasionally, cook approximately 10 minutes or until the onion is golden.  Add crushed tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, 1 cup of broth, salt and sugar; bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat to low.  Simmer, uncovered, until thick, for approximately 30 minutes.

Place bread cubes on a baking sheet and toast in 350 degree oven for 25 minutes, or until crisp.  Remove bread from the oven and add to sauce.  Gently stir for 5 minutes.  As the bread absorbs the tomatoes, add pepper and some of the stock as needed to keep the mixture soupy.  Use a spoon to mash the bread so the soup is thick and the bread blends into the tomato sauce.  Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.

To serve, ladle into individual bowls, lightly drizzle with remaining olive oil, and sprinkle with sliced basil.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                        = (4 to 6 slices, crumbled)
  10                    eggs -- gently beaten
  1                cup  asparagus tips
  1                cup  steamed broccoli florets
  1                cup  chopped tomatoes
  2          teaspoons  Italian seasoning
  1                cup  grated cheddar cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a skillet, melt half of the butter.  Add the garlic and vegetables and cook for two minutes.  Add bread crumbs and cook for an additional two minutes.  Set aside.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a separate oven-safe non-stick skillet or baking pan, melt the remaining butter over medium heat. Add the eggs and let cook for 2 minutes.  When the eggs form a base in the pan, add the vegetable/bread crumb mixture, seasoning and cheese.  Stir gently without disturbing the bottom of the pan.

Transfer pan to preheated oven and bake for ten minutes.  Remove from oven and invert frittata onto serving plate.  Cut in wedges or squares.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  A frittata (frih-TAH-tuh) is an Italian oven-baked omelet made by mixing the ingredients into the eggs rather than folding them inside.  Serve for breakfast or brunch with fresh fruit and our spinach parmesan bagels with salsa light cream cheese.  Enjoy!

Categories    : Cheesecake                      Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  1 3/4           cups  sugar -- divided
     1/2         pound  graham cracker crumbs
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted, and
                        cooled 5 minutes
  2 1/2         pounds  cream cheese - (five 8-oz pkgs) -- room temperature,
                        cut into chunks
  1 1/3           cups  grated white cheddar cheese
     1/3           cup  sour cream
  2                     jumbo eggs - (or 3 small eggs)
  1                     egg yolk
  1                cup  stout reduced to 2 1/2 tbspns and
                        cooled slightly -- see * Note
                        Raspberry sauce -- for garnish

* Note:  Stout is a very dark beer.  To reduce, cook over medium-high heat until beer evaporates to the 2 1/2 tablespoons needed.

To make crust, combine 2/3 cup of the sugar and cracker crumbs in mixing bowl.  Add butter and mix to combine.  Press into 10-inch springform pan.  Refrigerate 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 225 degrees.

To make filling, using heavy-duty mixer with paddle attachment, food processor with large mixing bowl, or large bowl and hand mixer, beat cream cheese until smooth.  Add cheddar cheese, remaining 1 3/4 cups sugar and sour cream and beat on low speed 5 minutes.  Reduce speed to low and add lightly whipped whole eggs and egg yolk, blending for 1 minute.  Batter will be thin.

Pour into chilled graham cracker crust.  Drizzle 2 1/2 tablespoons of stout reduction in spiral pattern onto cheesecake.  Using toothpick, swirl spiral in circular motion.  Place cheesecake on sheet pan and place in preheated oven.  Pour 1/2- to 3/4-inch water into sheet pan to create water bath.  Bake 4 to 4 1/2 hours or until done, adding additional water to pan when needed.

Cheesecake is done when knife inserted in center shows consistency of very stiff yogurt.  Center should be firm to touch, but should not be rock solid, and cracks should not appear on top.  Remove from oven and place on rack to cool.  Serve slices drizzled with raspberry sauce.

This recipe yields 16 to 20 servings.

  1              pinch  dried oregano
     2/3           cup  canola oil
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh basil

Portobellini Mushroom Caps:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Melt butter over medium heat in medium saucepan.  Add garlic and saute about 45 seconds; do not brown garlic.  Add sherry, pepper and salt, stirring well.  Remove from heat.  Gently dip mushroom caps, one at a time, to completely coat with butter mixture.

Place mushrooms on sheet pan, cap side up.  Bake in preheated oven 4 minutes.  Remove from oven; carefully drain and let cool.  When cool, place mushrooms in large shallow baking dish with tops down so mushrooms are ready to fill.  (Makes 36 mushrooms)

Spinach And Chicken Filling:  Melt butter over medium-high heat in large saucepan.  Add onions and saute until tender.  Add garlic and saute 1 minute.  Stir in water, cream and salt; bring to boil.  Simmer 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Add all cheeses, stirring frequently to melt.  Blend until smooth.  Add spinach and stir well.  Add remaining ingredients, in order given, blending well.  Remove from heat, cool slightly and refrigerate.  Note: To toast pine nuts, sprinkle nuts in ungreased heavy skillet.  Cook over medium heat 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently until nuts begin to brown, then stirring constantly until golden brown.  (Makes about 9 cups)

Salsa Cruda:  In large bowl, combine all ingredients.  Mix well.  Place in storage container and refrigerate until needed.  (Makes about 9 cups)

Balsamic oil vinaigrette:  Place all ingredients except oils and basil in blender or food processor.  With machine running, slowly drizzle oil into mixture.  When all oil has been incorporated, turn off machine.  Add basil and blend on low speed just until combined.  Transfer to storage bowl and refrigerate until needed.  (Do not over mix.  Dressing should be consistency of honey.  As it is whipped, it will first become shiny and will thicken.  When thickened and shiny, dressing is done.  If beaten too long, dressing will become too thick.)

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Fill each mushroom with about 1/4 cup spinach and chicken stuffing.  Sprinkle Parmesan cheese evenly over stuffed mushrooms.

Arrange stuffed mushrooms on large ungreased baking sheet with sides.  Spread salsa evenly around mushrooms.  (This may take more than one pan.)  Place in preheated oven; bake until mushrooms reach internal temperature of 165 degrees and cheese is browned, about 4 1/2 minutes.

Place salad greens and balsamic vinaigrette in mixing bowl; toss to coat.

For each serving, mound a bit of salad mix in center of plate.  Place some hot salsa on bottom half of plate.  Lay 3 hot mushrooms on top of salsa and salad mix, overlapping slightly.  Sprinkle evenly with chopped parsley.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 appetizer servings, 3 mushrooms each.

Portobellini Mushroom Caps:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Melt butter over medium heat in medium saucepan.  Add garlic and saute about 45 seconds; do not brown garlic.  Add sherry, pepper and salt, stirring well.  Remove from heat.  Gently dip mushroom caps, one at a time, to completely coat with butter mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place mushrooms on sheet pan, cap side up.  Bake in preheated oven 4 minutes.  Remove from oven; carefully drain and let cool.  When cool, place mushrooms in large shallow baking dish with tops down so mushrooms are ready to fill.  (Makes 36 mushrooms)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spinach And Chicken Filling:  Melt butter over medium-high heat in large saucepan.  Add onions and saute until tender.  Add garlic and saute 1 minute.  Stir in water, cream and salt; bring to boil.  Simmer 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Add all cheeses, stirring frequently to melt.  Blend until smooth.  Add spinach and stir well.  Add remaining ingredients, in order given, blending well.  Remove from heat, cool slightly and refrigerate.  Note: To toast pine nuts, sprinkle nuts in ungreased heavy skillet.  Cook over medium heat 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently until nuts begin to brown, then stirring constantly until golden brown.  (Makes about 9 cups)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Salsa Cruda:  In large bowl, combine all ingredients.  Mix well.  Place in storage container and refrigerate until needed.  (Makes about 9 cups)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Balsamic oil vinaigrette:  Place all ingredients except oils and basil in blender or food processor.  With machine running, slowly drizzle oil into mixture.  When all oil has been incorporated, turn off machine.  Add basil and blend on low speed just until combined.  Transfer to storage bowl and refrigerate until needed.  (Do not over mix.  Dressing should be consistency of honey.  As it is whipped, it will first become shiny and will thicken.  When thickened and shiny, dressing is done.  If beaten too long, dressing will become too thick.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Fill each mushroom with about 1/4 cup spinach and chicken stuffing.  Sprinkle Parmesan cheese evenly over stuffed mushrooms.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange stuffed mushrooms on large ungreased baking sheet with sides.  Spread salsa evenly around mushrooms.  (This may take more than one pan.)  Place in preheated oven; bake until mushrooms reach internal temperature of 165 degrees and cheese is browned, about 4 1/2 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  venison tenderloin
                        Kosher salt -- to coat venison
  1                cup  butter - (2 sticks) -- to saute vegetables
  4               cups  diced yellow onions
  4               cups  diced celery
  4               cups  diced carrots
  1 1/2         quarts  mixed mushrooms -- sauteed
  1              quart  lingonberries -- see * Note
  3             quarts  homemade beef stock
                        = (or beef base mixed with water, or beef
                        broth)
  8              large  bay leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  flour -- mixed with
  1                cup  water
  6               cups  cooked wild rice

* Note:  Lingonberries are available at specialty stores in jars or cans.  If only available packed in syrup, drain and rinse off syrup before using.  If available packed in natural juices, the juices can be added to the stew.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Generously rub venison with salt to create a salt cast.  Set in roasting pan and cook uncovered in preheated oven 45 minutes.  Remove from oven, cool slightly, then remove salt cast and discard salt.  Cut meat into bite-size pieces.

Melt butter in large stockpot.  Add onions and saute.  Add celery and carrots; cook until tender.  Add mushrooms and lingonberries.  Add reserved venison, stock and bay leaves.  Bring to boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, 1 hour.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Thicken stew slightly by gradually adding flour and water mixture.  The liquid should thicken to consistency of a medium gravy.  Serve over wild rice.

This recipe yields about 8 large servings.

Comments:  This recipe can be halved.  If you do not have access to venison, it can be special-ordered through Hank & Charlie's Market, 7828 W. Burleigh St., Milwaukee.  Their phone number is (414) 444-0105.  Venison also may be available through other meat markets by special order.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest
  3              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  lightly-toasted hazelnuts -- coarsely chopped
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolated chips -- melted

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a large bowl, beat together the butter, sugar and orange zest.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in vanilla.

In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt.  Add to the butter mixture and stir to blend thoroughly.  Stir in the nuts.  The dough will be soft.

On a lightly floured work surface, divide the dough into three equal pieces.  Lightly flour each piece and shape it into a log about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and 8 to 9 inches long.  Place the logs about 3 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet.  Press each log down to make it about 3/4-inch thick and 3 inches wide.

Bake until puffed and lightly browned on top, about 20 minutes.  Cool 10 minutes on the pan, then slide the logs onto a work surface.  Using a long, sharp knife, cut each log crosswise into 3/4-inch thick slices.  Make each cut with a single swipe of the blade.  Don't use a sawing motion, which will break the cookies.

Place the cookies, cut-side down, on the baking sheet.  (The cookies can be touching.)  Bake 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and, using tongs, turn each cookie over.  Bake until the biscotti are lightly browned, 10 to 14 minutes more.  Transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

Place about 1 teaspoon of melted chocolate on the tip of each biscotti and spread the chocolate from the tip to the center so the biscotti is nearly half-covered.  Place the biscotti on a wire rack and let set until the chocolate is hard, 2 to 3 hours.

This recipe yields about 3 1/2 dozen biscotti.

                     Starbucks' Frozen Frappuccino II

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COFFEE ===
     3/4           cup  double-strength coffee -- cold
  1                cup  low-fat milk
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  2               cups  ice
                        === CARAMEL ===
  3        tablespoons  caramel topping
                        Whipped cream -- for topping
                        Additional caramel topping -- for drizzling
                        === MOCHA ===
  3        tablespoons  Hershey's chocolate syrup
                        Whipped cream -- (optional)

Coffee:  Make double-strength coffee by brewing with twice the coffee required by your coffee maker.  That should be 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per each cup of coffee.  Chill before using.

To make the drink, combine all ingredients in a blender and blend on high speed until ice is crushed and drink is smooth.  Pour into two 16-ounce glasses, and serve with a straw.

Caramel:  For this version, add 3 tablespoons of caramel topping to the original recipe above and prepare as described.  Top each glass with whipped cream and drizzle additional caramel over the whipped cream.

Mocha:  For this version, add 3 tablespoons Hershey's chocolate syrup to the original recipe and prepare as described.  Top each glass with whipped cream if desired.

This recipe yields 2 "grande" drinks.

Comments:  It was in 1995 that Starbucks stores started selling this frozen drink, one of the company's most successful new products.  The Frappuccino is blended with strong coffee, sugar, a dairy base, and ice.  Each one is made to order and each one is guaranteed to give you a throbbing brain freeze if you sip too hard.  The drinks come in several different varieties, the most popular of which I've cloned here for your frontal lobe-pounding, caffeine-buzzing pleasure.  Make double-strength coffee by measuring 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per cup (serving) in your coffee maker.  The clone will be even more authentic if you use Starbucks beans and grind them yourself just before brewing.  Here now is an improved version of the recipe that was first posted here on this site, plus the new addition of a mocha version of one of world's coolest cold coffee drinks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === WHISKEY PEPPER SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2        tablespoons  chopped white onion
  2               cups  beef stock or canned beef broth
     1/4      teaspoon  cracked black pepper
  1                     garlic clove -- pressed
  2        tablespoons  whiskey
  1                     green onion -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  water
                        === PEPPER STEAK ===
  1                     sirloin steak - (16 oz) -- cut two portions
  2          teaspoons  cracked black pepper
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste

Fire up the barbecue.  In a saucepan or deep skillet, make the whiskey pepper sauce by sautÈing the white onions in the butter over high heat.  In about 3 minutes the onions will begin to turn brown.  Add 1 cup of the beef stock to the onions.  Add the cracked black pepper and garlic at this point as well.  Continue to simmer over medium-high heat until the sauce has reduced by about half.  Add the whiskey, green onion, and remaining 1 cup of beef stock to the sauce and let it simmer over low heat while you prepare the steaks.

Spread 1/2 teaspoon of cracked pepper over the entire surface of each side of the sirloin steaks and press it into the steaks so that it sticks.  Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Drop the steaks into the melted butter and sear each side of the steaks for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or until brown.  When the barbecue is good and hot, grill the steaks for 3 to 5 minutes per side or until they are done to your liking.  Salt the steaks lightly as they grill.

When the steaks are just about done, combine the cornstarch with the tablespoon of water in a small bowl.  Stir just until the cornstarch dissolves.  Remove the whiskey sauce from the heat and add the cornstarch to it.  Put the sauce back on the heat and continue to cook on low until the sauce is thickened to the consistency you desire.  Serve the steak doused with whiskey pepper sauce.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Recipe By     :Sylvia Woods
Serving Size  : 15    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  yellow cornmeal
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2 1/2           cups  milk
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  5              large  eggs

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking pan.

In a large bowl, sift or stir together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  Set aside.

In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat the milk, oil and eggs.  Add the cornmeal mixture and stir until just combined.  (Batter will be wet and a little lumpy.)  Pour into prepared pan and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the corn bread is pulling away at the edges.

Cool in the pan, then cut into 15 squares.

This recipe yields 15 servings.

Comments:  Like the cornbread served at the restaurant, this version is tall and cakey, thanks to the eggs.

     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  garlic powder
                        === PASTA ===
  1              pound  angel hair pasta
                        = (can cook and chill ahead of time)
  2        tablespoons  salt
     1/2        gallon  salted water
  2        tablespoons  salad oil
                        = (if pasta cooked ahead of time)
                        === TOMATO SALAD STEP 1 ===
  6             medium  Roma tomatoes - (to 8)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  10                    fresh basil leaves
                        === TOMATO SALAD STEP 2 ===
  2         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Remaining garlic butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced thin coins
                        === TOMATO SALAD STEP 3 ===
     1/2           cup  plain tomato sauce
                        Pasta -- (see above)
                        Balsamic Glaze -- (see below)
                        === BALSAMIC GLAZE ===
  1                cup  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sugar

For the Chicken Breasts:  Season both sides of chicken breasts with salt and black pepper Grill 3 to 4 minutes per side for grill marks or until the chicken breasts reach 165 degrees (recommended cooking on a seasoned grill).  Grill right before serving.

For the Garlic Bread:  Melt butter in microwave and stir to combine seasonings.  Drizzle your favorite bread with garlic butter and bake at 350 degrees until crispy and golden brown (approximately 4 minutes)

For the Pasta:  Boil pasta in salted water until al dente.  Drain and transfer to bowl.  If cooking ahead of time, shock in an ice bath to cool, remove from water and toss with salad oil.

For the Tomato Salad (Step 1):  Wash, core and dice tomatoes to 1/4-inch pieces, save juices and place in small bowl.  Wash, dry and cut basil leaves into thin strips.  Combine all ingredients and hold for 2 hours before use.

For the Tomato Salad (Step 2):  Heat heavy bottom sauce pan under medium-low flame.  Add olive oil, heat oil for 20 seconds.  Add any remaining garlic butter from bread to sauce pan.  Saute cloves of garlic, that are sliced into thin coins, in oil (if small use 3) for 45 seconds on each side until soft and tender -- do not brown garlic (if brown discard and start over).  Increase heat and add tomato salad and stir.

For the Tomato Salad (Step 3):  Add plain tomato sauce to pan and bring to a boil.  Add pasta to sauce pan and toss with fresh sauce (sauce should just coat pasta).  Transfer to a service platter or plate individually.  Garnish with Balsamic Glaze.

For the Balsamic Glaze:  Bring to a boil in small pan and turn down flame to a simmer.  Reduce by 75% until sauce turns to a thick syrup, hold at room temperature.

To serve:  Slice chicken breast into strips on a bias (45 degree angle) and place on top of pasta.  Slice 5 fresh basil leaves into thin strips and garnish pasta.  Enjoy!

This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the Chicken Breasts:  Season both sides of chicken breasts with salt and black pepper Grill 3 to 4 minutes per side for grill marks or until the chicken breasts reach 165 degrees (recommended cooking on a seasoned grill).  Grill right before serving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Garlic Bread:  Melt butter in microwave and stir to combine seasonings.  Drizzle your favorite bread with garlic butter and bake at 350 degrees until crispy and golden brown (approximately 4 minutes)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Pasta:  Boil pasta in salted water until al dente.  Drain and transfer to bowl.  If cooking ahead of time, shock in an ice bath to cool, remove from water and toss with salad oil.

Saute cloves of garlic, that are sliced into thin coins, in oil (if small use 3) for 45 seconds on each side until soft and tender -- do not brown garlic (if brown discard and start over).  Increase heat and add tomato salad and stir.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Tomato Salad (Step 3):  Add plain tomato sauce to pan and bring to a boil.  Add pasta to sauce pan and toss with fresh sauce (sauce should just coat pasta).  Transfer to a service platter or plate individually.  Garnish with Balsamic Glaze.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DIJON PASTA SAUCE ===
  1                     garlic clove -- pressed
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil
  1                cup  strained fat-free yogurt -- see * Note
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1                cup  evaporated skim milk
     1/4           cup  fat-free milk
  2          teaspoons  Grey Poupon Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
                        === SPICE BLEND AND CHICKEN===
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  paprika
                        Fat-free butter-flavored spread or spray
  4                     skinless chicken breast fillets
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  1            package  penne pasta - (16 oz)
  3             quarts  water - (to 4)
                        === GARNISH ===
  1              small  tomato -- diced
                        Chopped fresh parsley

* Note:  Make the strained yogurt by pouring a large container of plain yogurt into a coffee filter placed in a metal steamer basket or strainer.  Overnight, the liquid whey will drain from the yogurt, leaving a thick, cheeselike substance in the strainer.  Measure this thick stuff for the recipe and toss out the liquid.

Preheat barbecue or stovetop grill to medium-high heat.  Prepare pasta sauce by first sautÈing the pressed garlic in the olive oil in a medium saucepan.  Saute only for a minute or two over medium heat.  Do no let the garlic brown or it will become bitter.  Remove pan from heat.

Combine strained yogurt with cornstarch in a medium bowl.  Add evaporated milk, fat-free milk, and mustard, and mix.  Pour mixture into saucepan and place it back over heat.  Add Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper, and stir.  When sauce thickens, add parsley and turn heat to low, stirring often.

As sauce cooks, prepare the chicken by combining all of the spice blend ingredients in a small bowl.  Rub a light coating of butter-flavored spread or spray over each breast, and sprinkle some of the spice blend over both sides of each chicken breast.  Cook the chicken on the grill for 4 to 5 minutes per side.  Turn the chicken at a 45 degree angle halfway through the cooking time on each side, so that you get criss-crossed grill marks on the surface.

While chicken is grilling, prepare pasta by bringing 3 to 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pan.  Add pasta to the water and cook for 12 to 15 minutes or until pasta is tender.  Strain.

Divide strained pasta into four portions on four plates, and pour a generous portion of the sauce over the pasta.  Sprinkle some diced tomato over the pasta on each plate.  Sprinkle some additional fresh parsley over the pasta.

Slice each chicken breast across the grain, and arrange each sliced breast on top of the pasta on each plate, being careful to retain the shape of the chicken breast as you position it.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

* Note:  Make the strained yogurt by pouring a large container of plain yogurt into a coffee filter placed in a metal steamer basket or strainer.  Overnight, the liquid whey will drain from the yogurt, leaving a thick, cheeselike substance in the strainer.  Measure this thick stuff for the recipe and toss out the liquid.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat barbecue or stovetop grill to medium-high heat.  Prepare pasta sauce by first sautÈing the pressed garlic in the olive oil in a medium saucepan.  Saute only for a minute or two over medium heat.  Do no let the garlic brown or it will become bitter.  Remove pan from heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine strained yogurt with cornstarch in a medium bowl.  Add evaporated milk, fat-free milk, and mustard, and mix.  Pour mixture into saucepan and place it back over heat.  Add Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper, and stir.  When sauce thickens, add parsley and turn heat to low, stirring often.
</DirT>
<DirT>
As sauce cooks, prepare the chicken by combining all of the spice blend ingredients in a small bowl.  Rub a light coating of butter-flavored spread or spray over each breast, and sprinkle some of the spice blend over both sides of each chicken breast.  Cook the chicken on the grill for 4 to 5 minutes per side.  Turn the chicken at a 45 degree angle halfway through the cooking time on each side, so that you get criss-crossed grill marks on the surface.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While chicken is grilling, prepare pasta by bringing 3 to 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pan.  Add pasta to the water and cook for 12 to 15 minutes or until pasta is tender.  Strain.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide strained pasta into four portions on four plates, and pour a generous portion of the sauce over the pasta.  Sprinkle some diced tomato over the pasta on each plate.  Sprinkle some additional fresh parsley over the pasta.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Slice each chicken breast across the grain, and arrange each sliced breast on top of the pasta on each plate, being careful to retain the shape of the chicken breast as you position it.
</DirT>

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  onions - (to 4)
  3               cans  beef broth
     3/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  Worcheshire sauce
                        Butter -- as needed
  8             ounces  Sargento Italian blend cheese
                        = (this cheese works the best)
  1                     French baguette
  2                     bay leaves
  1               dash  garlic powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Slice the onions into rings and sautÈ in butter in a skillet until tender.

Turn crock pot on to low and put in the cans of beef broth, bay leaves, dash of garlic powder, salt and pepper, Worcheshire sauce, and water.  When the onions and butter mixture is tender, also add them to the crock pot.  Cover and cook for at least 3 to 5 hours on low.

At this point you may want to taste the soup and see if you would like it a little weaker -- if so, add a little water or chicken broth.  Also, at this time remove the bay leaves and discard them.

When about ready to serve, slice bread into thin slices and toast in oven on 350 or in toaster oven until just crusty.  Put toasted slices (1 to 3) in bowl and cover with the cheese (adjust cheese to your liking).  Then cover bread and cheese with hot soup.  The cheese will melt and the bread will rise to the top.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  very finely-chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  very finely-minced garlic
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  cold water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt - (to 1 tbspn)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  2 1/2         pounds  lean ground chuck
  30            ounces  tomato sauce

Combine chopped onion, garlic, parsley and bread crumbs in a food processor and mix 30 seconds.  Break the egg into a 3-quart bowl and mix well using a wire whisk.  Add water, olive oil, salt, pepper, and nutmeg to the egg and whisk until well whisked.  Add the bread crumb mixture, combining with a spatula.  Add the ground meat and mix thoroughly until ingredients are well distributed and the mixture is binding together tightly.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Using a medium-sized ice cream scoop, scoop out a portion onto a lightly oiled jelly-roll pan.  Form each meatball by rolling in the palm of your hand until they feel tight and solid.  (The finished meatballs should be about the size of a golf ball.)

Pour 1/4 cup water into the pan and place in the oven.  Time 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and loosen with a spatula.  Return to the oven an additional 10 minutes, or until cooked through.  Drain.

Heat the tomato sauce in a large skillet.  Add the meatballs and simmer 2 minutes.  Serve over pasta or rice.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Butter -- as needed
                        Cooked spaghetti
                        Grated mizithra cheese
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- (optional)

This is very easy.  In a large pot melt butter over very-low heat until it turns a light nutty-brown color, being very careful not to let it get too brown.  Add to the pot cooked spaghetti, and stir to coat with the butter.

Fork a portion onto a plate and top with grated mizithra.  Sprinkle a little chopped parsley on top, if desired.
