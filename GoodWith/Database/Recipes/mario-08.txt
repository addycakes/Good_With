              Almond And Grain Tart - {Pastiera Di Mandorle}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
  2               cups  flour
  1              large  egg -- beaten, plus
  2                     egg yolks -- beaten
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted with
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- and cooled
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  fresh ricotta
  1 1/2           cups  sliced blanched almonds -- ground to a
                        powder in food processor
     1/2           cup  cracked wheat -- soaked in water
                        overnight
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  orange flower water
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  6                     eggs -- separated
     1/2           cup  orange blossom honey

Mound the flour on a pastry board.  Make a well in the flour and place the egg, yolks, sugar, butter and olive oil mixture, and the vanilla in the center.  Proceed as you would with fresh pasta, bringing the flour in bit by bit from the sides.  When the dough comes together, knead until smooth, then allow to rest 10 minutes.  The dough will be very soft; chill if necessary.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Roll the dough out to a 12-inch circle with a thickness of 1/8-inch.  Fit the pastry to the inside of a 10-inch tart pan and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, almonds, cracked wheat, sugar, orange flower water and cinnamon and mix well to combine.  Add the egg yolks and mix to incorporate completely.

In a separate large bowl, whip the egg whites to soft peaks with a whisk or electric mixer.  Carefully fold the egg whites into the ricotta mixture with a spatula.

Pour the mixture into the pastry and bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until the crust is golden and the filling is solid.  When cooled, slice and serve with the honey.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Categories    : Candies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  sliced and blanched almonds
  3               cups  sugar
  4        tablespoons  almond oil

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the almonds on a sheet tray and toast them until light golden brown.  Set aside.

In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar and a few drops of water and cook over high heat until sugar liquefies, then turns deep golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Do not stir, but brush the sugar crystals off the sides of the pot with a wet pastry brush as necessary.  Once the sugar begins to brown, watch carefully and remove from heat as soon as it is the desired color, as the sugar can burn quickly.

Once the caramel is off the heat, immediately dump the almonds into the pot and stir quickly to incorporate, and turn out, spreading quickly to an even thickness, onto a cookie sheet greased with almond oil.

This recipe yields 1 pound croccante.

           Almond Custards With Almond Milk - {Biancomangiare}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     sheets gelatin
  6 1/2           cups  whole milk
                        Zest of 2 lemons
     1/2         pound  blanched skinless almonds
  2               cups  sugar -- divided
  1                cup  heavy cream -- very cold
  2        tablespoons  almond oil
  1        tablespoons  vanilla extract
  1              whole  egg -- plus
  4                     egg yolks
  1                     pomegranate -- seeds removed
                        from pith and skin
                        === EQUIPMENT ===
  10                    six-ounce flan molds

Place the gelatin leaves in 2 cups of cold water and set aside.

Place the milk and lemon zest in a non-reactive pan over medium-high heat.  Place the almonds in a food processor, grind to a powder and pour into the heating milk.  Bring the milk and almonds to a boil, remove from heat, cover and let stand 20 minutes.

Line a conical sieve with cheesecloth and strain the lemon zest and almond solids from the milk, pressing with the back of a spoon to remove all of the liquid.  Set aside 1 1/2 cups of the flavored milk for the sauce and place the remaining milk, 1 1/2 cups of the sugar and the soaked gelatin leaves into a saucepan and bring just to a boil, stirring constantly.  Remove from the heat immediately and allow to cool to room temperature.

Grease the flan molds with the almond oil and set aside.  Whip the cream to soft peaks and fold the cooled almond milk into the whipped cream.  Spoon the almond milk mixture into the greased flan molds so that theyíre 90 percent full, and refrigerate at least 4 hours.

Meanwhile, crack the eggs and beat together the egg and the yolks.  Add the egg mixture to the remaining 1 1/2 cups flavored milk, and add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar.  Place over medium heat and, stirring constantly, heat to a high simmer, 175 degrees.  Remove from heat, pour through a strainer into a small bowl and refrigerate 1 hour.

To serve, dip the molds upright into a bowl of hot water, without allowing any water to go over the edge into the mold, and carefully invert onto a large plate.  Whisk the sauce to loosen it and pour over the custards into the plate.  Garnish with pomegranate seeds and serve.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Place the gelatin leaves in 2 cups of cold water and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the milk and lemon zest in a non-reactive pan over medium-high heat.  Place the almonds in a food processor, grind to a powder and pour into the heating milk.  Bring the milk and almonds to a boil, remove from heat, cover and let stand 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line a conical sieve with cheesecloth and strain the lemon zest and almond solids from the milk, pressing with the back of a spoon to remove all of the liquid.  Set aside 1 1/2 cups of the flavored milk for the sauce and place the remaining milk, 1 1/2 cups of the sugar and the soaked gelatin leaves into a saucepan and bring just to a boil, stirring constantly.  Remove from the heat immediately and allow to cool to room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grease the flan molds with the almond oil and set aside.  Whip the cream to soft peaks and fold the cooled almond milk into the whipped cream.  Spoon the almond milk mixture into the greased flan molds so that theyíre 90 percent full, and refrigerate at least 4 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, crack the eggs and beat together the egg and the yolks.  Add the egg mixture to the remaining 1 1/2 cups flavored milk, and add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar.  Place over medium heat and, stirring constantly, heat to a high simmer, 175 degrees.  Remove from heat, pour through a strainer into a small bowl and refrigerate 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, dip the molds upright into a bowl of hot water, without allowing any water to go over the edge into the mold, and carefully invert onto a large plate.  Whisk the sauce to loosen it and pour over the custards into the plate.  Garnish with pomegranate seeds and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BROWN CHICKEN STOCK ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Bones, wings, scraps of 3 whole chickens -- excess fat removed
  3                     carrots -- coarsely chopped
  2                     onions -- coarsely chopped
  4                     celery ribs -- coarsely chopped
  3             quarts  water
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
  1              bunch  parsley stems
                        === SOUP ===
  2                     one-day-old baguettes -- cut into chunks
  2               cups  milk
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- cut into 1/8" dice
  1 1/2           cups  Parmigiano-Reggiano -- divided
  4                     eggs -- separated, and
                        yolks beaten
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  fresh breadcrumbs
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying

In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil until smoking.  Add the chicken bones and scraps and brown all over, stirring to avoid burning.  Remove the chicken parts and reserve.

Add the carrots, onions and celery and cook until soft and browned.  Return the chicken bones to the pot and add 3 quarts of water, the tomato paste, peppercorns and parsley, stirring to dislodge the browned chicken and vegetable bits from the bottom of the pan.  Bring almost to a boil, reduce to a simmer and allow to cook at a low simmer for 2 hours, until reduced by half, occasionally skimming excess fat.

After cooking, remove from heat and strain out all solids, pressing them with the bottom of a ladle to extract out all liquids.  Stir the stock to facilitate cooling and set aside.

In a large shallow bowl, cover the bread with the milk.  Allow to sit for 10 minutes.  Squeeze the milk from the bread by hand, cut the bread into a coarse dice and place in a medium bowl.  Add the prosciutto and 1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, egg yolks, parsley, and salt and pepper and roll into balls the size of a quarter.

Roll each ball in the egg whites, then the breadcrumbs.  In a heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the oil until almost smoking.  Cook the balls until golden and remove to a plate lined with paper towels.

When theyíve drained, divide them evenly among six warmed soup bowls, pour the hot broth over them and serve with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano sprinkled over the top.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHELLS ===
  1 1/2           cups  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  Marsala
                        === FILLING ===
  2             quarts  canola oil -- for frying
  1              pound  sheepís milk or cowís milk ricotta -- drained 1 hour in
                        a cheesecloth-lined conical sieve
     1/2           cup  superfine sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  4        tablespoons  Candied Orange Zest -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  tiny chocolate chips
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting

Note:  To make this classic dessert correctly, it is essential to have metal cannoli tubes

In a large bowl, combine the flour, cinnamon, sugar, and cocoa powder and cut in the butter with 2 knives or a pastry cutter, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the Marsala and shape the dough into a ball.  Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate.

In a 3 1/2-quart pot, heat the canola oil to 350 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, stir together the ricotta, sugar, vanilla, orange zest and chocolate chips until well-mixed.  Spoon into a pastry bag with an open tip and place in the refrigerator.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide into 4 pieces.  Roll one piece onto a flat surface with a rolling pin to a 1/16-inch thickness.  Using a cookie cutter, cut 4-inch circles from the dough.  Using the rolling pin, roll each circle into an oval and wrap each oval lengthwise around a metal form, sealing the edges with egg whites.  Flare the edges open with fingers.

Gently drop the cannoli shells into the hot oil and fry until dark golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and allow to drain on paper towels.  When the cannoli are cool enough to touch, twist the molds away from the shells.  The shells may be made one day in advance and allowed to rest, unfilled and uncovered.

To complete the cannoli, stuff with ricotta cream, dust with powdered sugar and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     cardoon stalks about 15" long -- (1 to 1 1/2 lbs)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- cut into 1/4" dice
  3               cups  Besciamela Sauce - (see recipe)
  4                     eggs -- plus
  3                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  ricotta
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- divided
                        Freshly-grated nutmeg -- to taste
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs -- toasted
                        Butter -- for the mold

Bring 6 quarts water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Peel the fibrous part off the stalks of cardoons and cut each stalk on the bias into pieces 1/4-inch thick.  Drop the pieces into the boiling water and cook 15 minutes, until tender.  Drain and allow the pieces to cool.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the oil over medium heat until smoking.  Add the onion and cook 7 to 9 minutes, until soft and light golden brown.  Add the cooked cardoon pieces and cook until very soft, about 10 more minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.

Place cool cardoon mixture into a mixing bowl and add Besciamela, eggs and yolks, ricotta, and 1/4 cup of the Parmigiano and season with nutmeg, salt and pepper.

Butter a bundt cake pan and sprinkle with breadcrumbs to coat.  Pour the cardoon mixture into the prepared pan and place it in a roasting pan.  Pour cool water into the roasting pan to come up 3 inches on the side of the bundt pan, and place it in the oven.  Cook 1 hour, until sformato is just cooked through, then remove.  The sformato is cooked when a toothpick poked into the center exits clean.

Allow to rest 15 minutes before edging with a thin knife and turning out onto a plate.  Sprinkle with toasted bread crumbs and remaining grated cheese before serving warm.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  salt
  4             ounces  butter - (1 stick)
  1                cup  flour
  4                     eggs
  1              small  cauliflower head - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- cut 1" florets
  10                    salted anchovies -- filleted, and
                        rinsed twice
  2             quarts  olive oil -- for frying

Place the water, salt and butter in a 2-quart saucepan and bring to a boil.  Have a whisk and a wooden spoon ready.  Remove the pan from the heat and add the flour all at once, whisking it in.  Return the pan to the burner and start stirring with a spoon.  Cook 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the dough starts to pull easily from the sides of the pan and form a ball.  Remove from the heat and stir until tepid, 6 to 8 minutes.

Add the eggs, 1 at a time, stirring each one completely in before adding the next.  Pour into a mixing bowl, cover the surface with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature.

Bring 4 quarts of water to boil and set up an ice bath next to the stove with 3 cups of ice and 4 cups of water.  Plunge the cauliflower into the water and cook until tender, not al dente.  Remove the cauliflower and refresh in the ice bath.  Drain cauliflower pieces well, dry on a kitchen towel and place in a bowl.

Finely chop the anchovy fillets and add to the cauliflower pieces.  Stir well to distribute.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.

Remove the plastic from the batter, pour the cauliflower mixture into the batter, and stir gently to mix well.

In a 6- to 8-quart pot, heat the olive oil to 375 degrees.  Set up a tray in the oven with several layers of paper towels, to drain the fritters and keep them warm.

Using 2 tablespoons, form fritters by grabbing a floret of cauliflower at a time with a generous amount of the batter that adheres to it, and drop them 1 a time into the hot oil.  Cook 6 or 7 at a time until golden brown, flipping them with a slotted spoon, and remove to drain on the paper towels.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 25 to 30 fritters.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
     3/4           cup  flour -- sifted before
                        measuring
  1                cup  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  6                     eggs
  1              quart  milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     3/4           cup  American Spoon cherry preserves,
                        (or amarene, sour cherries in syrup, drain
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        === PASTA FROLLA ===
  3               cups  flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  12       tablespoons  butter -- very cold
  3                     eggs -- lightly beaten

Set up a large, non-reactive bowl, a rubber spatula and a fine strainer next to the stove.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt.  Stir to combine and whisk in the eggs until the mixture is smooth.

In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the milk until scalded.  Remove the milk from heat and slowly whisk 2 cups of the hot milk into the flour and egg mixture.  Return this tempered flour mixture to the saucepan with the scalded milk and cook, whisking constantly, over low heat until the mixture starts to thicken and boils, about 10 minutes.

Immediately remove from heat and strain the pastry cream into a bowl, scraping out the pan with the spatula.  Stir the vanilla into the strained pastry cream.  Stir with the spatula to facilitate the cooling, and cover with parchment or waxed paper.  Refrigerate until very cold.

Meanwhile, in the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, sugar and baking powder.  Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the eggs and pulse again until dough comes together in pieces.  Turn the dough out, make into a ball and divide into 2 portions, one thatís 1/3 of the total, and the other thatís 2/3 of the total.  Flatten each portion into a disk, wrap each in waxed paper or parchment and chill for at least 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Roll the larger disk into a 16-inch circle and fit it into a buttered 10-inch tart pan with 1 1/2-inch sides.  Allow the dough to slightly overlap on the edges.

Pour the chilled pastry cream into the lined tart pan and distribute the cherry preserves in dots over the cream.  Using a pastry brush, brush the crust with the beaten egg.

Roll the remaining disk into a 10-inch circle and cut into ten 1-inch strips.  Lay the strips across the pastry cream in a lattice pattern.  Brush the lattice with the remaining egg wash and bake on a cookie sheet in the lower third of the oven for 35 minutes, turning after 20 minutes.

Let cool 30 minutes before removing from tart pan and serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  chestnut flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  walnut pieces
  2               cups  milk -- very cold
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  4                     lemons -- sliced paper-thin,
                        seeds removed
  1 1/2           cups  sugar

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, place the flour, sugar and walnuts.  Add 1/2 cup of the milk and slowly add the rest of the milk, stirring constantly to avoid forming lumps in the batter.

Grease the cake pan with 1 tablespoon of the oil and pour in the batter.  Drizzle the top of the batter with the remaining olive oil and distribute the rosemary evenly over the top.  Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick pierced in the center comes out clean.

While the castagnaccio is cooking, in a small saucepan, combine the lemons, sugar, and 1 cup water over medium heat.  Cook until quite soft and bubbly, about 20 minutes.  Remove the castagnaccio and serve either warm or cool with lemon sauce.

     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     fryer chicken - (2 1/2 to 3 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces

  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian parsley

In a heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the oil until almost smoking.  While the oil heats, season the chicken with salt and pepper, dredge each piece in the flour.  Cook in the oil, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan.  Cook the chicken until it is golden brown on all sides.  Remove the chicken and set aside.

Add the potatoes to the pan and cook 2 minutes, until beginning to brown.  Add the onions and cook 10 minutes.  Add the mushrooms, rosemary and tomato paste, stir to distribute the tomato paste and cook 10 minutes, reducing the heat if necessary to avoid burning.

Return the chicken to the pan and add the wine and enough water so that the cooking liquid reaches halfway up the sides of the chicken.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve with the pan juices.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  fresh broccoli with leaves or broccoli rab
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  8                     garlic cloves -- sliced in half
  10                    salted anchovies -- cleaned, filleted,
                        and roughly chopped

Trim the broccoli into long stalks, removing the bottom 2 inches and leaving the leaves attached.  Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil.

Meanwhile, place a 12- to 14-inch saute pan over medium heat and add the olive oil.  Add the garlic and anchovies and cook 5 minutes, until just golden brown and very fragrant.

Remove from heat and season aggressively with pepper and timidly with salt.  This dish may be served hot or at room temperature.

  1                cup  white wine -- divided

                        and rinsed
  2             pounds  clams
  1 1/2           cups  red wine vinegar
  1 1/4           cups  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  3                     salted anchovy fillets -- rinsed and chopped
  2                     red bell peppers -- cut into 1/4" dice

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a large soup pot, combine the shellfish cooking liquid, vinegar, 1 cup of the oil, anchovies, peppers, onion, celery, carrot and garlic and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.  Add the shellfish and stir to heat through.

Meanwhile, toast the bread in the oven for 4 minutes, until light golden brown and crispy.

Divide the soup among heated soup bowls, drizzle with the remaining oil, sprinkle with parsley and serve with a slice of toast floating on top.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs -- crusts removed
                        and set aside for another use
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              bunch  fresh oregano -- chopped

Carefully open the clams and loosen from bottom shell, carefully draining each of the clamsí liquid into a small mixing bowl.  Pour kosher salt onto a cookie sheet so that it is at least a half-inch deep, and arrange the clams in their half-shells around the cookie sheet.

In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat the oil over medium heat until smoking and add the onion, garlic, and peppers.  Cook 6 to 7 minutes, until softened and light golden brown, then add the bread crumbs and continue cooking another 3 minutes, until they are light golden brown.  Remove the mixture from heat, season with salt and pepper and cool.

Stir in the chopped oregano and the reserved clam liquid and pack about 2 teaspoons of the crumb mixture loosely into each clam shell.

Preheat the broiler.  Place clams under heat and heat through, without really cooking the clam, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, until the crumb mixture has turned deep golden brown.  Remove from heat, drizzle with a drop of olive oil, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRESPELLE ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  4                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  milk
                        === FILLING ===
  2 1/2           cups  ricotta -- drained in a straine
                        lined with cheesecloth for 30 minutes
     1/2         pound  fresh mozzarella -- grated
  1                cup  freshly-grated soft sheepís milk cheese
                        (cacio, or a young provolone)
     1/2         pound  salami -- cut into 1/8" dice
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  4        tablespoons  butter

First make the crespelle:  Place the flour in a large mixing bowl.  Crack the eggs over the flour and whisk them in.  Add salt and whisk in milk, a little at a time, until all milk is incorporated.  Allow the batter to stand for 20 minutes.

For the filling, combine all the filling ingredients except butter.

Heat a 6-inch, nonstick pan until hot and brush with olive oil.  Reduce heat to medium and pour 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons batter into the pan.  Cook 30 to 40 seconds, until pale golden, and then flip.  Cook on other side 20 seconds and remove to a plate. Continue the process until all the batter has been used, yielding between 17 and 19 crespelle.

Fill each crespelle with 3 tablespoons of the cheese mixture and fold in half.  Continue filling crespelle until all are full.  Be sure to leave 4 tablespoons of the cheese mixture for the topping.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Butter the bottom and all sides of 10- by 8-inch ceramic baking dish with 1 tablespoon of butter.  Lay the filled crespelle in an overlapping layer in the baking dish.  Smear the remaining cheese mixture over the top, dot with the remaining butter and place in oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until piping hot and crispy on top.

Remove and serve hot, or allow to rest and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 18 crespelle.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  grated pecorino
     1/4           cup  sliced blanched almonds
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves

In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, wine, salt and oil to form a soft dough.  Turn out onto a floured board, and knead lightly until dough holds together.  Can rest covered with a towel or plastic wrap for 10 minutes before rolling into ropes.

Roll pieces of dough into a 1/4-inch thick rope, cut it into pieces 4 inches long, and form O-shaped doughnuts from each 4-inch length.

Preheat the oven to 340 degrees.

In a medium pasta pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil.  Drop each doughnut into the boiling water for 25 seconds, remove with a slotted spoon and place each on a greased baking sheet.  Bake for 1/2 hour or longer for desired texture and doneness.

While the doughnuts are still hot, dip each one into either the pepper, the pecorino or a mixture of the almonds and the rosemary, and allow to cool.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3               cups  flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  flour
  3               cups  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
  1                cup  orange blossom honey
     1/4           cup  orange flower water
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar

In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring 3 1/2 cups water to a boil and add the sugar.  Cook for 1 minute and, whisking, add the flour in a steady, slow stream.  When the mixture becomes too thick for the whisk, change to a wooden spoon and continue to cook over low heat for 15 minutes.  Pour the mixture out onto a marble counter and allow to cool.

Knead the dough by hand for 8 minutes.  Roll it out into a rope (a dowel), about 1/3-inch thickness.  Cut the dowel into lengths of about 6 inches, and form doughnut-shaped rings that should be equal in diameter to a tennis ball.  Fry them in the oil until firm and golden, about 2 to 3 minutes, then remove from the oil with a slotted spoon or spatula.  Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.

While the doughnuts cool, in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the honey and the orange flower water and heat over medium heat to achieve the viscosity of a thin syrup.  Dip each doughnut in the honey mixture, shake off the excess syrup and sprinkle with the powdered sugar.

  2        tablespoons  salt
  3              large  eggplants - (abt 4 lbs) -- peeled, and
                        cut into quarters lengthwise
  4             slices  day-old bread
  1                     egg - (to 2)
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated pecorino -- divided
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian parsley
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Add the eggplants and boil 10 minutes.  Dip the bread in the water and remove, squeezing to drain the water and set aside.

Remove the eggplants from the water and drain well.  When the eggplants have cooled, coarsely chop them and place them in the work bowl of a food processor.  Add the soaked bread and 1 egg and pulse to form a somewhat homogenous paste adding more egg if necessary.  Add 1/2 cup pecorino, garlic and parsley and continue to pulse until a smooth yet somewhat dry mixture is formed.  Do not over-process.

Turn the mixture into a mixing bowl and place bread crumbs on a large plate.  Using your hands and working quickly, roll the eggplant mixture into balls with a 1/2-inch diameter and roll each ball in the bread crumbs to coat.  Hold each ball on a sheet tray.

In a heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the olive oil until just smoking.  Cook the eggplant balls in the oil a few at a time, for 6 to 7 minutes, until dark golden brown, turning gently with a wooden spoon to evenly brown all sides.  Remove to a tray or plate lined with paper towels.  Sprinkle with the remaining pecorino and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
     1/4           cup  light red or white wine (Fiano del Avellin
     3/4           cup  warm water
  1 1/2         ounces  brewerís yeast
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
                        === FILLING ===
  1              large  escarole head - (abt 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lbs)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  4        tablespoons  very small capers -- rinsed 3 times in
                        water, and drained
  4                     salted anchovies -- finely minced
  1                cup  Gaeta olives -- pitted, left whole
     1/4           cup  dried currants
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
  2               cups  fresh ricotta
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the dough:  Place the wine, water and yeast in a large bowl and stir until dissolved.  Add the honey, salt and olive oil and mix thoroughly.  Add 1 cup of flour and mix with a wooden spoon until it becomes a loose batter.  Add 2 more cups of flour and stir with the spoon for another 2 to 3 minutes, to incorporate as much of the flour as possible.

Bring the dough together with your hands and turn it out onto a floured board or marble surface.  Knead for about 6 to 8 minutes, until you have made a firm, smooth dough.  Place it in a clean, lightly-oiled bowl and cover it with a towel.  Let it rise in the warmest part of the kitchen for 45 minutes.

Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces and knead it into rounds.  Let rest 15 minutes.

For the filling:  Bring 3 quarts of water to boil.  Remove leaves from escarole head and rinse of all sand and dirt.  Drop the leaves into the boiling water and cook until tender, about 8 to 9 minutes.  Remove, drain and allow to cool.  Stack the leaves, cut them into 1-inch thick ribbons, and set aside.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat oil over high heat until smoking.  Add garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes, until light golden brown.  Add the capers, anchovies, olives, currants and pine nuts and cook 2 to 3 minutes, until garlic is dark golden brown.  Add the escarole and stir until well mixed.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.  Gently stir in ricotta and season mixture with salt and black pepper.  Set aside.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees and place a clean pizza stone in the oven to preheat.

Dust a clean work surface lightly with flour.  Take the first of 4 rounds of dough and flatten it with your fingers and palms until it is about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick and oval-shaped, and about 10 inches across.  Place 1/4 of the escarole mixture in upper part of center of the rolled dough.  Fold the dough to form a half-moon, then seal the edges.  Repeat this process with the other 3 pieces.

Place each piece on the stone in the oven and cook 15 to 18 minutes until golden brown.  Remove from the oven and serve.  This dish is often served at room temperature, but can be eaten fresh from the oven.

This recipe yields 4 calzones.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1        tablespoons  fresh oregano
  4        tablespoons  butter -- cut 4 equal pieces
  1 1/2           cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2                chipotle pepper -- pureed
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated pecorino

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, season with salt and pepper and add the oregano.  In a nonstick pan, cook 1 tablespoon of the butter until it foams and subsides.  Pour 1/4 of the egg mixture into the pan and cook until it has solidified and is easily slid from the pan, about 2 minutes.  Repeat this procedure 3 times with the remaining butter and egg mixture, setting each omelet aside to cool.

When the omelets are cool, cut each into 1/4-inch thick strips.

In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the Basic Tomato Sauce and the chilis and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.  Add the egg strips and simmer for 10 minutes.  Top with the grated pecorino and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  green Italian olives
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano leaves -- divided
     1/2           cup  grated Pecorino cheese
  1                cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1              pound  beef flank steak -- sliced 8 thin scallo
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              bunch  broccoli rabe -- blanched in boiling
                        water and refreshed
                        Flour -- for dusting
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry red wine

In a medium saucepan, combine the Basic Tomato Sauce, green olives and 2 tablespoons of the oregano and bring to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and continue cooking while assembling the rest of the dish.

In a mixing bowl, combine the Pecorino, chopped parsley and nutmeg and mix until well blended.  Lay 8 pieces of steak out on board.  Season with salt and pepper.  Divide the Pecorino mixture evenly over the beef, spreading it to form a thin layer on top of each piece of steak.

Roughly chop the broccoli rabe and divide it among the pieces of beef.  Roll up each piece like a jelly roll and tie securely with a piece of butcherís twine.  Dredge each roll in the flour.

In a 12- to 14-inch skillet, heat 1/4 cup oil until smoking.  Place 4 rolled steak pieces at a time in the skillet and brown evenly, rolling with tongs or a wooden spoon.  Remove first 4 pieces and repeat with remaining four.  Remove second group and pour off the cooking oil to discard.

Put the skillet back on the heat and add the red wine, scraping the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to loosen browned bits.  Add the simmering tomato sauce and bring to a boil.  Add all 8 beef rolls and simmer, uncovered, for 10 to 15 minutes, until all of the meat is cooked through.

Remove the meat to heated platter, pour the sauce over the meat and garnish with the remaining oregano.

This recipe yields 4 main course servings.

         Fresh Sausage And Broccoli Rabe - {Salsicce E Friarelli}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  fresh pork shoulder -- run through
                        the largest holes of butcherís grinder
  2             pounds  pancetta -- run through
                        the same grinder
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  4        tablespoons  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  3        tablespoons  dried oregano
  2        tablespoons  hot chili flakes
  8                     feet sheep casings - (abt 1/2 lb)
  2            bunches  broccoli rabe
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

In a mixing bowl, stir together the pork shoulder and pancetta with your hands until well-mixed.  Add pepper, salt, wine, oregano and chili flakes and mix until well-blended, again with your hands.  Work quickly here so that body temperature does not change the texture of the fat.

Set up the sausage stuffer and place the casing over the funnel feeder.  If you do not have a sausage stuffer, form the sausage into 1/4-pound logs by hand.  If using a sausage stuffer, stuff the sausage into the casings, twisting every 3 1/2 to 4 inches, to yield 4-ounce sausages, and form 22 to 25 sausages.  Prick them all over with a needle and set aside in a cool place.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Set up an ice bath next to the stove top.  Blanch the broccoli rabe for 2 minutes, refresh in the ice bath and drain.

Preheat the broiler.  Place the pricked sausages in an oven-proof pan and broil until halfway cooked, 5 minutes per side.  Place the pan over medium heat and continue to cook until the sausages are deep golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes.  Add the garlic and broccoli rabe and, stirring, cook until the broccoli rabe is hot, 5 to 7 more minutes.

Meanwhile, on a small sheet tray, toast the bread crumbs under the broiler until golden brown.  Remove to a small bowl, add the oil and mix well.  Pile the broccoli rabe on a plate, sprinkle with the bread crumbs, place the sausages next to the broccoli rabe and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                        on the bias
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
                        Flour -- for dredging
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the celery in the boiling water for 7 minutes, until tender but not soft.  Drain and set aside on paper towels to cool.

In a heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the oil until it is almost smoking.  While the oil heats, place the flour on a plate and place the eggs in a shallow bowl.   Dredge the cooled celery pieces through the flour, then the egg and cook them in the oil until they are deep golden brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     red onion -- chopped 1/8" dice
  1              pinch  saffron
  2               cups  arborio rice
  3               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  freshly-grated pecorino
  2                     eggs -- separated, plus
  2                     egg yolks
  2               cups  Ragu Napoletano -- (see recipe)
  1              bunch  fresh basil
     1/4           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs

In a 4- to 6-quart saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil until just smoking.  Add half the chopped red onion and saffron and cook until softened, about 7 to 9 minutes.  Add rice and chicken stock and bring to boil, uncovered.  Cook until the liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 25 minutes.  Spread the rice out to cool on a large cookie sheet, about 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick.

When the rice is cool, place it in a bowl and mix in the pecorino, 2 eggs, and 2 yolks and set aside.

In a 10- to 12-inch sautÈ pan, cook the remaining chopped onion in 2 tablespoons olive oil until light golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Add Ragu Napoletano and basil and cook 5 to 7 minutes, until reduced by one third and quite thick.  Set aside and allow to cool.

Place the dusting flour, egg whites and bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls and lightly beat the egg whites.  To form the arancine, place 3 tablespoons of the rice mixture in palm of hand and make an indentation with the back of a spoon.  Spoon 2 tablespoons of the ragu mixture into the indentation and form an open bowl out of the rice in your hand.  Cover the filled portion with another tablespoon of the rice mixture and, using both hands, shape the rice into a ball.  Continue with the remaining rice mixture and stuffing until done.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the remaining 1 cup of oil until almost smoking.  While the oil heats, dust the rice balls in the flour, then the egg whites, then the bread crumbs and cook in the oil until golden brown all over.  Remove to a plate lined with paper towels and serve with the remaining ragu.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
     1/4           cup  light red or white wine (Fiano del Avellin
     3/4           cup  warm water
  1 1/2         ounces  brewerís yeast
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
                        === FILLING ===
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/2          head  escarole - (abt 1/2 lb) -- cut 1/4" chiffonade
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  4                     salt-packed anchovies -- filleted, and
                        rinsed twice
  1                cup  Gaeta olives -- pitted, left whole
  3        tablespoons  capers (smallest available) -- rinsed
  4        tablespoons  pine nuts
  2        tablespoons  dried currants
  4               cups  olive oil -- for frying

For the crust:  In a large bowl, combine wine, water and yeast and stir until dissolved.  Add the honey, salt and olive oil and mix thoroughly.  Add 1 cup of flour and mix with a wooden spoon until it becomes a loose batter.  Add 2 more cups of flour and stir with the spoon for another 2 to 3 minutes, to incorporate as much of the flour as possible.

Bring the dough together with your hands and turn it out onto a floured board or marble surface.  Knead for about 6 to 8 minutes, until you have made a firm, smooth dough.  Place it in a clean, lightly-oiled bowl and cover it with a towel.  Let it rise in the warmest part of the kitchen for 45 minutes.

For the filling:  Bring 4 quarts of water to boil and add 1 tablespoon of salt.  Plunge the escarole into the water and cook 12 to 14 minutes, until very tender.  Remove, refresh with cold water, press intensely to remove all possible water, and set aside.

In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat oil until smoking.  Add garlic and cook 4 to 5 minutes, until light golden brown.  Add the anchovies, olives, capers, pine nuts, currants and cooked escarole and cook 8 to 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until all ingredients are well mixed and escarole has started to turn brownish-gray.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Remove a golf ball-sized piece of dough from the batch.  Press the ball with your fingers to form a circle about 5 inches across.  Repeat this process with all of the dough.  Place 2 tablespoons of filling into the center of each dough circle and fold into half moons, pressing with the tines of a fork around all the edges to close the well.

In a high-sided frying pan, heat the oil to 375 degrees.  Drop 2 or 3 half moons into the oil at a time and cook until golden brown on both sides.  Remove to drain on paper towels and season immediately with freshly ground pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 3/4           cups  flour
  2               cups  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  3              whole  eggs
  4                     egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  Nocello (walnut) liqueur
     1/2           cup  chopped green walnuts

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, sugar and baking powder.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks, and Nocello.  Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir just until the dough comes together, about 1 minute.  Add the walnuts and mix until just incorporated.

Roll the dough into 3 logs, about 10 inches by 2 inches and place on an ungreased baking sheet.  Bake 20 minutes until light golden brown and remove from oven.

As soon as they are cool enough to handle, cut the logs on a slight diagonal into pieces 1/3-inch thick and arrange, cut-side down, on the sheets.

Reduce the heat to 275 degrees, return the pieces to the oven and bake 20 minutes longer, until crisp and dry.  Allow to cool.

This recipe yields about 30 cookies.

                 Grilled Lobsters - {Aragoste Alle Brace}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Juice and zest of 3 lemons -- plus
  2                     lemons -- cut into wedges
  1              bunch  fresh marjoram -- tied tightly
                        at stem end with a piece of string
  3        tablespoons  limoncello or other lemon liqueur
  4                     live lobsters - (2 lbs ea)
  2               cups  arugula -- washed, spun dry

Preheat barbecue or broiler.

Place olive oil and juice and zest of 3 lemons into a small saucepan and place over medium heat.  Bring to a near boil, remove from heat and pour into a bowl.  Immediately add the marjoram "brush" and limoncello and allow to steep, like tea, for 1 hour, covered.  This mixture can be stored in a lidded jar, away from light, for up to a week.

Kill lobsters by piercing their shells with a sharp point at the center of the back end of the eyes.  Place the whole lobster on the hottest part of the grill for 3 minutes per side and remove from the heat.

Cut the lobsters in half lengthwise and, careful not to lose a drop of the tomalley or roe, gently anoint them with the scented oil, using the marjoram brush.  Gently place them, shell-side down, on the grill and cook until nearly done, about 6 to 7 minutes.  Turn the flesh-side down, cook for 1 minute, and remove to a platter.

Dress the arugula with 4 tablespoons of the scented oil and some coarse salt and pile in center of platter.  Serve warm or room temperature, with the remaining oil and lemon wedges on side.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  cake flour
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  minced blanched and shocked fresh basil
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated pecorino
  2        tablespoons  salt
  10       tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  6                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1             medium  zucchini -- cut into 1/4" thick
                        half-moons to yield 1 cup
  1           teaspoon  red chili flakes
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  rock shrimp
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley

For the Pasta:  Make a well in the flour, crack the eggs into the center, pour the milk over and add the basil.  Using a fork, stir the egg mixture slowly into the flour to form a wet dough.  Add the grated cheese and, working now with your hands, bring the dough together and knead 8 to 10 minutes to form a smooth dough.  Allow to rest 15 minutes, covered in plastic wrap.

Set up a pasta rolling machine and cut off a piece of pasta dough the size of a tennis ball.  Roll the pasta through the widest distance between the rollers, fold it by 3 and rerun it through the same setting.  Repeat this 3 times, being careful to use very little flour, as it will dry the pasta out.

Run the pasta through the next 2 levels on the pasta rollers.  Lay the sheet of now rolled pasta onto a floured cutting board and cut, using a knife, into strips 1/4-inch wide.  Lay the cut noodles on a kitchen towel and cover with another.  Roll and cut all pasta the same way and set aside.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 6 tablespoons of the oil and garlic over medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes, until the garlic is light golden brown.  Add the zucchini pieces and cook 2 to 3 minutes, until just soft.  Add the chili flakes, wine and Basic Tomato Sauce, bring to a boil and cook 1 minute.  Add the shrimp and remove from heat.

Drop the pasta into the boiling water and cook 3 minutes, until tender, yet al dente.  Drain and toss into the pan with shrimp and place the pan over high heat.  Cook about 1 minute, until shrimp are just cooked through, and the pasta is coated with the sauce.  Add the parsley and toss through with the remaining 4 tablespoons oil, off the heat.  Pour into a heated bowl and serve with plenty of freshly grated black pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  fresh pork shoulder -- run through the
                        largest holes of butcherís grinder
  2             pounds  pancetta -- run through the
                        same grinder
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  4        tablespoons  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  8                     feet sheep casings - (abt 1/2 lb)
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  5                     red bell peppers -- seeded, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2" strips
  5                     yellow bell peppers -- seeded, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2" strips
  1         tablespoon  red chili flakes
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano
  1                can  tomato paste
  1                cup  dry red wine

In a mixing bowl, stir together the pork shoulder and pancetta with your hands until well mixed.  Add pepper, salt and white wine and mix until well blended, again with your hands.  You must move quickly here or your body temperature could change the texture of the fat.

Set up the sausage stuffer and place the casing over the funnel feeder.  If you do not have a sausage stuffer, form the sausage into 1/4 pound logs by hand and be careful handling them.  Stuff the sausage into the casings, twisting every 3 1/2 to 4 inches so that each sausage is about 4 ounces, and form 22 to 25 sausages.  Prick them all over with a needle and set aside in a cool place.

In a 12- to 14-inch frying pan, heat the oil over medium heat until smoking.  Add the onions, peppers, chili flakes and oregano and cook 8 to 10 minutes, until softened.  Add the tomato paste and cook 15 to 18 minutes, until paste turns a darker color.  Add the red wine and simmer 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool.

To finish the dish, place a 14- to 16-inch skillet over medium heat and place the sausages in the pan.  Cook for 7 to 9 minutes, until dark golden brown on the bottom, moving sausages carefully and frequently.

Turn the sausages and add the pepper mixture.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, augmenting the pan with water, 1/4 cup at a time to keep the liquidity near that of a ragu.

Remove from heat, divide equally among 6 warmed dinner plates, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

             Honey Drenched Christmas Fritters - {Struffoli}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fritters

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  flour
  6                     eggs -- plus
  1                     egg yolk
                        Zest of 2 lemons
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  1                     orange -- zested
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  limoncello
  4               cups  canola or peanut oil -- for frying
  2               cups  honey
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting

In a mixing bowl, place flour, eggs, yolk, zest of 1 lemon, orange zest, salt and limoncello and mix well to form a firm dough, 8 to 10 minutes.  Place in the refrigerator and allow to rest 30 minutes.

Remove from the refrigerator and cut golf ball-sized pieces of dough from the main batch.  Roll each ball into a 1/2-inch thick dowel (rope) and cut each dowel into 1/2-inch pieces.  Roll each piece into a ball and continue until finished with all dough.

In a 12- to 14-inch skillet with at least 3-inch sides, heat the oil to 375 degrees.  Drop enough balls in to cover about half of the surface of frying oil and cook until dark golden brown.  Use a slotted spoon to turn them regularly, and expect them to puff up while cooking.  As they finish, remove them to a tray covered with paper towels, and drain well.  This should take at least 5 batches.

When all of the struffoli are cooked, heat the honey, lemon juice and zest together in a wide 6- to 8-quart saucepan until quite warm, about 150 degrees, and substantially thinner.  Add struffoli to honey and stir carefully until well coated.  Remove from heat and allow to cool 5 minutes in the pan, stirring regularly.  Pour out into a large serving tray in the form of either a pyramid or a ring mold.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a 12- by 9-inch casserole.

Cut the artichokes with a very sharp knife or a mandoline into 1/8-inch thick slices.  Layer the lasagne, beginning with the Besciamela, then a layer of pasta, then a layer of artichokes, each layer getting a sprinkling of pecorino.  The top layer should be besciamela and cheese.  Bake in the oven for 45 minutes.  Allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

Categories    : Beverages                       Condiments

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  vodka
                        Zest of 10 lemons -- no pith at all,
  2 1/2           cups  sugar
  3 1/2           cups  water

You may substitute 15 limes, 6 grapefruits, 10 blood oranges, 12 mandarin oranges, or 8 regular oranges for the 10 lemons.

Place vodka and zest in a sealable jar, like a mason jar and allow to sit in a cool place for 4 days.

On the fifth day place the sugar and the water in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Allow to cook 5 minutes, remove from heat and allow to cool.  Add sugar solution to the vodka solution and allow to stand overnight.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  salt -- plus
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2              large  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/2" dice
  5                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1 1/2         ounces  prosciutto or pancetta
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  red chili flakes
  1              pound  linguine

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a large, non-reactive bowl, combine the tomatoes and the remaining 2 teaspoons of salt, stir gently with a wooden spoon, and set aside.

On a clean cutting board, mince the garlic and prosciutto or pancetta together to make a homogenous, paste-like mixture.  In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat and add the garlic and pork mixture.  Cook it gently for 4 to 5 minutes, until it is translucent but not browned.  Remove from heat, add the chili flakes, stir well to combine and set aside.

Cook the linguine in the boiling water according to package instructions, until tender yet al dente.  Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid.

Toss the drained pasta into the pan with the garlic-pork mixture and the tomatoes and toss over high heat for 1 minute, adding enough of the reserved pasta water to bring the sauce to desired consistency and dress each strand of pasta.

Remove from heat and divide among 4 warmed pasta bowls.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  wild mushrooms - (to 4 lbs), such as
                        porcini, chanterelles and hen of the
                        woods - (you may substitute 1 1/2 lbs
                        portobello, 2 lbs shiitake and 1 lb crimin
  3               cups  good white wine vinegar
  1             bottle  good dry white wine
  4                     fresh bay leaves
  1                     rosemary stem
  1         tablespoon  hot chili flakes
  10                    black peppercorns
     1/4           cup  kosher salt
  2             quarts  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === EQUIPMENT ===
  3                     quart jars with lids -- cleaned and steriliz

Clean the mushrooms of any dirt with a soft brush or a cloth, but do not wash with water.  Cut the portobello caps into quarters and cut the stems into 1/2-inch thick rectangles, and set aside.  Remove the stems from the shiitake, leave the caps whole and set aside.  Halve the crimini and set aside.

Pour the vinegar and the wine into a stainless steel, 8-quart saucepan and add the bay leaves, rosemary, chili flakes, peppercorns and salt and bring to a boil.  Add all of the mushrooms and, once the solution has returned to a boil, cook for 20 minutes.

Drain the mushrooms in a colander, discarding the aromatics, and pour them out onto a stack of kitchen towels to drain and dry well, about 30 minutes.

Divide the mushrooms among the 3 jars, placing 3 or 4 peppercorns and a pinch of chili flakes in each jar.  Fill each of the jars with oil to the very top and refrigerate overnight.  The mushrooms will absorb oil the first couple of nights, so it will be necessary to "top up" the oil after 3 or 4 days.

Seal the jars with the caps and allow the mushrooms to marinate a week before serving.  In Italy, these mushrooms could easily rest 6 weeks before theyíre served.  They are, however, ready after 4 days, and could be consumed as early as the first day following their marinating.

To serve, bring a jar to room temperature and place some of the mushrooms into a bowl with a little of the oil and a plate of grilled bread rubbed with garlic on the side.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     boneless (sleeve boned) quail -- if available,
                        if not, leave bone in
  8        tablespoons  honey
  1                cup  olive oil -- plus
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     russet potatoes -- peeled, cut
                        into 1/2" cubes, standing in cold water
     1/2           cup  Gaeta olives -- drained of juice
  1                     fennel bulb -- trimmed of stalk,
                        cut into batons
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced

          Meatballs In Green Sauce - {Granatine Con Salsa Verde}

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatballs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             slices  day-old bread
  1              pound  ground beef
     1/2         pound  fresh sausage -- out of its skin
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1              bunch  basil leaves -- cut into chiffonade
  2                     eggs
     1/2           cup  pecorino
  1 1/2           cups  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  6                     anchovies -- filleted and rinsed
  3        tablespoons  capers
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian parsley
  1              bunch  mint -- leaves only
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar

Soak the bread in water for 5 minutes, remove from the water and press out the liquid by hand.  Place the soaked bread in a large bowl, add the beef and the sausage and mix by hand to combine.  Add the garlic, basil, eggs and pecorino and mix well to combine.  Make golf ball-sized balls out of the meat mixture and set aside.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat 1 cup of the oil until smoking.  Cook the meatballs in the oil until golden brown and cooked through, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan.  Remove the meatballs to a plate lined with paper towels and keep warm.

In the work bowl of a food processor, puree the remaining 1/2 cup oil, anchovies, capers, parsley, mint and white vinegar.  Pour half of the sauce over the warm meatballs, and serve the other half on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
     1/2         pound  calamari -- cleaned
  2                     lemons -- sliced 1/8" thick
  2                     lemons -- cut into wedges
     1/2         pound  tiny smelts -- cleaned
     1/2         pound  fresh anchovies -- cleaned
     1/2         pound  small scallops -- shucked and cleaned
  2               cups  cornstarch
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a deep pan with a fryer basket, heat the oil to 375 degrees, until just smoking.  In a wide, shallow bowl, combine half the calamari, half the lemon slices, half the smelts, half the anchovies and half the scallops.  Sprinkle evenly with 1 cup cornstarch and toss quickly with hands to coat.

Season the fried foods with salt and pepper and immediately repeat the coating and frying process with the remaining seafood, lemons and cornstarch.  Season the second batch and serve all with lemon wedges.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh buffalo mozzarella -- sliced into
                        four (3" by 4") slices
  8             slices  American-style sandwich bread -- crusts removed
  4                     eggs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTA ===
  4                     eggs
  3 1/2           cups  flour -- plus more for
                        dusting work surface
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil
                        === FILLING ===
  3               cups  ricotta cheese
  1 1/2           cups  freshly-grated pecorino
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  2                     eggs
  1              bunch  basil, leaves only -- cut into chiffonade
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- cut into 1/8" dice
                        Several gratings of nutmeg
  3        tablespoons  salt
  8        tablespoons  butter

To make the pasta, make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.  As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and leftover crusty bits.  Discard these bits.  Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead it for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Meanwhile, to make the filling, in a large bowl, combine the ricotta and the pecorino and mix well.  Add the parsley, eggs, basil, prosciutto and nutmeg and stir well to combine.  Set aside.

Roll out pasta to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine and place on a lightly floured surface.

If you have a ravioli-cutting rolling pin, cover the layer of pasta with a 1/4-inch thick layer of the ricotta mixture.  Place an equal sheet of pasta over and press down lightly with your hands.  Carefully roll the 2 sheets together with the roller to form the ravioli.  Using a pastry cutter, cut the ravioli apart by running down between the ravioli.

If you do not have a ravioli-cutting rolling pin, then cut a single sheet of pasta at a time into rectangles 2 by 1-inch.  Place a teaspoon of the ricotta mixture into the center of each rectangle and fold the pasta down like a piece of notebook paper and seal to form a 1-inch square.  Repeat until all ingredients have been used.

Bring 8 quarts of water to boil and add 3 tablespoons salt.  Drop the ravioli in and cook 6 to 7 minutes, until tender and fully cooked.

Meanwhile, in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the butter until melted and bubbling.  Emulsify with 4 tablespoons pasta water taken from the pasta pot.  Remove ravioli from cooking liquid, drain and add to saute pan.  Toss over heat 1 minute to coat, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

To make the pasta, make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.  As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and leftover crusty bits.  Discard these bits.  Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead it for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, to make the filling, in a large bowl, combine the ricotta and the pecorino and mix well.  Add the parsley, eggs, basil, prosciutto and nutmeg and stir well to combine.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out pasta to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine and place on a lightly floured surface.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you have a ravioli-cutting rolling pin, cover the layer of pasta with a 1/4-inch thick layer of the ricotta mixture.  Place an equal sheet of pasta over and press down lightly with your hands.  Carefully roll the 2 sheets together with the roller to form the ravioli.  Using a pastry cutter, cut the ravioli apart by running down between the ravioli.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you do not have a ravioli-cutting rolling pin, then cut a single sheet of pasta at a time into rectangles 2 by 1-inch.  Place a teaspoon of the ricotta mixture into the center of each rectangle and fold the pasta down like a piece of notebook paper and seal to form a 1-inch square.  Repeat until all ingredients have been used.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring 8 quarts of water to boil and add 3 tablespoons salt.  Drop the ravioli in and cook 6 to 7 minutes, until tender and fully cooked.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the butter until melted and bubbling.  Emulsify with 4 tablespoons pasta water taken from the pasta pot.  Remove ravioli from cooking liquid, drain and add to saute pan.  Toss over heat 1 minute to coat, and serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  day-old bread in 1" cubes
  1 1/4         pounds  ground beef
  3                     eggs -- beaten
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     3/4           cup  grated pecorino
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
     1/4           cup  pine nuts -- toasted in 400 degre
                        oven for 2 minutes
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2 1/2           cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)

In a shallow bowl, soak the bread cubes in enough water to cover.  Remove the bread cubes and squeeze by hand to wring excess moisture.

In a large bowl, combine the bread, beef, eggs, garlic, pecorino, parsley, pine nuts, salt and pepper and mix by hand to incorporate bread into meat.  With wet hands, form the mixture into 12 to 15 meatballs, each of them a size somewhere between a tennis ball and a golf ball.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the oil until almost smoking.  Add the meatballs, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan, and cook until deep golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.

Add the Basic Tomato Sauce and reduce the heat to a simmer.  Add all meatballs, cook for 10 minutes and allow to cool.

This recipe yields 12 to 15 meatballs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
  2               cups  flour -- plus additional
                        for rolling out pastry
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              ounce  sugar
  2                     lemons -- zested, and
                        finely grated
     3/4           cup  butter -- cut small cubes,
                        and chilled
  1              whole  egg -- plus
  1                     egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  orange liqueur
  1                cup  confectionersí sugar
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/3           cups  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  1                     orange -- zested, and
                        finely grated
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar
     1/2           cup  mascarpone cheese
  7                     eggs
  3        tablespoons  orange liqueur
                        Confectionersí sugar -- for garnish

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt, 1 ounce of sugar, and lemon zest.  Cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  In a small bowl, combine the egg, the yolk, the liqueur and confectionersí sugar, and stir this mixture into the flour mixture with a fork until it just comes together.

Turn the mixture onto a floured board and gently work the mixture until a dough is formed.  Press the dough into a disc shape about 6 inches across, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for 15 minutes.

Remove from the freezer and quickly roll the dough so that it fills out a buttered, 12- to 14-inch tart pan.  Place the dough in the pan, trimming the edges, wrap the pan in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Remove the pastry from the refrigerator and prick it all over with a fork.  Bake for 10 minutes, reduce heat to 375 degrees and continue to bake for 5 minutes, until pale golden.  Remove from oven and allow to cool.

To make the filling, in a medium bowl, combine the orange juice, zest, sugar and mascarpone and beat well.  Add the eggs 1 at a time and continue to beat.  When all eggs have been added, beat in the liqueur.

Pour the filling into the cooled pastry shell and bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes, until it is browned in spots and the crust is golden.  Allow to cool dust with confectionersí sugar.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt, 1 ounce of sugar, and lemon zest.  Cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  In a small bowl, combine the egg, the yolk, the liqueur and confectionersí sugar, and stir this mixture into the flour mixture with a fork until it just comes together.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn the mixture onto a floured board and gently work the mixture until a dough is formed.  Press the dough into a disc shape about 6 inches across, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the freezer and quickly roll the dough so that it fills out a buttered, 12- to 14-inch tart pan.  Place the dough in the pan, trimming the edges, wrap the pan in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the pastry from the refrigerator and prick it all over with a fork.  Bake for 10 minutes, reduce heat to 375 degrees and continue to bake for 5 minutes, until pale golden.  Remove from oven and allow to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the filling, in a medium bowl, combine the orange juice, zest, sugar and mascarpone and beat well.  Add the eggs 1 at a time and continue to beat.  When all eggs have been added, beat in the liqueur.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the filling into the cooled pastry shell and bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes, until it is browned in spots and the crust is golden.  Allow to cool dust with confectionersí sugar.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  flour
  6             ounces  lard
  4                     egg yolks
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        A little ice water
  2             pounds  rigatoni or ziti pasta
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === THE CONDIMENTS ===
                        Neapolitan Meat Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Neopolitan Meatballs -- (see recipe)
                        Besciamela Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2         pound  prosciutto crudo -- cut 1/4" dice
                        Several gratings of nutmeg
  2               cups  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        === THE ASSEMBLY ===
     1/2           cup  butter
  1 1/2           cups  toasted bread crumbs

Make a well in the flour on a wooden work surface.  Cut the lard into 1/4-inch pieces and place in the center of the well with the yolks, salt and a teaspoon of ice water.  Mix well with the tips of your fingers to form a lumpy mass.  Bring together as a dough and knead for 4 to 5 minutes.  Wrap in plastic and set aside.

Place 6 quarts water in a spaghetti pot, bring to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop pasta in and cook 2 minutes less than the package instructions, remove and refresh under cold running water until cool, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from refreshing bath and toss with 2 tablespoons oil and set aside.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Roll out the pasta frolla to 1/4-inch thick.  Butter the metal bowl and dust with the bread crumbs.  Lay the pasta frolla in to completely line all of the bowl plus 1 1/2 inches over the edge and set aside.

Mix half of the cooked rigatoni with 2 1/2 cups Ragu Napoletano, 1/2 cup of Parmigiano and set aside.  Mix the remaining half of the cooked rigatoni with half of the Besciamela, 1/4 cup parmigiano, the prosciutto and a generous grating of nutmeg, and set aside.

Place the white mixed pasta into the mold and press down lightly.  Sprinkle over with grated Parmigiano.  Place the polpette over the white pasta carefully in a consistent layer and press carefully down.  Sprinkle with Parmigiano.  Place the red pasta over the Polpette and press down gently.  Fold the extra 1 1/2 inches of pasta frolla over the whole thing and press gently.  Cover the open top with foil and place in oven to bake for 35 to 40 minutes.

Remove from oven, remove foil, invert onto a large serving platter and allow to rest 3 minutes.  Carefully loosen the pasta around the base with a knife and knock with knuckles to remove from bowl.  Serve immediately with remaining Parmigiano on the side.  This will be cut like a cake to serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

        Pasta-Stuffed Peppers - {Peperoni Imbotiti Ai Vermicelli}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10       tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  12             large  red and yellow bell peppers
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  angel hair pasta
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  green olives -- pitted
     1/2           cup  black olives -- pitted
  4        tablespoons  capers -- rinsed
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  toasted bread crumbs

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a large bowl, toss 4 tablespoons of the oil and the peppers to coat the peppers.  Roast the peppers over the flame of a burner until blackened all around.  This process takes a little time, but is well worth it.

Meanwhile, make the filling.  In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, place the remaining 6 tablespoons oil and the garlic over medium heat and cook until the garlic is light golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Break the pasta into 2-inch pieces, place in the pan with the garlic and cook, tossing to mix, until pasta is golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add 1 cup water, olives, capers and the oregano and cook until the water has dissipated, about 6 to 7 minutes.  Remove from heat, allow to cool, add parsley and set aside.

Peel and seed the roasted peppers carefully to retain whole and slit down one side to create a hole.  Stuff each of the peppers with some of the pasta mixture and place each carefully into a roasting pan with the wine.  Sprinkle all over with breadcrumbs.  Place in oven and cook until heated through, 20 minutes.  Remove and serve warm, or allow to cool and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     center cut pork chops, 1" thick
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Flour -- for dredging
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  wild fennel seeds, or use regular fennel
                        seeds, and grind 1 tspn in a spice grinder
                        to simulate pollen, plus some to garnish

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Season the pork chops with salt and pepper and dredge them in the flour.

In a 10- to 12-inch skillet, heat the oil until almost smoking.  Add the pork chops and cook 1 minute on each side, until evenly browned.  Sprinkle 1 teaspoon fennel seed on 1 side of the chops.  Turn and sprinkle the remaining teaspoon on the other side.  Add wine and garlic, and place in the oven and cook for 15 minutes, until just cooked through.

Remove the chops to a plate and keep warm.  Over medium heat, cook until liquid is reduced by half.  Add the fennel fronds to the hot liquid and cook 1 minute more, allowing fronds to wilt.  Remove the garlic and pour the wine sauce over the chops, garnishing with the fennel fronds and wild fennel pollen.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  baking potatoes - (abt 16)
  4                     eggs
     1/4           cup  fresh ricotta
  1 1/2           cups  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1                cup  freshly-grated Pecorino
     1/2         pound  soppressata -- cut into 1" batons
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  2        tablespoons  butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cut into small dots
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  1              pound  fresh mozzarella -- cut into tiny cubes,
                        less than a 1/4"

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Fill a pasta pot with water and add the whole potatoes.  Bring the water to a boil and cook until tender, about 45 minutes.  Drain and peel the potatoes and pass them through a food mill.

While the potatoes are still warm, place them in a mixing bowl and combine the eggs, ricotta, cheeses, soppressata, milk and parsley.  Stir just enough to evenly mix.

Butter a 12-inch springform pan with 2 tablespoons of butter and dust with breadcrumbs.  Place half of the potato mixture into the pan and gently smooth it to the edges.  Sprinkle the mozzarella over the potato mixture, to within 1/2 inch of the outer edge, but not over.  Smear the remaining potato mixture over carefully, and smooth with a wet spatula.  Sprinkle with remaining bread crumbs and dot with remaining butter.

Place the gatto in the oven and cook 25 to 30 minutes, until light golden brown on top.  Remove from oven, let stand 15 minutes, unmold and serve in slices.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2         pounds  baking potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  4                     eggs -- separated
     1/4         pound  prosciutto cotto, cooked ham -- cut 1/4" dice
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Several gratings of nutmeg
  1                cup  flour
  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying

Bring 8 quarts of water to a boil.  Cook the potatoes in the boiling water until easily pierced with a paring knife, about 15 minutes.  Drain the potatoes and, while still hot, pass them through a food mill.  Immediately add the egg yolks, prosciutto, butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and nutmeg and mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.

With moist hands, divide the mixture into golf ball-sized portions and form disks of 2-inch diameter.

On three separate plates, place the flour, egg whites and bread crumbs.  Dredge each disk through each of the plates, starting with the flour, then the egg whites, then the bread crumbs.

In a heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the oil until almost smoking.  Cook the disks in the oil, working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan, until disks are deep golden brown.

Remove disks to a plate lined with paper towels and serve.  They can be reheated from room temperature, but should not be refrigerated.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

             Sausage Ready To Mail - {Salsicce In Cartoccio}

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sausage

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  fresh pork shoulder -- run through the
                        largest holes of butcherís grinder
  2             pounds  pancetta -- run through the
                        same grinder
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  4        tablespoons  kosher salt
  4        tablespoons  fennel seeds
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  8                     feet sheep casings - (abt 1/2 lb)
  8                     scallions -- roots trimmed
  2             pounds  fava beans -- shucked and peeled
  4                     hot chilis
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     egg whites -- beaten
                        === MIX TOGETHER ===
  1              bunch  parsley -- chopped
  1              bunch  oregano -- chopped
  1              bunch  chives -- chopped
  1              bunch  thyme -- chopped
                        === EQUIPMENT ===
  4                     sheets parchment

In a mixing bowl, stir together the pork shoulder and pancetta with your hands until well-mixed.  Add pepper, salt, fennel seeds, and white wine and mix until well-blended, again with your hands.  Work quickly so that body temperature does not change the texture of the fat.

Set up the sausage stuffer and place the casing over the funnel feeder.  If you do not have a sausage stuffer, form the sausage into 1/4-pound logs, by hand, and be careful handling them.  Stuff the sausage into the casings, twisting every 3 1/2 to 4 inches so that each sausage is about 4 ounces, and form 22 to 25 sausages.  Prick them all over with a needle and divide into four equal batches.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place each batch of sausage in a single layer in the center of each piece of parchment and fold in half like a book.  Divide the scallions and favas among four packs, place 1 hot chili on top of each and drizzle each with 2 tablespoons oil.

Fold so there are no openings, seal the edges of each packet with the egg whites and place each packet on a sheet tray.  Cook in a pizza oven 30 minutes, remove.  Cut the bag with scissors at the table and sprinkle with the herbs.  Serve in the bag.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a mixing bowl, stir together the pork shoulder and pancetta with your hands until well-mixed.  Add pepper, salt, fennel seeds, and white wine and mix until well-blended, again with your hands.  Work quickly so that body temperature does not change the texture of the fat.

Set up the sausage stuffer and place the casing over the funnel feeder.  If you do not have a sausage stuffer, form the sausage into 1/4-pound logs, by hand, and be careful handling them.  Stuff the sausage into the casings, twisting every 3 1/2 to 4 inches so that each sausage is about 4 ounces, and form 22 to 25 sausages.  Prick them all over with a needle and divide into four equal batches.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place each batch of sausage in a single layer in the center of each piece of parchment and fold in half like a book.  Divide the scallions and favas among four packs, place 1 hot chili on top of each and drizzle each with 2 tablespoons oil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fold so there are no openings, seal the edges of each packet with the egg whites and place each packet on a sheet tray.  Cook in a pizza oven 30 minutes, remove.  Cut the bag with scissors at the table and sprinkle with the herbs.  Serve in the bag.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTA ===
  3 1/2           cups  flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  flour --for work surface
  4                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === FILLING ===
  10       tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  sea bass fillet -- skin and bones
                        removed, and flesh cut into 1/2" cubes
                        (or any flavorful, firm fish such as sole,
                        halibut, or grouper)
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh marjoram leaves -- plus
  3        tablespoons  whole fresh marjoram leaves
  1              large  Idaho potato -- boiled, peeled,
                        and mashed
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)

To make the pasta:  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any leftover crusty bits.  Discard these bits.  Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead it for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

While the dough rests, in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the oil until smoking.  Add the garlic and cook until light golden brown, about 1 minute.  Add the fish pieces and saute, stirring constantly, 8 to 9 minutes, until the fish is just cooked through.  Remove fish to a mixing bowl and allow to cool.

To the mixing bowl, add the 3 tablespoons chopped marjoram, mashed potato and remaining 6 tablespoons oil and stir to mix well, being certain to break up all of the fish.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.

Roll out pasta to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine and place on a lightly floured surface.

If you have a ravioli-cutting rolling pin, cover the layer of pasta with a 1/4-inch thick layer of the sea bass mixture.  Place an equal sheet of pasta over and press down lightly with your hands.  Carefully roll the 2 sheets together with the roller to form the ravioli.  Using a pastry cutter, cut the ravioli apart by running down between the ravioli.

If you do not have a ravioli-cutting rolling pin, then cut a single sheet of pasta at a time into rectangles 2- by 1-inch.  Place 1 teaspoon of the fish mixture into the center of each rectangle and fold the pasta down like a piece of notebook paper and seal to form a 1-inch square.  Repeat until all ingredients have been used.

Bring 8 quarts of water to boil and add 3 tablespoons salt.  Drop the ravioli in and cook 6 to 7 minutes, until tender and fully cooked.

Meanwhile, in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, combine Basic Tomato Sauce and marjoram leaves and place over heat.  Drain the ravioli, reserving cooking water, and add ravioli to the pan with tomato sauce.  Toss the pasta to dress it with the sauce, adjust the moisture of the sauce with pasta water, if necessary, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.   Score the snapper twice on each side with a sharp knife.  Dredge the fish in the flour.

In a 14- to 16-inch saute pan, heat the oil until just smoking and saute the whole fish until it is golden brown on 1 side.  Turn the fish carefully and add the olives, capers, lemon segments, zest, juice and wine and place the pan in the oven to cook for about 14 to 15 minutes.

Allow the fish to rest for 5 minutes before filleting, then drizzle it with the pan juices and high-quality oil, sprinkle with parsley and sea salt, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1 1/2           cups  walnut pieces -- plus
  1                cup  walnut halves

     1/2           cup  maraschino liqueur
  2               cups  heavy cream

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Butter a 10-inch tart pan and set aside.

Toast the walnut pieces on a cookie sheet in the oven for 15 minutes, remove and chop roughly.  Toast the walnut halves the same way, but leave whole and set aside.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  red chili flakes
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  6                     garlic cloves -- crushed and minced
                        Salt -- to taste
  1              pound  spaghetti

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the olive oil.  Add the chili flakes and bring oil almost to a simmer.  Add the fennel seed, oregano and garlic and remove the pan from the heat.  The garlic should color slightly but not get too dark, to ensure that the sauce is not bitter.

Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water according to the package directions, until tender but al dente.  Drain the pasta and place it in a large, warmed bowl.  Pour the oil over the pasta and toss to coat.  Divide among four individual bowls and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  red onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  ground pork shoulder
     1/2         pound  lean ground beef
  2               cans  tomato paste
  1                cup  red wine
  1                can  peeled San Marzano tomatoes - (28 oz) -- crushed by hand
  2             medium  artichokes -- trimmed, choke
                        removed, and quartered
  10                    mint leaves
  1           teaspoon  hot chili flakes
  2               cups  oil
  1              pound  bucatini
     1/4         pound  fresh ricotta

In a 14- to 16-inch saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons olive oil until just smoking.  Add the onion and garlic and saute until soft and golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.  Add the pork and beef cook until meat is beyond gray and beginning to brown in its own fat, about 20 minutes.  Add the tomato paste and cook for 12 to 15 minutes.  Add the wine and the tomatoes, reduce heat to a low simmer and cook for 1 hour.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, combine the artichokes, mint leaves and chili flakes and 2 cups oil.  Bring the oil to a boil and turn off the heat, allowing the artichokes to cool in the oil.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop the bucatini in the boiling water and cook according to package directions, until tender yet al dente.

Meanwhile, drain the artichokes from the oil and add to the pan with the ragu.  When the pasta is ready, drain it and add it to the ragu and the artichokes.  Toss over high heat 1 minute, until pasta is dressed with sauce.

Divide among 4 warmed pasta bowls and serve each with 1/4 of the ricotta in the center of the portion.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  red onion -- cut into 1/4" dice
  2             pounds  perciatelli or bucatini
  6                     eggs
  1                cup  freshly-grated cacio cheese
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring 8 quarts of water to a boil and add 3 tablespoons salt.

In a 14- to 16-inch frying pan, heat the oil over medium heat until smoking.  Add the onion and cook 7 to 9 minutes, until soft and light golden brown.  Remove from heat.

Drop the perciatelli into the boiling water and gently stir to separate.  Cook until just short of al dente, following package instructions, and drain in a colander, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water before draining.

Pour the perciatelli into the frying pan with the onion and 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta cooking water and place over medium heat, adding more pasta water if necessary.

Beat the eggs in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper.  Add eggs and cacio cheese to pan with the pasta and gently mix thoroughly.  Watch carefully, as the eggs will start to solidify after about 1 minute.  They should start to solidify, but not scramble.  When they start, remove from heat and add the Parmigiano.  Pour into a warmed bowl, top with pepper and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings, as a first course.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fryer chicken - (2 1/2 to 3 lbs) -- including liver
                        and giblets
  10       tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  2              large  leeks -- cut into 1" pieces
  1              pound  salami -- diced
     1/4           cup  grated caciocavallo
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  white wine
  3        tablespoons  dried currants
  3        tablespoons  pine nuts

Season the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the oil until almost smoking.  Add the leeks, liver, and giblets and cook 10 to12 minutes.  Remove the leeks and liver to a medium bowl and giblets to a cutting board, chop giblets and add them to the bowl.  Add the salami and the cheese, mix well, season with salt and pepper, and stuff the bird with the mixture.

Cut a length of butcherís twine 18 inches long.  Secure the wings and legs with the twine and tie the legs together, to seal in the stuffing.

In a Dutch oven, heat the remaining oil over high heat until just smoking.  Place the chicken in the pan and brown all sides well, a process that takes about 10 minutes.

Add the wine, currants and pine nuts and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to an active simmer, adding wine when necessary, for 1 hour, turning carefully every 15 minutes.  Remove, carefully cut off the string, and carve the chicken into portions.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast -- plus
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  2               cups  warm water
  1              pinch  sugar
     2/3           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
  1           teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  milk
  7               cups  flour
     1/2           cup  fine cornmeal
  10            ounces  buffalo milk mozzarella -- cut into 1/4" cubes
  1                cup  freshly-grated pecorino
  3             ounces  prosciutto -- finely shredded
  2             ounces  sun-dried tomatoes -- finely shredded
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              quart  olive oil -- for frying

Place the warm water and sugar in a small bowl, add the yeast and allow to soften for 15 minutes, until it has dissolved and is foaming.  In a separate small bowl, combine 2/3 cup olive oil, 1 tablespoon of salt and the milk.

In a large bowl, combine the flour and cornmeal and add the yeast mixture and the olive oil mixture, stirring a few times with a wooden spoon to form a rough amalgam.  Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured board and knead for 6 to 8 minutes, until it is smooth and resilient.

Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap.  Set aside in a warm place to rise for 35 to 40 minutes, until it has doubled in bulk.

Divide the dough into 2 equal portions and, with a well-seasoned rolling pin, quickly roll the first half out to 1/4-inch thickness.  Using a 5-inch biscuit cutter, cut rounds from the dough and place on a sheet tray.  You may combine the scraps and re-roll the dough once.  Repeat the process with the other half of the dough, until all is used up.  This should yield 10 disks.  Cover the disks lightly with parchment or a clean cloth and allow to rest for 10 minutes.

Divide the mozzarella into 10 equal portions and place a portion on one half of each disk, half-moon style.  Add pecorino, prosciutto and tomatoes to each mound of mozzarella.  Season with pepper and fold the disks in half to form half-moons.  Press the edges with your finger to seal them well.  Cover again with parchment or a clean cloth.

Preheat the oven to 150 degrees.

In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan that will hold liquid at a depth of at least 5 inches, heat the olive oil until almost smoking.  Add 3 or 4 of the pastries at a time and cook until browned, turning gently with tongs or a wooden spoon to ensure even browning on both sides.

As the panzarotti finish cooking, remove them to a tray lined with paper towels, and hold them in the oven until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 5 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  red onions
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
     3/4         pound  ground beef chuck
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated caciocavallo
  4        tablespoons  fresh marjoram leaves
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  1 1/4           cups  fresh bread crumbs -- divided

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Carefully cut the onions exactly in half across the equator, remove the peel and slice a small amount from the point end, so that the halves will stand upright on the point end.  Place the halves upright on a cookie sheet, season with salt and pepper and drizzle with 4 tablespoons of the oil.  Bake until just softened, about 15 minutes.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the ground beef over high heat and cook until browning in its own fat.  Remove to a bowl and add the caciocavallo, marjoram, red wine and 3/4 cup of the bread crumbs.  Stir to mix well and season with salt and pepper.

Stuff each of the onion halves carefully with the mixture, to just over the edge, and sprinkle with the remaining bread crumbs.  Place the onions in a well-oiled glass brownie pan, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and place in the oven.  Cook 20 to 25 minutes, until dark golden brown on top, and serve.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10       tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
     1/2         pound  veal kidneys
  2               cups  fresh bread crumbs
     3/4           cup  chopped Italian parsley leaves -- divided
     1/2           cup  pecorino
  2                     eggs
                        Several gratings nutmeg
  4                     beef short ribs -- boned, and
                        cut in half, with a 1" pocket cut
                        into each piece of meat
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             medium  red onion -- cut into 1/4" dice
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  1                cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  penne

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the oil until smoking.  Saute the kidneys in the oil until browned, about 5 minutes.  Cut them into 1/4-inch pieces, place in a medium bowl and allow to cool.

To the bowl with the kidneys, add the bread crumbs, 1/2 cup of the parsley, pecorino, eggs and nutmeg, and mix lightly.  Stuff this mixture into the pocket of each short rib and tie the opening closed with butcherís twine.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the remaining oil until smoking, season the meat with salt and pepper, and brown on all sides in the oil, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan.  Remove the ribs from the pan and set aside.

Add the onion, remaining 1/4 cup parsley and oregano to the same pan and cook 8 to 10 minutes, until the onion is soft and golden brown.  Add the wine and Basic Tomato Sauce and bring to a boil.  Return the meat to the pan, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 2 hours, checking for evaporation every 15 minutes and adjusting with more wine and sauce as necessary.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the penne in the boiling water according to package directions, until tender yet al dente.

When the meat is fork-tender, remove from the sauce and set aside.  Add the cooked penne to the sauce, toss over high heat 1 minute to coat, and serve.  Serve the meat as a second course.

This recipe yields 4 servings pasta, 4 servings meat.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the oil until smoking.  Saute the kidneys in the oil until browned, about 5 minutes.  Cut them into 1/4-inch pieces, place in a medium bowl and allow to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To the bowl with the kidneys, add the bread crumbs, 1/2 cup of the parsley, pecorino, eggs and nutmeg, and mix lightly.  Stuff this mixture into the pocket of each short rib and tie the opening closed with butcherís twine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the remaining oil until smoking, season the meat with salt and pepper, and brown on all sides in the oil, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan.  Remove the ribs from the pan and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the onion, remaining 1/4 cup parsley and oregano to the same pan and cook 8 to 10 minutes, until the onion is soft and golden brown.  Add the wine and Basic Tomato Sauce and bring to a boil.  Return the meat to the pan, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 2 hours, checking for evaporation every 15 minutes and adjusting with more wine and sauce as necessary.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the penne in the boiling water according to package directions, until tender yet al dente.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the meat is fork-tender, remove from the sauce and set aside.  Add the cooked penne to the sauce, toss over high heat 1 minute to coat, and serve.  Serve the meat as a second course.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings pasta, 4 servings meat.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  baking potatoes
  2               cans  tuna in olive oil
  1                cup  fresh ricotta
  1              bunch  fresh marjoram
                        Salt -- to taste

  3                     eggs -- separated
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
  1                cup  flour
  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs

In a large pasta pot, bring 8 quarts of water to a boil.  Add the potatoes and cook until easily pierced with the point of a paring knife, about 25 minutes.

Drain, peel, and, while still warm, pass potatoes through a food mill.  Place in a large bowl and immediately add the tuna, ricotta, marjoram, and salt and pepper to taste.  Add the egg yolks and mix well to combine.  Using tablespoons, form the mixture into golf-ball sized balls and set on a sheet tray.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the oil until almost smoking.  While the oil heats, place the flour on a plate, egg whites in a shallow bowl and the bread crumbs on a plate.

Dredge the balls first in the flour, then the egg whites, then the bread crumbs and fry in the olive oil until golden brown on all sides.  Remove balls from pan with a slotted spoon and let drain on a plate lined with paper towels.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     Spanish onion -- cut into 1/4" dice
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)

  1              pound  fresh mozzarella
  8                     fresh basil leaves

Preheat broiler to 500 degrees.

  3             ounces  prosciutto -- cut into 1/8" dice
     1/3           cup  coarsely-chopped Italian parsley leaves
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed

  1              pound  veal loin -- cut into
                        four 3/4" thick slices
                        Salt -- to taste

  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme
     1/2         pound  wild mushrooms -- thinly sliced
                        (such as chanterelles, or crimini)
  4        tablespoons  pine nuts
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh marjoram leaves only
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated pecorino
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  2                     lemons -- zested and juiced

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Using a meat mallet, pound the veal pieces until they are 1/8-inch thick.  Season with the salt and pepper and set aside.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat  4 tablespoons of the oil until just smoking.  Add the onion, garlic and thyme and cook over medium heat until light golden brown.  Add the mushrooms and cook until soft and liquid has cooked out, about 10 minutes.  Remove to a bowl and allow to cool, saving the pan on the stove.

Add the pine nuts, marjoram, half of the parsley, pecorino and eggs and stir to mix well.  Add the wine and Basic Tomato Sauce to pan, add the lemon juice and zest and stir to mix.  Set aside.

Lay the 4 veal pieces out and divide the pine nut mixture among them.  Roll and tie them individually and place in the pan with the sauce. Place the pan in the oven and bake 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove, snip the strings off the veal pieces and place in the center of the platter.  Finish the sauce with the remaining olive oil and parsley, spoon the sauce over the meat and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

           Zucchini And Ricotta Tarts - {Sfogliata Di Formaggi}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
     1/3           cup  warm water
  2 1/2           cups  tepid water
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  milk
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  semolina flour
  4                     scallions -- thinly sliced
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced almonds
  1           teaspoon  chili flakes
  4             medium  zucchinis -- sliced 1/8" rounds
     1/2           cup  fresh ricotta

In a large bowl, combine the yeast and the warm water and set aside for 15 minutes, until yeast dissolves and foams.

In a medium bowl, mix the tepid water, 1/4 cup oil, the milk, and the salt.

In a medium bowl, combine the all-purpose and the semolina flour and add them to the yeast mixture, along with the liquid mixture.  With a wooden spoon, combine the ingredients to form the beginnings of a dough.  Turn out onto a lightly-floured board and knead by hand until the dough is smooth and elastic, at least 8 minutes.  Place the dough in a lightly-oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.

Meanwhile, make the filling.  In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the remaining oil until smoking.  Add the scallions, garlic and almonds and saute 2 to 3 minutes, until light golden brown.  Add the chili flakes and zucchini and cook until the zucchini is very soft, about 10 to 12 minutes, stirring regularly.  Cut the dough into 8 pieces and stretch each piece into an 8-inch round, which need not be perfectly round.

Place a clean pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Divide zucchini mixture evenly among the 8 rounds of dough, distributing it evenly, and dab a little ricotta on each one.  Bake until light golden brown, about 14 to 16 minutes, and serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place the zucchini on a baking sheet, cut-side down.  Arrange the garlic cloves around the zucchini, drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Roast in the oven 40 minutes, until zucchini are blackened in some spots and garlic is golden brown.  Allow to cool and remove skins from garlic cloves.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the zucchini, garlic, Parmigiano-Reggiano, lemon juice, zest and heavy cream and process until smooth.  Add the basil, process for 15 seconds and remove to a chilled bowl.  Refrigerate 30 minutes.
