  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter -- softened
  1 1/2         pounds  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  toasted pecan pieces
  12            ounces  white chocolate -- chopped

Lightly butter a 10- by 12-inch baking sheet, or casserole dish and set aside.

In the top of a double boiler, or in a metal bowl set over a pot of boiling water, melt the semisweet chocolate, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula.  Add the toasted pecans and stir well.  Pour the chocolate into the buttered dish, smoothing the top with a rubber spatula.

Melt the white chocolate in the top of a double-boiler, stirring occasionally.  Spoon melted white chocolate on top of melted semisweet chocolate, then run a knife back and forth to create a random "marbled" effect.

When chocolate is cooled and has hardened, cut or break into pieces of desired size.

This recipe yields 2 1/4 pounds marbled chocolate bars.

                 Almond Tuile Cups With Raspberry Sorbet

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Sorbets/Ices


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ALMOND TUILE CUPS ===
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  3              large  egg whites
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/2           cup  sliced blanched almonds -- toasted
                        === RASPBERRY SORBET ===
  2               cups  water
  2               cups  sugar
  4 1/2           cups  fresh raspberries - (abt 18 oz)
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice

For the Almond Tuile Cups:  Preheat oven to 350 degree and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

Invert 12 ramekins or tea cups on the counter.  In a bowl whisk together the flour, sugar and salt.  Whisk in the whites, butter, and almond extract until well combined.  Let the batter sit at room temperature for 45 minutes.

Drop rounded tablespoons of batter about 6 inches apart onto the baking sheet.  Spread the batter with the back of a spoon into 5-inch rounds.  Sprinkle each round with sliced almonds and bake in middle of oven until golden, about 5 to 8 minutes.

With a thin spatula, quickly remove the cookies 1 at a time from the baking sheet and drape on top of a ramekin to create a cup shape.  (If the cookies become too brittle, replace on the baking sheet and place in the oven for 10 seconds to soften.)  Cool the tuiles completely on the ramekins, then gently lift off and transfer to a platter until ready to use.

For the Raspberry Sorbet:  To make a simple syrup, in a heavy saucepan combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.  Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until completely chilled, about 3 hours.

Measure 3 cups of the syrup, saving the rest for another use.  Divide the 3 cups of syrup, raspberries, and lemon juice into 2 equal portions.  In a food processor process each batch on high speed until smooth.  Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean bowl and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.

Pour the raspberry mixture into an ice cream machine and churn according to the manufacturer's directions.  Put the sorbet into a plastic container and store in the freezer until needed.  (Makes 1 quart)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

For the Almond Tuile Cups:  Preheat oven to 350 degree and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Invert 12 ramekins or tea cups on the counter.  In a bowl whisk together the flour, sugar and salt.  Whisk in the whites, butter, and almond extract until well combined.  Let the batter sit at room temperature for 45 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drop rounded tablespoons of batter about 6 inches apart onto the baking sheet.  Spread the batter with the back of a spoon into 5-inch rounds.  Sprinkle each round with sliced almonds and bake in middle of oven until golden, about 5 to 8 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With a thin spatula, quickly remove the cookies 1 at a time from the baking sheet and drape on top of a ramekin to create a cup shape.  (If the cookies become too brittle, replace on the baking sheet and place in the oven for 10 seconds to soften.)  Cool the tuiles completely on the ramekins, then gently lift off and transfer to a platter until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Raspberry Sorbet:  To make a simple syrup, in a heavy saucepan combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.  Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until completely chilled, about 3 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Measure 3 cups of the syrup, saving the rest for another use.  Divide the 3 cups of syrup, raspberries, and lemon juice into 2 equal portions.  In a food processor process each batch on high speed until smooth.  Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean bowl and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the raspberry mixture into an ice cream machine and churn according to the manufacturer&apos;s directions.  Put the sorbet into a plastic container and store in the freezer until needed.  (Makes 1 quart)

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  crËme fr‚iche
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice -- plus
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh tarragon
  8              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  herbes de Provence
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8             ounces  jumbo lump crabmeat -- picked over
                        for cartilage
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3                     artichoke hearts -- trimmed. and
                        thinly sliced
  8             ounces  Saint Andre cheese -- rind removed,
                        and sliced thinly
                        = (or other triple-crËme cheese)
  2             ounces  sevruga or osetra caviar
  8             slices  toasted brioche

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.

In a small bowl whisk together the crËme fr‚iche with 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon of the tarragon, and a pinch of salt.  Set aside.

In a bowl or large measuring cup, beat the eggs with the herbes de Provence, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper.

In a small bowl, combine the crabmeat with 1 teaspoon of the lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of the tarragon, the parsley, and a pinch of salt.

In a small skillet, melt 1 1/2 teaspoons of the butter over medium-high heat.  Add 1/4 of the eggs (about 1/2 cup) to the skillet, and tilt the pan to completely coat the bottom of the pan.

Arrange a layer of artichoke heart slices down the center of the omelet, topped by the sliced cheese and crabmeat.  With a rubber spatula, fold the omelet over the filling and gently slide onto a serving plate.  Place the plate in the warmed oven while making omelets with the remaining ingredients.

Drizzle 1/4 cup of the lemon crËme fr‚iche over each omelet and top each with 1/2 ounce of caviar.  Serve immediately with toasted brioche.

     1/4           cup  bourbon
     1/4           cup  rum
                        === CARAMEL SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  6        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  chopped toasted pecans
                        === CRISPY PLANTAIN CHIPS ===
  1           teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  ground cinnamon
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying
  2                     green plantains -- sliced as thin
                        as possible on a mandoline

In a saucepan combine heavy cream and milk with vanilla bean and bring to a simmer.  In a bowl whisk egg yolks with sugar until smooth.  Ladle a small amount of the hot cream mixture into the beaten yolks and whisk to combine.  Add a few more ladlefuls of hot cream into egg-cream mixture and mix well.

Return egg-cream mixture to the remaining hot cream in pot and continue to cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon.  Do not allow to boil.

Immediately transfer custard to a clean bowl and place in an ice bath.  Stir until cool, then refrigerate until thoroughly chilled before processing.

While custard is chilling, melt butter in a sautÈ pan and add brown sugar.  Add banana pieces, cinnamon and nutmeg and cook, stirring, until bananas have softened and caramelized.  Remove pan from heat and add bourbon and rum (away from flame), return to heat and continue to cook until liquid has evaporated.  Transfer banana mixture to a small bowl and refrigerate until cool.

When custard is cold, process in an ice cream machine according to manufacturerís instructions.  Add bananas near end of processing time.

Serve with Caramel Sauce and Crispy Plantain Chips as a garnish.  (Makes about 1 quart ice cream)

Caramel Sauce: In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the brown sugar, butter and heavy cream and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat slightly and continue to cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until thickened and coats the back of a spoon.  Stir in pecans and keep warm until ready to serve with Banana Ice Cream and Crispy Plantain Chips.

Crispy Plantain Chips:  In a deep fryer or large saucepan heat vegetable oil to 350 degrees.  Fry plantain strips in batches until slightly golden, about 1 1/2 to 2  minutes.  Remove to paper towels to drain.  Sprinkle immediately with spiced sugar and serve as a garnish alongside Banana Ice Cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  chopped shallots
  1                cup  Champagne
  1                     vanilla bean -- halved lengthwise
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" pieces
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  Champagne vinegar

In a saucepan, combine the shallots and Champagne.  Scrape the vanilla seeds from the split pod into the pan and add the vanilla pod halves.  Bring to a boil and cook until almost all liquid evaporates, about 6 minutes.

Add the heavy cream, bring to a boil and simmer until cream thickens and coats the back of a spoon, and is reduced by nearly 50 percent in volume, about 3 minutes.

Whisk in the butter until smooth and strain the sauce through a fine mesh strainer, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible.  Season, to taste, with salt, pepper, and vinegar and serve immediately over fish or shellfish.

Note:  If sauce is made in advance, keep warm in a bain marie over barely simmering water.

This recipe yields about 1 generous cup, 4 servings.

For the masa:  In the bowl of a food processor, process the grits for 1 minute.  In a small saucepan bring 1 1/4 cups of the chicken stock to a low boil.  Transfer the grits to a bowl and add the hot chicken stock.  Let stand uncovered for 10 to 12 minutes.  Add the masa harina and cumin, and mix until evenly combined.  Cool to room temperature before proceeding.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whip the lard until smooth, light and creamy, about 2 minutes.  Stir in half of the masa mixture and whip until well-blended.  Add remaining masa mixture, little by little, until mixture resembles a thick cake batter, adding chicken stock if needed.  Add the baking powder and add salt, to taste, and whip for 1 to 2 minutes until well incorporated and smooth.

Lay 1 cornhusk on a work surface with the narrow end closest to you.  Top with a second corn husk so that the fat ends are in the middle and narrow ends out.  Spoon 1/4 cup of the masa batter into the center where the husks join and with the back of a spoon, spread it into a 4-inch square.  Place about 1 generous tablespoon each of the chicken, grated cheese and chopped poblano in the center of the masa square.

Fold 1 side of the cornhusk over the filling, pulling it tight and tucking it under the filling.  Fold the other side over the filling, and then the top and bottom ends.  With a piece of kitchen string or a thin strip of leftover corn husk, tie the tamale together loosely so that it resembles an oblong rectangular package.  Repeat with the remaining corn husks and filling.

Once the tamales are assembled, line a steamer basket with any remaining cornhusks and layer the tamales inside the steamer basket, leaving enough room for the tamales to expand slightly while cooking.  Cover tamales with another remaining cornhusk, cover steamer with a tight fitting lid and steam for 1 1/2 hours, or until tender and tamale easily pulls away from cornhusk.  Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields approximately 18 tamales, serving 4 to 6 people.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  lean ground beef
  1                cup  finely-chopped yellow onion
     1/4           cup  finely-sliced leek
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped peeled carrots
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh thyme -- (stems and leaves)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh tarragon -- (stems and leaves)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley -- (stems and leaves)
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, smashed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8              large  egg whites -- lightly beaten
  8               cups  chicken stock -- defatted
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISHES ===
                        Sour cream
                        Chopped chives
                        Lemon slices
                        Toast points
                        Diced seeded tomato and
                        finely-shredded basil leaves
                        Thinly sliced mushrooms and
                        minced fresh parsley or chervil
                        Small, thin bread rounds topped with
                        finely shredded Parmesan and toasted
                        Diced carrots and fresh peas
                        Finely-shredded savory crepes
                        Lettuce/chervil chiffonade
                        Shredded leeks lightly sauteed in butter

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the ground meat with the onions, leeks, celery, carrots, thyme, tarragon, parsley, garlic, and black pepper.  Puree on high speed.

In a bowl, combine the egg whites with the pureed meat mixture.  Stir well to blend.

Place the stock in a large pot and add the "raft" (the pureed meat-egg white mixture).  Bring to a boil, stirring constantly to prevent the raft from sticking to the bottom and sides of the pot.  (Once the stock has come to a boil, do not stir again.)  Reduce to a simmer and puncture a hole in the center of the raft for the stock to circulate through and clarify.  Simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Gently poke a hole in the raft large enough to fit a ladle.  With a ladle, gently scoop out the consomme into a clean pot or bowl.  Strain through a layer of cheesecloth to finish clarifying.

Serve hot with desired garnish.  (Alternatively, transfer consomme to a shallow bowl or roasting pan and cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, covering with plastic wrap only when the consomme is cool enough that no condensation forms on the plastic.  When the consomme is completely cooled, cut it into 1/2-inch cubes and divide between consomme cups.  Garnish with sour cream, chopped chives, and a lemon slice and serve with toast points.)

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

             Chilled Roasted Beet And Fennel Soup With Crema

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  medium beets -- stems removed
  1                     fennel bulb - (abt 3/4 lb) -- core and stems
                        removed and quartered
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  thinly-sliced yellow onion
     1/4           cup  small-diced carrot
     1/4           cup  small-diced celery
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  6               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-sodium chicken broth)
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  3        tablespoons  apple sauce
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh mint
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh sage
     1/4           cup  crushed toasted pistachios

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a bowl, place the beets, fennel, 2 tablespoons of the oil, salt, and pepper, and toss to combine.  Spread the vegetables on a baking sheet and roast until caramelized, about 1 hour.

Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.  When cool enough to handle, peel beets and cut into 1/2-inch cubes.

In a medium, heavy pot, heat the remaining oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and sautÈ until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the carrots and celery, and sautÈ until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and sautÈ for 30 seconds.  Add the fennel, beets and stock, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

With a hand-held immersion blender, or in batches in a food processor or blender, puree the soup.  Refrigerate the puree until cool, at least 2 hours.

In a small bowl combine the sour cream, apple sauce, mint, and sage and stir to combine.

Ladle the chilled soup into serving bowls, top with a dollop of Apple-Sage-Mint Crema and some of the crushed pistachios, and serve.

This recipe yields about 6 cups (4 to 6 servings).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             ounces  condensed milk
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1            package  sweetened flaked coconut - (14 oz)
  3               cups  semisweet chocolate chips

In a large bowl, combine the condensed milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract.  Stir well until thoroughly incorporated and smooth.  Add the coconut and stir well to combine.

With a tablespoon, scoop out portions of the candy mixture onto a baking sheet.  With wet hands roll the candies into rounds.  Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.

In the top of a double boiler or metal bowl set over a pot of simmering water, melt the chocolate chips.  Pour the chocolate into a shallow bowl and, using 2 forks or toothpicks, dip the coconut balls into the chocolate and roll to coat completely.  Shake off the excess, and place on a rack set over a baking sheet covered with waxed paper.  Repeat with the remaining candies and let air dry, or refrigerate to harden.

This recipe yields about 48 pieces.

                  Cream Of Porcini Soup With Quail Eggs

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  dried porcinis
     1/2           cup  Madeira or wine
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2                     onions -- chopped
  1                     leek, white and light green parts only -- thinly sliced
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  button mushrooms or cremini
  3        tablespoons  flour
  6               cups  chicken or vegetable stock - (to 8)
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  6                     hard-boiled quail eggs -- halved

In a small saucepan, combine dried porcinis with Madeira, and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and allow to sit for 20 minutes, or until mushrooms are very soft and liquid is flavorful.  Strain mushrooms and broth through a fine sieve or coffee filter and reserve liquid.  Rinse mushroom pieces under running water to remove any residual dirt or sand, then roughly chop porcinis and reserve.

In a soup pot or saucepan heat butter and saute onions, leek and garlic until vegetables are soft and lightly caramelized, about 6 minutes.  Add mushrooms and continue to cook until they have released their liquid and most liquid has evaporated, about 4 minutes.

Sprinkle flour over mushrooms and vegetables, stir to mix well and cook for 2 minutes.  Add reserved porcini liquid, chicken stock, thyme, and reserved porcinis and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes.  Add heavy cream and cook for 15 minutes.

In a blender puree the soup in batches and return the pureed soup to the pot to keep warm until ready to serve.  Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary, and serve in bowls, each bowl garnished with 1 halved quail egg.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  linguica -- removed from casing,
                        and chopped
     1/2           cup  minced yellow onions
     1/4           cup  minced green bell pepper
     1/3           cup  sliced green onions
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  8               cups  day-old French bread in 1" cubes
  2 1/2           cups  milk
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  melted butter
  8              large  eggs -- beaten
     1/2         pound  pepper jack -- grated
     1/2         pound  monterey jack -- grated

     3/4           cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Add the green onions and stir well.  Add the white wine and reduce slightly, stirring, about 1 minute over high heat.  Remove from the heat.

Place the bread in a large mixing bowl.  Add the milk and cream and stir well.  Let sit for 5 minutes.

Add the sausage mixture to the bread mixture.  Add the eggs, grated cheeses, salt, black pepper and cayenne, and quickly fold mixture together.  Place mixture in casserole.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 1 hour.  Uncover and bake for 15 minutes.

Remove the casserole from the oven and increase the temperature to 375 degrees.  Spread the sour cream evenly over the top and cover with grated Parmesan.  Bake uncovered for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the casserole is lightly browned on top.

Serve hot.

     1/2           cup  drained green olives with pimientos -- halved
     1/2           cup  tomato sauce
     1/4           cup  raisins
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cider vinegar
  6                     semi-ripe plantains
                        = (yellow with some spots)
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2                     eggs
  3        tablespoons  water
     1/2           cup  grated parmesan cheese

For the filling:  Heat a large skillet over medium high heat, add beef and cook, stirring and breaking up clumps, until no pink remains, about 5 minutes.  Add onion, chopped red and green bell peppers, salt, pepper, bay leaves and achiote and cook until vegetables are softened and meat is browned, 6 to 8 minutes.

Add tomatoes and reserved juice, olives, tomato sauce, raisins and vinegar and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is flavorful and most liquid has evaporated, about 35 minutes.  Transfer filling to a bowl to cool and set aside while you prepare the plantains.

Peel plantains and cut diagonally into 1/3-inch slices.  In a large skillet heat 1/4 cup of the oil over medium high heat and sautÈ plantains in batches until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side, adding remaining oil as needed.  Transfer cooked plantains to paper towels to drain.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil a 3 quart baking dish or casserole.

In a small bowl, whisk eggs and water until blended.  Pour half of egg-water mixture into baking dish and layer bottom and sides of dish with 1/3 of the plantains.  Spread half of the beef filling over the plantains and sprinkle with half of the parmesan cheese.  Top with half of the remaining plantains and then spread remaining beef filling, topping with remaining parmesan, and ending with remaining plantains.  Pour remaining egg-water mixture over top of pie, tilting to distribute evenly.

Cover baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in middle of oven until hot throughout and bubbly around edges, about 1 hour.  Cool for 10 minutes before serving pie.  (Pie can be inverted onto a serving platter for a nice presentation.)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     free range chicken - (3 1/2 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  finely- chopped rosemary (reserve stems)
     1/3           cup  roast garlic puree -- (see below)
                        === ROAST GARLIC PUREE ===
  10                    garlic heads - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Rinse the chicken well inside and out and pat dry with paper towels.  Rub chicken all over with olive oil, and season, inside and out, with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle rosemary all over chicken (place stems inside cavity) and roast in the oven for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, until chicken is almost cooked through.  Remove chicken from the oven and schmear Roast Garlic Puree all over outside of chicken and return to the oven for 15 minutes, until chicken is cooked through.

Roast Garlic Puree:  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.

Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.  Squeeze a head of garlic, gently pressing with your fingers to expel the cloves into a bowl.  Repeat with the remaining garlic.  Stir the garlic with a rubber spatula to blend thoroughly.  Use as needed, or store refrigerated in an airtight container.  (Makes 1 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments: Garlic puree can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.  Mix with olive oil to extend the life of the puree.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Basic Pizza Dough -- (see below)
  2               cups  crushed tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     2/3           cup  kalamata olives -- pitted, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/2         pound  mozzarella -- cut 1/2" cubes, plus
     1/2         pound  mozzarella -- sliced
     1/2         pound  ricotta
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
  1                cup  cooked sausage pieces
                        = (such as chorizo or Italian sausage)
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil
                        === BASIC PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  2 1/2           cups  flour - (to 3) -- plus more if necessa
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat oven to 500 degrees and if you have one, place a pizza stone on the bottom rack of the oven.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine tomatoes, olive oil, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Process until smooth and transfer half of the sauce to a small bowl and set aside.  Divide remaining sauce between 4 calzones, spreading the sauce on one half of the dough.

In a small bowl, combine olives, mozzarella cubes, ricotta, Parmesan, sausage, and chopped basil and mix well.  Divide mixture between the 4 calzones, placing cheese mixture on top of tomato sauce.  Fold untopped half of dough over filling, pressing edges together with the tines of a fork.

Cut a slit in the top of each calzone and transfer calzones to a preheated baking stone in a preheated oven and cook for 8 minutes, or until golden brown and cheese is bubbly on top.  Remove from the oven with a metal peel or spatula and serve immediately.

Basic Pizza Dough:  In a small bowl, combine yeast with water, olive oil, salt and stir well to proof.  After 5 minutes, transfer to the bowl of a food processor along with flour, salt, and olive oil and process until the dough forms a ball.  The dough should be soft but not sticky.  If it is too sticky, add a bit more flour and process for another minute.

Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead dough for 2 to 3 minutes, adding enough additional flour if necessary to form a smooth and elastic dough.  Dough should not be sticky.  Transfer dough to a lightly oiled 2- or 3-quart bowl and turn to coat dough with oil.  Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, usually at least 1 hour.

For calzones, divide the dough into 4 equal portions and form into 4 balls.  Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover with a damp towel.  Let rest for 15 minutes, then transfer to a lightly floured surface and roll out into 4 (6-inch) circles.

This recipe yields 4 calzones.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine tomatoes, olive oil, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Process until smooth and transfer half of the sauce to a small bowl and set aside.  Divide remaining sauce between 4 calzones, spreading the sauce on one half of the dough.

In a small bowl, combine olives, mozzarella cubes, ricotta, Parmesan, sausage, and chopped basil and mix well.  Divide mixture between the 4 calzones, placing cheese mixture on top of tomato sauce.  Fold untopped half of dough over filling, pressing edges together with the tines of a fork.

Cut a slit in the top of each calzone and transfer calzones to a preheated baking stone in a preheated oven and cook for 8 minutes, or until golden brown and cheese is bubbly on top.  Remove from the oven with a metal peel or spatula and serve immediately.

Basic Pizza Dough:  In a small bowl, combine yeast with water, olive oil, salt and stir well to proof.  After 5 minutes, transfer to the bowl of a food processor along with flour, salt, and olive oil and process until the dough forms a ball.  The dough should be soft but not sticky.  If it is too sticky, add a bit more flour and process for another minute.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead dough for 2 to 3 minutes, adding enough additional flour if necessary to form a smooth and elastic dough.  Dough should not be sticky.  Transfer dough to a lightly oiled 2- or 3-quart bowl and turn to coat dough with oil.  Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, usually at least 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For calzones, divide the dough into 4 equal portions and form into 4 balls.  Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover with a damp towel.  Let rest for 15 minutes, then transfer to a lightly floured surface and roll out into 4 (6-inch) circles.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 calzones.

          Emerilís Inside-Out Spicy Tuna Roll With Special Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  hot chile paste
  1           teaspoon  hot chile oil
     1/2      teaspoon  toasted sesame oil
  4                     sheets toasted seaweed (yakinori)
                        Mitsukoís Perfect Sushi Rice -- (see recipe)
                        = (at least 3 cups cooked rice)
     1/2         pound  sushi-quality fresh tuna -- cut 1/2"-wide strips
                        Wasabi paste -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  finely-sliced scallions
  3        tablespoons  toasted black sesame seeds

In a small bowl combine mayonnaise, chile paste, hot chile oil, and sesame oil and stir to combine.

Place 1 piece of toasted seaweed on top of a sushi roller (makisushi), with the short end closest to you.  Using lightly wet fingers, press enough rice onto the seaweed to completely cover the seaweed, and press firmly so that rice adheres to seaweed.  Turn seaweed over so that rice side now faces down.  Arrange strips of tuna on top of seaweed, with the tuna strips running vertically in line with the short side of the seaweed, about 1/3 of the way into the seaweed sheet.

Spread a small amount of wasabi on the tuna, then sprinkle with sliced scallions.  Using the sushi roller as a guide, carefully begin rolling the seaweed up, pressing as tightly as possible so that the roll is firm and compact.  Once the roll is completely rolled, reposition roll on sushi roller and press again.  Sprinkle sesame seeds on a flat surface and lightly roll in seeds to coat.  Allow roll to sit for a few seconds before slicing with a sharp, damp knife.

Cut roll into 6 or 8 pieces and serve with dollops of sauce spooned on top, or alongside for dipping.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.

This recipe yields 4 rolls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     shallot -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  red wine
  1 1/2           cups  softened butter - (12 oz or 3 sticks)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  48                    cleaned snail shells
  1                can  snails - (28 oz) -- drained, rinsed
                        = (or 48 fresh snails, prepared as
                        directed below)
                        === PREPARING FRESH SNAILS ===
  48                    fresh snails in their shells
                        White vinegar -- as needed
                        Salt -- as needed
                        Dry white wine -- as needed
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  2                     carrots -- coarsely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- coarsely chopped
  1                     bouquet garni
  10                    garlic cloves -- mashed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

In a bowl combine shallot, parsley, garlic, red wine, butter, salt, and pepper and mix well to thoroughly combine.  Place a small amount of the butter inside each prepared snail shell.  Add one snail to each shell, then fill each shell with more of the garlic-butter mixture.  Place each prepared shell in the well of a snail dish and bake until butter is melted and bubbly and just beginning to brown.

If using fresh snails, follow this procedure for cleaning and preparing the shells:  Allow snails to fast for at least one day.  Rinse snails under cold running water and then transfer to a large bowl and cover with white vinegar and a handful of salt.  Cover snails with a heavy plate to keep them submerged and allow them to purge for at least 3 hours.

Rinse again under cold running water and clean thoroughly to remove all traces of mucous.  Place snails in a small saucepan and cover with water.  Boil for 10 minutes.  Drain and remove snails from their shells.  Transfer shells to another saucepan and cover with salted water and boil for at least 30 minutes.  Remove shells from the water, clean thoroughly and let them dry completely before proceeding.

Clean shelled snails again and remove the black part at the end of the tail.  Place snails in a saucepan and cover with a mixture of half water and half dry white wine.  Add onion, carrots, celery, bouquet garni, 10 garlic cloves, salt, and pepper.  Partially cover saucepan and bring to a boil.  Simmer for 2 hours, or until tender, and allow snails to cool in cooking liquid.  Drain snails (discard poaching liquid) and pat snails dry.  Proceed with recipe as directed.

This recipe yields 48 snails, serving 8 as an appetizer.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  orange zest
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  lime zest
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  3                     egg whites
  1              pinch  salt
  1         tablespoon  lime juice

In a small saucepan combine heavy cream and the zests, and scald.  Remove from heat and let cream infuse for at least 1 hour.  Transfer cream to a mixing bowl and chill thoroughly before proceeding.

Butter 4 3/4-cup ramekins and sprinkle them1 1/2 tablespoons of the sugar.  Cut strips of waxed paper long enough to overlap around sides of ramekins and wide enough to extend 2 to 2 1/2-inches above the tops.  Tape or tie the strips around the ramekins.

When the heavy cream is chilled, whip it to soft peaks.

In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites and salt until slightly thickened and frothy.  Add remaining sugar in small increments as you continue to beat the whites, beating until whites are stiff and glossy, about 5 minutes.

Stir in the lime juice and, using a large spatula or a balloon whisk, carefully fold a small amount of the whipped cream into the whites to lighten them.  Add remaining whipped cream to whites and gently but thoroughly fold together.

Divide the souffle mixture among the prepared ramekins and chill in the freezer until completely frozen, 2 to 3 hours.  Remove the waxed paper strips from the frozen souffles, top each souffle with a sprig of mint, freshly grated lime or orange zest, or candied violets, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  For a different presentation, souffles may also be presented in hollowed out lemons or oranges.

                        Frozen Creole Cream Cheese

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  Homemade Creole Cream Cheese -- (see recipe)
  1 1/4           cups  whole milk
  1 1/4           cups  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  5        tablespoons  orange-flavored liqueur
     1/2           cup  fig preserves

Into a large bowl, force the cream cheese through a strainer to eliminate any large curds.  Add the milk, cream, sugar, vanilla, and 2 tablespoons of the orange liqueur remaining ingredients and whisk well to dissolve the sugar.

Process the mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.  (Note that the mixture will not freeze like ice cream, but instead will have a lighter, more slushy consistency.  Don't worry, it will set up after some time in the freezer.)

Meanwhile, in a small bowl whisk together the fig preserves with the remaining 3 tablespoons of orange liqueur.  When the cream cheese mixture is slushy and somewhat firmed, pour into a large plastic container or metal bowl.  Add the fig mixture, and fold to create swirls but not completely incorporate.  Cover tightly and place in the freezer at least 2 hours before serving.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 quarts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     half-racks of lamb - (abt 1 lb ea)
  2        tablespoons  Emeril's Original Essence -- see * Note
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
  2        tablespoons  diced chopped celery
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped dried apricots
     1/4           cup  golden raisins
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped prunes
  1                cup  port
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh mint leaves
     1/4           cup  ground walnuts
  1                cup  plain bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  Creole mustard
                        = (or other whole-grain, spicy mustard)
                        === SAUCE ===
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
     1/4           cup  dry fruit stuffing
     3/4           cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  veal/lamb stock
  1         tablespoon  walnuts -- ground very fine
  1         tablespoon  chopped sage
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  cold butter

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Season the fat on the meaty sides of each rack with 1 tablespoon of the Essence.

Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, celery, shallots, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the apricots, raisins, and prunes, and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the Port and cook until almost all the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes.

Add the mint and walnuts, and stir well to combine.  Remove from the heat and let cool for 10 minutes.  (If desired, the stuffing may be made 1 day ahead and refrigerated, tightly wrapped.)  Reserve 1/4 cup nut stuffing for sauce.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  With a thin, sharp knife, cut into the middle of the lamb loin going as deep as you can.  Turn the lamb and cut into the center from the other end, to make the 2 ends meet as 1 long slit.  Insert a long handled wooden spoon into the slit and push it through the hole on the other side.  Gently work the spoon handle to enlarge the hole to 1/2- to 3/4-inch in diameter.  With your fingers, work the fruit stuffing into the center of the meat, so that the hole is filled with about 1/4 cup of the stuffing.  Repeat with the remaining racks and stuffing.

Heat a heavy skillet over medium high heat.  Add one rack to the pan and sear until brown on all sides, about 7 minutes.  Repeat with remaining racks.  Combine the bread crumbs, olive oil, remaining tablespoon of Essence, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, in a shallow bowl.  Rub each rack with 2 tablespoons of the mustard, then press on the seasoned breadcrumbs, coating the fat and both ends evenly.  Place the lamb on a roasting pan meaty-side up, and cover the bones with aluminum foil to prevent them from burning as they cook.  Roast the racks of lamb 20 to 25 minutes for medium-rare.  While the racks are roasting, make the sauce.

For the Sauce:  In a 1-quart saucepan set over a medium-high heat, add the olive oil.  Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and sweat for 1 minute.  Add the onions to the pan and sweat for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the dry fruit stuffing to the pan and sweat for 1 minute and deglaze with the red wine.  Reduce the wine until nearly evaporated, and add the stock and the walnuts to the pan and reduce by 30 percent.  Add the chopped sage to the sauce, and season with the salt and black pepper.  Swirl the cold butter into the sauce off the heat, and serve immediately over the lamb.  (Makes approximately 1 1/4 cups)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  1              pinch  salt
  8                     egg yolks
     3/4           cup  sugar

In a large, heavy saucepan, combine the cream, milk, ginger, and salt over medium heat and simmer for 20 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine the egg yolks and sugar.  Whisk until pale yellow in color and frothy.  Ladle 1/2 cup of the hot cream mixture into the eggs and whisk well to combine.  Stir the egg mixture into the hot cream mixture and cook over low heat, stirring constantly to prevent sticking, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes.  Strain into a large clean bowl through a fine mesh strainer, pressing with the back of a large spoon to extract as much liquid as possible.  Cover tightly and place in the refrigerator until well chilled, at least 3 hours.

Pour the custard into the bowl of an ice cream maker, and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and freeze until ready to eat.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 quarts.

  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2         pounds  very ripe plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and coarsely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === BASIL PUREE ===
  1 1/2           cups  basil leaves -- washed, dried
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GOAT CHEESE TURNOVERS ===
  4              large  onions -- thinly sliced
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  chopped rosemary
  1           teaspoon  chopped thyme
  1           teaspoon  chopped basil
  2                     garlic cloves -- pressed
     1/2        recipe  Homemade Goat Cheese -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Flour -- for rolling out past
  1            package  frozen puff pastry -- thawed in refrigerat
  1                     egg -- beaten

For the Tomato Coulis:  In a sautÈ pan, heat the olive oil and sautÈ onion until softened, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Add garlic and cook for 1 minute longer before adding the tomatoes.  Stir well to combine, season with salt and pepper, and continue to cook until tomatoes have softened and most of the released liquid has evaporated.  Serve warm with hot turnovers and basil puree.

For the Basil Puree:  Combine all ingredients in a blender and puree.  Transfer to an airtight container and store refrigerated until ready to use, up to 1 day in advance.  Bring to room temperature before serving with Goat Cheese Turnovers with Tomato Coulis.

For the Goat Cheese Turnovers:  In a large skillet sautÈ onions in 3 tablespoons of the olive oil until very soft, translucent and caramelized, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes.  Set aside to cool.

In a bowl combine remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, chopped herbs, garlic, and goat cheese.  Stir well to thoroughly combine, season with salt and pepper, and refrigerate until ready to assemble turnovers.

On a large cutting board or counter lightly dusted with flour, roll out each sheet of puff pastry to a 14-inch square.  Using a very sharp knife, trim edges so that theyíre straight, and cut pastry into 4 equal sized squares.  Mentally divide the squares into 2 triangles, and place 2 heaping tablespoons of the caramelized onions on 1 side.  Using the back of the spoon spread onions out slightly, then top with 3 tablespoons of the goat cheese mixture.

In a small bowl, lightly whisk the egg.  Using a pastry brush, brush the edges of the pastry with the egg.  Fold the unoccupied corner of pastry over the goat cheese and onions and press edges with a fork to decoratively seal.  Lightly brush the top of the turnover with egg wash, and then chill at least 10 minutes in the refrigerator.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

When ready to bake, make several small slits in top of pastry and bake on an ungreased baking sheet for 12 to 15 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and puffy.  Serve warm or hot with warm Tomato Coulis and drizzle with Basil Puree.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
     1/2           cup  loose green tea
  2 1/2           cups  heavy cream

In a large bowl beat the egg yolks with the sugar and salt.  Set aside.

Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a clean container and cool in the refrigerator, about 2 hours.

Pour into an ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer to a plastic container and keep in the freezer until ready to serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  minced fresh mint
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6             pounds  leg of lamb -- trimmed of fat
  3             pounds  baby potatoes -- rinsed well, halved
                        = (if larger than 1 1/2" in dia,
                        cut into 1/2" pieces)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme

In a bowl, whisk together the mustard, red wine and garlic.  Slowly drizzle in the olive oil to form an emulsion, then whisk in the herbs, salt and pepper.  Rub the mixture over the lamb, coating the outside completely.  Place the lamb in a large plastic bag and cover with any remaining marinade.  Seal the bag, refrigerate and let marinate at least 8 and up to 48 hours, turning the bag occasionally to coat evenly.

In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the remaining ingredients, turning to coat evenly.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the lamb in a large roasting pan and roast for 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and spread the potatoes evenly around the lamb.  Return to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of lamb registers 140 degrees for medium-rare, about 1 hour more.

Remove the lamb from the pan and place on a platter to rest for 15 minutes before carving.  Return the potatoes to the oven to continue cooking while the meat rests.

Carve the lamb and serve with the hot roasted potatoes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5 1/2         pounds  Braeburn, Cortland, or McIntosh apples -- cored, and
                        cut into eighths - (10 to 12 apples)
  1                cup  water
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     cinnamon sticks
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- or more to taste

In a large saucepan or stockpot, combine all the ingredients, except the sugar.  Cook over high heat until the apples begin to release their liquid, about 5 minutes.  Cover and reduce the heat to medium, and cook until the apples soften and begin to break apart, about 1 hour, stirring frequently.  Reduce the heat to low and partially cover.  Cook until the apples fall apart and the mixture reaches sauce consistency, about 30 minutes.

Remove from the heat.  Add the sugar (if needed) and stir well.  Put the mixture through a food mill or a fine mesh strainer, pushing with the back of a spoon to extract as much sauce as possible.  Discard the cinnamon sticks and apple skins.  (Makes 6 cups)

This recipe yields 6 to 10 servings.

                       Homemade Creole Cream Cheese

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             gallon  skim milk -- at room temperature
                        = (between 70 and 80 degrees)
     1/2           cup  cultured buttermilk
     1/2      teaspoon  rennet - (6 to 8 drops)
  6                     two-cup cream cheese molds - (to 7)
                        Cheesecloth

In a large enameled saucepan, glass, or plastic bowl, combine milk, buttermilk, and rennet and stir constantly for one minute.  Cover the container with plastic wrap or cheesecloth and allow to stand at room temperature (between 70 and 80 degrees) for 16 to 24 hours.  Do not stir again, or you will break the curds.  The longer the mixture sits, the firmer the cheese will be.

Carefully ladle the curds into cheese molds lined with cheesecloth.  (These could be plastic containers with holes punched in the sides and bottoms if you have no cheese molds.)  Place molds inside a baking pan to catch the excess whey that will drain off of the cheeses.  Place molds in the refrigerator for at least 6 to 8 hours, longer is fine (cheese will become firmer as more liquid drains).  The cheese is now ready to eat and will keep, refrigerated, for at least two weeks.

This recipe yields 6 containers cream cheese, about 1 1/2 cups each.

Comments:  This homemade Creole cream cheese is traditionally eaten for breakfast on toast with butter, salt and pepper, or topped with cream and fresh fruit (sugar sprinkled on top), although you can use it any way in which you might use plain yogurt.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              dozen  quail eggs
  3               cups  white vinegar
  4          teaspoons  salt
  3          teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  6                     garlic cloves

Process jars in a hot water bath for 10 minutes.  Remove from the hot water and set aside to cool.  Jars should seal as they cool.  Any jars that do not seal properly should be refrigerated and consumed within 2 weeks.

Allow properly sealed jars to sit at least 2 weeks before eating.

This recipe yields 2 pints.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  bacon -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2               cups  finely-chopped yellow onions
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (14 oz)
     1/2           cup  fresh or frozen green peas
  1                cup  vodka
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/3           cup  chopped basil
  4                     sheets fresh pasta - (abt 1 lb) -- torn into rags
                        abt 3" by 1" each
                        Grated Parmesan -- (optional),
                        for serving

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

In a skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until the fat is rendered and just beginning to brown, about 4 minutes.  Add the onions and crushed red pepper and saute until soft and slightly caramelized, about 6 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes and stir well to combine.  Cook for 2 minutes, stirring.  Add the vodka and cook until slightly reduced, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the peas and cream, and cook, until thickened, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the basil.

Cook the pasta in the boiling water until just al dente, about 2 minutes.  Drain in a colander.  Add to the pasta sauce, and toss to combine.  Serve immediately with grated Parmesan, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        = (or 48 fresh snails, prepared as
                        directed below)
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        === SAUCE ===
                        Remaining foie gras fat and enough
                        butter to measure 1/4 cup total
     3/4           cup  minced shallots
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2 1/2           cups  chicken stock
  2 1/2           cups  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === PREPARING FRESH SNAILS ===
  48                    fresh snails in their shells
                        White vinegar -- as needed
                        Salt -- as needed
                        Dry white wine -- as needed
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  2                     carrots -- coarsely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- coarsely chopped
  1                     bouquet garni
  10                    garlic cloves -- mashed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat a small saute pan until very hot and quickly sear foie gras until browned on both sides.  Transfer foie gras to paper towels to drain and set aside.  Reserve the rendered foie gras fat.

Transfer 3 tablespoons of the rendered foie gras fat to a large saute pan along with the butter.  Heat over medium-high heat and saute the shallots for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms, salt, pepper, and saute, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms give off their liquid.  Continue to cook until almost all of the liquid has evaporated, about 7 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with the Madeira and cook until all liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to a small bowl and set aside to cool to room temperature.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out puff pastry sheets to a thickness of 1/8-inch.  Cut into 12 (2-inch) rounds and 12 (3 1/2-inch) rounds.  Divide duxelles between the 12 (2-inch) rounds and top each mound of duxelles with 4 snails.  Cut reserved foie gras into 12 pieces and place one piece on top of each mound of snails and duxelles.

Using a pastry brush or your fingers, brush the edges of each 2-inch round with some of the beaten egg, then top each 2-inch round with one of the larger rounds, easing to cover snails so that the edges line up.  Crimp edges closed with your fingers or with the tines of a fork and make a small slit in the top of each dome with the tip of a paring knife.  Brush each dome with a little of the beaten egg, transfer domes to an ungreased baking sheet and chill thoroughly.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees and bake the domes for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown and puffed.  Serve immediately, covered with some of the Sauce.

For the Sauce:  While domes are baking, make the sauce by melting the reserved foie gras fat and butter and saute shallots until soft, about 2 minutes.  Add garlic and fresh thyme and cook for 1 minute.  Add chicken stock and cook until liquid has reduced to a quarter of its original volume.  Add heavy cream and cook until sauce is thick and coats the back of a spoon.  Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and serve with the hot escargot domes.

If using fresh snails, follow this procedure for cleaning and preparing the shells:  Allow snails to fast for at least one day.  Rinse snails under cold running water and then transfer to a large bowl and cover with white vinegar and a handful of salt.  Cover snails with a heavy plate to keep them submerged and allow them to purge for at least 3 hours.

Rinse again under cold running water and clean thoroughly to remove all traces of mucous.  Place snails in a small saucepan and cover with water.  Boil for 10 minutes.  Drain and remove snails from their shells.  Transfer shells to another saucepan and cover with salted water and boil for at least 30 minutes.  Remove shells from the water, clean thoroughly and let them dry completely before proceeding.

Clean shelled snails again and remove the black part at the end of the tail.  Place snails in a saucepan and cover with a mixture of half water and half dry white wine.  Add onion, carrots, celery, bouquet garni, 10 garlic cloves, salt, and pepper.  Partially cover saucepan and bring to a boil.  Simmer for 2 hours, or until tender, and allow snails to cool in cooking liquid.  Drain snails (discard poaching liquid) and pat snails dry.  Proceed with recipe as directed.

This recipe yields 12 domes, serving 6 as a first course.

     1/4         pound  chopped tasso or other smoked ham
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4                     eggs -- beaten
  1 1/2           cups  half-and-half
     1/2           cup  grated Swiss cheese or monterey jack -- (abt 2 oz)
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === SAVORY PIE CRUST ===
  1 1/4           cups  flour
  2          teaspoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4             ounces  cold unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
  3        tablespoons  ice water - (to 4)

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Roll out the pie crust on a lightly floured surface to fit a deep 9- or 10-inch pie pan.  Place the pastry in the pie pan and crimp edges decoratively.  Refrigerate at least 30 minutes, then line with aluminum foil.  Fill with pie weights and blind bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly golden around the edges.  Remove foil and pie weights, and return to the oven for 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the oven and brush the surface of pie crust with a light coating of egg white and allow to cool.

In a saute pan melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, bell pepper, and Essence, and saute until softened, 4 minutes.  Add the green onions and garlic and saute for 1 minute.  Add the crawfish, tasso, tomato paste and salt, and cook for 2 minutes longer.  Transfer to a bowl and let cool.

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, Swiss cheese, thyme, salt, and pepper.  Pour the crawfish mixture into the pie shell, and pour the egg mixture over the top.  Bake on the bottom rack of the oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the custard is set and quiche is golden brown on top.  Allow to cool slightly before serving.

Savory Pie Crust:  In the bowl of a food processor combine flour, Essence, salt, and butter and process until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  While the motor is running, add water in increments until dough comes together to form a ball.  Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and shape into a flat disc.  Refrigerate overnight or at least one hour.

Remove from refrigerator and roll out on a lightly floured surface to desired shape and thickness.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1              large  white onion -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
                        Pita bread rounds
                        === TZATZIKI ===
  1             medium  cucumber -- peeled, halved,
                        seeded, and finely chopped
     1/8      teaspoon  salt -- plus
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  plain yogurt
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
                        = (or white wine vinegar)
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh dill
                        = (or oregano leaves)
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Place the meat in a non-reactive bowl.  Mix together the lemon juice, oil, salt, pepper, 1 tablespoon oregano, garlic, and grated onion, and pour over the meat.  Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to overnight.  Thread the meat onto metal or bamboo skewers.

Heat the oil on a griddle or in a large skillet over high heat.  Add the onions, remaining teaspoon oregano and Essence to the griddle and cook light brown, about 6 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the pan.

Preheat a grill.  Grill the skewers, turning occasionally, until brown on all sides.  Remove from the grill.  Quickly heat the pita bread on the grill until just warmed through and pliant.  Holding a pita in the left hand, and the skewer in the right hand, pull the contents from the skewer into the pita bread.  Repeat with the remaining skewers.  Divide the cooked onions among the pita, and top with Tzatziki (cucumber sauce).  Serve immediately.

Tzatziki:  Put the cucumber in a strainer set over a bowl.  Sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon salt and drain for 1 hour.  Put the yogurt in another strainer set over a bowl and drain for 1 hour.  Combine the cucumber and yogurt in a bowl with the remaining ingredients and stir well.  Cover and chill for at least 1 hour before serving.  (Makes 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2               cans  hearts of palm - (14 oz ea) -- drained
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped shallot
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1 1/4           cups  milk
     2/3           cup  heavy cream
  1 1/2      teaspoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
     2/3         pound  cooked lobster meat -- coarsely chopped
                        = (the meat from 2 (1-lb) lobsters or
                        substitute cooked shrimp)
  2             slices  white bread -- crusts removed,
                        toasted and processed in food processor
                        to make fresh bread crumbs

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a skillet heat 3 tablespoons of the butter.  Add the hearts of palm, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the white pepper and saute until the hearts of palm are golden, about 3 minutes.  Arrange the cooked hearts of palm in a layer on the bottom of a gratin dish.

In a saucepan melt 3 tablespoons of the butter.  Add the shallots and garlic until softened, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the flour, increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 2 minutes, being careful not to let it brown.  Whisk in the milk and heavy cream, and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a gentle boil.  Cook until the floury taste is gone and sauce is smooth and thickened, about 3 minutes.  Add the lemon juice, chives, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and remaining 1 teaspoon of pepper.  Add the lobster meat, and stir well.

In a small saucepan melt the remaining tablespoon of the butter and remove from heat.  Add the breadcrumbs and toss to thoroughly combine.  Pour the lobster mixture over the hearts of palm and spread the breadcrumbs evenly on top.  Bake until golden brown and bubbly, about 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               pint  ripe strawberries -- washed, hulled,
                        and sliced
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  4        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  simple syrup
  4                     egg yolks
  1              pound  mascarpone
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup
  1                cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice

In a small, non-reactive bowl toss strawberries with balsamic vinegar and sugar and set aside to macerate while you prepare the gelato.

In a metal bowl whisk together simple syrup and egg yolks, set the bowl over a pan of simmering water and whisk continuously until the mixture reaches the ribbon stage (thick, pale yellow and forms a ribbon when the whisk is lifted).

Remove the bowl from the heat, transfer to the bowl of an electric mixer and beat at low speed until cool.  Whisk in the mascarpone, corn syrup, milk, and lemon juice and strain mixture through a fine sieve.  Chill thoroughly, then process in an ice cream machine according to manufacturer's directions.  Serve with macerated strawberries.

This recipe yields about 1 quart.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Stuffing


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     merlitons - (abt 3 3/4 lbs)
  1              pound  pork sausage -- removed from casings
  3               cups  finely-chopped yellow onions
  1                cup  finely-chopped bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh sage
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh thyme
  1                cup  dry bread crumbs -- plus
     1/4           cup  dry bread crumbs
  2              large  eggs
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Place the meriltons in a large pot and cover with water by 1-inch.  Bring to a boil and cook until a knife can be inserted easily, about 20 minutes.  Drain in a colander and cool.  When cool enough to handle, halve the merlitons, peel, remove the seeds, and cut the flesh into 1/2-inch cubes.

While merlitons are cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the sausage, onions, bell peppers, garlic, Essence, and salt.  Cook until the meat is brown, and the vegetables are very soft, give off their liquid, and begin to caramelize, about 25 minutes.  Add the cubed merlitons and cook, stirring frequently, until they give off their liquid and soften, 15 to 20 minutes.  Transfer to a large bowl and cool slightly before adding the butter, green onions, parsley, sage, thyme, 1 cup bread crumbs, and eggs.  Stir well to combine.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Lightly grease an 8-cup casserole.  Transfer the stuffing to the casserole and sprinkle the top with the remaining 1/4 cup bread crumbs.  Drizzle with the olive oil, then bake until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

            Mesquite-Smoked Caribbean Style Whole Red Snapper

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  red snapper - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs) -- scaled, cleaned
  3        tablespoons  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  cracked black pepper
  1                     red bell pepper -- julienned
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- julienned
  1                     Vidalia or other sweet onion -- julienned
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
     1/4           cup  julienned ginger
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                     Scotch bonnet pepper -- ribbed, seeded,
                        and small diced
  2               cups  coconut milk
     1/2           cup  dark rum
     1/4           cup  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  cane or dark brown sugar
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1                cup  Mesquite wood chips -- soaked for 1 hour

Make 4 or 5 deep diagonal cuts into the flesh of the fish on both sides of the fish.  Season the snapper both inside and out with the salt and black pepper.  In a mixing bowl, combine the red pepper, yellow pepper, onion, and cilantro, set aside.

Place the snapper in a large casserole dish.  Stuff the cavity of the fish with the pepper/onion mixture.  In a small bowl mix the ginger, garlic, and the Scotch bonnet pepper, rub this mixture all over the fish being sure to rub the cavity and the slits on either side.

In a separate mixing bowl combine the coconut milk, rum, lime juice, sugar and olive oil.  Pour this mixture over the snapper and wrap with plastic.  Refrigerate and let marinade for 2 hours before smoking.  Be sure to turn the fish 3 times during the marinating period.

Set-up the grill using an indirect cooking method (the coals are pushed to the sides of the grill and the fish cooks in the center of the coals), and sprinkle the Mesquite wood chips over top the charcoals.  Place the marinated snapper in a fish basket and place the basket on the grill.  Cover the grill and let the fish cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the flesh flakes and breaks away from the bone.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     cup chopped yellow onion
  1           teaspoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              quart  chicken stock
  4               cups  freshly-shelled peas
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

                 Minted White And Dark Chocolate Terrine

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  heavy cream
     2/3           cup  finely-chopped mint
  8             ounces  white chocolate chips
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate chips
                        === CHOCOLATE FUDGE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  bittersweet chocolate chips
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  orange liqueur

In a saucepan combine 1 1/2 cups of the cream and the mint and bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat and let cream infuse for at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours.

Place white chocolate chips in a large bowl and return mint-infused cream to a boil.  Strain hot cream through a fine sieve into the bowl containing the white chocolate.  Let sit for 1 minute, then whisk until smooth.  Transfer to the refrigerator to cool, stirring occasionally.

Place semisweet chocolate chips in another bowl and heat remaining cream in a saucepan to a boil.  Pour over semisweet chocolate and let sit for one minute, then whisk, or stir, until smooth and thick.  Transfer to the refrigerator and stir occasionally until thoroughly chilled.

When both mixtures are cold and thickened, beat with an electric mixer to soft peaks, then beat the last few strokes by hand with a whisk until thick and firm.  (Be careful not to over-whisk, or mixture will become grainy.)

Line an 8- by 4-inch bread pan or terrine mold with aluminum foil, smoothing to remove as many wrinkles as possible.  Using a spatula, place an even layer of the dark chocolate ganache on the bottom of the prepared terrine mold, using about one quarter of the entire volume.  Place the terrine in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes, until the layer of ganache is firm.

Top the first layer with a layer of the white chocolate ganache, using about one third of the entire volume.  Chill until firm, then repeat with remaining white and dark chocolate ganaches, alternating layers of each mixture.

When terrine is completely assembled, cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight before unmolding.  Remove terrine by pulling overhanging aluminum foil out of the mold.  Carefully "peel" aluminum foil off the terrine, then slice using a warm, damp knife.  Serve with Chocolate Fudge Sauce.

Chocolate Fudge Sauce:  In the top of a double boiler, melt chocolate chips and butter over simmering water.  When chocolate begins to melt, whisk in heavy cream and water.  Remove from heat when smooth, and stir in the orange liqueur.  Serve sauce either warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

                       Mitsukoís Perfect Sushi Rice

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 3/4           cups  Japanese rice, such as Nishiki
                        = (or 5 rice maker cups)
  3 3/4           cups  water
                        = (or 5 rice maker cups)
     1/2           cup  rice vinegar
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt

In a large bowl, add rice and cover with lots of water.  Stir rice in water with your hands, then pour off most of the water, and agitate 10 to 15 times by quickly moving your hand back and forth, swishing rice against side of bowl.  Rinse the rice several more times, until the water that drains off of the rice is almost clear.  Transfer the rice to a colander and let drain for 1 hour, undisturbed.  Transfer the rice to a rice cooker, add the water, cover, and cook as directed by manufacturerís directions.

While the rice is cooking, bring rice vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan, and then remove from the heat.  Add sugar and salt and stir until dissolved.  Allow to cool to room temperature.

When rice is done, allow cooked rice to remain in rice cooker for 10 minutes.  Transfer rice to a large shallow mixing bowl (traditionally a wooden tub, called a hangiri), so that rice forms a mound in the center of the bowl.

Using a diagonal slicing motion, gently cut into rice with a wooden paddle (called a kijakushi), and pour cooled vinegar mixture over top of rice.  "Cut" rice several times to evenly distribute vinegar mixture, then allow to cool.  Gently turn rice over from time to time with paddle so that rice cools evenly.  You might want to consider using a fan if time is of the essence.

When rice has cooled to body temperature, it is ready to use for sushi rolls.  Rice can be kept at the proper temperature by placing it in an insulated container such as a small ice chest, covered with a damp kitchen towel.

This recipe yields enough rice for at least 7 large rolls (futomaki).

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  pork loin or pork butt -- trimmed, and
                        cut into thin match-stick strips
  2        tablespoons  rice wine or dry vermouth
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  3              large  eggs -- beaten
  2               cups  thinly-sliced bok choy
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped green onions
  1                cup  fresh bean sprouts
     1/2           cup  bamboo shoots -- rinsed, and
                        well drained if canned
  4             ounces  wood ear or baby chanterelle mushrooms -- stems trimmed,
                        and thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        Hoisin Sauce -- for serving
                        === MANDARIN PANCAKES ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  boiling water
  3        tablespoons  sesame oil -- more or less

In a bowl toss the pork with the rice wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, cornstarch, garlic, and ginger.  Cover and marinate, refrigerated, for 2 to 4 hours.

In a large wok or sautÈ pan heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the eggs and quickly scramble.  Remove the set eggs from the pan and set aside.

Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in the work and add the drained pork strips.  Stir fry over high heat until browned and cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the pan and set aside.

Add the remaining ingredients except the hoisin sauce and pancakes to the wok and stir-fry until wilted and well combined, about 2 minutes.  Return the pork to the pan and stir to mix well and heat through.  Add the eggs and mix well.  Remove from the heat and place in a decorative bowl.

To serve, place 1 pancake on a plate and coat with 2 teaspoons of hoisin sauce.  Top with the Mu Shu Pork filling, roll into a cylinder, and serve immediately.

Mandarin Pancakes:  In a mixing bowl put the flour, and gradually stir in the water, mixing to make a thin batter.  When cool enough to handle, work the dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.  Place the dough in a bowl, cover with a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes.

Place the sesame oil in a small bowl.  Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll out to 1/4-inch thickness.  Cut into rounds with a 3-inch cutter.  With your fingers, daub a small amount of oil on top of 1 round.  Place another round on top and press together.  Roll the 2 rounds together to form a circle about 6 or 7-inches in diameter.  Cover with a damp kitchen cloth until ready to cook, and repeat with the remaining dough.

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat.  Cook 1 pancake at a time until barely golden and dry on both sides, turning once, about 1 minute.  Remove from the pan, and when cool enough to handle, carefully separate the 2 pancakes.  Wrap in foil until ready to use, or refrigerate.  (To reheat, place in a steamer insert and steam, covered, for 5 minutes.  Makes about 20 to 24 pancakes)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Place the sesame oil in a small bowl.  Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll out to 1/4-inch thickness.  Cut into rounds with a 3-inch cutter.  With your fingers, daub a small amount of oil on top of 1 round.  Place another round on top and press together.  Roll the 2 rounds together to form a circle about 6 or 7-inches in diameter.  Cover with a damp kitchen cloth until ready to cook, and repeat with the remaining dough.

Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat.  Cook 1 pancake at a time until barely golden and dry on both sides, turning once, about 1 minute.  Remove from the pan, and when cool enough to handle, carefully separate the 2 pancakes.  Wrap in foil until ready to use, or refrigerate.  (To reheat, place in a steamer insert and steam, covered, for 5 minutes.  Makes about 20 to 24 pancakes)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     bone-in veal chops - (abt 12 oz ea)
  2          teaspoons  Emeril's Essence -- plus
  2        tablespoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
  1                cup  bleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  fine dried bread crumbs
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  milk
  1              bunch  arugula -- washed, patted dry,
                        and chopped - (abt 1 1/2 cups)
  4                     ripe Roma tomatoes - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- cored, chopped
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  clarified butter
                        = (or vegetable oil)
  1                     lemon -- cut into 4 wedges

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

With a thin, sharp knife, cut a slit about 3-inches across and 1-inch deep into the meaty side of 1 of the chops, being careful not to cut all the way through to the bone.  Gently pry open the slit and place the chop between 2 large pieces of plastic wrap on a work surface.  Using a meat mallet, pound the chop to a 1/4-inch thickness.  Season both sides of the chop with 1/2 teaspoon Essence.  Repeat with the remaining chops.

Combine the flour with 1 of the remaining tablespoons of Essence in a shallow bowl.  Put the bread crumbs in another shallow bowl and season with the remaining tablespoon of Essence.  Combine the eggs and milk in another shallow bowl and whisk to blend.

Dredge the chops in the seasoned flour and shake off excess.  Dip in the egg wash, and then coat both sides with the bread crumbs.

Toss the arugula, tomatoes, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.

Heat the clarified butter in a large, heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chops, 2 at a time, and cook until cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.  Remove and place on 4 serving plates.  Mound a portion of the arugula salad on top of each chop, and serve with a lemon wedge on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE DUCK ===
     1/4           cup  hickory chips -- soaked 1 1/2 hours
  2                     duck breast halves -- boned
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     1/2      teaspoon  vegetable oil
                        Water -- as needed
                        === FOR THE PIZZA ===
  1              pound  Brie -- cut 1/4"-thk slices
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Pizza dough for 2 (12-inch) pizzas -- (see below)
                        Vegetable oil -- for greasing pans
  2                     roasted red bell peppers -- peeled, seeded,
                        and thinly sliced
     2/3           cup  thinly-sliced crimini mushrooms
  2          teaspoons  truffle oil, or to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped chives
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
                        === BASIC PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 degrees F)
  2 1/2           cups  flour - (to 3) -- plus more if necessa
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Place soaked hickory chips in the bottom of a stovetop smoker and add enough water to come 1/4-inch up the sides of the pan.  Place smoker on the stovetop over high heat until the water comes to a boil.  While waiting for the water to boil, cut slits into the fat on the fatty side of the breast halves and season both sides with the Essence.

When water has come to a boil, position drip pan in smoker, then oil rack with the vegetable oil and place this in the smoker.  Position duck breast halves on top of the oiled rack, fatty-side up, and cover smoker with its lid.  Reduce heat to low and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until duck is cooked through.  Remove duck breasts from the pan, and when cool enough to handle, slice or tear into bite-sized pieces.

While the duck is smoking, remove the white outer casing from 1/4 of the Brie and combine with the heavy cream in a saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until cream is very smooth and thick and has infused with the cheese flavor, about 20 minutes.

Basic Pizza Dough:  In a large bowl combine yeast with water, olive oil, salt and stir well to proof.  After 5 minutes, add 1/2 of the flour and mix well to thoroughly incorporate.  Add all remaining flour except 1/2 cup and mix well with your hands.

Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead dough for at least 5 and up to 7 minutes, adding enough additional flour as necessary to form a smooth and elastic dough.  Dough should not be sticky.

Transfer dough to a lightly oiled 2 or 3 quart bowl and turn to coat with oil.  Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, usually at least 1 hour.

Divide dough into 2 portions (for 2 (12-inch) pizzas) and form into balls.  Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover with a damp towel.  Let rest for 15 minutes, then transfer to a lightly floured surface.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Roll or shape Pizza Dough into 2 (12-inch) circles and place on lightly greased baking sheets.  Using the back of a spoon, spread each pizza with half of the brie cream.  Top each pizza circle with half of the duck, bell peppers, mushrooms, and remaining Brie.  Bake pizzas for 20 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.  Drizzle pizzas with the truffle oil and sprinkle with the chopped chives and parsley before serving.

This recipe yields 2 (12-inch) pizzas, serving 4 to 6.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  crushed tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves -- julienned or
                        coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/2         pound  mozzarella, sliced 1/4-inch thick
                        === BASIC PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  2 1/2           cups  flour - (to 3) -- plus more if necessa
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat oven to 500 degrees and, if you have one, place a pizza stone on the bottom rack of the oven.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine tomatoes, olive oil, and salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste and process until smooth.  Divide sauce between the 2 pizzas and smooth to spread evenly, leaving a 1/2-inch border along the edges of the dough.  Sprinkle basil leaves on top of sauce and then top with Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Finally, divide mozzarella slices between 2 pizzas, and bake for about 8 minutes, or until cheese is bubbling and the edges are golden brown.

Basic Pizza Dough:  In a large bowl, combine yeast with water, olive oil, salt and stir well to proof.  After 5 minutes, add half of the flour and mix well to thoroughly incorporate.  Add all remaining flour except 1/2 cup and mix well with your hands.

Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead dough for at least 5 and up to 7 minutes, adding enough additional flour as necessary to form a smooth and elastic dough.  Dough should not be sticky.  Transfer dough to a lightly oiled 2- or 3-quart bowl and turn to coat with oil.  Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, usually at least 1 hour.

Divide dough into 2 portions (for 2 (12-inch) pizzas) and form into balls.  Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover with a damp towel.  Let rest for 15 minutes, then transfer to a lightly floured surface, shape as desired and roll out to a thickness of 1/4-inch.

This recipe yields 2 (12-inch) pizzas for 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh beets -- washed, and tops
                        and stems trimmed
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  minced shallots
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  6        tablespoons  vodka
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  honey

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  10            ounces  goat cheese
  2        tablespoons  minced basil leaves
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  red bell peppers - (abt 1 lb) -- roasted, with
                        cores, seeds and skins removed
  2              large  yellow bell peppers - (abt 1 lb) -- roasted, with
                        cores, seeds and skins removed
  16            ounces  fresh spinach -- washed and stems
                        removed, blanched and squeezed dry
                        Sun-dried Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Toasted croutons -- as an accompaniment

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Line 2 large baking sheets with aluminum foil, and lightly grease with olive oil.  Lay the eggplant, zucchini, and squash slices in a flat layer, slightly overlapping.  Brush with olive oil and lightly season with salt and pepper.  Bake in the oven until soft and just golden around the edges, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and transfer to a plate to cool.  Repeat with the remaining vegetable slices.

In a large bowl, combine the goat cheese with the basil, parsley, and extra-virgin olive oil.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper, and mix well.

In a 6-cup terrine (12- by 3- by 3-inches), arrange the eggplant slices across the bottom and over the sides, overlapping the slices to completely cover the terrine.  Top with slices of red pepper, zucchini, squash, spinach, and yellow pepper.  Crumble a layer of the goat cheese mixture on top of the yellow pepper, and repeat layering with the remaining vegetable slices.  Wrap the overhanging eggplant over the bottom of the terrine.  Wrap the terrine loosely in plastic wrap.  Top with an equal sized terrine, or a piece of cardboard wrapped in aluminum foil.  Place a brick on top of the terrine and refrigerate at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours.

Remove from the refrigerator.  Remove the weight and unwrap.  Slice with a very sharp knife and serve 1 large or 2 thin slices per person with the Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce and toasted croutons.

This recipe yields 8 to 12 appetizer servings.

                        === BLACK TRUFFLE BUTTER SAUCE ===
  3             medium  shallots -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
  6             ounces  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  2             ounces  truffle butter -- cut small pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Slice the scallops in half to make 2 medallions out of each.  Sprinkle the medallions with the truffle oil, lemon juice, and chives.  Place a slice of truffle on half of the scallops and place the other halves on top to make a sandwich.

Spread a sheet of the parchment paper on a table so the point of the heart is facing away from you.  Place 1/8 of the leek and carrot confit on 1 side of the parchment.  Place 4 of the scallop sandwiches on top of the confit.  Fold the other half of the parchment paper over and begin folding at the crease at a narrow angle.  Repeat this until you have gone all the way around the papillote.  When you reach the pointed end, twist it so that it forms a tail.  Brush the top with egg white and place on a cookie sheet in the center of the oven.  Bake for 15 minutes.  Serve immediately with black truffle butter sauce.

Confit of Leeks and Baby Carrots:  In a saucepan heat butter over medium heat and cook leeks, stirring often, until softened (do not allow to color).  Add carrots and cook 3 minutes longer.  Add wine and when most of the liquid has evaporated, add water or stock, thyme, sugar, salt, pepper and nutmeg, and simmer uncovered, until vegetables are soft and most liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes.  Season with salt and white pepper, to taste.

Black Truffle Butter Sauce:  In a small saucepan, combine the shallots, vinegar, and wine and reduce to 1/4 cup.  Add the heavy cream and reduce by half.  Slowly whisk in the cold butter, adding the truffle butter last.  Season the sauce with salt and white pepper.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

               Seared Duck Breasts With A Citrus-Tea Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless muscovy duck breast halves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  sliced shallots
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sliced garlic
  1                cup  fresh orange juice
  2        tablespoons  loose Earl Grey tea leaves
  3               cups  dark chicken or duck stock
  4          teaspoons  sweet orange marmalade
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh rosemary
  2        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut small pieces

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Score the fatty side of the duck breasts.  Season on both sides with the Essence, salt and pepper and place in the refrigerator overnight.

In a large, heavy skillet over high heat cook duck breasts skin-side down until golden brown and crispy, about 6 minutes.  Turn and sear for 1 minute.  Transfer the duck breasts to a pan.

Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the duck fat from the skillet.  Add the shallots and saute for 1 minute.  Add the garlic and saute for 30 seconds.  Add the orange juice and tea.  Bring to a boil and reduce by half in volume.  Add the stock, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until reduced by half in volume, about 15 minutes.  Place the duck breasts in the oven to heat through and finish cooking while the final sauce is being assembled, about 5 minutes for medium-rare.

Strain the sauce through a fine mesh strainer, pressing on the solids with the back of a spoon to extract all the liquid.  Return the sauce to the pan.  Add the marmalade and rosemary, and stir to combine.  Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.  Whisk in the butter and remove from the heat.

Remove the duck breasts from the oven and divide among 4 serving plates.  Spoon the sauce over the duck breasts and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

       Shellfish Stuffed Spinach Cannelloni With Truffled Balsamell

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Spinach Pasta Dough -- (see recipe), rolled
                        into sheets, and cut into 4" squares
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2         pound  cooked lobster meat -- coarsely chopped
     1/2         pound  cooked shrimp -- coarsely chopped
     1/2         pound  jumbo lump crabmeat
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh herbs of choice
                        = (such as tarragon, parsley, and basil)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  flour
  2 1/2           cups  milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  white truffle oil -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  finely-grated Parmesan

Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil and add pasta squares.  Stir well to prevent them from sticking together and cook for less than half a minute.  Drain and transfer partially cooked pasta to a large bowl of ice water.  Once cooled, transfer to damp kitchen towels and cover until ready to assemble the cannelloni.

In a saute pan melt 4 tablespoons of the butter along with the olive oil and saute onion until softened, about 6 minutes.  Add garlic and cook for 2 minutes longer.  Transfer to a mixing bowl and add lobster, shrimp, crabmeat, and chopped herbs.  Gently toss to combine.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Assemble the cannelloni by placing a small amount of the filling in the center of each pasta square and roll up, cigar fashion.  Repeat with the remaining cannelloni.  Lightly oil a large casserole dish and arrange filled cannelloni, seam-side up.  Set aside while you make the sauce.

In a small saucepan melt remaining 4 tablespoons of butter and whisk in flour.  Cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add the milk and whisk to combine well.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and cook for 5 minutes, until very thick and the floury taste is gone.  Season to taste with salt, pepper, and truffle oil.  Pour sauce over top of cannelloni, sprinkle with grated cheese and bake in a preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until heated through, bubbly and golden brown on top.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil and add pasta squares.  Stir well to prevent them from sticking together and cook for less than half a minute.  Drain and transfer partially cooked pasta to a large bowl of ice water.  Once cooled, transfer to damp kitchen towels and cover until ready to assemble the cannelloni.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a saute pan melt 4 tablespoons of the butter along with the olive oil and saute onion until softened, about 6 minutes.  Add garlic and cook for 2 minutes longer.  Transfer to a mixing bowl and add lobster, shrimp, crabmeat, and chopped herbs.  Gently toss to combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Assemble the cannelloni by placing a small amount of the filling in the center of each pasta square and roll up, cigar fashion.  Repeat with the remaining cannelloni.  Lightly oil a large casserole dish and arrange filled cannelloni, seam-side up.  Set aside while you make the sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small saucepan melt remaining 4 tablespoons of butter and whisk in flour.  Cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add the milk and whisk to combine well.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and cook for 5 minutes, until very thick and the floury taste is gone.  Season to taste with salt, pepper, and truffle oil.  Pour sauce over top of cannelloni, sprinkle with grated cheese and bake in a preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until heated through, bubbly and golden brown on top.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  Creole mustard
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  prepared horseradish
  4                     sheets toasted seaweed (yakinori)
                        Tempura-Fried Soft-shell Crabs -- (see recipe),
                        cut 8 pieces,
     1/2                avocado -- sliced lengthwise
     1/2                cucumber -- peeled, seeded,
                        and sliced into thin batons
                        Mitsukoís Perfect Sushi Rice -- (see recipe)
                        = (at least 3 cups cooked rice)
  2        tablespoons  finely-sliced scallions
     1/2           cup  baby cress

In a small bowl combine the mayonnaise, mustard, soy sauce, lemon juice, and horseradish and stir to combine well.  Set aside.

Hold one sheet of seaweed in your hand and with the other hand (fingers should be damp) scoop a small handful of rice and press onto seaweed, leaving 2 of the diagonal corners free of rice (these will be the top and bottom of the handroll).  Lay 2 pieces of soft-shell crab, several slices of avocado, and some of the cucumber on top of the rice, and sprinkle with scallions and baby cress.  Carefully begin rolling the roll, ice cream cone-fashion.  If the roll does not stay closed on its own, you can either wet one edge or place a few stray pieces of rice to act as a "glue".  Serve immediately, with some of the sauce spooned over the top.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.

This recipe yields 4 hand-rolls.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     semi-ripe plantains
                        = (yellow with some spots)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1              large  carrot -- grated
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  6                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  2             quarts  chicken stock
                        Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
                        Salt -- to taste

                        Black Bean Salsa -- (see recipe)
     1/2         pound  smoked shrimp -- for garnish

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place unpeeled plantains on a baking sheet and rub with 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil and sprinkle with kosher salt.  Roast plantains in oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until skin is blackened and flesh is softened somewhat.  While plantains are still warm, trim ends and peel fruit (you may need gloves or a dishtowel if plantains are still very hot).  Cut plantains into 1/2-inch-thick slices.

In a heavy saucepan sautÈ onion, carrot and cumin in remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil until softened and caramelized, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Add plantains and chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Skim surface of soup if necessary, and lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the plantains are very tender, about 20 minutes.

In a food processor or blender purÈe the mixture in batches until smooth and season with Essence, salt and pepper, to taste.  Return the soup to the pot and keep warm until ready to serve.  When serving, top each portion with 2 tablespoons of the Black Bean Salsa and the smoked shrimp.

This recipe yields 6 servings (about 8 cups).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  flour
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  ground ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
  4             ounces  cold unsalted butter
  3                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1                cup  milk
     1/2           cup  chopped crystallized ginger

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and lightly flour a 8-inch by 3-inch cake pan.

Into a large bowl sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, ginger, cloves, and allspice.  Using a pastry blender, 2 knives, or your fingers, work the butter into flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the eggs, vanilla, milk, and half of the crystallized ginger and stir just until dry ingredients are moistened (batter will appear lumpy).

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and sprinkle remaining crystallized ginger on top of batter.  Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester inserted into cake's center comes out clean.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh young okra
                        = (2" to 3" pods are best)
  1              quart  white vinegar
  6        tablespoons  kosher salt
  8                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  16                    fresh hot peppers
     1/3           cup  whole mustard seed
     1/3           cup  whole dill seed

Wash okra under cold running water.  Trim stem ends of okra, leaving at least 1/3-inch of the cap intact.  Soak okra in ice water for 1 hour, drain, and pat dry.  Divide okra between 4 or 5 pint-sized sterilized canning jars, placing them cap-side down.

In a large enameled pot, bring vinegar, salt, garlic, hot peppers, mustard seed, and dill seed to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes.  Divide peppers, garlic cloves, and mustard and dill seeds evenly between jars.  Cover okra with hot pickling liquid by at least 1/4-inch, leaving at least 1/2-inch from the jar rims.  Make sure there are no air bubbles in jars, wipe rims clean, and cover jars with lids and screw bands firmly in place.

Process jars in a hot water bath for 10 minutes.  Remove jars from water and cool.  Jars should seal as they cool.  Allow pickles to mature at least 4 weeks before consuming.  Any jars that do not vacuum seal properly should be refrigerated and consumed within 2 weeks.

This recipe yields 4 or 5 pints of pickled okra (this will depend on the size of the okra).

                  Sweet Tamales With Raisins And Spices

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Tamales

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Banana leaves -- as needed
     1/2           cup  rum
     1/2           cup  dark raisins
     1/2           cup  white raisins
     2/3           cup  vegetable shortening
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2               cups  masa harina
  1                cup  whole milk
  1                cup  coconut milk
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1 1/2         sticks  unsalted butter -- melted

Defrost the banana leaves overnight in the refrigerator if frozen, and cut off any hard sections or sections with holes.  Cut the leaves into unbroken 12-inch pieces.  If the leaves are pliable, proceed with recipe.  If not, steam the banana leaves in the top of a double boiler until soft and pliable, 20 to 30 minutes.  Set aside until ready to assemble the tamales.

In a small saucepan, gently heat the rum.  Place the raisins in a small bowl and cover with the warm rum.  Let the raisins soak and absorb the rum while you prepare the masa filling.

In the bowl of an electric mixer beat the vegetable shortening until very light, about 1 minute.  Add the sugar and half of the masa, and beat until combined.  Mix the milk and coconut milk and add alternately with the remaining masa in several batches to the mixture until mixture is the consistency of medium-thick cake batter.  Add baking powder, salt and cinnamon, and beat for 30 seconds.  Add the melted butter and beat to incorporate, being careful not to overmix.

Spoon about 3 tablespoons of the masa batter into the center of a banana leaf.  Place about 2 teaspoons of plumped raisins in the center.  Fold 1 side over the batter, then the other to enclose the filling.  Bring the bottom and the top over the filling to create a small package.  Tie the tamale with a piece of string, and repeat with the remaining masa batter and filling.

Line a steamer insert with a layer of unused banana leaves.  Lay the tamales in the lined steamer, and steam over simmering water until the tamales are cooked through and release easily from the banana leaf wrappers, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

This recipe yields 18 tamales, 6 to 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  soft-shell crabs
  1               dash  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
  1                     egg -- beaten
     2/3           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
  1                cup  cold soda water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat the deep-fat fryer.

To clean the crabs, remove the tail, gills, and eyes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Whisk together the Essence, egg, flour, cornstarch, soda water, salt, and pepper into a smooth batter.  Dip the soft-shell into the tempura batter, shaking off any excess.  Remove the basket from the fryer.  First, carefully holding the top of the crab, drag the legs through the oil first, for 1 minute.  This will allow the individual legs to fry separately instead together.  Then lay the soft-shell, top-side-down, into the oil.  Fry for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden, flip the soft-shell over and continue frying for additional 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the fryer and allow to drain on a paper-lined plate.

This recipe yields 4 fried soft shell crabs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     boneless turkey breast half - (abt 3 lbs)
  2               cups  Wild Mushroom Stuffing For Turkey Roulade -- (see recipe)
  10            ounces  thick-sliced apple bacon

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

On a large cutting board, place turkey breast on top of plastic wrap and cut so that it opens up to one large flat piece of even thickness.  Cover with additional plastic wrap and pound to an even thickness of just under 1/2-inch.  Remove plastic wrap from top of turkey and spread stuffing evenly over middle portion of turkey breast and roll it up, using the plastic wrap to help keep the roll in place.

On a large piece of parchment paper, lay the slices of bacon down so that they just overlap.  The resulting "blanket" of bacon should be long enough to cover the entire length of the turkey roulade.

Lift the turkey roulade onto the bacon slices and carefully remove the plastic wrap.  Using the parchment as a handle, carefully roll up roulade, "tootsie-roll" fashion.  Twist ends tightly.  Place this roll on top of a large piece of aluminum foil and roll entire roulade, paper and all, with the aluminum foil.  Crimp ends closed.

Bake in a roasting pan with a rack for 1 1/2 hours, or until internal temperature reads 155 degrees.  Let roulade rest for 15 minutes, then slice into 1-inch thick slices and serve alongside "Whiskey- Braised Apple Sauce" and "Corn And Wild Rice Pudding" (see recipes).

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

            Veal Scallopine With Madeira And Porcini Mushrooms

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         ounce  dried porcinis
  1                cup  veal or chicken stock
  1 1/2         pounds  veal scallopine -- pounded, flattened
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Seasoned flour -- for dredging
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2                     shallots -- minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  Madeira wine
     3/4           cup  heavy cream

In a small saucepan, combine dried porcinis with veal stock, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and steep for 30 minutes.  Remove porcinis from liquid, rinse under running water, chop finely, and set aside.  Strain liquid through a fine sieve and reserve.

Season veal with salt and pepper on both sides and lightly dredge in seasoned flour.  (Do not do this until you are ready to cook the veal.)  In a skillet over high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the oil and heat until hot but not smoking.  Add 2 tablespoons of the butter and saute half of the veal, cooking for 1 minute on each side, until golden brown and crispy.  Transfer veal to a warm plate and set aside.

Saute remaining veal in remaining oil and butter, wiping skillet clean between batches if necessary.

Transfer veal to warm plate and add reserved porcini mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and Madeira, scraping pan bottom with a wooden spoon.  When Madeira has reduced by half, add reserved porcini broth, and cook for 3 minutes or until volume is reduced by half.  Add heavy cream and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until sauce is thickened and coats the back of a spoon.

Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and return veal to skillet to heat through, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Serve immediately with sauce spooned over the top.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Basic pie pastry -- blind-baked in
                        a 9" pie pan and cooled
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  sugar
  2                     eggs -- beaten until frothy
  6        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Limoncello
                        = (or other lemon-flavored liqueur, or
                        lemon extract)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, bring the water to a boil.  In a small bowl, combine the flour and sugar, tossing with a fork to blend.  Add the flour-sugar mixture to boiling water and cook, whisking often, until thickened, about 6 minutes.

Remove from heat and slowly add the eggs, whisking vigorously.  Return to medium-low heat and cook, whisking, until velvety smooth, about 3 minutes.  Add the vinegar and lemon extract and whisk just to blend.

Pour into the cooled pastry shell and refrigerate until set, about 3 hours.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A traditional southern "farm" favorite, made using ingredients always on hand -- this is one pie that tastes much better than you'd imagine.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  unsalted butter -- cut 1-tbspn pieces
  2               cups  sugar
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped walnuts
     1/4           cup  water

  2               cups  white chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped toasted walnuts

Butter a large baking sheet (10- by 12-inches) with 1 tablespoon of the butter, and set aside.

Pour the candy onto the buttered sheet pan and evenly sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top.  As the chocolate melts, spread them evenly over the top of the candy with a rubber spatula.  Sprinkle the finely chopped walnuts over the chocolate, and let the candy cool before breaking into uneven pieces.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  powdered wasabi
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  1                     ripe avocado -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/2" pieces
     1/2         pound  jumbo lump crabmeat -- picked over for shel
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2               cans  hearts of palm - (14 oz ea), drained, and
                        dried on paper towels
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil

In a small bowl whisk together the rice wine vinegar, cilantro, soy sauce, sesame oil, wasabi and crushed red pepper.  Add the avocado and crabmeat and stir gently to combine.

Sift the flour into a small shallow bowl.  Roll the hearts of palm in the flour and lightly coat.  Heat the oil in a small skillet and when hot but not smoking, saute hearts of palm until crispy and golden brown, turning occasionally with tongs to ensure even browning, about 6 minutes.  Remove the hearts of palm from the skillet and cut on the bias into 1/2-inch thick slices.

Divide the slices between 6 salad plates and decoratively arrange.  Top each arrangement of hearts of palm with a portion of the crabmeat and avocado salad, spooning some of the vinaigrette over the slices of hearts of palm and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Sift the flour into a small shallow bowl.  Roll the hearts of palm in the flour and lightly coat.  Heat the oil in a small skillet and when hot but not smoking, saute hearts of palm until crispy and golden brown, turning occasionally with tongs to ensure even browning, about 6 minutes.  Remove the hearts of palm from the skillet and cut on the bias into 1/2-inch thick slices.

Divide the slices between 6 salad plates and decoratively arrange.  Top each arrangement of hearts of palm with a portion of the crabmeat and avocado salad, spooning some of the vinaigrette over the slices of hearts of palm and serve immediately.
