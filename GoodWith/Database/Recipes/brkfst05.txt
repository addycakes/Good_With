Recipe By     :n/a

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  blackberries or raspberries -- fresh or frozen
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  quick-cooking rolled oats
     2/3           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2           cup  margarine or butter -- melted

For filling, in a medium saucepan combine berries, sugar, water, lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat.  Simmer, uncovered, for about 8 minutes or till slightly thickened, stirring frequently.  Remove from heat.

In a mixing bowl stir together flour, oats, brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and baking soda.  Stir in melted margarine or butter till thoroughly combined.

Set aside 1 cup of the oat mixture for topping.  Press remaining oat mixture into an ungreased 9- by 9- by 2-inch pan.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes.

Carefully spread filling on top of baked crust.  Sprinkle with reserved oat mixture.  Lightly press oat mixture into filling.  Bake in the 350 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes more or till topping is set.  Cool in pan on a wire rack.  Cut into bars.

This recipe yields 18 bars.

Comments:  These bars are not only an exceptional way to start the day, but they're also great for the fast break - a quick energy snack between all those summer activities.

                   Scrambled Eggs On Caramelized Onions

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2             medium  yellow onions -- sliced very thin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     eggs - (to 6) -- beaten
  3        tablespoons  water
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
                        Chopped chives, chervil or parsley

Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy skillet set over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to low and add the onions.  Cover the pan and cook until the onions are very soft and caramel-colored about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and set aside.

Beat the eggs and water together, adding a pinch of salt and pepper.  Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a small skillet (preferably non-stick) over medium heat.  Pour in the beaten eggs and add salt and pepper to taste.  Scramble to desired doneness.

Divide the onions between two dinner plates, creating a bed of caramelized onions.  Spoon eggs on top and garnish if desired with fresh herbs.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  If you like, caramelize the onions the day before and reheat before serving to save a bit of time.  Water added to the eggs create fluffier, better textured scrambled eggs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             large  eggs
  6        tablespoons  water
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     2/3           cup  Boursin cheese
                        = (almost 1 package of cheese)
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Using a large mixing bowl and a wire whisk, beat eggs with cream and water until ingredients are thoroughly incorporated.  Season with salt and pepper.  Last, add Boursin cheese broken off in small pieces (don't worry about any clumps, the cheese will melt as it cooks).

Set a double-boiler, the bottom pan filled halfway with water, over medium heat.  When water has reached a simmer, place butter in the upper pan to melt.  Alternatively, you can use a nonstick sautË pan set over medium-low heat.

When butter has melted add egg mixture and stir eggs continuously yet slowly with a wooden spoon over steady but low to medium heat.  Continue cooking until eggs have reached the desired point of dryness, anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                 Scrambled Eggs With Lox And Cream Cheese

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1            package  cold cream cheese - (8 oz) -- cut 1/2" cubes
  6             ounces  thinly-sliced Nova Scotia
                        smoked salmon or lox -- cut 1/2" pieces
                        Chopped fresh chives -- (optional)

Whisk eggs, salt and pepper in large bowl to blend.

Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add eggs.  Using wooden spoon, stir until eggs are almost set, about 5 minutes.

Gently fold in cream cheese and salmon and stir just until eggs are set, about 1 minute.

Transfer eggs to platter.  Sprinkle with chives, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  There are pockets of cream cheese throughout this savory mixture, the key to creating them is keeping the cheese cold until it is folded into the eggs.  Be sure to have plenty of coffee and an assortment of teas on hand to complete the meal.

Description:
  "Called Goldie Lox at Sarabeth's restaurant in New York, this
  delicious dish gets its name from the golden color of the eggs, which
  are combined with the lox."

<DirT>
Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add eggs.  Using wooden spoon, stir until eggs are almost set, about 5 minutes.

<DirT>
Gently fold in cream cheese and salmon and stir just until eggs are set, about 1 minute.

Comments:  There are pockets of cream cheese throughout this savory mixture, the key to creating them is keeping the cheese cold until it is folded into the eggs.  Be sure to have plenty of coffee and an assortment of teas on hand to complete the meal.

<Desc>
Called Goldie Lox at Sarabeth&apos;s restaurant in New York, this delicious dish gets its name from the golden color of the eggs, which are combined with the lox.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  spinach -- see * Note
  2        tablespoons  coarse salt
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1             medium  onion -- peeled, chopped
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- trimmed, sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6                     eggs
     1/2         pound  feta cheese -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  crushed dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed dried rosemary
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  10                    sheets phyllo dough
     1/4           cup  olive oil

* Note:  To substitute frozen spinach, use two 10-ounce packages for every 3 pounds of fresh.

Rinse spinach leaves vigorously in several changes of cold water; remove tough stems.  Place in a large bowl and sprinkle with coarse salt.  Rub salt into the leaves, tearing up the spinach by rubbing it between your hands (spinach volume will decrease drastically).  Rinse salt off, squeeze excess water from spinach and blot dry with paper towels.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Heat first addition of olive oil and butter in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion, mushrooms, garlic, salt and pepper.  Saute until onion is fragrant and translucent and mushrooms are tender, 5 to 7 minutes; remove from heat and set aside.

Beat eggs in a large bowl.  Add feta cheese, Parmesan cheese, spinach and onion/mushroom mixture.  Stir in parsley, oregano, rosemary and nutmeg.

Place one phyllo sheet in 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan, letting edges hang over; brush with olive oil.  Repeat with four more sheets.  Add spinach filling, smoothing to edges with a spatula or wooden spoon.  Top with remaining five phyllo sheets, brushing each with oil, including the top layer.  Trim the edges with a small, sharp knife or with scissors.

Bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until thoroughly heated and golden brown on top.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            slices  sandwich bread
     1/4           cup  butter -- melted
  6             slices  deli American cheese - (3/4 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  water
  10                    eggs
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4         pound  sliced deli ham -- chopped

Heat oven to 400 degrees.  Flatten each bread slice with rolling pin.  Make 1-inch lengthwise cuts into each corner of bread slice with sharp knife.  Brush both sides of all bread slices lightly with melted butter.  Gently press each flattened bread slice into cups of ungreased muffin pan, overlapping crust to form cups.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until lightly browned.

Meanwhile, reserve 2 slices cheese.  Cut remaining slices into bite-sized pieces.

Combine water and eggs in large bowl.  Beat with wire whisk until well mixed.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in 10-inch skillet.  Pour eggs into skillet; sprinkle with ham.  Cook over medium heat, gently lifting portions with spatula so uncooked portion flows underneath, until eggs are set (3 to 5 minutes).  Sprinkle reserved cheese pieces and pepper, if desired, over eggs.  Continue cooking, gently stirring, just until cheese is melted (1 minute).

Place toast cups on serving plate.  Fill each toast cup with about 1/3 cup egg mixture.  Cut each reserved slice of cheese into 12 thin strips.  Place 2 strips cheese on each toast cup.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

                   White Cheddar Eggs Over Potato Cakes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  baking potatoes -- peeled, grated
  3          teaspoons  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1              dozen  large eggs
     3/4           cup  half-and-half
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1 1/2           cups  shredded white Cheddar cheese

Wrap the grated potatoes in a large clean towel and squeeze out the excess starch.  Get them as dry as possible.  Unwrap and put the potatoes in a large mixing bowl.  Add 2 teaspoons of the salt, 1 teaspoon of the white pepper, and the olive oil and toss to mix well.  Form the mixture into 12 small cakes about 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick.

Heat the vegetable oil in a 10- or 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until itís hot but not smoking.  Fry the cakes, several at a time, until they are golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes on each side.  Drain on paper towels and keep warm.

Pour off the oil and wipe the skillet clean.  Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs until frothy, about 1 minute.  Add the remaining teaspoon salt, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon white pepper, half-and-half, green onions, and parsley.  Whisk to blend.

In the skillet, heat the butter over medium heat for 1 minute.  Add the egg mixture.  Using a wooden spoon, stir the eggs and cook until the mixture sets slightly, but is still soft, 7 to 8 minutes.  Cook 2 to 3 minutes longer if firmer eggs are desired.  Add the cheese, stir gently for about 30 seconds, and remove from heat.  Continue stirring the mixture until the cheese melts completely.

To serve, top each potato cake with an equal portion of the eggs.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 12 servings.
