                Apple Bread Pudding With Hard Cider Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4              large  eggs
  3               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  apple cider
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  6               cups  cubed stale raisin-cinnamon bread
  1                     Granny Smith apple -- cored and cubed
  1                cup  dried apples
                        === HARD CIDER SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  hard cider
  4              large  egg yolks

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 10- by 14-inch baking dish with the butter and set aside.

In a large bowl, beat the eggs.  Add the cream, cider, sugar, melted butter, salt, and cinnamon, and whisk to combine.  Add the bread, fresh and dried apples, and stir to combine.  Pour into the prepared dish, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the bread is well saturated, up to 1 hour.)  Bake until the top is golden brown and the center is firm, about 1 hour.

Remove from the oven and let sit on a wire rack for 15 minutes.  Cut into pieces and drizzle with the Hard Cider Sauce.  Serve immediately.

For the Hard Cider Sauce:  In the top of a double boiler, melt the butter over simmering water.  Add the sugar and whisk to combine, whisking for 1 minute.  Add the cider and whisk until the sugar is dissolved, 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the egg yolks, 1 at a time, whisking constantly.  Return to the heat and continue whisking until the sauce is pale and slightly thickened, 5 minutes.

Remove from the heat.

Spoon the sauce over the pudding and serve immediately.  (Note: The sauce will thicken and set up as it cools.  If you desire a thicker consistency, serve the sauce slightly cooled.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

                      Artichokes Stewed With Greens

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  artichokes
  2                     lemons -- quartered
     1/2           cup  Greek extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     spring onions -- finely chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  2 1/2         pounds  assorted fresh tender greens -- stemmed, well rinsed
                        = (such as dandelions, sorrel, spinach)
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill leaves
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Fill a medium bowl with water and squeeze 1 lemon into it.

Working 1 at a time, trim the artichoke stems to 1-inch in length.  With a paring knife, trim away the tough stem exterior.  (As you work, rub the cut artichoke surfaces with a lemon quarter to prevent discoloration.)  Break off the leaves near the base and with the artichoke held at an angle on the cutting board, cut away the leaves to leave a cone shape.  Cut the leaves to within 1-inch of the heart, and with a spoon, scrape out the tough hairy choke, leaving the tender heart and stem.  Cut in half lengthwise.  Place in the lemon water to prevent discoloration while preparing the remaining artichokes.

In a large saucepan, heat 1/4 cup of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the artichokes and brown on both sides.  Add the greens, water, dill, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and stir to combine.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook, stirring, occasionally, until the artichokes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.

Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Place in a serving dish and drizzle with the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Fill a medium bowl with water and squeeze 1 lemon into it.

<DirT>
Working 1 at a time, trim the artichoke stems to 1-inch in length.  With a paring knife, trim away the tough stem exterior.  (As you work, rub the cut artichoke surfaces with a lemon quarter to prevent discoloration.)  Break off the leaves near the base and with the artichoke held at an angle on the cutting board, cut away the leaves to leave a cone shape.  Cut the leaves to within 1-inch of the heart, and with a spoon, scrape out the tough hairy choke, leaving the tender heart and stem.  Cut in half lengthwise.  Place in the lemon water to prevent discoloration while preparing the remaining artichokes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large saucepan, heat 1/4 cup of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the artichokes and brown on both sides.  Add the greens, water, dill, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and stir to combine.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook, stirring, occasionally, until the artichokes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Place in a serving dish and drizzle with the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil.  Serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  dried borlotti beans
                        = (or pinto or red kidney beans)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/4           cups  minced yellow onions
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  4              small  smoked pork chops
                        = (or 8 oz other smoked pork, such as
                        smoked ham hock or smoked ham, cut into
                        1" cubes)
  2                     bay leaves -- divided
  6               cups  water - (to 8)
  4             ounces  pancetta -- chopped
     1/2         pound  sauerkraut -- rinsed, drained
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  whole peppercorns
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4             ounces  prosciutto di San Daniele -- finely diced
                        Polenta Croutons -- (listed below)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- topping
                        === POLENTA CROUTONS ===
  3               cups  water
  1                cup  polenta
  2          teaspoons  salt
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  olive oil

Place the beans in a large bowl.  Cover with cold water by 2 inches and soak overnight.  Drain.

In a large pot, heat the oil.  Add the onions and cook until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and 1 bay leaf and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the pork chops and cook, turning, for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the beans and enough water to cover (6 to 7 cups) and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender, about 1 hour.

With a heavy wooden spoon or potato masher, mash about half of the beans against the sides of the pot.  Continue cooking until very tender, 10 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, in another pot, cook the pancetta over medium heat until the fat is rendered, about 6 minutes.  Add the sauerkraut, 1 cup of water, the remaining bay leaf, the sugar, peppercorns, and salt.  Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender and aromatic, about 30 minutes.

Add the sauerkraut mixture to the beans and stir well to combine.  Cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes.  Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.

Remove from the heat and discard the bay leaves.  Ladle into 4 deep bowls, giving each person 1 pork chop.  Place several fried croutons in each bowl and top with the diced prosciutto.  Grind freshly ground black pepper over the top and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil.  Serve.

For the Polenta Croutons:  In a heavy medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil over high heat.  Stir the polenta and salt into the water, lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, stirring from time to time.  Cook until the polenta is cooked through and thickens, about 20 to 25 minutes.

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter until smooth.  Pour the polenta onto a lightly oiled, baking sheet and spread to about 3/4-inch thick.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day in advance.

Run a knife around the edge of the baking sheet and unmold the polenta onto a cutting board.  Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares and refrigerate, wrapped, until ready to cook.

In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the polenta squares in batches and cook quickly until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the pan and repeat with the remaining polenta, adding more oil as needed.

Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Bean soups abound in Friuli and many are flavored with a ham bone.  But the most representative soup of all is Jota (pronounced "yota"), a thick, hearty, smoked pork and sauerkraut soup from Trieste, with clear Austrian/Yugoslavian origins.  There are as many versions of Jota as there are cooks; in the northwestern portion of the region, they include barley, further west they use pickled turnips instead of sauerkraut.  Pork is the region's most beloved meat; mountain and hill cookery draws inspiration and sustenance from the pig's versatile meat, and transforms every part of the animal into something edible.  Though one might not associate sauerkraut with Italy, it's common in Friuli, called "capuzi garbi."  While normally cornmeal is added at the end to thicken the soup, instead we're adding the polenta croutons to soak up the extra liquid.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried black-eyed peas
     1/2           cup  dried shrimp
     3/4           cup  roughly-chopped onion
  2          teaspoons  roughly-chopped garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
                        Salt -- to taste
  2             quarts  vegetable oil
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  dried shrimp
     3/4           cup  roughly-chopped onion
  1           teaspoon  peeled fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste

Soak the black-eyed peas overnight in cold water to cover.  Drain.  Rub off and discard the skins.  Soak the shrimp in cold water to cover for 30 minutes.  Puree the peas, onion, shrimp, garlic and cayenne in a food processor.  Season to taste with salt, if necessary.  Form mixture into tablespoon-size balls.

Meanwhile in a 5-quart pot or Dutch oven, fitted with a candy or deep-frying thermometer, or in an electric deep fryer, heat oil over medium-low heat until the thermometer registers 365 degrees.  Make sure you have at least 3 inches of space between the top of the oil and the top of the pan, as oil will bubble up when fritters are added.

Fry the fritters in small batches until golden brown all over, turning once.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Serve at room temperature with the Sauce.

For the Sauce:  Soak the shrimp in cold water, to cover, for 30 minutes.  Drain the shrimp and puree in a food processor or blender with the onion, ginger and red pepper.  Heat the oil in a skillet and saute the shrimp mixture for about 5 minutes.  Season with salt, to taste.  Transfer to a bowl and serve with fritters.  (Makes about 1 1/4 cups)

This recipe yields about 2 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm-ripe Anjou pears -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
  1                cup  sweet late harvest Riesling, Muscat,
                        Sauternes, or Montbazillac
     1/2           cup  pear nectar
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  2               cups  heavy cream
  4              large  egg yolks
  4             ounces  Danish Blue, or other creamy blue cheese -- rind removed and
                        crumbled
  1              pinch  salt
                        Honey -- for drizzling
                        Toasted chopped walnuts -- for sprinkling
                        === PHYLLO COOKIES ===
  2                     sheets phyllo dough
  2        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  chopped walnuts
  2        tablespoons  sugar

In a saucepan, combine the pears, wine, nectar, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and lemon juice.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the pears are tender and the liquid is reduced by 1/2.  Puree in a food processor and transfer to a bowl to cool.  Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours.

In a medium saucepan, heat the cream to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Remove from the heat.

Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl.  Whisk 1/2 cup of the hot cream into the egg yolks.  Whisking, gradually add the egg mixture to the hot cream.  Return to medium-low heat and cook, whisking, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean bowl.  Add the blue cheese and salt, and whisk until fairly smooth.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to keep a skin from forming.  Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours.

Whisk together the pear and cheese mixture and pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine.  Freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.

To serve, scoop the ice cream into bowls, 2 scoops per person.  Drizzle with honey and sprinkle with chopped nuts.  Place 2 phyllo cookies in the ice cream and serve.

For the Phyllo Cookies:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a baking sheet and set aside.

Place the phyllo on a work surface and cover with a damp kitchen towel.  With a pastry brush, paint the top sheet with melted butter, and lightly sprinkle with nuts and sugar.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.  Fold the phyllo stack in 1/2 over itself.  Cut the phyllo twice lengthwise and twice across to make rectangles.

Bake until golden brown and just crisp, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on the pan until ready to serve.

This recipe yields about 1 quart.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  veal shanks -- halved crosswise,
                        and patted dry
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (to 8)
  3             ounces  pancetta or bacon -- chopped
  2               cups  dry red wine
  1 1/2           cups  chopped yellow onions
     3/4           cup  chopped carrots
     3/4           cup  chopped celery
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic -- plus
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1                cup  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley -- plus
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  3          teaspoons  finely-grated lemon zest
  3               cups  beef stock - (to 4)
                        === MASCARPONE CHEESE POLENTA ===
  4               cups  milk
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1                cup  polenta
                        = (coarsely-ground yellow cornmeal)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  Mascarpone cheese

In a shallow dish, combine the flour and Essence.  Dredge the veal shanks in the seasoned flour, shaking to remove any excess.  In a large Dutch oven, melt 4 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat.  Add the pancetta and cook until browned and the fat is rendered.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

To the fat in the pan, add the veal shanks in batches to prevent overcrowding and cook until browned on all sides, adding more butter if needed.  Remove the shanks from the pan and let rest on a baking sheet.  Add the wine and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring to deglaze the pan.  Cook until reduced by half.

Add the onions, carrots, and celery to the pan, and cook, stirring, until soft, 4 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon of the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the tomatoes and bay leaves and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the thyme, 1 teaspoon of the lemon zest and enough beef stock to almost completely cover the meat.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover tightly and simmer, turning the meat occasionally, until the meat is tender and falling from the bone, about 2 hours.

To make the Mascarpone Polenta:  In a large saucepan, bring the milk to a boil.  Add olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Very gradually, add the polenta in a steady stream, whisking constantly.  Add the salt and whisk to combine.  Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring frequently with a heavy wooden until thick and creamy, 20 to 30 minutes.  Add the mascarpone to the polenta and adjust the seasoning to taste.  With tongs, transfer the shanks to a plate and cover to keep warm.  Bring the liquid to a boil and cook until slightly reduced.  Remove from the heat.

To make the gremolata, in a small bowl, combine the remaining teaspoon garlic, 2 teaspoons lemon zest and 2 tablespoons parsley.  Spoon the polenta into 4 large bowls and top each with 2 veal shank pieces.  Spoon the sauce over the veal and sprinkle each portion with gremolata to taste.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a shallow dish, combine the flour and Essence.  Dredge the veal shanks in the seasoned flour, shaking to remove any excess.  In a large Dutch oven, melt 4 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat.  Add the pancetta and cook until browned and the fat is rendered.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To the fat in the pan, add the veal shanks in batches to prevent overcrowding and cook until browned on all sides, adding more butter if needed.  Remove the shanks from the pan and let rest on a baking sheet.  Add the wine and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring to deglaze the pan.  Cook until reduced by half.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the onions, carrots, and celery to the pan, and cook, stirring, until soft, 4 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon of the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the tomatoes and bay leaves and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the thyme, 1 teaspoon of the lemon zest and enough beef stock to almost completely cover the meat.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover tightly and simmer, turning the meat occasionally, until the meat is tender and falling from the bone, about 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Mascarpone Polenta:  In a large saucepan, bring the milk to a boil.  Add olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Very gradually, add the polenta in a steady stream, whisking constantly.  Add the salt and whisk to combine.  Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring frequently with a heavy wooden until thick and creamy, 20 to 30 minutes.  Add the mascarpone to the polenta and adjust the seasoning to taste.  With tongs, transfer the shanks to a plate and cover to keep warm.  Bring the liquid to a boil and cook until slightly reduced.  Remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the gremolata, in a small bowl, combine the remaining teaspoon garlic, 2 teaspoons lemon zest and 2 tablespoons parsley.  Spoon the polenta into 4 large bowls and top each with 2 veal shank pieces.  Spoon the sauce over the veal and sprinkle each portion with gremolata to taste.  Serve immediately.

                        === SPICY LEMON TARTAR SAUCE ===
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  minced yellow onions

Pour into a decorative bowl and chill for 1 hour before serving.  (Makes about 1 1/4 cups)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (abt 4 lbs) -- rinsed, patted dry
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     fresh parsley sprigs
  1                     fresh rosemary sprig
  1                     fresh thyme sprig
  1                     bay leaf
  40                    garlic cloves -- unpeeled
                        = (from 3 to 4 heads of garlic)
  1                cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
                        French bread -- optional
                        accompaniment
                        === GRILLED RADICCIO ===
  2              heads  radicchio -- quartered
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Rub the cavity and outside of the chicken with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and season with the salt and pepper.  Place the parsley, rosemary, thyme and bay leaf inside the chicken.  Tie the legs together with kitchen string and fold the wings under bird.

In a large Dutch oven or small heavy roasting pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Add the chicken and cook, turning carefully to avoid tearing the skin, until golden brown on all sides, about 8 minutes.

Remove from the heat and transfer the chicken to a large plate.  Add the garlic cloves and celery to the pan.  Return the chicken to the pan, breast-side up, and pour the white wine over the top.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil and then top with a lid to create an airtight seal.  Bake for 1 1/2 hours without removing the cover.

For the Grilled Radicchio:  Preheat a grill or grill pan.  Toss the radicchio wedges with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.  Arrange in a single layer on the grill and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.

Remove the chicken from the oven and transfer the chicken to a platter and let rest for 10 minutes before carving.  Spoon the pan juices and whole garlic cloves over each portion of chicken, and pass the remaining juices and garlic tableside with French bread for dipping.

Remove the radicchio from the grill and serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Peanut oil or vegetable oil -- for frying
  2                     Petrole soles -  (1 1/2 to 2 lbs ea) -- scaled, and
                        eviscerated, head off
  2        tablespoons  Chinese fermented black beans -- rinsed well, drained
  4 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  mirin
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Red Pepper Dipping Sauce -- (listed below)
                        Steamed white rice -- as accompaniment
     1/4           cup  bias-sliced green onions -- for garnish
                        === RED PEPPER DIPPING SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  dried red chile flakes
  4 1/2      teaspoons  peanut oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh ginger

In a large wok or pot, heat the vegetable oil to 400 degrees.

Make 2 or 3 slashes diagonally across the flesh of each side of the fish.

In a small bowl, mash the black beans and garlic.  Add the rice wine, oil, ginger, sugar, pepper flakes, and salt, and whisk to combine.  Rub the mixture over the outside of the fish, rubbing onto the slashes.

In a shallow bowl, combine the cornstarch and flour.  Dredge the fish in the mixture and shake to remove any excess.  Carefully slide the flour-coated fish into the hot oil.  Fry until golden brown, about 5 to 8 minutes, turning as necessary with tongs.  Remove and drain on paper towels.

To serve, arrange the fried fish on a platter with the red pepper sauce and rice.  Garnish with the chopped green onions and serve immediately.

For the Red Pepper Dipping Sauce:  Combine all the ingredients in a decorative bowl and mix.  Set aside at room temperature until ready to serve.  (Makes about 1/3 cup)

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- melted
     1/4           cup  milk
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  3              large  eggs -- separated
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated orange peel
     1/4           cup  cognac
                        = (or Pineau de Charentes)
     1/4           cup  water
                        Macaroons St. Emilion -- (see recipe)
                        Chocolate shavings -- for garnish

Lightly grease a 1-quart charlotte mold.

Place the chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl.  In a small saucepan, scald the milk and sugar.  Remove from the heat and pour over the chocolate.  Stir to blend.  Let cool, then beat in the egg yolks until smooth and shiny.  Add the orange peel and beat to incorporate.  Let cool completely.

In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff.  Fold 1/2 of the whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten.  Gently fold in the remainder.

In a small bowl, combine the cognac and water.  Dip the macaroons 1 at a time into the mixture, then layer across the mold, flat side down.  Arrange additional macaroons up the sides of the mold, flat sides out.  Spoon 1/2 of the chocolate mixture into the mold, and top with a layer of macaroons.  Add the remaining chocolate mixture and top with the remaining macaroons.

Cover with plastic wrap and place a plate on top.  Place a weight (such as a large can or measuring cup filled with water) on the plate and refrigerate until set, at least 8 hours or overnight.

To serve, remove the weight and plate and unwrap.  Place a platter on top of the charlotte and invert, shaking slightly to release and remove the mold.  Thinly slice.  Garnish with chocolate shavings and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1              pinch  salt
  4             ounces  semisweet chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  chopped lightly-toasted pecans
  1                     unbaked 9" sweet piecrust -- (listed below)
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  confectioners' sugar -- more for dusting
  1         tablespoon  white creme de menthe
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- for garnish
                        Cocoa -- for garnish
                        === BASIC SWEET PIECRUST ===
  8             ounces  flour
                        = (abt 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4         pound  cold butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/4" pieces
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  3        tablespoons  ice water

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a bowl, beat together the eggs and yolk.  Add the sugar, corn syrup, melted butter, bourbon, vanilla, and salt, and mix well.  Fold in the chips and pecans, and pour into the prepared crust.  Bake until set, about 40 minutes.

Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before serving.

To make the sweetened cream, in a bowl, whip the cream to soft peaks.  Add the sugar and creme de menthe and whip to stiff peaks.

Slice the pie while slightly warm and place on plates.  Place a dollop of mint cream on the side and sprinkle with cocoa.  Garnish with mint sprigs, dust the plates with additional confectioners' sugar, and serve.

For the Basic Sweet Piecrust:  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large bowl.  Using your fingers, work in the butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add 2 tablespoons of ice water and work with your fingers until the water is incorporated and the dough comes together.  Add more water as needed to make a smooth dough, being careful not to over mix.  Form the dough into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough until an 11-inch round.  Fit into a 9-inch pie pan and trim and crimp the edges.  Cover and refrigerate (as necessary) until ready to fill.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) pie, 6 to 8 serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- plus
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened
  2 1/2           cups  cake flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  cake flour
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  8              large  eggs -- separated
  1         tablespoon  orange zest
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  groundcinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  ground anise
  2 1/4           cups  Ruby Port
                        === GARNISH ===
  2                     seedless navel oranges -- peeled, segmented
                        Fresh orange blossoms

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Lightly grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan using 1 tablespoon of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the flour, knocking to remove any excess.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, cream the remaining 2 sticks of butter and sugar with an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides as needed, about 3 minutes.  Add the egg yolks 1 at a time, beating well after the addition of each.  Mix in the orange zest.

In a large bowl, sift the remaining 2 1/2 cups of flour, the baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, and anise.  Mix into the egg mixture.

In a large clean bowl, beat the egg whites with clean beaters on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.

Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into this batter.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until golden and springy to the touch, 45 to 50 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan for 10 minutes.  Turn out onto a decorative platter or cake plate and let cool.

In a medium saucepan, bring the Port to a boil and cook until reduced by 1/2.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly, then drizzle over the top of the cake.  Garnish the cake with the orange segments and garnish the cake platter with the orange blossoms before serving.

This recipe yields 1 (10-inch) cake.

                Cold Cream Of Zucchini And Watercress Soup

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  chopped yellow onion
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1 1/4         pounds  zucchini -- trimmed, chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  3               cups  chicken stock
  1              sprig  thyme
  1                cup  watercress leaves - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley leaves
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  creme fraiche
                        = (or sour cream)
                        Watercress sprigs -- for garnish
                        Chopped chives -- for garnish
                        === CHEDDAR-PECAN CRACKERS ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces,
                        and softened
  1                cup  grated cheddar cheese - (packed)
     1/2           cup  chopped toasted pecans
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame seeds

In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 15 seconds.  Add the zucchini, salt, and pepper, and cook until tender.  Add the stock and thyme and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.

Add the watercress and let wilt, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and discard the thyme sprig.

With a hand-held immersion blender or in batches in a food processor, puree the soup.  Return to the heat and stir in the cream.  Heat gently and cook for 5 minutes.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, keeping in mind, that salt is less evident in cold foods.

Let cool and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 to 6 hours.

Transfer to a large thermos.  To serve, pour into double-handled cream soup bowls or decorative cups.  Swirl creme fraiche into each serving and garnish with watercress sprigs and chives.  Serve with cheese crackers.

For the Cheddar-Pecan Crackers:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Into a bowl, sift together the flour, cayenne, and salt.

In another bowl, cream together the butter and cheese.  Add the dry ingredients and mix together.  Fold in the pecans and sesame seeds.  Drop onto the baking sheet 1 teaspoon at a time, spreading gently to flatten into rounds.  Bake until golden and crisp around the edges, about 15 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before serving, or serve at room temperature.  (Makes about 1 dozen)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 15 seconds.  Add the zucchini, salt, and pepper, and cook until tender.  Add the stock and thyme and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.

Add the watercress and let wilt, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and discard the thyme sprig.

With a hand-held immersion blender or in batches in a food processor, puree the soup.  Return to the heat and stir in the cream.  Heat gently and cook for 5 minutes.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, keeping in mind, that salt is less evident in cold foods.

<DirT>
Into a bowl, sift together the flour, cayenne, and salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In another bowl, cream together the butter and cheese.  Add the dry ingredients and mix together.  Fold in the pecans and sesame seeds.  Drop onto the baking sheet 1 teaspoon at a time, spreading gently to flatten into rounds.  Bake until golden and crisp around the edges, about 15 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before serving, or serve at room temperature.  (Makes about 1 dozen)

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     prepared puff pastry shells -- defrosted
  1              stick  cold unsalted butter -- cut into tablespoons
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1               pint  oysters -- drained, and
  2        tablespoons  oyster liquor reserved
     1/2         pound  crawfish tails
     1/2         pound  sea scallops
  2          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     3/4                white Bordeaux
  2        tablespoons  cognac
  1                cup  fish stock
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1                cup  finely-diced peeled seeded tomatoes
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh parsley leaves -- plus
                        Chopped parsley leaves -- for garnish
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh tarragon leaves
  12                    fresh chives -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place the puff pastry shells on an ungreased baking sheet.  Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove the tops, pull out any uncooked pastry and discard.  Return the shells and tops to the oven and bake for 2 minutes.  Remove and let rest.

In a large skillet or saute pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.  Add the shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring, until soft, 2 minutes.  Add the oysters and their liquid, crawfish tails, scallops and Essence and cook, stirring, until the oysters curl and the scallops turn opaque, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove the seafood with a slotted spoon to a bowl.

Add the wine and cognac and bring to a boil.  Cook until reduced by 1/2.  Add the fish stock, salt, and cayenne, and cook until reduced by 1/2.  Reduce the heat to medium-low.  Stir in the tomatoes and cook for 1 minute.

Whisk in the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter 1 tablespoon at a time, adding the next piece before the previous one is completely incorporated, being careful not to let the sauce get too hot and break.

Add the green onions, parsley, and tarragon and stir.  Return the seafood and any accumulated juices to the pan and cook, stirring until heated through.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Place 1 puff pastry shell on each of 6 medium plates.  Divide the seafood sauce among the pastries and arrange the pastry lid on top of each.  Garnish each plate with 2 chives and sprinkle chopped parsley around the sides.  Serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)

  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  Red Curry Paste - (to 3) -- listed below
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2               cups  shrimp or chicken stock
  1                cup  drained canned bamboo shoot strips
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  julienned fresh Thai basil
                        = (if unavailable use Italian basil)
                        === RED CURRY PASTE: KRUNG KAENG PHED ===
  20                    red chiles - (to 30) -- to taste
                        = (such as Thai chiles)
     3/4           cup  chopped shallots
     1/4           cup  chopped peeled fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  whole coriander seeds
     1/4           cup  chopped garlic
  2                     large stalks lemongrass -- tough outer leaves
                        discarded, finely sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  1         tablespoon  shrimp paste -- plus
  1           teaspoon  shrimp paste
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  lime zest
                        Salt -- to taste
                        = (depending upon saltiness of shrimp
                        paste)
                        === STEAMED JASMINE RICE ===
  2               cups  jasmine rice
                        = (other long-grain white rice can be
                        substituted)
  3               cups  water

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.

In a shallow bowl, combine the flour and 1/2 teaspoon Essence.  Season the fish on both sides with the remaining teaspoon Essence.

In a large, heavy skillet, heat 1/2 cup of the vegetable oil to 360 degrees.

Dredge 2 of the fillets in the flour, coating evenly and shake to remove excess flour.  Fry the fillets until golden brown, about 4 minutes on each side.  Remove with a slotted spatula and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining fish.

Keep the fish warm in the oven while preparing the curry.

To prepare the curry heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over medium-high heat.  Add the bell peppers and cook, stirring, until soft, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the curry paste and soy sauce and stir to combine.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to a simmer and cook for another 5 minutes.  Add the bamboo shoots and stir to combine.  Add the fried fish and cook until fish is heated through, about 1 minute.  Season, to taste, with salt.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in the basil and serve with the Steamed Jasmine Rice.

For the Red Curry Paste:  Stem the chiles, and depending upon taste, keep or discard all or a portion of the seeds (which will make the paste hotter).  Place in a bowl and add enough warm water to cover.  Soak for 30 minutes.  Drain, reserving the water.

Heat a small skillet over medium heat.  When hot, add the shallots, ginger, and coriander seed and cook, stirring constantly, until aromatic, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat.

Combine all the ingredients in a blender or food processor.  Process into a moist paste, stopping frequently and scraping down the sides, and adding 1 tablespoon of the chili soaking liquid or extra oil as necessary to make moist.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.

Place in an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use.  Paste can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 month or in the freezer for up to 3 months.  (Makes about 1 1/4 cups)

For the Steamed Jasmine Rice:  In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the rice and water and bring to a boil.  Cover tightly, reduce the heat to low, and cook undisturbed until the water is absorbed, 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let sit undisturbed for 10 minutes.  Fluff with a fork before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  2                     squabs - (12 to 16 oz ea) -- cleaned, rinsed
  3               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  roughly-chopped green onions -- white and green
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh garlic
  3        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
                        Steamed long-grain white rice -- as accompaniment
                        Minced green onions -- for garnish
                        === HOMEMADE PLUM SAUCE ===
  1                cup  plum preserves or plum jam
  2        tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  minced onions
  1           teaspoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the squabs and blanch for 2 minutes.  Remove, drain, and pat dry with kitchen towels.  Set aside.

In a medium saucepan, combine the chicken stock, green onions, garlic, light and dark soy sauces, ginger, rice wine, brown sugar, honey, and salt and bring to a boil.

Mound rice in the center of 2 plates and drizzle with a small amount of the poaching liquid, if desired.  Place the squabs in the center of the rice and spoon the Plum Sauce over the top of the birds.  Garnish with chopped green onions.  Serve hot.

For the Homemade Plum Sauce:  In a small saucepan, bring all the ingredients to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring, until the preserves are melted, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning to taste.  Let cool to room temperature before serving.  Sauce will keep refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.  (Makes about 1 1/4 cups)

Remove and dry on kitchen towels for at least 1 hour, and up to 4 hours (refrigerated).  Strain the poaching liquid to serve with the rice, if desired.

In a medium pot heat enough oil to come halfway up the sides to 350 dergrees.  Carefully add the squabs and fry until the skins are crisp and golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.

Mound rice in the center of 2 plates and drizzle with a small amount of the poaching liquid, if desired.  Place the squabs in the center of the rice and spoon the Plum Sauce over the top of the birds.  Garnish with chopped green onions.  Serve hot.

For the Homemade Plum Sauce:  In a small saucepan, bring all the ingredients to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring, until the preserves are melted, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning to taste.  Let cool to room temperature before serving.  Sauce will keep refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.  (Makes about 1 1/4 cups)

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  penne, ziti, or other tubular pasta
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  6             ounces  pancetta -- diced
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  white wine
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1 1/4           cups  grated Grana Padana or
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1                cup  crumbled Dolce Gorgonzola, Gorgonzola, or
                        other creamy, mild blue cheese
     3/4           cup  grated fontina
     1/2           cup  grated Pecorino Toscana, or
                        Percorino Romano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Minced parsley -- for garnish

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente.  Drain and return to the pot.  Toss with the olive oil and stir to prevent from sticking.

Meanwhile, in a large saute pan, cook the pancetta until the fat is rendered and browned.  Remove and drain on paper towels.

Melt the butter in the pan over medium heat.  Add the garlic, and cook, stirring, until soft and fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the wine, increase the heat, and stir to deglaze the pan.  Cook until reduced to 1 tablespoon.  Add the cream and cook until reduced slightly, about 2 minutes.

Lower the heat and add the cheeses 1 at a time, stirring after each addition.  Cook, stirring, until melted and smooth.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Add the pasta and toss to coat evenly.  Stir in the pancetta.

Transfer to a hollowed cheese wheel or large serving bowl.  Top with freshly ground black pepper and parsley.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dried shrimp
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  chopped onion
     1/2           cup  ground toasted cashew nuts
     1/2           cup  ground toasted blanched almonds
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  minced seeded red chile peppers
  4               cups  fish or shrimp stock
  1                can  coconut milk - (14 oz)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1              pound  sea bass fillets -- cut 2" cubes
                        = (or other firm white fish fillets)
  1              pound  shrimp -- peeled, deveined

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Soak the dried shrimp in warm water to cover for 15 minutes.  Drain, then puree in a blender or food processor.  Set aside.

Heat a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat and add the olive oil.  Saute the onions, stirring often, until soft, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the pureed shrimp and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the nuts, garlic, ginger and peppers and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute.  Add the stock, coconut milk and lime juice and cook until reduced by 1/2, about 20 minutes.

Reduce the heat to medium.  Add the fish and simmer until the fish is almost cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the shrimp and simmer until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.  Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Stir in 1/4 cup cilantro and remove from the heat.

Arrange a scoop of rice in the center of 6 large plates or soup bowls.  Ladle the stew over the rice and garnish with the remaining 1/4 cup chopped cilantro.  Place 1 lime wedge on each plate and serve immediately.

Soak the dried shrimp in warm water to cover for 15 minutes.  Drain, then puree in a blender or food processor.  Set aside.
</DirT>

Heat a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat and add the olive oil.  Saute the onions, stirring often, until soft, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the pureed shrimp and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the nuts, garlic, ginger and peppers and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute.  Add the stock, coconut milk and lime juice and cook until reduced by 1/2, about 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reduce the heat to medium.  Add the fish and simmer until the fish is almost cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the shrimp and simmer until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.  Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Stir in 1/4 cup cilantro and remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange a scoop of rice in the center of 6 large plates or soup bowls.  Ladle the stew over the rice and garnish with the remaining 1/4 cup chopped cilantro.  Place 1 lime wedge on each plate and serve immediately.

                        === SALSA ===
  2                     Florida oranges -- peel, pith cut away

                        === LUMP CRABMEAT GUACAMOLE ===
  2                     ripe avocados -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped

                        shells and cartilage
                        === GROUPER ===
  4                     grouper fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Essence -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FRIED YUCCA CHIPS ===
  2             pounds  fresh yucca -- peeled
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Essence -- to taste
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === ACCOMPANIMENT & GARNISH ===
  4              shots  margaritaville tequila in
                        salted shot glasses -- as accompaniment
  4                     lime wedges dipped in salt -- for garnish
                        Minced fresh cilantro -- for garnish

For the Salsa:  Segment the oranges over a bowl to catch the juices.  Add the mango, onions, bell peppers, cilantro, jalapeÒo, oil, zest, ginger, salt, and cayenne.  Adjust seasoning to taste.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour before serving to allow the flavors to blend.

For the Tomatillo Sauce:  Heat a large, heavy saute pan over high heat.  When the pan is very hot, add the tomatillos and cook until they begin to soften and the skin begins to blister and brown.  Add the onions and cook until tender.  Add the chicken stock, chile, and garlic and just bring to a simmer.  Remove from the heat.  Transfer to a blender.  Add the herbs, and honey and puree until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Keep warm until ready to serve.

For the Crabmeat Guacamole:  In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients except the crabmeat, mashing slightly to combine.  Fold in the crabmeat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

For the Grouper:  Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat until just smoking.  Season both sides of the fish fillets with Essence, salt, and pepper, patting it on with your hands.  Sear the fish until browned and crisp, about 2 minutes per side, turning once.  Remove from the heat.

Arrange 1 fish fillet across the center of each of 4 plates.  Spoon a dollop of the orange-mango salsa to 1 side of the fish, and the crabmeat guacamole to the other side.  Fan the yucca fries to the top.  Place the margaritaville tequila shot below the fish with the salted lime wedge to the side.  Sprinkle with cilantro and serve.

For the Fried Yucca Chips:  In a deep saucepan, heat enough oil to come halfway up the sides to 375 to 380 degrees.

Using a mandoline or very sharp heavy knife, slice the yucca as thinly as possible.

Add the yucca in batches to the oil and cook, turning, until golden brown, 45 seconds to 1 minute.  Drain on paper towels, season with Essence and salt, to taste.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- plus
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 cup)
  1         tablespoon  flour -- plus
     3/4           cup  flour -- sifted
  3            squares  unsweetened baking chocolate - (1 oz ea)
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  chopped pecans -- lightly toasted
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
                        === FUDGE TOPPING ===
  1              stick  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  6        tablespoons  buttermilk
  1              pound  confectioners' sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of flour into the pan to coat the sides and bottom, knocking out any excess.  Set aside.

In the top of a double boiler or in a bowl set over simmering water, combine the remaining 12 tablespoons butter and the chocolate.  Cook, stirring, until smooth, about 3 minutes.  Add the granulated sugar and whisk until smooth.  Add 1/4 cup of the flour and whisk to combine.  Alternate adding the remaining flour and eggs, whisking well after each addition.  Stir in the toasted nuts and vanilla.

Pour into the prepared pan, shifting the pan to create an even layer.  Bake until risen and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

For the Fudge Topping:  While the brownies are in the oven, in a medium saucepan, combine the butter, cocoa powder and buttermilk over medium heat.  Cook until the butter melts and mixture just comes together.  Remove from the heat and whisk until smooth.  Sift the confectioners' sugar into a medium bowl.  Add the chocolate mixture and vanilla and whisk until smooth.

Remove the brownies from the oven and, with the handle of a wooden spoon, poke holes into the brownies every 1 to 2 inches.  Pour the Fudge Topping over the brownies and smooth with a rubber spatula.  Let cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before cutting.

Cut into 2-inch brownies and serve.

This recipe yields 2 dozen brownies.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of flour into the pan to coat the sides and bottom, knocking out any excess.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the top of a double boiler or in a bowl set over simmering water, combine the remaining 12 tablespoons butter and the chocolate.  Cook, stirring, until smooth, about 3 minutes.  Add the granulated sugar and whisk until smooth.  Add 1/4 cup of the flour and whisk to combine.  Alternate adding the remaining flour and eggs, whisking well after each addition.  Stir in the toasted nuts and vanilla.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour into the prepared pan, shifting the pan to create an even layer.  Bake until risen and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Fudge Topping:  While the brownies are in the oven, in a medium saucepan, combine the butter, cocoa powder and buttermilk over medium heat.  Cook until the butter melts and mixture just comes together.  Remove from the heat and whisk until smooth.  Sift the confectioners&apos; sugar into a medium bowl.  Add the chocolate mixture and vanilla and whisk until smooth.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the brownies from the oven and, with the handle of a wooden spoon, poke holes into the brownies every 1 to 2 inches.  Pour the Fudge Topping over the brownies and smooth with a rubber spatula.  Let cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before cutting.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut into 2-inch brownies and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 dozen brownies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  Armagnac or brandy
     1/4           cup  white raisins
     1/4           cup  black currants or black raisins
  4             ounces  goat cheese -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  honey
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-grated lemon peel
  4              large  Golden Delicious apples
     3/4           cup  apple cider
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        Finely-chopped toasted walnuts
                        Powdered sugar -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a small saucepan, gently heat the Armagnac over medium heat.  Place the raisins and currants in a bowl and cover with the warm Armagnac.  Let sit until plumped, about 10 minutes.  Drain, reserving the liquid.

In a small bowl, mash the goat cheese, honey, lemon peel, and 2 teaspoons of the reserved Armagnac until smooth.  Add the raisins and currants and mix until well blended.  Refrigerate until slightly firm, about 20 minutes.

Using an apple corer and small melon baller, scoop out the stems, cores, and seeds from the apples, leaving the bottoms intact.  Using a paring knife, peel the skin from the top inch of the apple.  Stand in a baking dish.

Divide the goat cheese mixture into 4 equal portions and stuff into the apples.

In a bowl, whisk together the cider and sugar, and the remaining reserved Armagnac, (about 1/4 cup) if desired.  Pour over the apples.  Bake uncovered until the apples are tender, 45 to 40 minutes, basting every 10 to 15 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes.

Place the apples on plates and spoon the pan juices over them.  Sprinkle with the chopped nuts and powdered sugar and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

               Gorgonzola Ravioli With Walnut-Brown Butter

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  ricotta cheese -- well drained,
                        and crumbled
     1/4           cup  crumbled Gorgonzola -- plus
  2        tablespoons  crumbled Gorgonzola
                        = (or other creamy blue cheese)
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  roasted garlic paste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     sheets fresh spinach pasta
                        Cornmeal -- as needed
  1              stick  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  roughly-chopped walnuts
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh tarragon
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  finely-grated Parmesan -- plus more for
                        topping if desired

In a bowl, combine the ricotta, Gorgonzola, parsley, and garlic paste and mash together until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.

Put 1 pasta sheet on a work surface with the long side facing you.  Place heaping tablespoons of filling down the sheet, about 2 inches apart.  Brush water around each pile of filling and fold the dough lengthwise over the filling.  Press gently around each to force out any air and seal.  Trim with a fluted pastry wheel or knife to cut into separate ravioli.  Place on a baking sheet lightly dusted with cornmeal to keep from sticking.  Repeat with the remaining ravioli.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Cook the ravioli until they are tender and rise to the surface, gently stirring to keep them from sticking together, 3 to 4 minutes.

Meanwhile, while the ravioli are cooking, in a skillet over medium-high heat, cook the butter without stirring until it starts to darken to a golden color.  Add the nuts and cook until the butter is golden brown and the nuts are fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Add the herbs, cream, and lemon juice, and stir to combine.  Cook for 30 seconds.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer the ravioli with a slotted spoon to the skillet with the butter, swirling to coat.  Sprinkle with the Parmesan, spooning the sauce over the ravioli to melt the cheese.

Divide the ravioli among 4 plates and sprinkle each serving with additional Parmesan, if desired.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  self-rising flour
     3/4           cup  cake flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  3          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1                cup  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  grated cheddar cheese
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour -- bench flour
  2        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.

Into a bowl, sift together the self-rising flour, cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt.  Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the buttermilk, cheese, and green onions and, using your hands or a rubber spatula, stir just until the buttermilk and flour come together to form a dough, being careful not to overmix.

Lightly flour a work surface with the all-purpose flour.  Turn out the dough onto the surface and press into a disk about 1/2-inch thick and 8 inches in diameter.  Using a 3-inch round cutter dusted in flour, cut into rounds.  (Be sure to press straight and downward when cutting the dough -- a twisting motion will prevent the dough from rising.)

Reform the scraps in order to make 7 biscuits.  Place on a small baking sheet and brush the tops with the melted butter.  Bake until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.

Remove from the oven and serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 7 biscuits.

  4                     cooked Dungeness crabs - -- (1 1/2 to 2 lbs ea)
  2             sticks  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     red or grey mullets - (8 to 10 oz ea) -- cleaned, gutted,
                        and heads left on
                        Greek extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  1                     fresh lemon -- cut 8 wedges
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12             large  fresh grape leaves -- wiped clean
  1              bunch  fresh parsley -- washed
  4                     stems fresh oregano
                        === GARLIC-WALNUT SAUCE ===
  3             slices  home-style bread -- crusted removed
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled, smashed
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  finely-chopped toasted walnuts
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar - (to 3)
  1                cup  Greek extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat the grill.

Lightly rub the outside of the mullets with olive oil and sprinkle lightly with lemon juice.  Sprinkle the insides of the mullets with lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Place 3 grape leaves on a work surface, overlapping slightly.  Place several parsley stems and 1 oregano stem in the center.  Place the fish on top of the herbs and enclose with the leaves.  Secure with toothpicks.  Lightly oil the outside of the leaves.  Repeat with the remaining leaves, herbs, and fish.

Place the wrapped fish on the grill and cook until cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes per side.  Remove from the grill and remove the toothpicks.

To serve, place 1 wrapped fish on each of 4 plates.  Slit open the grape leaf package and drizzle with the Garlic-Walnut Sauce.  Serve with the remaining lemon wedges on the side.

For the Garlic-Walnut Sauce:  Run the bread under cold running water to saturate.  Squeeze dry and crumble into a bowl.

In a food processor, process the garlic with the salt to form a paste, scraping down the sides as needed.  Add the walnuts and process until mealy.  Add the soaked bread and 2 tablespoons of the vinegar and process.  With the machine running, add the oil in a steady stream and process until creamy.  (If the mixture is too thick, first adjust, to taste, with vinegar, then add water 1 to 2 teaspoons at a time.)

Adjust the seasoning, to taste, and transfer to a decorative bowl for serving with the grilled fish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  3        tablespoons  sugar

Preheat a grill.

Make a seasoning salt by processing the salt, juniper, peppercorns, and allsice in a spice grinder, coffee grinder, or blender.

Place the venison on a work surface and sprinkle on both sides with the seasoning.  Grill the sirloin and tenderloin on both sides until medium-rare, about 1 minutes per side for the sirloin and 2 minutes per side for the tenderloin.  Grill the venison sausages until they are cooked through, about 6 to 8 minutes.

While the venison is cooking:  In a medium saucepan, bring the veal stock, cider, shallots and pepper to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the mixture is reduced by half.  Whisk in the mustard.  Working on and off the heat, whisk in the butter in pieces.  Remove from the heat add minced parsley and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Serve as soon as possible.

To serve, spoon the mashed potatoes into the center of 4 large plates and top with the venison.  Spoon the sauce over the meat, and arrange the red cabbage around the sides of the plate.  Garnish with parsley and serve.

For the Mashed Potatoes:  In a medium saucepan, cover the potatoes with water by 1 inch and add 1 teaspoon of the salt.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and cook at a low boil until the potatoes are fork-tender, 12 to 15 minutes.  Drain in a colander.  Return the potatoes to the saucepan and cook for 1 minute get rid of excess moisture.  Add the cream, butter, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and the pepper.  With the heat on medium-low, mash until well blended, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

For the Braised Red Cabbage:  Heat the oil in a large nonreactive skillet over high heat.  When the oil is hot, add the onions, cabbage, salt, and pepper and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add the vinegar, bay leaves, cinnamon, allspice, and water, and stir and simmer for 3 minutes.  Stir in the sugar and cook, stirring and folding the ingredients through the cabbage, for 2 minutes.

Cover the pot and cook over high heat 3 minutes.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes.  Uncover, turn the heat up to high and cook, stirring from time to time, until the cabbage is tender, for about 15 minutes.  Serve immediately.  (Makes about 2 cups)

  3             pounds  venison stew meat -- trimmed and cubed
                        = (such as round or roast)
  4               cups  dry red wine
  1                cup  red wine vinegar
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onions
  1                cup  chopped carrots
  1                cup  chopped celery
  3                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  4                     cloves
  8                     parsley stems
  3                     bay leaves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  juniper berries
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
  4             ounces  pancetta or bacon -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  8             ounces  wild mushrooms -- wiped clean, and
                        stems trimmed
                        = (or quartered button mushrooms)
  1                     wide egg noodles -- (12 ounces)
                        Chopped parsley -- for garnish

In a large non-reactive bowl, combine the meat, wine, vinegar, 3/4 cup onions, 1/2 cup carrots, 1/2 cup celery, garlic, rosemary, thyme, cloves, parsley stems, bay leaves, juniper and peppercorns.  Stir to combine, cover, and marinate 24 to 36 hours, refrigerated.

Drain the meat thoroughly, reserving the liquid, and pat dry.

In a large pot, cook the pancetta over medium heat until brown and the fat is rendered.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  In batches, add the drained meat and cook, stirring, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the pan.  Add the remaining onions, carrots, and celery, and the minced garlic.  Cook, stirring, until soft.  Add 1 cup of the reserved marinade and bring to a boil, stirring to deglaze the pan.

Return the meat and pancetta to the pan and add enough marinade to come halfway up the sides of the meat.  Reduce the heat, cover slightly, and simmer until the venison is tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours.  (The cooking liquid should reduce and thicken as the meat cooks, yet add additional liquid should be added as needed to keep the meat halfway covered during cooking.)

In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet.  Add the mushrooms and cook until tender and starting to brown.  Remove from the heat and reserve.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the egg noodles and cook until al dente.  Drain well and return to the pot.  Toss with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

To serve, place the egg noodles in a large serving bowl.  Top with the stew and arrange the cooked mushrooms over the stew.  Garnish with fresh parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  1           teaspoon  Kentucky bourbon
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  sour cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  sake
  1           teaspoon  orange zest
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  minced green onion
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4           cup  orange juice
     1/4           cup  mirin
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  3             quarts  peanut oil
  1                cup  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  Asian seasoning
  5             pounds  drumettes
  2        tablespoons  minced chives

In a large saute pan set over medium-high heat, place the soy sauce, sake, orange zest, garlic, ginger, green onion, sesame oil, orange juice, mirin, sugar and red pepper flakes.  Bring the pan to a boil and stir occasionally until the sugar is dissolved and the liquid has reduced to a thick syrup, about 20 minutes.

While the sauce is reducing, place the oil in a large 6-quart pot and bring to 375 degrees.  In a small bowl, season the cornstarch with the Asian Essence.  Place the seasoned cornstarch in large, 1-gallon heavy-duty plastic bag and place the drumettes in the bag in batches.  Shake the bag to coat the chicken, remove the chicken from the bag and place 8 to 10 pieces in the hot oil to fry.  Fry in the oil stirring occasionally for 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove from the oil, place in a clean large bowl.  Continue this process until all the chicken has been fried.

When all the chicken is fried and the sauce is reduced, use a spatula to pour the sauce over the chicken.  Toss the chicken in the bowl to evenly coat with the glaze.  Once all the chicken is coated, sprinkle it with the chives.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- softened, plus
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2               cups  sugar
  4              large  eggs -- separated
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        Decoraters Buttercream -- (see recipe)
                        Toasted sliced almonds -- for decorating

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Butter 2 (9-inch) cake pans with 1 tablespoon of butter.  Line with parchment paper and butter the paper with 1 tablespoon of butter.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, with a mixer, cream the remaining 1 1/2 sticks of butter with the sugar.  Add the yolks 1 at a time, beating well after the addition of each.

Into a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking powder and salt.  Alternating with the milk, add to the egg mixture, beating.

In a bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Fold with the vanilla into the batter.  Pour into the prepared cake pans and bake until golden and a tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.  Turn out the cakes, remove the paper, and let cool completely.

To ice the cake:  Place 1 cake layer on a cake plate or stand.  Spread the icing on top of the layer, spreading out to the edge of the cake.  Top with the second cake layer.  Ice the top and sides of the cake with the icing.  Decorate with toasted, sliced almonds.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) cake.

             Ma Ma's Mirliton, Shrimp And Crabmeat Casserole

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  7             pounds  mirliton -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" thick slices
                        = (or a 7-lb green pumpkin) -- *see note
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  2 3/4           cups  finely-chopped yellow onions
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped garlic
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2             pounds  shrimp -- peeled, deveined
     1/2         pound  lump crabmeat -- picked over for
                        shells and cartilage
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  1              pound  Gruyere or mozzarella -- finely grated

* Cooks note: any type of bland squash can be substituted for the mirliton or green pumpkin in this recipe (merlitons, yellow squash, or zucchini) Long green Italian squashes would work great too.  Regular pumpkins can also be used (not the kind for pie, but the big, bland ones more often used for Jack o'lanterns).  Butternut or acorn squash does not work with this recipe.  The original recipe uses 1 (7 pound) green pumpkin.

Place the mirlitons in a large pot and add enough water to come 1-inch up the sides of the pot.  Cover and bring to a boil.  Continue to cook over medium-high heat until the mirliton is very tender, about 40 to 45 minutes.  Strain in a large colander.  Using the back of the spoon, press on the pumpkin to release as much liquid as possible.  Discard any liquid.

In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the mirliton, salt, and pepper, and stir to combine.  Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the mirliton is very thick and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 30 to 40 minutes.  (Be careful near the end of the cooking time that the mirliton does not burn on the bottom of the pot.)

Preheat the oven broiler.

Add the shrimp, crabmeat, green onions, and parsley to the pumpkin mixture and gently stir to combine.  Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary.  Transfer hot pumpkin mixture to the prepared dish and spread the grated cheese evenly over the top.  Broil until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  ground almonds
  1 1/2           cups  confectioners' sugar -- plus
                        more for dusting
  6        tablespoons  Sauternes, Barsac or
                        other sweet white wine
  3              large  egg whites

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease the paper.  Set aside.

In a bowl, mix together the almonds, 1 1/2 cups sugar, and wine.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff.  Whisk into the almond mixture.  Transfer to a saucepan and over the barest heat, whisk to dry slightly.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

When cool, spoon tablespoons of the mixture onto the prepared sheet and flatten slightly.  Sprinkle lightly with powdered sugar.  Bake until crisp on the top rack of the oven, 15 to 20 minutes.  Do not let brown.

Remove from the oven and lift one end of the paper.  Pour a small glass of water under the paper.  (The resulting steam will loosen the macaroons.)  Let sit for 2 minutes, then remove to a rack to cool.

This recipe yields about 1 dozen.

  8             ounces  almond paste
  1 3/4           cups  confectioners' sugar
  4        tablespoons  corn syrup
                        Food coloring -- as needed

In the bowl of an electric mixer, add the almond paste and beat just to break up the almond paste some.  Add about 1 cup of the sugar and mix until it is incorporated.  Add the remaining sugar and beat until incorporated.  The mixture will look like coarse bread crumbs at this point.  Add the corn syrup and mix to combine well.  The mixture will still be very crumbly.

Turn the mixture out onto a clean work surface and knead until it makes a smooth dough.  If the dough seems too sticky, knead in a little more confectioners' sugar.  The dough can be tightly wrapped and refrigerated at this point.  If you want to color the marzipan, break off the amount of dough you want colored.  Add a drop and knead in.  For more intense color, add more food coloring.  Shape into desired shapes.

This recipe yields about 1 cup marzipan.

  3        tablespoons  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
     3/4           cup  buttermillk
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2              large  eggs
  6        tablespoons  Meyer lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated Meyer lemon peel
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar -- plus
                        extra for garnish
                        Thinly-sliced Meyer lemons -- for garnish

Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large bowl.  Using your fingers, work in the butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add 2 tablespoons of ice water and work with your fingers until the water is incorporated and the dough comes together.  Add more water as needed to make a smooth dough, being careful not to over mix.  Form the dough into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pie dough to an 11-inch circle.  Transfer to a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and press the dough against the sides.  Refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes.  Line the shell with parchment paper and fill with pie weights.  Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove the paper and weights, and bake until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack before filling.

Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.

To prepare the filling, whisk the buttermilk, sugar, eggs, Meyer lemon juice, flour, lemon peel in a medium bowl.  Pour into the cooled crust and bake until the filling is set, 25 to 30 minutes.  Cool completely then cover and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 3 hours.

Add cream to the bowl of an electric mixer and beat to soft peaks.  Add confectioners' sugar and beat to stiff peaks.

To serve, slice tart and place on dessert plates.  Place a dollop of sweetened whipped cream on the side and garnish with powdered sugar and lemon slices.

This recipe yields 1 tart, about 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Meatballs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             slices  home-style bread -- crusts removed,
                        and torn into small pieces
     1/4           cup  ouzo
                        = (or other anise-flavored liqueur, such
                        as Pernod)
  6        tablespoons  Greek olive oil -- or more as needed
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped white onions
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1              pound  ground lamb
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh mint leaves
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley leaves
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh oregano leaves
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  onion -- finely diced
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
     1/2           cup  ouzo
  2        tablespoons  chopped mint leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped oregano leaves
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped fresh mint and parsley leaves
                        Kefalotyri -- grated
                        Ouzo -- as accompaniment

In a bowl, soak the bread pieces in the ouzo until the ouzo is absorbed, about 5 minutes.

In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

In a large bowl, combine the meat and onions.  Squeeze the bread dry and add to the mixture.  Add the remaining ingredients except the flour and Essence, and mix well with your hands.  With wet hands, shape the mixture into small balls about the size of a walnut.

In a shallow dish, combine the flour and Essence.  Roll the meatballs in the flour to lightly coat on all sides.  Place on a baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.

In a large skillet, heat the remaining 1/4 cup of oil over high heat.  Add the meatballs in batches, being careful not to overcrowd and cook until evenly browned and cooked through, shaking the pan from time to time, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, and place in a baking dish in the oven to keep warm.  Cook the remaining meatballs, adding more oil as needed to the pan.

Make the sauce in a separate pan.

In a separate pan, add the olive oil and heat.  When the oil is hot, add the onion and saute for 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat and carefully add the ouzo.  Return the mixture to the heat and flambe.  Cook until the flames die down.  When the flames go out, add the herbs and cook for 1 minute.  Add the lemon juice and pour over the meatballs.

Arrange on a platter, sprinkle with the chopped herbs and grated Kefalotyri, and serve hot with glasses of ouzo.

This recipe yields about 3 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  mirlitons - (abt 4 medium)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  8               cups  julienned yellow onions
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1               head  escarole -- cleaned, halved,
                        stem intact
  2               cups  halved radishes
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
                        Crusty bread -- as accompaniment

In a medium saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat.  Add the celery, fennel, and shallots, and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes.

Add 1 teaspoon garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the water, white wine, lemon juice, peppercorns, coriander seeds and fennel seeds.  Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes.  Strain the liquid and return to the saucepan with the mushrooms.  Stir to coat and simmer for 10 minutes.  Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

Remove the mushrooms with a slotted spoon and arrange in a serving dish.  Bring the broth to a boil and reduce until thickened almost to a syrup-like consistency.  Adjust the seasoning and pour the broth over the mushrooms.  Cover and refrigerate until chilled.

In a separate pan, add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the remaining 2 teaspoons garlic and saute for 15 seconds.  Add escarole and radishes and season with salt and pepper and saute for 30 seconds.  Add the chicken stock, just to cover the vegetables and bring to a simmer.  Cover and cook over medium-low heat for 15 minutes, or until the escarole is tender.

Ladle mushrooms into serving bowls.  Garnish with parsley and serve slightly chilled or at room temperature.  Serve on crusty bread with braised escarole and radishes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  diced (1/2") pineapple
  1                cup  diced (1/2") bananas
  4              large  eggs
  3               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  coconut milk
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
  6               cups  cubed (1/2") day-old Cuban or French bread
                        Coconut Rum Sauce -- (listed below)
     1/2           cup  sweetened shredded coconut -- toasted
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for garnish
                        === COCONUT-RUM SAUCE ===
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
     1/3           cup  coconut milk
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1              large  egg yolk -- beaten
     1/2           cup  light rum

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 13 by 9-inch baking dish with 2 tablespoons of the butter.

In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat.  Add the pineapple and bananas and cook, stirring, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

In a small saucepan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs.  Add the cream, coconut milk, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and allspice, and whisk well.  Add the bread, fruit, and melted butter, and stir well to combine.  Let sit until the bread is saturated.  Pour into the prepared dish.

Bake until golden and firm when pressed in the center, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and cool slightly on a wire rack to set, about 20 minutes.

Serve on dessert plates.  Spoon the sauce over the pudding and sprinkle each serving with the coconut and confectioners' sugar.

For the Coconut-Rum Sauce:  In a medium saucepan, combine all the ingredients except the rum.  Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the sauce has thickened and coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes.  (Do not allow the sauce to boil or the egg will curdle and the sauce will not be smooth.)  Remove from the heat, whisk in rum, and set aside to cool slightly before serving.  (Makes about 2 cups)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Prepared Sweet Pie Dough -- (listed below)
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
     1/2           cup  sugar
  5              large  egg yolks -- beaten
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  3                     navel oranges -- segmented
  1               pint  raspberries
                        === SWEET PIE DOUGH ===
  8             ounces  all-purpose flour
                        = (abt 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              stick  cold unsalted butter -- cut 1/4" pieces
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  3        tablespoons  ice water

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pie dough to an 11-inch circle.  Transfer to a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and press the dough against the sides.  Refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes.

Line the shell with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove the paper and weights, and bake until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack before filling.

Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, whisk the juice, zest, and sugar to dissolve the sugar.  Whisk in the beaten egg yolks and cream.  Pour into the prepared shell and bake until set, about 30 minutes.

Cool completely then cover and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 3 hours.  Before serving, arrange the orange segments and raspberries in a concentric pattern around the top of the tart.

Sprinkle lightly with powdered sugar and serve chilled.

For the Sweet Pie Dough:  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large bowl.  Using your fingers, work in the butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add 2 tablespoons of ice water and work with your fingers until the water is incorporated and the dough comes together.  Add more water as needed to make a smooth dough, being careful not to over mix.  Form the dough into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.

This recipe yields 1 tart, about 8 servings.

For the Sweet Pie Dough:  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large bowl.  Using your fingers, work in the butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add 2 tablespoons of ice water and work with your fingers until the water is incorporated and the dough comes together.  Add more water as needed to make a smooth dough, being careful not to over mix.  Form the dough into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.

                        === PICADILLO DE PAVO ===
     1/4           cup  pure olive oil
  1 1/4         pounds  ground turkey
  1         tablespoon  butter

  1              large  tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
     1/2           cup  tomato paste
  1                cup  dry red wine
     1/2           cup  Spanish dry sherry
     1/2           cup  small capers -- well rinsed,
                        and chopped
     1/2           cup  raisins or currants -- roughly chopped
  5        tablespoons  roughly-chopped rinsed green olives
     3/4           cup  sliced scallions
                        === PAPAS RELLENAS ===
  3               cups  mashed Idaho potatoes - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  3               cups  mashed boiled yuca - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  5                     extra-large eggs
     1/4           cup  chopped thyme leaves
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  3               cups  picadillo de pavo
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  water
  3               cups  fine bread crumbs
                        Canola or peanut oil -- for deep-frying

For the Picadillo:  Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Put the turkey in the skillet and cook, separating the clumps of meat with a spoon or spatula, until crumbly and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Transfer the turkey and any juices to a bowl.  Reserve.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and the butter to a skillet and heat until hot.  Add the garlic, onion and bell peppers, season with salt and pepper, and saute for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Stir in the turkey, tomato, tomato paste, red wine, sherry, capers, raisins, olives, and scallions.  Lower the heat to medium-low, season to taste, and cook for about 15 minutes until the flavors meld.  Remove from the heat.

For the Papas Rellenas:  Combine the mashed potatoes and yuca in a large bowl.  Lightly beat 2 of the eggs, and add to the potato mixture, along with the thyme, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.  Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Form the potato mixture into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Using your thumb or forefinger, make a little well large enough to hold 1/2 tablespoon of filling in each ball.  Add the filling and pinch the dough to seal.  Pat the seam gently, then roll the ball to make it smooth and round.

Bring out 3 shallow bowls, Put the flour in 1 and season with salt and pepper.  In another, beat the remaining 3 eggs with the water.  Put the bread crumbs in the third bowl.  Roll each ball in flour, then in the eggs, and then in the bread crumbs to coat.

In a deep fryer or deep pot, heat the oil to 375 degrees.  Drop the Papas Rellenas in the oil, in batches, and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Serve.

This recipe yields 40 to 44 papas.

         Pastry-Wrapped Baked Brie With Truffled Crabmeat Filling

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  4             ounces  wild mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        wiped clean, and roughly chopped
  1                cup  lump crabmeat - (abt 1/3 lb) -- picked over for
                        cartilage and shells
     1/2      teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne
  2        tablespoons  minced green onions
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  truffle oil
  2             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
  1            package  frozen puff pastry - (2 sheets) -- thawed
  1                     round Brie cheese - (16 oz)
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  2          teaspoons  water -- for egg wash
  1              bunch  watercress -- tough stems
                        removed,
                        rinsed and spun dry
                        Toast points, crackers, or croutons -- as accompaniment

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and garlic and cook, stirring, until soft and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and cook until they give off their liquid and start to color, about 4 minutes.  Add the crabmeat, Essence, salt, and cayenne and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the green onions and parsley and cook for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and stir in the truffle oil.  Let cool and fold in the goat cheese.  Adjust the seasoning to taste.

Roll out each sheet of pastry slightly, and cut each piece into a round 1-inch larger than the Brie.  Using a paring knife, cut several leaves or other decorative shapes from the pastry scraps.  Place 1 piece of pastry on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

Cut the Brie in 1/2 horizontally and lay 1 piece in the center of the pastry sheet, cut side up.  Spread the cooled crabmeat mixture over the cut Brie and top with the remaining Brie 1/2, gently pushing the 2 halves together.

Paint the edges of the bottom piece of pastry with the egg wash.  Top the cheese with the remaining pastry sheet, pinching the edges together to seal.  Paint the top pastry lightly with the egg wash, being careful not to let any drip down the sides.  Arrange the decorative leaves on top, and lightly paint with egg wash.  Bake until the pastry is puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven.

Line a platter with the watercress and place the baked brie on top.  Let sit for 5 minutes.  Surround with toast points and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and garlic and cook, stirring, until soft and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and cook until they give off their liquid and start to color, about 4 minutes.  Add the crabmeat, Essence, salt, and cayenne and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the green onions and parsley and cook for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and stir in the truffle oil.  Let cool and fold in the goat cheese.  Adjust the seasoning to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out each sheet of pastry slightly, and cut each piece into a round 1-inch larger than the Brie.  Using a paring knife, cut several leaves or other decorative shapes from the pastry scraps.  Place 1 piece of pastry on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut the Brie in 1/2 horizontally and lay 1 piece in the center of the pastry sheet, cut side up.  Spread the cooled crabmeat mixture over the cut Brie and top with the remaining Brie 1/2, gently pushing the 2 halves together.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Paint the edges of the bottom piece of pastry with the egg wash.  Top the cheese with the remaining pastry sheet, pinching the edges together to seal.  Paint the top pastry lightly with the egg wash, being careful not to let any drip down the sides.  Arrange the decorative leaves on top, and lightly paint with egg wash.  Bake until the pastry is puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line a platter with the watercress and place the baked brie on top.  Let sit for 5 minutes.  Surround with toast points and serve.

             Pork Medallions With Pears And Spaghetti Squash

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     spaghetti squash - (abt 4 lbs) -- halved lengthwise
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots -- plus
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  8                     pork medallions - (4 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  shallots
  2               cups  diced peeled cored firm-ripe pears
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh gingerroot
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon zest
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  Poire William
                        = (or eau de vie or brandy)
  1                cup  dark chicken stock
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish
     1/4           cup  toasted pumpkin seeds -- for garnish

In a Dutch oven or large pot, place the squash, cut-sides down.  Add enough water to come 2-inches up the sides of the squash and bring to a boil.  Cover and reduce the heat to a simmer.  Cook until tender and can easily be pierced with a knife, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove, drain, and let cool.

When cool enough to handle, using a fork, scrape the flesh from the skin, separating into long, spaghetti-like strands.  Discard the skins.

In a large saute pan or skillet, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons of the shallots and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the cinnamon and nutmeg, and stir.  Add the squash and toss to coat.  Cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

In a shallow dish, season the flour with the Essence.  Lightly dust the pork medallions, shaking to remove any excess.

In a clean, large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat.  In batches, add the seasoned medallions and cook until golden on both sides, about 6 minutes.  Remove and cover to keep warm.

Add the shallots to the pan and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the pears and cook, stirring until starting to color and soften, about 2 minutes.  Add the ginger, zest, wine, and eau de vie and bring to a boil, stirring to deglaze the pan.  When the wine is reduced to by half, add the stock and cook until thickened and reduced by half to 2/3.  Swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and add any accumulated juices from the resting pork.  Stir and remove from the heat.

To serve, place the spaghetti squash in the middle of 4 plates.  Arrange 2 medallions on top of each and spoon the sauce over the top.  Garnish with the parsley and pumpkin seeds and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a Dutch oven or large pot, place the squash, cut-sides down.  Add enough water to come 2-inches up the sides of the squash and bring to a boil.  Cover and reduce the heat to a simmer.  Cook until tender and can easily be pierced with a knife, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove, drain, and let cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When cool enough to handle, using a fork, scrape the flesh from the skin, separating into long, spaghetti-like strands.  Discard the skins.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large saute pan or skillet, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons of the shallots and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the cinnamon and nutmeg, and stir.  Add the squash and toss to coat.  Cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm until ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a shallow dish, season the flour with the Essence.  Lightly dust the pork medallions, shaking to remove any excess.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a clean, large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat.  In batches, add the seasoned medallions and cook until golden on both sides, about 6 minutes.  Remove and cover to keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the shallots to the pan and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the pears and cook, stirring until starting to color and soften, about 2 minutes.  Add the ginger, zest, wine, and eau de vie and bring to a boil, stirring to deglaze the pan.  When the wine is reduced to by half, add the stock and cook until thickened and reduced by half to 2/3.  Swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and add any accumulated juices from the resting pork.  Stir and remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, place the spaghetti squash in the middle of 4 plates.  Arrange 2 medallions on top of each and spoon the sauce over the top.  Garnish with the parsley and pumpkin seeds and serve.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     catfish fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  4          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2              large  Idaho russet potatoes -- peeled, and passed
                        through a vegetable shredder, soaking in
                        cool water
                        Mustard -- for coating
     1/4           cup  olive oil

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4              whole  trout - (8 oz ea) -- cleaned
                        = (or other small freshwater fish)
  16            slices  presunto* or prosciutto - (abt 16 oz)
                        Olive oil -- for pan frying
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped garlic
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
                        = (Portuguese Vinho Verde recommended)
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/2         pound  butter - (2 sticks) -- cut into pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Presunto is a cured Portuguese ham similar to prosciutto.  It is available in specialty Portuguese shops.  Substitute with prosciutto.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, Essence and salt.  Lightly dust both sides of the fish with the flour mixture, shaking to remove any excess.  Wrap each fish on the bias with the presunto, overlapping the slices slightly to completely enclose the fish.

In a large skillet, heat enough oil to come 1/2-inch up the sides over medium-high heat.  Add 2 fish at a time and pan-fry until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Using a slotted spatula, transfer to paper towels to drain.  Add more olive oil to the skillet as needed and cook the remaining fish.

Meanwhile, in a heavy saucepan, combine the garlic with the white wine and lemon juice.  Simmer over medium heat until reduced to 1 tablespoon.  Add the water, stir to combine, and heat for 15 seconds.  Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time, adding each piece before the previous one has been completely incorporated.  Continue until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, removing the pan from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from getting too hot and breaking.  Remove from the heat and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

Place the fish on 4 dinner plates and drizzle with the sauce.  Garnish with the parsley and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The Portuguese version of prosciutto is "presunto" not widely available in the United States.

* Presunto is a cured Portuguese ham similar to prosciutto.  It is available in specialty Portuguese shops.  Substitute with prosciutto.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, Essence and salt.  Lightly dust both sides of the fish with the flour mixture, shaking to remove any excess.  Wrap each fish on the bias with the presunto, overlapping the slices slightly to completely enclose the fish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large skillet, heat enough oil to come 1/2-inch up the sides over medium-high heat.  Add 2 fish at a time and pan-fry until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Using a slotted spatula, transfer to paper towels to drain.  Add more olive oil to the skillet as needed and cook the remaining fish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, in a heavy saucepan, combine the garlic with the white wine and lemon juice.  Simmer over medium heat until reduced to 1 tablespoon.  Add the water, stir to combine, and heat for 15 seconds.  Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time, adding each piece before the previous one has been completely incorporated.  Continue until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, removing the pan from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from getting too hot and breaking.  Remove from the heat and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the fish on 4 dinner plates and drizzle with the sauce.  Garnish with the parsley and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  The Portuguese version of prosciutto is &quot;presunto&quot; not widely available in the United States.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  Idaho potatoes - (abt 1 lb ea)
                        = (large enough to hold a dove or quail
                        inside)
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              large  cleaned quails - (6 oz ea) -- rinsed, patted dry
  8                     fresh sage leaves -- divided
  4             ounces  prosciutto di San Daniele -- cut long thin slices
  4        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  1                cup  dry white wine -- divided
  2        tablespoons  brandy
  1         tablespoon  roughly-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  2        tablespoons  bacon fat or butter
     1/4           cup  minced onions
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  6             ounces  chicken livers -- rinsed, patted dry,
                        and chopped
  8             ounces  fresh porcini mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        stems trimmed, and roughly chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1         tablespoon  drained capers
                        Grilled Radicchio -- (listed below)
                        Chopped parsley -- for garnish
                        Black grapes -- for garnish
                        === GRILLED RADICCHIO ===
  2              heads  radicchio -- quartered
                        Olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Rub each potato with 1/2 teaspoon of the olive oil, and season lightly with salt and black pepper.  Place on a heavy baking sheet and bake until very tender, about 1 1/2 hours.  Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.

Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise.  With a melon baller or small spoon, scoop out the pulp into a large mixing bowl, leaving a thin potato border along the skin.  Place the potato shells on a baking sheet and reserve the potato flesh for another use.

Salt and pepper the quails inside and out, and place 1 sage leaf inside each.  Wrap each quail in prosciutto.

In a large ovenproof saute or braising pan, heat the remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil and melt the 2 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat.  Add the wrapped quail and cook until browned on all sides, 6 to 7 minutes.  Remove the quail from the pan.  Add 1/2 cup of the white wine, brandy, 4 sage leaves, and 1 tablespoon of rosemary and bring to a boil, stirring to deglaze the pan.  Cook until the liquid is slightly reduced, about 2 minutes.  Return the quail to the pan and cover tightly.  Roast until the quail are cooked through and the leg meat is just pink, 10 minutes, basting once.

Remove from the oven.  Place 1 quail into 4 potato halves and cover with the remaining potato halves and place in a gratin dish.  Deglaze the saute pan that held the quail with white wine over medium-high heat and, stirring, cook until the pan juices are reduced by half.  Remove from the heat and pour over the potatoes.  Return to the oven to bake until hot, about 5 to 8 minutes.

In a large skillet heat the bacon fat over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the livers, mushrooms, the parsley, capers, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper, stirring to break up into small pieces.  Cook until the mushroom liquor has almost all evaporated and the livers are almost no longer pink.  Add the reduced pan juices and the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and stir to combine.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Remove the quail from the oven.  Place 1 quail-stuffed potato on each of 4 plates.  Serve with Grilled Radicchio, top with the sauce and garnish with bunches of black grapes and chopped parsley.

For the Grilled Radicchio:  Preheat a grill.

Drizzle the radicchio with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Place on the grill and grill under tender, about 8 minutes, turning often to cook evenly.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     acorn squash - (1 1/4 lbs) -- halved lengthwise,
                        then cut into crescents, seeds and fibers
                        removed
  6        tablespoons  melted butter -- divided
  1           teaspoon  light brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  3             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
  4             slices  rye bread -- cut into cubes
     1/4           cup  pure maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  creme fraiche
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  prepared horseradish
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         bunch  frisee or chicory -- tough stems
                        removed, rinsed and spun dry
  5               cups  mesclun lettuces -- rinsed, spun dry
     1/4           cup  chopped walnuts
  8             ounces  thick-cut bacon -- cut thick strips,
                        fried until crisp, and drained

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a bowl, toss the squash crescents with 2 tablespoons of the butter, the sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of the Essence to coat.  Place in a roasting pan or baking dish.  Cover with aluminum foil and roast, shaking the pan occasionally to prevent from sticking, until the squash is tender but still slightly firm, 20 to 30 minutes.  Remove and let cool.

In a bowl, whisk together the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Whisk in the goat cheese.  Add the bread cubes and toss to evenly coat.  Place on a small baking sheet and bake until toasted and bubbly, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the maple syrup and creme fraiche.  Add the vinegar, horseradish, salt and pepper and whisk until smooth.  Slowly add the remaining 1/3 cup of oil, whisking constantly until emulsified.

In a large bowl, combine the frisee and mesclun lettuces.  Add the squash, croutons, and walnuts, and enough dressing to lightly coat.  Toss to combine and adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Divide the lettuces among 4 salad plates and top with the bacon lardons.  Drizzle with additional dressing and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Alaskan salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper -- plus
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                     Granny Smith apple -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into small dice
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  hard cider
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/2         pound  cold unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- cut into pieces
                        === HERBED POTATO CAKES ===
  2                     Idaho potatoes - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, grated
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley -- leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon -- leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil -- leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        === GARNISH ===
                        American farmed caviar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Grease a baking sheet with the oil.  Season both sides of the salmon fillets with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and place on the baking sheet.  Roast until the center is still slightly pink, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven.

Meanwhile, to make the Granny Smith apple butter sauce, in a medium saucepan, combine the diced apples, sugar, and hard cider.  Cook over medium-high heat until the apples are translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the cream and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Add the butter several pieces at a time, whisking constantly to blend, and removing from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from breaking.  Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon white pepper and whisk to blend.  Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm until ready to serve, stirring occasionally.

Place 1 potato cake on each plate and top with a salmon fillet.  Drizzle each portion with the apple butter.  Top with 1/4 of the salmon and garnish with 1 teaspoon of the caviar.  Serve immediately.

For the Herbed Potato Cakes:  Rinse the potatoes in a large bowl of water and drain well.  Transfer to a dish towel and wring dry.  If necessary, wring again in a second towel.  Place in a large bowl and add the remaining ingredients.  Stir to mix well.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a medium skillet.  Divide the potato mixture into fourths.  Form each portion into a 4-inch round cake, about 1/2-inch thick, squeezing out the excess moisture.  Place 2 cakes in the hot pan and cook until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes per side, turning several times.  Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels.  Wipe the pan clean with a paper towel and repeat with the remaining ingredients.  (Makes 4 cakes)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Cocoa Powder
                        Powdered sugar
                        Caramel sauce -- in a squeeze bottle
                        with a very small tip
                        Chocolate Sauce
  2             ounces  vanilla vodka
                        = (Stoli Vanilla recommended)
  2             ounces  white creme de cacao
  2             ounces  Praline New Orleans Style Pecan Liqueur
                        Crushed ice
                        Roasted pecan halves -- for garnish
                        Roughly-chopped chocolate squares -- for garnish

First, sweeten the cocoa powder to your liking by mixing the cocoa and powdered sugar.  Take a large martini glass and very carefully coat the rim in caramel sauce from the squeeze bottle, being careful not to let it drip too far down the sides.

Then, dip the entire rim of the glass into the sweetened cocoa powder, being sure to coat all of the caramel.  The desired effect is a chocolate dusted caramel rim.  If available, I also like to put just a drop of chocolate syrup at the bottom of the glass for color.

For the drink, shake the vodka, creme de cacao and praline liqueur in a martini shaker with ice to chill.  Fill the martini glass nearly full with crushed or shaved ice, being careful not to touch the rim.  Strain the drink into the martini glass.

Garnish atop the floating ice with a roasted pecan half and a small piece of chopped chocolate.  Alternately, I have garnished it with a half of a Turtle candy by making an incision and hanging it on the rim of the glass.  Whichever you prefer.

Also, if you prefer your martini to LOOK chocolatey, I would use the dark creme de cacao.  However, I find the decorative elements (powder and garnish) stand out when the drink is more translucent.

This recipe yields 1 drink.

First, sweeten the cocoa powder to your liking by mixing the cocoa and powdered sugar.  Take a large martini glass and very carefully coat the rim in caramel sauce from the squeeze bottle, being careful not to let it drip too far down the sides.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Then, dip the entire rim of the glass into the sweetened cocoa powder, being sure to coat all of the caramel.  The desired effect is a chocolate dusted caramel rim.  If available, I also like to put just a drop of chocolate syrup at the bottom of the glass for color.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the drink, shake the vodka, creme de cacao and praline liqueur in a martini shaker with ice to chill.  Fill the martini glass nearly full with crushed or shaved ice, being careful not to touch the rim.  Strain the drink into the martini glass.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Garnish atop the floating ice with a roasted pecan half and a small piece of chopped chocolate.  Alternately, I have garnished it with a half of a Turtle candy by making an incision and hanging it on the rim of the glass.  Whichever you prefer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Also, if you prefer your martini to LOOK chocolatey, I would use the dark creme de cacao.  However, I find the decorative elements (powder and garnish) stand out when the drink is more translucent.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 drink.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2             pounds  Andouille -- cut 1/2" pieces
                        = (or other spicy smoked link sausage)
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  1             bottle  dark beer - (12 oz)
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- crushed, and
                        their juices
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  6               cups  cooked red kidney beans -- drained, rinsed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  grated cheddar cheese -- for garnish
  1                cup  finely-chopped green onions -- for garnish

In a large heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the sausage and brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Add the onions, garlic, chili powder, Essence, and cumin and cook, stirring often, until soft, about 4 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with the beer and cook until the foam subsides, about 1 minute.

Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, and kidney beans to the pot.  Stir well and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the chili from sticking to the bottom of the pot.  Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.

Remove from the heat and transfer to a thermos.  To serve, ladle into bowls or thick cups.  Sprinkle each serving with grated cheese and green onions, and serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh lemongrass -- tough outer leaves
                        removed
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced peeled fresh ginger
  5              small  Thai chiles -- stemmed, and
                        lightly crushed
  4                     Kaffir lime leaves -- crushed
  3               cups  shrimp stock or fish stock
  1                cup  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- sliced
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  Thai nam pla -- or more to taste
                        = (or Vietnamese nuoc nam [fish sauce])
  1              pound  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1 1/2           cups  coconut milk
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === STEAMED JASMINE RICE: KHAO SUOY ===
  2               cups  jasmine rice
                        = (other long-grain white rice can be
                        substituted)
  3               cups  water

In the center of a 6-inch square piece of cheesecloth, place the lemongrass, ginger, chilies and lime leaves.  Draw up the sides to form a pouch and tie with kitchen twine.

In a large pot, combine the stock, mushrooms, fish sauce, and sachet in a large pot.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add the shrimp, coconut milk, and cilantro, and simmer until the shrimp are cooked, 3 to 4 minutes.

Remove from the heat and discard the sachet.  Season, to taste, with salt or additional fish sauce.  Serve with jasmine rice.

For the Steamed Jasmine Rice:  In a 2-quart saucepan, combine the rice and water and bring to a boil.  Cover tightly, reduce the heat to low, and cook undisturbed until the water is absorbed, 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let sit undisturbed for 10 minutes.  Fluff with a fork before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a variation on the classic soup Tom Kha Kai (Chicken-Coconut Soup with Ginger and Lemongrass), kicked up with shrimp instead of chicken.

     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil

To smoke the catfish, prepare a stovetop home smoker according to the manufacturer's directions.  Season the fish on both sides with the Essence.

Place the fillets, skin-side down, on the rack inside the home smoker.  Place over medium heat (or as directed by the manufacturer) and cook until firm and flakes easily, 20 to 30 minutes, depending upon the size of the fillets.  Remove from the heat and remove the fish from the smoker.  Let sit until cool enough to handle.

Line a terrine mold or loaf pan with plastic wrap and set aside.

In a bowl, lightly whip the cream to soft peaks.

In a large bowl, crumble the smoked fish.  Add the horseradish, lemon juice, salt, and hot sauce, and stir to combine.  Stir in the cream cheese, green onions, parsley, dill, and the whipped cream.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.

In a small saucepan, combine the gelatin and white wine.  Let sit for 3 minutes, then gently heat over low heat to dissolve the gelatin.  Remove from the heat.  Fold into the fish mixture.  Spread into the prepared terrine and refrigerate until set, 6 hours or overnight.

To serve, unwrap the terrine and place a platter or decorative plate on top.  Invert and remove the mold.  Remove the plastic wrap and discard.  Garnish with lemon wedges and serve with sliced cucumbers and croutons for spreading.  Serve as an hors d'oeuvre.

For the Creole Mustard Sauce:  In a blender or food processor, combine all the ingredients except the oil and process for 20 seconds.  With the machine running, add the oil in a steady stream through the feed tube and process until smooth and thick.  Adjust the seasoning to taste.

Place in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 12 hours before serving.  (Makes about 3/4 cup)

This recipe yields 1 terrine, 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     turkey wings -- separated at
                        joints, tips removed, rinsed well and
                        patted dry
  5        tablespoons  Essence -- plus
  3        tablespoons  Essence -- plus for seasoning
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  3        tablespoons  hot sauce

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place coated wings on a large wire rack set over a sheet tray and let rest, un-refrigerated, for 20 minutes.  Add to the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes per side.  Drain on paper towels and season with Essence.  Place on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, or until cooked through.

Serve hot or at room temperature with Emeril's Kicked Up Horseradish Coleslaw.

             Sticky Rice With Coconut Sauce - {Kha Niao Man}

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  Thai sticky rice (khao niao)
  1                can  unsweetened coconut milk - (19 oz)
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2                     mangoes -- peeled, sliced
  6                     mint sprigs

In a large bowl, combine the rice and enough water to cover by 2-inches.  Soak for at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours.  Drain.

Inside a wok, place a bamboo steamer and line the steamer with parchment paper.  Add enough water to come up just below the bottom steamer rack, 1 to 1 1/2 inches.  Bring the water to a boil.  Add the rice to the bottom steamer rack, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and steam until rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer the rice to a bowl.

Open the coconut milk and skim the thick cream from the top into a small saucepan.  (Reserve the leftover coconut milk for another recipe.)  Add the sugar and salt to the coconut cream and bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, about 1 minute.  Pour over the rice, mix well, cover and set aside until liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes.

Serve at room temperature with mango slices.  Garnish with mint sprigs.  (The finished dish can be kept, covered, at room temperature for 6 to 8 hours.  Don't refrigerate or the rice will harden.)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This simple dessert is what the Thai would call a "sweet snack."  Dessert is not a popular course in Thailand because of the heat and humidity, but they do enjoy a light treat such as this or simply serve fruit at the end of the meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut 1" cubes
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  ground Szechwan pepper
  1                     Wide rice-stick noodles
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced gingerroot
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
     3/4           cup  chicken stock
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce -- or more to taste
  2        tablespoons  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
  3        tablespoons  peanut or vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped yellow onions
  1                     carrot -- thinly sliced
     1/2                red bell pepper -- cut 1" pieces
  1              small  zucchini -- halved lengthwise,
                        then into 1" pieces
  1                     celery stalk -- cut 1/2" slices
  1              bunch  baby bok choy -- bottoms trimmed,
                        rinsed well, and cut on the diagonal
  3             ounces  shiitake or button mushrooms -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  roasted chopped cashews
     1/2           cup  mung bean sprouts
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro

In a bowl, toss the chicken with the sugar, red pepper flakes, and Szechwan pepper.  Let sit.

To make the rice noodles, place 1/4 pound of rice stick noodles in a bowl, cover with boiling water and let stand until softened.  Drain, cover, and set aside until ready to serve.

To make the seasoning blend, in a blender or small food processor, combine the sesame oil, garlic cloves, ginger, and 2 tablespoons of the green onions, and puree on high speed.

To make the cooking sauce, in a small bowl, combine the chicken stock, soy and hoisin sauces.  In another small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the sherry.  Set aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the peanut oil to smoking in a wok or very large skillet over high heat.  Add the pureed seasoning blend and cook for 15 seconds.  Add chicken and stir-fry until mostly opaque, but not cooked through all the way, about 2 minutes.  Remove to a plate.  Add the remaining tablespoon of oil, then the onions, carrots, bell pepper, zucchini, and celery, and cook, stir-frying for 30 seconds.  Add the bok choy and mushrooms and cook for 1 minute.

Add the reserved cooking sauce and return the chicken to the wok.  Stir and toss until the sauce glazes the food and the chicken is cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the cornstarch mixture.  Return to the heat and return to a boil.  Cook, stirring, until thickened, about 1 minute.

Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of green onions, the cashews, bean sprouts, and cilantro.  Adjust seasoning to taste, with additional soy sauce, if desired.

Serve immediately over blanched rice noodles.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  1 1/4      teaspoons  active dry yeast
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  2               cups  all-purpose flour - (to 2 1/4)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2 1/2      teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  20            medium  raw shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        and cut in half lengthwise
     1/2           cup  tequila
                        = (Cabo Wabo recommended)
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, smashed
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro leaves -- plus
                        extra for garnish
  1           teaspoon  grated lime zest
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        Cornmeal -- for dusting peel
  8             ounces  Mexican chorizo -- chopped
                        Cilantro Pesto -- (listed below)
  1 1/2           cups  grated Monterey jack cheese
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into long strips
     1/2        medium  white onion -- cut into rings
  4             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
                        Chopped green onions -- for garnish
                        === CILANTRO PESTO ===
  2               cups  fresh cilantro leaves - (tightly packed)
     1/4           cup  lightly-toasted pine nuts
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
     1/4           cup  grated cotija, queso fresco, or Parmesan
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  olive oil

In a large mixing bowl, stir together the water, yeast, and sugar.  Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.  Add 2 cups of the flour, salt, and 2 teaspoons of the oil, stirring with a heavy wooden spoon to incorporate.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and pliable, yet slightly sticky, 5 minutes, adding more flour as needed 2 teaspoons at a time to prevent from sticking to the board.

Lightly oil a large mixing bowl with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil.  Place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with the oil.  Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm, draft-free place.  Allow the dough to rise until nearly double in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

At least 45 minutes before baking pizza, put a pizza stone on the bottom rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

While the dough is rising, marinate the shrimp.  In a large bowl, combine the shrimp, tequila, lime juice, crushed garlic, cilantro, lime zest, pepper flakes, kosher salt, and cumin.  Let marinate for no more than 1 hour.  Remove the shrimp from the marinade and pat dry.

In a skillet, cook the sausage over medium-high heat until the fat is rendered and almost completely cooked through, about 4 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Let cool.

On a lightly floured surface turn out the dough and lightly work into a large flat disk.  Let rest for 10 minutes.  Pat and stretch out the dough to a 12-inch round, turning and lifting to make about 1/8-inch thick.

Dust a baker's peel or bottom of a baking sheet with the cornmeal.  Carefully transfer the dough onto the peel and reshape as necessary without pressing down hard (so the dough will come away easily).  Working quickly, spread cilantro pesto across the dough to cover, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge.  Sprinkle the grated cheese evenly over the top, then arrange the shrimp, bell peppers, onions, and cooked sausage over the top.  Dot the pizza with the goat cheese.

Line up the peel over the baking stone and slide to release the pizza.  (Alternately, bake on the baking sheet.)  Bake until the dough is crisp and golden brown and the cheeses are melted and bubbly, about 8 minutes.  Transfer with the peel to a large cutting board.  Let sit for 5 minutes.

Garnish with chopped cilantro and green onions, to taste.  Cut into slices, and if desired, drizzle with additional pesto sauce.

For the Cilantro Pesto:  In a food processor or blender, combine the cilantro, pine nuts, and garlic, and puree on high speed.  Add the cheese, pepper and salt, and process to combine.  Scrape the sides of the processor, and with the machine running, add the olive oil.  Blend until well combined.  (Makes about 3/4 cup)

This recipe yields 1 large pizza.

     1/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
                        Grated cheddar cheese -- garnish
                        = (Longhorn recommended)
                        Minced yellow onions -- for garnish
                        Cornbread, corn muffins, or garlic bread -- optional
                        accompaniment

In a large, heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the meat and Essence, and stir with a long-handled wooden spoon to break up the pieces.  Cook, stirring, until the meat is brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Add the onions, garlic, jalapeÒos, chili powder, pepper flakes, paprika, cumin, oregano and salt, and cook, stirring, until the onions are soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and their juices, beer, and stock.  Stir well and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the meat is tender and cooked through, about 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

In a small bowl, dissolve the masa in the water and stir to make a thick paste.  Add to the chili and stir to incorporate.  Cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the cilantro.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Ladle into chili bowls.  Sprinkle with grated cheese and minced onions.  Serve with hot cornbread, muffins or garlic bread, as desired.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                              Thai Iced Tea

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  water
  1                cup  Thai tea
     3/4           cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  cream
  6        tablespoons  condensed milk

In a kettle, bring the water to a boil.  Place the tea in a teapot or glass container.  Pour the water over the tea and let steep until bright orange in color, 3 to 5 minutes.  Strain into a clean container, such as a pitcher (or, if in tea bags, remove the bags).  Add sugar and stir to dissolve.  Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Fill 6 tall glasses with crushed ice and add tea to 3/4 full.  Add 1 tablespoon cream and 1 tablespoon condensed milk to each glass.

Serve with iced-tea spoon so guests can swirl the mixture themselves.

This recipe yields 6 drinks.

Comments:  Thai red tea leaves are blended with star anise, cinnamon, and vanilla.  The steeped tea then is flavored with sugar, and after being cooled is mixed with cream and often condensed milk for a refreshing creamy drink.

Categories    : Hors d'Oeuvres                  Venison

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless venison shoulder -- cubed
  8             ounces  cooked ham -- cubed
  8             ounces  pork fat -- cubed
     1/2           cup  Port
  2        tablespoons  Cognac
  2                     bay leaves -- crumbled
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon zest
  2          teaspoons  grated orange zest
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  cayenne
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2              large  egg whites
                        Toast points, crackers, or large croutons -- as accompaniment
                        Hot mustards or currant jam -- as accompaniment

In a large bowl, combine the venison, ham, pork fat, Port, Cognac, bay leaves, garlic, lemon and orange zests, allspice, pepper, and cayenne.  Toss to coat evenly.  Cover, refrigerate, and marinate for 8 hours.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a 4- by 8 1/2-inch loaf pan.

Drain the meat mixture in a colander.  Discard the liquid and the bay leaves.  Add the parsley and salt.  Grind in a meat grinder fitted with a rough die, or pulse in batches in a food processor, leaving the meat chunky.  Place in a bowl and mix in the egg whites.

Transfer to the prepared pan, tapping on the counter to evenly distribute.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil and place in a large roasting pan.  Fill the roasting pan with water to come halfway up the sides of the terrine.  Bake until an instant read thermometer reads 160 degrees and the juices run yellow (not pink), 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.

Remove from the oven and remove the aluminum foil.  With a bulb baster, remove any excess fat on the surface.  Recover with aluminum and top with the bottom of an equal-sized pan.  Weight the pan with weights or large cans and refrigerate for 8 hours.

To serve, slice as desired and serve as an hors d'oeuvre or appetizer with toast points, mustard or jam.

This recipe yields 1 terrine, 10 to 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  fine dry bread crumbs
     1/3           cup  toasted almonds
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1              piece  manchego - (8 oz) -- rind removed and
                        cut into 4 equal rounds
                        = (the medium-aged variety - it should
                        not be too hard)
  1                     egg white -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  Sherry vinegar
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  assorted chopped fresh herbs
                        = (such as parsley, chives, basil, and
                        marjoram)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  6             ounces  mesclun -- rinsed, spun dry
                        = (or other salad greens)
  2              small  oranges -- segmented
     1/2           cup  toasted pinenuts
  4             ounces  Serrano ham -- cut chiffonade

                        Chives -- for garnish

In a food processor, pulse the bread crumbs, almonds, and Essence until the nuts are ground, being careful not to over-grind.  Place in a shallow dish.

Dip the cheese slices in the egg white, then into the bread crumb mixture, turning to coat on all sides and pressing to adhere.  Place on a plate, cover with plastic and refrigerate 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a bowl, combine the vinegar, shallots, garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper.  Slowly add the oil, whisking to make an emulsion.

Place the greens and orange segments in a large bowl and toss lightly with dressing to taste.  Adjust seasoning to taste.  Divide among 4 salad plates.

On a small, lightly greased baking sheet, bake the cheese rounds until golden brown and softened, about 5 minutes.  Remove and transfer 1 round to each salad.  Sprinkle the pine nuts and ham over the top of each salad, and garnish with the parsley sprigs and chives.

Serve immediately with warm croutons.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped shallots
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  8             ounces  wood ear or shiitake mushrooms -- stems trimmed,
                        wiped clean, and coarsely chopped
  8             ounces  fresh morel mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        wiped clean, and coarsely chopped
  8             ounces  fresh chanterelle mushrooms -- stems trimmed,
                        wiped clean, and coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh thyme

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  4             ounces  hot Italian sausage -- chopped or crumbled
     1/2           cup  minced yellow onions
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  1              small  butternut squash - (1 to 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, halved,
                        seeds and fibers removed, and diced
  2          teaspoons  light brown sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  2              large  zucchini -- ends trimmed
  8                     grouper, halibut or other firm mild
                        fish medallions - (3 oz ea) -- trimmed to
                        measure each abt 1 1/2" to 2" square
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- to make an egg wash
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Pinot Noir Butter Sauce -- (listed below)
                        Zucchini blossoms -- for garnish
                        Chopped chives -- for garnish
                        === PINOT NOIR BUTTER SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced shallots
     1/2           cup  pinot noir
                        = (or other dry red wine)
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
  2             sticks  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
                        Salt -- to taste

In a large saute pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the sausage and stir to break up into pieces.  Cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring, until soft, 3 minutes.  Add the squash and cook, stirring, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the sugar, salt, pepper, and chicken stock, and stir.  Cover and cook over medium heat until the squash is tender, 5 to 6 minutes.  Uncover, stir, and cook until the liquid is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat, adjust seasoning, to taste, and cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Using a mandolin or other slicing machine, cut the zucchini lengthwise into long ribbons, about 1/8-inch thick.  On a work surface, overlap 2 long zucchini ribbons to form a cross.  In the center of the cross, place 1 halibut medallion and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Brush a small amount of egg wash on each zucchini strip and fold alternately over the fish to form a tight package.  Lightly salt and pepper.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

In a large non-stick skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat.  Add the fish packages, folded-side down, and sear for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the butter, turn the fish and place in the oven until cooked through and tops are golden, 5 minutes.  Remove from the oven.

To serve, spoon the squash hash in the center of 4 plates.  Top each portion with 2 fish packages and nap with the Pinot Noir Butter Sauce.  Garnish each plate with zucchini blossoms and sprinkle with chopped chives.  Serve immediately.

For the Pinot Noir Butter Sauce:  In a medium saucepan, combine the shallots, wine and peppercorns and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced in volume by half, about 2 minutes.  Whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, adding each piece before the previous one has been completely incorporated.  Continue until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, removing the pan from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from getting too hot and breaking.

Strain into a clean container and use immediately.  (Makes 1 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.
