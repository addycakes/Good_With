                       Asian Spicy Barbecue Chicken

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
     1/2           cup  minced onion
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
     1/4         stick  cinnamon
     1/2                star anise
     1/4           cup  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/2           cup  plum sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  Chinese five spice powder
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1              whole  chicken -- cut into 8 pieces
     1/2                lime -- juiced

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a small saucepan set over medium-high heat, add the sesame and peanut oils.  Once the oils are hot, about 30 seconds, add the onions to the pan and cook, stirring often until the onions are soft and slightly translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, ginger, cinnamon and star anise to the pan and cook for 30 seconds.

Deglaze the pan with the lime juice and soy sauce.  Once the juice has reduced by half, add plum sauce, crushed red pepper flakes, water and mustard.  Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook the sauce for 5 minutes.  Remove the sauce from the heat and discard the cinnamon stick and star anise.  Reserve the sauce until ready to use.

Combine the kosher salt and Chinese five spice in a small bowl and stir to mix well.  Season the chicken with the salt mixture and set aside for 20 minutes.

Cook the chicken on a medium hot grill for 4 minutes then turn 45 degrees and cook for an additional 4 minutes.  Turn the chicken over and cook for 4 minutes before rotating it 45 degrees to cook for a final 5 minutes.

Remove the chicken from the grill and place on a sheet pan that has been lined with aluminum foil.  Squeeze lime juice over chicken, brush the chicken with the barbecue sauce, and place the sheet pan in the oven.  Cook the chicken for 10 minutes, remove from the oven and serve while warm.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : First Course                    Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  asparagus -- tough ends trimmed
                        and stalk bottoms peeled if necessary
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/3           cup  finely-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped tarragon leaves -- plus
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped tarragon leaves
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped chives
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh tarragon
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2         pound  fresh jumbo lump crabmeat -- picked over for
                        shells

Trim asparagus and cut stalks diagonally into 1-inch lengths.  Reserve tips separately.

In a large, heavy skillet, cook asparagus and onion in 3 tablespoons of the butter over medium-low heat until asparagus is tender, about 20 minutes.  Puree asparagus mixture in a food processor until very smooth.  If after pureeing the mixture you still have tough fibers, pass the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve before proceeding.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees and lightly coat the inside of 6 (1/2-cup) ramekins with the remaining tablespoon of butter.

Transfer the pureed asparagus mixture to a mixing bowl and whisk in the eggs, heavy cream, cheese, 1 teaspoon tarragon, salt and pepper.  Divide the asparagus mixture evenly among the prepared ramekins and place ramekins in a large baking pan.  Add enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the pan, and bake, uncovered, until flans are set, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Transfer the ramekins to a wire rack to cool slightly.

While flans are cooking, blanch the asparagus tips in a small saucepan of salted water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Rinse under cool running water to keep from overcooking and set aside to drain.  In a mixing bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, chives, 2 teaspoons tarragon, lemon zest, Worcestershire Sauce, and salt and white pepper, to taste.  Add the crabmeat and reserved asparagus tips and toss gently but thoroughly to combine.  Reseason, if necessary.

When the flans have cooled slightly, run the tip of a paring knife around the edge of each flan and turn flans out onto serving plates.  Garnish each flan with some of the crabmeat mixture and serve immediately.  Flans are equally delicious served hot, warm, or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 first course servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GLAZE ===
  3               cups  apple cider
  1                cup  apple cider vinegar
  1                cup  apple sauce
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced ginger
     1/2         stick  cinnamon
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split in half
                        lengthwise and seeds scraped
  6                     cardamom pods
  2          teaspoons  allspice berries
  1 1/2      teaspoons  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === RIBS ===
  4             pounds  baby back ribs - (to 5)
                        = (2 full slabs, each cut in half)
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  paprika
     3/4      teaspoon  granulated garlic powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  granulated onion powder
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2           cup  apple cider

To make the glaze, place all of the ingredients for the glaze in a 6-quart pot and cook over medium-high heat.  Bring the contents of the pot to a boil, stirring often to dissolve the sugar.  Once the mixture has come to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, and allow the mixture to reduce to a glaze consistency, about 30 to 35 minutes longer.  Remove the glaze from the stove and strain through a fine-mesh strainer.  Reserve until ready to use.

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.

Place the ribs on a full sheet pan.  In a small mixing bowl, combine the kosher salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and cayenne.  Stir well to incorporate, and use 1 tablespoon of the spice rub to cover each of the ribs.  Rub the mixture into the meat, and allow it to sit undisturbed for at least 20 minutes.

Pour the cider into the sheet pan, and wrap the ribs with aluminum foil to make a tight seal.  Place the sheet pan in the oven and bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the ribs are very tender. Remove the ribs from the oven, discard the foil and the fat and oil from the sheet pan, and allow the ribs to cool for 15 to 20 minutes.

Adjust the oven to the broil setting and position the oven rack on the lowest rung.  Brush the ribs with a generous coating of the glaze, about 3 tablespoons of the glaze per set of ribs.  Place the sheet pan back in the oven, and broil until the ribs are browned and caramelized, about 5 minutes.

Remove the ribs from the oven and lay on a cutting board meaty-side down.  Use a sharp knife to cut the ribs apart.  Serve the ribs with some of the leftover glaze on the side, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

To make the glaze, place all of the ingredients for the glaze in a 6-quart pot and cook over medium-high heat.  Bring the contents of the pot to a boil, stirring often to dissolve the sugar.  Once the mixture has come to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, and allow the mixture to reduce to a glaze consistency, about 30 to 35 minutes longer.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Bourbon whiskey
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1                cup  chopped yellow onion
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1                     jalapeÒo -- seeds and stem
                        removed, and minced
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1                cup  ketchup
     3/4           cup  brewed strong black coffee
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  cane syrup or dark molasses
  1         tablespoon  hot red pepper sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2              whole  racks baby back pork ribs - (abt 4 lbs) -- cut in half

Place the bourbon in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Simmer until reduced to 1/3 cup.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, Essence, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, pepper, and lemon and cook, stirring for 30 seconds.  Add the ketchup, coffee, sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire, cane syrup, and hot sauce, and bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Add the bourbon and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.

Remove from the heat.  With a hand-held immersion blender, or in batches in a food processor, puree on high speed until smooth.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Place the ribs in a large non-reactive dish and cover with the barbecue sauce.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let marinate, refrigerated, for 12 to 24 hours.

Prepare a charcoal or gas grill to medium heat.  Remove the ribs from the marinade, shaking to remove any excess.  Place the rib sections, meaty-side up, in the grill.  Cover and cook until marinade starts to set, 10 to 15 minutes.  Turn and baste lightly.  Cover and grill until nearly cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.  Turn and baste again.  Cook uncovered without basting until the sauce is thick and the ribs are completely cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes.  Discard any unused marinade.

Remove from the grill and serve hot.

                          Baked Semolina Gnocchi

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1              quart  whole milk
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly grated nutmeg
  1 1/2           cups  semolina 00-grade flour - (to 2 cups)
  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Grease a small baking sheet with 1 teaspoon of the butter and set aside.  Butter a piece of parchment paper the same size as the baking sheet with 1/2 teaspoon of the butter and set aside, buttered side-up.  Butter a 9-inch square baking pan with 1 teaspoon of butter and set aside.

Combine the milk, salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a medium, heavy pot.  Bring to a boil.  Add 1/4 cup of the semolina, and whisk constantly until the mixture begins to thicken.  Lower the heat to medium-low.  Continue to cook, stirring constantly with a heavy, wooden spoon, adding the remaining semolina flour 1/4 cup at a time, about 12 minutes.  The mixture should be very stiff and thick.  Remove from the heat and let rest 5 minutes.

Beat the eggs in a large bowl.  Add 1/2 cup of the semolina mixture to the eggs and whisk well to incorporate.  Add the eggs to the remaining semolina mixture and stir as hard as possible to blend.  Add 1/4 cup of the cheese and stir well to blend.  Turn out the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet and using an off-set cake spreader or rubber spatula, spread across the bottom.  Place the buttered parchment paper directly on the batter.  With an outward motion, spread the batter evenly across the pan and smooth the top.  Refrigerate until completely cooled, 20 to 25 minutes.

With a knife, cut the batter into 24 equal pieces, about 1 1/2-inches square, dipping the knife in hot water as needed to cut cleanly.  Lay the pieces in 4 rows in the prepared 9-inch pan, shingling them to fit.  Dot the top with the remaining butter and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese.  Bake until the top begins to brown and the gnocchi are puffed, about 25 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This isn't the potato gnocchi commonly found on Italian restaurant menus.  Instead, it's a recipe typical of Italy's Emilia-Romagna region, also referred to Parisian gnocchi.  We used coarse grain, "00"-graded semolina flour to make this gnocchi.  And though this may not look like much, one bite will tell you it's a special dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter -- softened, and
                        at room temperature
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest -- finely grated
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar
  12       tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut into pieces
  1                     egg
  1           teaspoon  orange-flavored liqueur
                        = (Grand Marnier recommended)
                        === FILLING ===
     3/4           cup  fresh blood orange juice
  1                     orange -- zested, and
                        zest finely grated
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar
     1/3           cup  mascarpone cheese
  3              large  eggs
  3                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  orange-flavored liqueur -- (optional)
                        = (Grand Marnier recommended)
                        Confectioners' sugar -- (optional), for
                        garnish

Butter an 11-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom with 2 teaspoons of butter and set aside.

Make the pastry by combining the flour, salt, lemon zest, and confectioners' sugar in a mixing bowl.  Add the butter and, using a pastry cutter, 2 knives, or your hands, work in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Combine the egg and orange liqueur in a small bowl and add to the flour mixture.  Using a fork, stir until the mixture just comes together.  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead just until a dough is formed.  Shape into a flattened disk, wrap in plastic, and transfer the dough to the freezer for 15 minutes.

Place the dough on a floured surface and roll into a 13-inch round.  Transfer dough to the prepared tart pan and ease dough into the edges and up the sides of the pan.  Trim excess dough.  Transfer to the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Remove the tart shell from the refrigerator and prick it all over with the tines of a fork.  Line the pastry with aluminum foil or parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake the crust until the edges just begin to turn golden, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and remove the pie weights and aluminum foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the crust is light golden brown.  Remove from the oven and set aside on a wire rack to cool.

Make the filling by combining the blood orange juice, orange zest, brown sugar, and mascarpone in a mixing bowl; whisk until smooth.  Add the eggs and egg yolks, 1 at a time, beating after each addition.  Add the liqueur and stir until smooth.  Pour the filling into the cooled tart shell.  Bake until the filling is lightly browned in spots and the crust is golden, about 25 minutes.  Let cool completely.  Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  2             medium  carrots -- coarsely chopped
  1                cup  white wine
  1                cup  chicken stock

Lightly pound or butterfly the breast of veal until it measures roughly 15 by 13 inches.  Season on both sides with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.

In a mixing bowl, combine the bread crumbs, pancetta, Parmesan, olive oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, garlic, minced rosemary, Essence, and lemon zest and stir until the mixture resembles wet sand.  Spread the bread crumb mixture evenly over the pounded portion of the veal to within 1-inch from all edges.  Carefully roll the meat lengthwise and tie every 1 1/2 inches with kitchen twine.  (Roast can be assembled to this point up to 8 hours or overnight ahead of time, and then brought back to room temperature before proceeding.)  Reserve any bread crumb mixture that falls out of the ends of the roast as you are tying it.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large Dutch oven over medium high heat, heat the reserved rendered fat and, when very hot, brown the roast on all sides, turning occasionally, about 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove the veal from the pan and add the onions and carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly caramelized, about 4 minutes.  Add the white wine, chicken stock, remaining 3 tablespoons of lemon juice, rosemary sprigs, remaining teaspoon of salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper and return the veal to the pan.  Add any reserved bread crumb mixture.  When the liquid comes to a boil, cover the Dutch oven and transfer to the oven.  Cook, turning occasionally, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until the veal is very tender.

Remove from the oven and transfer the roast to a platter.  Cover loosely with aluminum foil and let stand for 15 to 30 minutes before removing the kitchen twine and slicing into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Serve with the braising liquid.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

     1/2      teaspoon  Italian seasoning
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Place the lettuce in a large salad bowl and add the croutons, dressing and Parmesan.  Toss to coat evenly.  Top with grilled shrimp and then serve immediately.

For the Grilled Shrimp:  Preheat a grill or broiler to medium-high.  Combine the shrimp, Essence and oil in a mixing bowl and toss to combine.  Thread the shrimp onto 4 skewers.  When the grill is hot, place the shrimp on the grill and cook for about 2 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through.  Serve on top of the Caesar 'Lite' salads.

This recipe yields 4 main course salads or 6 to 8 side salads.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced yellow onions
  1              large  leek, white part only -- cut into strips and
                        washed in several changes of water
  2                     garlic cloves -- roughly chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley -- plus
                        more for garnish
  1                     bay leaf
  4             pounds  mussels -- beards removed,

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  reserved beef fat, butter or vegetable oil -- plus
  4        tablespoons  reserved beef fat, butter or vegetable oil
                        = (or a combination)
  6                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  milk
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  4             ounces  goat cheese -- cut or crumbled
                        into 18 to 20 equal pieces

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Brush 18 to 20 wells of 2 popover or muffin tins with some of the melted fat.  Place tins in the oven to heat while you prepare the popover batter.

Combine the eggs, flour, salt, thyme, rosemary, and pepper in a blender and blend until well combined.  Using a spatula, scrape down the sides of the blender.  While the blender is running, add the milk and cream in a slow stream until smooth and thoroughly combined.

Remove tins from the oven and fill each prepared well halfway with some of the batter.  Place a piece of the cheese in the center of each cup and pour the remaining batter over so that the cups are filled 2/3 of the way.  Bake the popovers until puffed and golden, 20 to 25 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 18 to 20 popovers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pieces  beef top round, abt 1/2" thk - (8 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  1               pint  oysters -- drained
                        === CREAM GRAVY ===
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  finely chopped onion
     1/2           cup  finely-sliced green onions
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2 1/2           cups  milk

Using a meat mallet, vigorously pound each steak until well tenderized and about 1/8-inch thick.

In a large bowl combine the flour with 3 tablespoons Essence.  In another large bowl combine the buttermilk with the remaining 1 tablespoon Essence.

Coat the steak with the flour.  Shake off the excess flour, dip the steaks in the buttermilk and then coat again with the flour.  Place the coated steaks on a rack over a sheet tray until ready to fry.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.

Heat 1/2-inch of oil in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until almost smoking.  Fry the steaks in the hot oil until golden brown and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side.

When the steak is done, transfer to a paper-lined tray or plate to drain, and keep warm in the oven while you fry the oysters and make the gravy.

Coat the oysters with the flour.  Shake off the excess flour, dip the oysters in the buttermilk and then coat again with flour.  Fry the oysters in the hot oil until golden brown and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes.  Transfer the oysters to another paper-lined tray and place in the oven.  Reserve pan with fond to make the gravy.

Serve the steaks topped with the gravy, then the oysters.  Garnish with remaining 1/4 cup green onions.

Cream Gravy:  To make the gravy, carefully pour out most of the hot oil from the skillet, leaving the crumbly bits on the bottom.  Add the flour to the skillet and cook it, stirring, with the crumbly bits and oil for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the onion, 1/4 cup green onions, salt, pepper and Essence and saute until vegetables are tender, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Whisk in the milk little by little, until thoroughly combined.  Cook until the sauce is smooth and thickened, about 5 to 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  thick-cut bacon -- cut 3/4" dice
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
                        Essence -- recipe follows
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
     1/2           cup  Calvados
  1                cup  apple cider
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced red apples
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        Fresh chives -- for garnish

In a large, heavy saucepan, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until crisp and the fat is rendered, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat.

Season the chicken on both sides with Essence.  Dredge in the flour to coat lightly, shaking to remove any excess.  Add the chicken to the fat in the pan and cook over medium-high heat until golden brown on both sides and nearly cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.  Remove and cover to keep warm.

Add the onions to the pan and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the Calvados and cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan.  Simmer until reduced by half.  Add the cider, bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half.  Add the apples and cook, stirring, until tender, about 2 minutes.  Add the cream and simmer until reduced by half.

Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the butter, several pieces at a time, and cook, stirring, until each is incorporated.  Stir in the thyme.  Return the chicken and any accumulated juices to the pan and cook until the chicken is heated through and cooked all the way, turning, 1 to 2 minutes.

Remove from the heat and divide the chicken and sauce among 4 plates.  Garnish each serving with the bacon and fresh chives and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  dried shiitake mushrooms
  10              cups  chicken stock
                        = (or low-sodium chicken broth)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
     3/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/2         pound  chicken or tofu -- cut into small
                        bite-size strips or chunks
     1/4           cup  lime juice
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
  3        tablespoons  mushroom flavored soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
                        Hot chile oil -- for drizzling
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced scallions

Combine shiitake mushrooms and 3 cups of the chicken stock in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Remove from heat and let stand until mushrooms are tender and broth is flavorful, about 30 minutes.  Remove mushrooms and discard stems.  Thinly slice caps and reserve.  Strain broth through a fine mesh sieve, combine with the remaining chicken stock and set aside.

In a medium saucepan heat the vegetable oil and, when hot, add the ginger, garlic and crushed red pepper; cook for 2 minutes, or until fragrant.  Add the chicken stock and reserved shiitakes and bring to a simmer.  Cook for 30 minutes.  Add the chicken or tofu and stir to combine.

In a small bowl or cup, combine the lime juice and cornstarch and stir until smooth.  Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the hot soup and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the soy sauce and sesame oil and serve the soup, drizzled with hot chile oil to taste, and garnished with some of the sliced scallions.

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 quarts soup; 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fryer chicken - (3 1/2 lbs)
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice -- plus
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        = (reserve lemon shell)
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  melted butter -- plus
  4        tablespoons  softened butter -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  honey
  1 1/2    tablespoons  soy sauce
  4        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

Prepare a clay roaster by soaking in cold water for 15 minutes.

Wash the chicken well inside and out under cool running water.  Pat dry with paper towels.  Rub chicken all over with 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice and season evenly on all sides with the salt and pepper.  Place the reserved lemon shell inside the chicken cavity.

Place the chicken inside the prepared clay roaster and brush with the melted butter.  Cover the roaster and transfer to a cold oven.  Set the oven temperature to 400 degrees and cook for 45 minutes.

Combine the remaining 1/4 cup of lemon juice, honey, and soy sauce in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until heated through.  In a small bowl, make a paste from the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter and the flour.  Whisk the butter-flour mixture into the melted honey-lemon-butter mixture.  Continue to cook until the sauce has thickened slightly.

Remove the clay cooker from the oven and pour the honey-butter mixture all over the chicken, making sure to evenly cover the breast and any exposed areas.  Cover the roaster and return the chicken to the oven for 45 minutes, or until it is cooked through and very tender.

Transfer the chicken to a platter or carving board, cut into pieces and serve immediately.  Transfer the sauce to a gravy boat for serving, or spoon some of the sauce over each piece of chicken.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Suggestion: orzo, rice pilaf, or cooked white rice.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             gallon  water
  2               cups  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  red chile flakes
  2                     ducks - (4 to 5 lbs ea) -- giblets and neck
                        removed, well rinsed and patted dry
                        === COFFEE-NOCELLO GLAZE ===
  2               cups  dark corn syrup
  1                cup  white vinegar
  6             ounces  Nocello (walnut flavored) liqueur
     1/2           cup  strong brewed coffee
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/4      teaspoon  coriander seeds
     1/2                cinnamon stick
                        === HARICOTS VERTS ===
  2              large  shallots -- sliced
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1              pound  haricots verts -- trimmed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley

To make the brining liquid, in a large, heavy pot combine the water, salt, peppercorns, and chile flakes, and bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat and submerge in an ice bath until cool.  Add the ducks and weight with a small plate to submerge in the brine.  Refrigerate at least 24 hours and up to 48 hours, turning occasionally to ensure that the ducks are evenly brined.

Remove the ducks from the brine.  Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil.  Add the ducks, 1 at a time, and poach for 3 minutes each.  Remove with tongs and place on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.  Pat dry with paper towels.  Pour 1/4 cup of the glaze onto the topside of each duck, rubbing to coat evenly.  Refrigerate uncovered for 24 hours, spreading an additional 1/4 cup of glaze on each duck 3 times.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Remove the ducks from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes.  Spread about 1/2 cup of glaze over each duck, rubbing to coat evenly.  Roast until deep golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.  Lower the temperature to 375 degrees and roast until the skin is a deep mahogany color and the juices run clear, 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours.  Add 1 cup of water every 30 minutes to the bottom of the roasting pan to prevent the dripping glaze from burning.  Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes before carving.

With poultry sheers, cut along either side of the backbone and remove.  With a sharp knife, cut through the breastplate and remove the rib cage.  Drizzle with additional glaze, if desired, and serve one duck half per person.

For the Coffee-Nocello Glaze:  Combine all the ingredients in a large, heavy saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the sauce is reduced by half to a thick syrup, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat, discard the cinnamon stick, and let cool before using.

For the Haricots Verts:  Saute the shallot in butter until translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add the haricots verts and saute until firm but cooked.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Toss with the parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BRINE ===
     3/4        gallon  water
  2               cups  white wine
  1 1/2           cups  orange juice
  1                cup  kosher salt
  1                cup  light brown sugar
     1/3           cup  chopped ginger
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
  4                     bay leaves
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
                        === TURKEY ===
  1              whole  turkey breast - (abt 6 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        === GLAZE ===
  1                     bag fresh cranberries - (12 oz)
     1/3           cup  chopped ginger
  2          teaspoons  orange zest
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  1 1/4           cups  water
     1/4           cup  orange-flavored liqueur
                        = (Grand Marnier recommended)

Combine all of the brining liquid ingredients in a large non-reactive container (a stockpot works well for this) and stir to dissolve the salt and sugar.  Rinse the turkey well under cold running water.  Place the turkey in the brine, cover, and refrigerate, turning occasionally, for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.

While the bird is brining, make the cranberry glaze by combining the cranberries, ginger, orange zest, sugar, orange juice, and water in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally, and reduce to a simmer.  Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until cranberries burst and sauce is very thick.  Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a mixing bowl to cool.  When cooled, add the liqueur and stir to combine.  Cover and refrigerate until you are ready to glaze the bird.  (Make sure to return the glaze to room temperature before serving.  If the glaze gets too thick, thin it with a bit of water.)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Remove the turkey from the brine and discard the brine.  Place the turkey, breast-side up, in an aluminum foil lined roasting pan.  Pat dry with paper towels.  Rub the turkey with the vegetable oil and sprinkle on all sides with Essence.

Roast the turkey until it is golden brown and almost done, about 1 hour and 20 to 30 minutes.  Remove the turkey from the oven and brush all over with about 1/3 cup of the cranberry glaze.  Return the turkey to the oven and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast registers 160 to 165 degrees, about 10 minutes longer.  (If the turkey begins to get too dark before it is cooked through, cover loosely with aluminum foil until it reaches the desired temperature.  Transfer to a platter and let rest at least 15 minutes before carving.

Carve into thin slices.  Serve with the remaining glaze passed at the table.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

                        === DUCK CONFIT ===
  1 1/2           cups  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  coarse black pepper
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme
  2                     bay leaves

  1              sprig  fresh thyme
                        === VANILLA-SHALLOT VINAIGRETTE ===
  4              whole  shallots - (abt 3 oz) -- peeled, and
                        stem ends removed
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper -- plus
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                     vanilla bean
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  Champagne vinegar
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  granulated sugar

Combine the duck confit, radicchio, endive, arugula, vinaigrette, pepper, and salt in a large bowl and toss well to combine.  Add the cheese and cherries and toss.  Divide among 4 salad plates and serve.

For the Duck Confit:  Combine salt, black pepper, chopped thyme, bay leaves, chopped rosemary, and 4 cloves of garlic in a medium bowl.  Stir to mix well.  Add the duck legs 1 at a time, firmly packing the salt mixture onto both sides.  Place the duck legs on a rack set over a baking sheet, skin-side down, and top with the remaining salt mixture.

Refrigerate uncovered at least 24 hours and up to 48 hours.

Preheat the oven to 225 degrees.

Rinse the duck under cold running water to remove the salt crust and pat dry.  Place in a medium roasting pan without overlapping and cover with the duck fat.  Place the remaining 2 cloves of garlic, the sprig of rosemary, and sprig of thyme on top.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil and roast until falling from the bone and the fat is completely rendered, 6 to 7 hours.  Remove from the oven and let cool at room temperature.

Transfer the duck to an airtight container with a lid, cover with the fat, cover, and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.

For the Vanilla-Shallot Vinaigrette:  Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Place the shallots in a small ovenproof saucepan.  Add the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper, and toss to combine.  Roast until tender and just beginning to color, 30 to 35 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool.  Thinly slice and place in a medium bowl.

Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and with the tip of sharp knife, scrape the seeds into the bowl with the shallots.  Add the split vanilla pod, olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, black pepper, sugar, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/8 teaspoon white pepper, and whisk well to combine.  Toss with the Duck Confit Salad, or as desired with other ingredients.  (Makes 3/4 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  milk
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-grated white pepper
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1              ounce  grated cheese
                        = (such as Swis, Gruyere, or Emmenthaler)
                        === CRISPY POTATO PANCAKES ===
     3/4         pound  russet potatoes - (abt 1 large)
  4             ounces  pancetta or bacon -- cooked until crisp,
                        drained and crumbled
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.

Prepare the Sauteed Spinach and keep warm while you prepare the remaining components.  Prepare the Mornay Sauce and keep warm while you prepare the remaining components.  Prepare the Crispy Potato Cakes and keep warm in the oven while you poach the eggs.

To poach the eggs:  Break the eggs into individual saucers or cups.  Fill a medium skillet halfway with water.  Add the vinegar and salt and bring to a boil.  Pour eggs into water, cover the skillet and remove from the heat.  Allow to sit 4 to 5 minutes.

When the eggs are ready, divide the potato cakes evenly between 2 dinner plates and top each with some of the creamed spinach.  Remove the eggs from the skillet with a slotted spoon and gently place on top of the creamed spinach and potato cakes.  Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.  Ladle some of the Mornay Sauce over the eggs and spinach, garnish with parsley, and serve.

For the Sauteed Spinach:  Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and saute for 1 minute.  Add the spinach and saute, stirring to wilt and combine with the shallots.  Season with salt and freshly ground pepper and a pinch freshly ground nutmeg, to taste.

For the Mornay Sauce:  In a small saucepan melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the roux is pale yellow and frothy, about 1 minute.  Do not allow the roux to brown.  Slowly whisk in the milk and continue to whisk until the sauce thickens and comes to a boil, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and season with the salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Allow to simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the cheese and whisk until melted.  If the sauce seems too thick, thin with a little milk.

Use sauce immediately or refrigerate, surface covered with plastic wrap, for several days in the refrigerator.  (Makes about 1 cup)

For the Crispy Potato Pancakes:  Peel the potato and put in cold water.  Using a mandoline, grater, or food processor, coarsely grate the potato.  Place in a fine-mesh sieve or strainer and squeeze out all of the potato liquid over a bowl.  After the starch has settled to the bottom of the bowl, carefully pour off the clear liquid, reserving the starch.  Add the grated potato to the starch in the bowl, along with the reserved crumbled bacon, egg, salt and pepper.

Heat a nonstick pan with a small amount of oil in the bottom of the pan.  When the oil is hot, take about one-quarter of the potato mixture in the palm of your hand and, using the other hand, flatten and squeeze to remove any excess liquid.  Place the potato mixture in the heated pan and cook, pressing down with a spatula to flatten, until crispy and golden, about 3 minutes on each side.  Transfer to a paper lined baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining potato cakes.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

              Fettuccine With Fresh Fava Beans And Pancetta

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh fava beans -- in their shells
  1              pound  dried fettuccine
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced pancetta -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2          head  escarole -- torn bite size
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  finely-grated Pecorino Romano -- plus
                        more for passing if desired

Shell the fava beans and blanch in boiling salted water for 2 minutes.  Drain and, when cool enough to handle, slip off the tough outer skin of the beans.  Discard skins and reserve beans on the side.

Heat a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the fettuccine, stirring often, until al dente.

While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and pancetta and cook until the onion is soft and the pancetta begins to crisp, about 7 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Add the favas and escarole to the pancetta and cook until the beans are tender, about 5 minutes.

When the pasta is al dente, drain, reserving 3/4 cup of the cooking liquid.  Add the pasta, reserved cooking liquid, and heavy cream to the fava mixture and cook, tossing to mix thoroughly, until everything is heated through.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Garnish with 2 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano and serve immediately.  Pass the extra grated cheese at the table.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Shell the fava beans and blanch in boiling salted water for 2 minutes.  Drain and, when cool enough to handle, slip off the tough outer skin of the beans.  Discard skins and reserve beans on the side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the fettuccine, stirring often, until al dente.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and pancetta and cook until the onion is soft and the pancetta begins to crisp, about 7 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Add the favas and escarole to the pancetta and cook until the beans are tender, about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the pasta is al dente, drain, reserving 3/4 cup of the cooking liquid.  Add the pasta, reserved cooking liquid, and heavy cream to the fava mixture and cook, tossing to mix thoroughly, until everything is heated through.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Garnish with 2 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano and serve immediately.  Pass the extra grated cheese at the table.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     beef filets -- (6-ounce) room
                        temperature
  2 1/4      teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped green bell peppers
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped celery
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped green onions
     1/2         pound  lump crabmeat -- picked over for
                        shells and cartilage
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs

Preheat a grill to high.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Season the filets with 2 teaspoons Essence, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.  Mark the steaks on the grill, searing fully on both sides.  Transfer to a small sheet pan and set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, bell peppers, celery, remaining 1/4 teaspoon Essence, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon of the parsley and the green onions and cook until wilted, about 1 minute.  Remove from the heat.

Place the crabmeat in a medium bowl and add the cooked vegetables.  Add the mayonnaise and bread crumbs and stir gently to combine.

Evenly divide the crabmeat between the steaks, allowing about 1/4 cup for each steak.  Pack the crabmeat on top of each steak, gently molding to the steak's shape to create a crust.  Place in oven and cook for 10 minutes for medium-rare.  Garnish with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  rum
  1 1/2          pints  strawberries -- hulled
                        === BUTTERMILK-PRALINE ICE CREAM ===
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  3               cups  buttermilk
     3/4      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  crumbled Homemade Pecan Pralines -- (listed below)
                        === HOMEMADE PECAN PRALINES ===
  1                cup  light brown sugar
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                cup  pecan halves

In a large saute pan, add the butter and melt over medium heat.  Add the brown sugar and cook until sugar is melted and bubbly.  Remove the pan from the heat and carefully add the rum.  Return the pan to the heat and ignite.  Cook until the flames die out, about 10 to 15 seconds.  Add the strawberries and cook until the strawberries just begin to soften, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Serve over the Buttermilk Praline Ice Cream.

For the Buttermilk-Praline Ice Cream:  In a small saucepan, combine the cream and sugar.  Simmer over medium heat, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved.  Remove from the heat and let cool completely.  In a bowl or pitcher, combine the cream mixture, buttermilk, and vanilla.  Refrigerate until well-chilled, about 1 hour.

Pour into an ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturer's instructions.  When the ice cream is nearly firm, and with the machine running, add the crumbled pralines through the feed tube.  Continue to churn until the ice cream freezes, about 5 minutes.  Place the ice cream in a plastic container and freeze until firm, 2 hours, or overnight.

For the Homemade Pecan Pralines:  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the light brown sugar, granulated sugar, heavy cream, butter, and water.  Place over a medium-high heat and stir constantly until the mixture reaches the softball stage, 238 to 240 degrees.  Add the pecans to the candy, and pull the pan off of the stove.  Continue to stir the candy vigorously with a wooden spoon until the candy cools, and the pecans remain suspended in the candy, about 2 minutes.  Spoon the pralines out onto a parchment or aluminum foil lined sheet pan and cool completely before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     Pont L'Eveque cheese - (8 oz) -- very cold,
                        rind removed and cut into 1" pieces
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  fine dry bread crumbs
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1              large  egg
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  Champagne vinegar
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  walnut oil
  1         tablespoon  olive oil or vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     red apples -- cored, and
                        cut lengthwise into 8ths
  6               cups  mixed baby lettuces
  12            sprigs  fresh baby parsley
     1/2           cup  roughly-chopped toasted walnuts
                        Sliced warm French bread -- as an accompaniment

In a large saute pan or medium pot, preheat 2-inches of vegetable oil to 350 degrees.

Place the flour in a shallow bowl.  Combine the bread crumbs and Essence in another shallow bowl.  Beat the egg in a third bowl.  In batches, dip the cheese cubes into the flour, then the beaten egg, then into the bread crumbs, shaking to remove any excess.  Place on a plate and freeze until very cold, about 15 minutes.

Remove from the freezer and fry in the oil until golden brown and crisp, 20 to 30 seconds.  Drain on paper towels.

In a small bowl, whisk together the mustard, vinegar, and garlic.  Add the walnut oil, then the olive oil, in a steady stream, whisking constantly to form an emulsion.  Add the shallots and salt and pepper to taste.  Toss with the lettuces and baby parsley sprigs, and divide among 4 salad plates.  Garnish each plate with 4 apple slices.

Top each salad with fried cheese cubes and garnish with a sprinkling of walnuts.  Serve immediately with French bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  hazelnut liqueur
                        = (Frangelico recommended)
  1                cup  melted semisweet chocolate
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  roughly-chopped toasted pistachios
                        = (or hazelnuts)
                        Whipped cream -- for garnish
                        Mint leaves -- for garnish

Set a small saucepan filled with 2 cups of water over a medium low heat.  Place the egg yolks and hazelnut liqueur into a medium-sized mixing bowl, and beat with a whisk.  Place the bowl over the saucepan and continue to beat the eggs until they start to thicken.  The egg should take on the consistency of a hollandaise sauce but since it is a sweet sauce, it will be called a sabayon.  As you draw the whisk up, the sabayon should fall off the whisk in ribbons, and when it lands on itself in the bowl, it should hold its shape for a moment.

Once you've completed the sabayon, fold the warm melted chocolate and salt into the bowl and allow it to cool.  Be sure to not over work the sabayon as you fold the chocolate into it or it will deflate and you will lose air volume.

In a separate clean bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, sugar and vanilla extract to make whipped cream.  Beat the cream until stiff peaks form and then fold the whipped cream into the sabayon and chocolate mixture.

Line a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, being sure that you have about 3 inches of overhang on all sides of the pan.  Pour the mousse mixture into the prepared loaf pan, raise the loaf pan about 3 to 4 inches off the workstation and drop.  Do this 2 or 3 times to force out any air bubbles that may have formed in the pan.  Drape the overhanging plastic over the top of the mousse and overlap it with the plastic wrap on the other side.  Place the terrine in the freezer and freeze for at least 4 hours, and up to 2 days.

To serve the terrine, remove from the freezer, peel back the plastic wrap and invert the loaf pan onto a clean cutting board.  Peel back the remaining plastic wrap and slice the terrine using a hot, long thin bladed knife.  Make the slices about 3/4-inch thick, and place on a clean plate, garnished with the pistachios, whipped cream and mint leaves.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Categories    : Desserts                        Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ICE CREAM ===
  2               cups  fresh orange juice
  1                cup  sugar
  6              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  orange zest
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  milk
                        === CREPES ===
  1 1/4           cups  whole milk -- plus
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  3              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- melted
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  2          teaspoons  orange zest
     1/2           cup  orange-flavored liqueur
                        = (Grand Marnier recommended)

Make the Ice Cream:  Place the orange juice in a large skillet or saute pan and bring to a boil over high heat.  Continue to cook until juice is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 15 minutes.  Set aside.

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the sugar, egg yolks and orange zest and, using an electric mixer or a whisk, beat until yolks are thickened and pale yellow.  Set aside.

In a heavy medium saucepan bring the heavy cream and milk to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Ladle a cup of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolk mixture and whisk to combine.  Transfer the egg yolk mixture to the saucepan and whisk to combine.  Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens slightly so that it coats the back of a spoon.  Add the reserved orange concentrate to the custard, then strain the custard through a fine mesh sieve into a clean mixing bowl.  Place the bowl in an ice bath and stir frequently until cooled.  Transfer to the refrigerator until thoroughly chilled.

Once the custard is chilled, transfer to an ice cream machine and process according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer the ice cream to a freezer-safe container and freeze for at least 2 hours before serving.

Make the Crepes:  In a large bowl, whisk together all the ingredients except 2 tablespoons of the butter, to form a smooth, thin batter.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Heat a 6-inch crepe pan or a heavy small skillet over medium-high heat.  When hot, brush lightly with some of the remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter.  Ladle about 3 tablespoons of the batter into the pan, tilting it to coat evenly with batter.  Cook until the crepe is golden brown on the bottom and the top is beginning to dry, 1 to 2 minutes.  Using a rubber spatula, carefully turn the crepe, and cook just until the bottom colors slightly, about 30 seconds.  Transfer to a plate.  Repeat with the remaining batter, adding a small amount of butter to the pan for each crepe.  Stack the crepes between sheets of waxed paper and set aside until ready to use.

Note: Crepes may be stacked between sheets of waxed paper, wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen for up to 2 months before using.

To make the Sauce:  Combine the butter and sugar in a medium skillet over medium high heat and cook until the sugar is melted.  Add the orange juice, 1/4 cup of the orange liqueur, and the orange zest, and heat until well blended.  Fold each of the crepes into quarters.  Add folded crepes, in batches if necessary, to the orange sauce.  Warm the crepes until thoroughly heated.

Transfer 2 crepes to each of 8 plates.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup of the orange liqueur to the remaining sauce in the skillet and ignite with a match.  Scoop 1 or 2 scoops of the ice cream onto the warm crepes, then pour some of the remaining sauce over the ice cream.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings (16 crepes and 1 quart of ice cream).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               ears  fresh sweet corn -- silks removed but
                        husks still attached
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  milk
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  1                     lime -- halved
     1/2           cup  shredded queso anejo, queso fresco, or
                        Parmesan
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt

Pull husks up to cover the corn ears and place the corn in a large bowl or pot.  Cover with cold water and place a large plate or other weight on top of the corn so that it remains submerged.  Allow the corn to soak for at least 1 hour.

In a small bowl combine the sour cream and milk and set aside.

While the corn is soaking, prepare a grill or barbecue to medium-high.  Adjust the grilling rack so that it sits about 4 inches away from the fire.

Lay the corn on the grill and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, turning frequently.  Remove and allow to cool slightly.

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.

Pull the husks back to form a handle and brush the ears evenly with the melted butter.  Squeeze the lime halves evenly over the ears of corn, and brush the ears with some of the sour cream mixture.  Sprinkle the cheese evenly among the corn ears, coating on all sides.  Sprinkle the ears evenly with the chili powder and kosher salt.  Place corn in a baking dish and put in the oven for at least 5 minutes, or until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

            Grilled Grouper With Mango Habanero Barbecue Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  diced onion
  1                     habanero pepper -- diced with seeds
                        and ribs removed
  1           teaspoon  diced garlic
  2               cups  diced mango
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/2           cup  white vinegar
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  4                     grouper fillets - (6 oz ea)
     1/4      teaspoon  fresh cracked white pepper

Place a 1-quart saucepan over medium high heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan.  Once the oil is hot, add the onions and habanero pepper and cook until the onions are translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the garlic to the pan and cook for 30 seconds.  Deglaze the pan with the lime juice and vinegar.

Bring the pan to a boil then reduce the heat to medium.  Add the sugar, mustard, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt to the pan.  Continue to cook the barbeque sauce until the mangoes are very soft, about 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and allow the sauce to cool for about 15 minutes.

You can leave the sauce chunky like this, or puree the contents of the pan in a blender on low speed for 1 minute, if desired.  Reserve the sauce until ready to use.  Sauce will keep up to 10 days in a non-reactive air-tight container in the refrigerator.

Preheat a grill to medium heat.  Season the grouper with the remaining 3/4 teaspoon of salt and the white pepper.  Place the fish on the grill and cook for about 3 minutes then turn the fish 45 degrees and cook for an additional 3 minutes.  Turn the fish over and cook for an additional 5 minutes or until cooked through.  During the last few minutes of cooking, brush the fish with the sauce.  Serve with a simple salad, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh oregano leaves
                        = (or 1 tspn dried oregano)
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8             slices  ciabatta bread

                        thinly sliced)
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced mozzarella
  2             ounces  thinly-sliced prosciutto
  2             ounces  thinly-sliced soppressata

Whisk 1/4 cup olive oil, vinegar, oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper in a small bowl to blend.  Arrange the slices of bread on a flat work surface and, using a brush, divide the vinaigrette equally among 1 side of each slice.  Divide the mozzarella equally among the bread slices.

Brush the outsides of each sandwich with some of the remaining tablespoon of olive oil.  Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium heat.  Add the sandwiches and cook until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted, pressing occasionally to compact with a large spatula or the bottom of a heavy small saucepan, about 4 to 5 minutes per side.

     1/2           cup  pine nuts -- lightly toasted
  4             cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/2           cup  freshly grated Parmesan
  1 1/3           cups  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2             pounds  swordfish steaks, 1" thick -- cut 1 1/2" cubes
  1                     red bell pepper -- cut 1" pieces
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- cut 1" pieces
  1                     red onion -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/2"-thick slices
  1                     long zucchini - (abt 6") -- halved lengthwise,
                        and cut into 1/2"-thick slices
  16                    cremini mushrooms -- ends trimmed

Make the Fresh Herb Pesto Sauce by combining the basil, parsley, mint, cilantro and chives in the bowl of a food processor and process until finely chopped.  Add the pine nuts, garlic and Parmesan cheese and, with the machine running, add 1 cup of the oil in a thin, steady stream.  Add the lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and pulse to combine well.  Transfer to a non-reactive bowl and set aside, covered with plastic wrap, until ready to use.

Preheat a grill or broiler to high.

Assemble the kabobs by dividing the swordfish and cut vegetables evenly among 8 extra-long (11- to 12-inch) skewers, alternating colors and ingredients.  (If using bamboo skewers, make sure to soak them in warm water for at least 15 minutes before adding ingredients.)  Lightly brush all sides of each filled skewer with some of the remaining olive oil, and then season the skewers with the remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Grill or broil the skewers 6 inches from the heat source until the fish is just cooked through and vegetables are lightly browned on the edges, about 8 minutes.  Enjoy while hot, with some of the Fresh Herb Pesto Sauce drizzled over all.

This recipe yields 8 appetizer servings or 4 main course servings.

Cook's Note:  The pesto sauce can be made up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated until ready to use.  If you choose to make this ahead of time, cover the top of the sauce with a thin film of oil to keep the sauce from darkening.  Return to room temperature before serving.

                        Walnut Butter Cookies -- (listed below)
  2        tablespoons  melted butter
                        Chocolate Swirl Ice Cream - softened -- (listed below)

                        === WALNUT BUTTER COOKIES ===
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened, plus
  8             ounces  unsalted butter - (2 sticks)
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  dark brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1              large  egg
     3/4           cup  walnuts -- toasted, and
                        chopped fine
                        === CHOCOLATE SWIRL ICE CREAM ===
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2               cups  whole milk
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  chopped orange zest
  1                     vanilla bean -- halved lengthwise
  6                     egg yolks
  6             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        === CHOCOLATE GANACHE ===
  3               cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2             pounds  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        === MOCHA ICE CREAM ===
  4             ounces  bittersweet chocolate chips
  2               cups  heavy cream
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  instant coffee powder
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Crumble 8 cookies into small, bite-size pieces.  Finely grind the remaining cookies in a food processor or blender.  Add the butter and process until moist crumbs form.  Press the mixture into bottom of a 9 1/2-inch spring form pan.  Bake until golden, about 8 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool completely on a wire rack.

Spread all of the softened chocolate swirl ice cream over the crust.  Sprinkle with half of the crumbled cookies and cover with 3/4 cup ganache (As necessary, microwave the ganache for 30 seconds to keep it at pouring consistency, but do not allow it to get too hot as it will melt the ice cream) and freeze until set.

Spread all of the softened mocha ice cream over the hardened ganache.  Sprinkle with the remaining crumbled cookies.  Freeze until very firm, at least 4 hours.  Cut around pan sides to loosen cake.  Turn the cake out onto a wire rack set over a baking sheet.  Pour the ganache over the top and sides of the cake.  Let sit and pour remaining ganache over so the cake is completely coated with chocolate.

Freeze on the wire rack until very firm, at least 4 hours.  Serve cake straight from the freezer.

For the Walnut Butter Cookies:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and position the oven racks in the middle of the oven.  Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets with 1 tablespoon of the butter and set aside.

Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a medium bowl.  Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer and cream the ingredients on high speed.  Add the vanilla and egg, and combine on medium speed.  Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Add the flour mixture and combine on low speed.  Remove bowl from mixer.  Stir in walnuts by hand.

Form into balls about 2 tablespoons each in size.  Divide the balls of dough between the prepared baking sheets, and press to slightly flatten, leaving about 2-inches of space between each cookie.  Bake in batches in the oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on wire racks.  (Makes 24 cookies)

For the Chocolate Swirl Ice Cream:  Combine the cream, milk, sugar, and orange zest in a medium, heavy saucepan.  Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the pan and add the vanilla bean halves.  Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Remove from the heat.

Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl.  Whisk 1 cup of the hot cream into the egg yolks.  Gradually add the egg mixture, whisking, to the hot cream.  Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to keep a skin from forming.  Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.

Combine the chocolate and oil in a small saucepan and melt gently, stirring occasionally, over medium heat.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

Remove from the refrigerator and pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine.  Freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.  After the ice cream is made, transfer to an airtight container and stir in the melted chocolate.  Cover tightly and freeze until ready to use.  (Makes 1 quart)

Foe the Chocolate Ganache:  Scald the cream and butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Remove from the heat.  Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl.  Add the hot cream and let sit for 2 minutes, then whisk until smooth.  Let cool to room temperature before using.  (The sauce can be kept refrigerated in an airtight container for several days, but it must be returned to room temperature before serving.)

For the Mocha Ice Cream:  In the top of double boiler set over medium high heat, melt the chocolate.  Remove from the heat.

In a medium saucepan, bring the cream to a gentle boil.  Remove from the heat.

In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until slightly thickened.  Whisk 1/2 cup of the hot cream into the egg mixture.  Whisk in the coffee powder.  In a slow, steady stream, gradually add the egg mixture to the pan of hot cream.  Cook over moderately-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 3 to 5 minutes.

Remove the pan from the pan from the heat and strain the mixture into a clean bowl through a fine mesh strainer, pressing against the strainer with the back of a spoon.  Add the melted chocolate and vanilla.  Pour into a container and cover with waxed paper or plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to keep a skin from forming.  Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.

When cold, pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine.  Churn and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.  When the ice cream has come together, transfer to an airtight container and place in the freezer until ready to serve.  (Makes3 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     shoulder lamb chops, abt 3/4"-thk each
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-sliced yellow onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  24                    black olives -- pitted
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon zest
  8             sprigs  thyme
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
     1/4           cup  aged balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  Montepulciano
                        = (or any dry red wine)
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
                        = MACCHERONI ALLA CHITARRA AGLIO E OLIO =
                        Basic Pasta dough -- (listed below)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  crushed red pepper flakes
                        === BASIC PASTA ===
  1 1/2           cups  durum semolina
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Season the chops lightly on both sides with salt and pepper.  Combine the flour and Essence in a shallow bowl.  Add the chops to the flour and turn to coat evenly, shaking to remove any excess.

In a large, deep skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the lamb and cook for 4 minutes.  Turn the chops, and add the onions, garlic, olives, zest, and 4 sprigs of the thyme.  Cook, stirring, until the onions are wilted, 3 minutes.  Add rosemary and cook for 1 minute.  Increase the heat, add the balsamic vinegar and wine, and stir to deglaze the pan.  Turn the chops and cook for 1 additional minute for medium-rare.  Transfer the chops to 4 large plates, top with the sauce, and garnish each plate with 1 sprig of thyme.

Serve immediately.  Serve on Maccheroni alla Chitarra Aglio e Olio.

For the Maccheroni Alla Chitarra Aglio E Olio:  Roll pasta dough out to the second thinnest setting on a pasta machine.  Lay pasta over a chitarri.  Using a rolling pin, roll over the dough so the strings cut the pasta.  Repeat with all of the dough.

Cook pasta in boiling, salted water until al dente.  Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until garlic is lightly browned.  Drain pasta and place in a bowl.  Add olive oil mixture and toss.

For the Basic Pasta:  Mix the semolina, flour, and salt together.  On a large work surface, form a mound with the semolina mixture and create a "well" in the center of the mound.  In a small bowl, beat the eggs and oil together until smooth.  Pour this mixture into the well.  Working from the inside of the well out, gradually work the semolina into the eggs, until all the flour is worked in.  Wrap with plastic and allow to rest for 30 to 40 minutes.  Roll out and cut to desired shape.  (Makes 1 pound of pasta)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Season the chops lightly on both sides with salt and pepper.  Combine the flour and Essence in a shallow bowl.  Add the chops to the flour and turn to coat evenly, shaking to remove any excess.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large, deep skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the lamb and cook for 4 minutes.  Turn the chops, and add the onions, garlic, olives, zest, and 4 sprigs of the thyme.  Cook, stirring, until the onions are wilted, 3 minutes.  Add rosemary and cook for 1 minute.  Increase the heat, add the balsamic vinegar and wine, and stir to deglaze the pan.  Turn the chops and cook for 1 additional minute for medium-rare.  Transfer the chops to 4 large plates, top with the sauce, and garnish each plate with 1 sprig of thyme.

Serve immediately.  Serve on Maccheroni alla Chitarra Aglio e Olio.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Maccheroni Alla Chitarra Aglio E Olio:  Roll pasta dough out to the second thinnest setting on a pasta machine.  Lay pasta over a chitarri.  Using a rolling pin, roll over the dough so the strings cut the pasta.  Repeat with all of the dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook pasta in boiling, salted water until al dente.  Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until garlic is lightly browned.  Drain pasta and place in a bowl.  Add olive oil mixture and toss.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Basic Pasta:  Mix the semolina, flour, and salt together.  On a large work surface, form a mound with the semolina mixture and create a &quot;well&quot; in the center of the mound.  In a small bowl, beat the eggs and oil together until smooth.  Pour this mixture into the well.  Working from the inside of the well out, gradually work the semolina into the eggs, until all the flour is worked in.  Wrap with plastic and allow to rest for 30 to 40 minutes.  Roll out and cut to desired shape.  (Makes 1 pound of pasta)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  2 1/4           cups  water
     3/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
                        = (preferably Dutch-process)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract

In a medium saucepan combine the sugar and 1/4 cup of the water and cook over medium-high heat, undisturbed, until the sugar melts and begins to boil.  Allow the sugar to cook, swirling occasionally, until the syrup reaches a deep golden caramel, about 5 minutes.

Add the water carefully; the caramel will harden and steam vigorously.  Cook over low heat until the caramel is dissolved.  Add the cocoa powder, cinnamon, cayenne and salt and whisk until dissolved.  Transfer to a clean bowl and cool, stirring occasionally.  When the mixture has cooled, stir in the vanilla and transfer to the refrigerator until thoroughly chilled.

Freeze in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions.  Transfer to an airtight container and freeze for at least two hours before serving.

This recipe yields about 3 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, plus
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened
  1                cup  cake flour
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  poppy seeds
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  plain low-fat yogurt
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === LEMON GLAZE ===
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice -- strained
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/8      teaspoon  almond extract

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly grease 2 mini muffin tins (each with 12 (1 3/4-inch) wells) with 1 tablespoon softened butter and set aside.

In a large bowl, sift together cake flour, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and poppy seeds.

In a medium bowl, combine the egg and sugar and beat with an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.  Reduce the mixer speed to medium and beat in the yogurt, remaining 4 tablespoons of butter, lemon juice, zest and vanilla until well incorporated, about 30 seconds.  Fold the wet ingredients into the dry just until moistened and being careful not to over-mix.  Divide the batter among the prepared muffin tins, filling each halfway.

Bake until the muffins are set and golden brown and a tester comes out clean, 14 to 16 minutes.  Remove from the oven and use a toothpick to poke several holes in the top of each muffin.  Brush each muffin generously with the Lemon Glaze.  Allow the muffins to cool for 10 minutes in the tin and then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

For the Lemon Glaze:  In a small bowl, combine ingredients and whisk to incorporate.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
                        Shiitake Mushroom Stuffing -- (listed below)
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/4           cup  Madeira
  2               cups  chicken stock
                        ===BRAISED CELERY ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1             medium  yellow onion -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1               head  celery -- ends trimmed,
                        and cut into 4" lengths
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  vermouth
                        = (or dry white wine)
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4      teaspoon  finely-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
  2        tablespoons  lightly-toasted chopped walnuts
                        === SHIITAKE MUSHROOM STUFFING ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  12            ounces  assorted mushrooms -- stems trimmed,
                        and coarsely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  dried fine bread crumbs
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh basil
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place the chicken breast between sheets of plastic wrap and pound, with the flat side of a meat mallet to 1/4-inch thickness.  Pat dry with paper towels.

Place 1 ball of mushroom stuffing along 1/2 of each chicken piece.  Tuck the short ends in and, starting at 1 long side, roll up the chicken into a tight cylinder.  Fasten with toothpicks.  Season with salt and pepper.

In a large, non-stick skillet, heat the oil over high heat.  Add the stuffed chicken and cook, turning, until brown on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and place in the oven.  Bake until cooked through, about 7 minutes.  Alternately, cover the skillet and cook over low heat until the chicken is cooked through, about 6 minutes.

Remove from the oven.  Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover to keep warm.  Add the shallots to the pan juices and cook, over medium heat until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and thyme and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the Madeira and bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring, until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.  Add the chicken stock, return to a boil, and cook, until reduced by half, about 6 minutes.

Add the chicken and any juices to the pan and cook until the chicken is warmed through, about 1 minute.  Serve with Braised Celery.

For the Shiitake Mushroom Stuffing:  Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are wilted and begin to caramelize.  Add the shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the wine and cook, stirring to loosen any browned bits in the pan, and until the liquid has almost all evaporated, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer the mushrooms to the bowl of a food processor.  Add the cheese, bread crumbs, parsley, basil, and oregano, and process on high speed to a thick paste.

Transfer to a bowl and divide into 4 equal portions.  Roll each into firm balls and use to stuff the chicken breasts.  (Makes about 1 cup)

For the Braised Celery:  In a large, non-stick skillet, add the olive oil, onions, garlic, and celery.  Add the chicken broth, Vermouth, bay leaf, salt, and pepper, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and cover.  Simmer, turning once, until the celery is tender, about 30 minutes.

Remove from the heat and transfer the celery to serving plates.  Spoon a little cooking liquid over each serving, and sprinkle with the parsley and toasted walnuts.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5              large  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into large wedges
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, kept warm
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  4              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  creme fraiche
  2          teaspoons  Calvados -- plus
  1         tablespoon  Calvados
  1                     prepared Sweet Tart Crust -- (listed below)
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2          teaspoons  confectioners' sugar -- plus
                        more for dusting
                        === SWEET TART DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  8        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  2        tablespoons  cold vegetable shortening
  2        tablespoons  cold water - (to 4) -- as needed

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a large bowl, toss the apples with the melted butter and 1 tablespoon of the sugar.

In a bowl fitted with an electric mixer, combine 1/2 cup sugar and eggs.  Beat until pale and creamy, about 5 minutes.  Add the creme fraiche and 2 teaspoons Calvados and beat for 1 minute.

Decoratively arrange the apples evenly over the bottom of the baked tart shell.  Pour the cream mixture over the apples and spread to the edges.  Bake until the cream is set and the apples are tender, 50 minutes to 1 hour.

Remove and cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour.

In a medium bowl, beat the heavy cream until soft peaks start to form.  Add 2 teaspoons of confectioners' sugar and the remaining tablespoon of Calvados and beat until stiff peaks start to form.  Transfer to a decorative bowl.

Remove the tart from the pastry mold.  Place on a platter, dust with confectioners' sugar, and serve with the Calvados whipped cream.

For the Sweet Tart Dough:  Into a large bowl, sift together the flour and salt.  Add the sugar, butter, and shortening, and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add 2 tablespoons of ice water, and work into a smooth dough, adding more water as needed.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out 1/8-inch thick to fit an 11-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Line with parchment paper, fill with pie weights or beans, and bake for 12 minutes.  Remove from the oven and remove the paper and weights.  Bake until just golden, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack before making the tart.  (Makes 1 (11-inch) tart crust)

  1                     pineapple -- skin, eyes, and
                        blemishes removed
  1                cup  fresh orange juice
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
     1/4           cup  dark rum
     1/2           cup  non-fat vanilla yogurt
  2        tablespoons  coconut liqueur
  2        tablespoons  toasted -- shredded coconut
  4             sprigs  mint -- for garnish

Cut the pineapple crosswise into 3/4-inch rounds (there should be 8 slices), and remove the core.  In a large nonstick saute skillet, combine the orange juice, lemon juice, sugar, vanilla bean, and vanilla seeds.  Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.  When the sugar is dissolved, add the pineapple slices and cover.  Cook 1 minute, then reduce the heat to low.  Continue to cook for 4 minutes.

Remove the pan from the heat and add the rum.  Return to the heat and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the pineapple from the pan and place in a large bowl.  Place the pan over medium heat, cook until reduced and thick, 5 to 7 minutes.  Pour the syrup over the pineapple and refrigerate for 2 hours.

Place the yogurt in a cheesecloth-lined fine mesh strainer placed over a bowl, and let drain, refrigerated, for 2 hours, or overnight.  Add the coconut liqueur to the drained yogurt and mix well.

To serve, remove the vanilla bean from the bowl.  Divide the pineapple slices and syrup between 4 small bowls.  Top with a dollop of vanilla yogurt and sprinkle with toasted coconut.  Garnish with the mint and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1              small  pumpkin - (abt 2 lbs) -- halved, strings and
                        seeds discarded (or seeds reserved for
                        roasting)
  1                     acorn squash - (abt 1 lb) -- halved, strings and
                        seeds discarded
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- plus
                        more for garnish
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2             medium  yellow onions -- peeled, halved
  3             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        halved lengthwise
  2             medium  shallots -- peeled, halved
     1/2        medium  orange
  3                     bay leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  6               cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  dark brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  heavy cream

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Rub the pumpkin and squash halves with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper; place flesh-side down in a large roasting pan.  Place thyme sprigs under each half.

Toss the onions, carrots, shallots, orange and bay leaves with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and place in the roasting pan.  Roast until the vegetables are well browned, about 1 1/2 hours, occasionally stirring the vegetables (except the pumpkin and squash).  Remove the orange if it begins to brown before other vegetables.

Remove the pan from the oven and let sit until the vegetables are cool enough to handle.

Meanwhile, remove the thyme and bay leaves and discard.  Once cool, scoop the flesh from the pumpkin and squash and transfer back to roasting pan.  Place the roasting pan over 2 burners over medium heat.  Season with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, cloves, and allspice and add wine to deglaze the pan.  Add 2 cups stock and bring to a simmer.  Cook for 20 minutes.  Remove the orange and discard.

Transfer the soup in small batches to a food processor or blender and puree until very smooth.  Strain the mixture through a sieve into a medium saucepan or soup pot.  Add the remaining 4 cups stock, orange juice, brown sugar, and balsamic vinegar and bring to a simmer.  Add cream and stir to combine.  Garnish with freshly ground black pepper.

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  2              large  baking potatoes - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- scrubbed
  1              large  egg white
  2          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and grease a large non-stick baking sheet with the vegetable oil.

Pat the potatoes dry and slice lengthwise into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Turn each slice flat and slice again lengthwise into even fries, 1/2-inch thick.  In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the egg white until very light and foamy.  Add the potatoes and the Essence to the egg whites and toss to coat evenly.

Spread the coated potatoes on the prepared baking sheet, not touching.  Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy; halfway through the cooking time, with a spatula, scrape the potatoes from the baking sheet and turn.  Carefully remove with a spatula to a large serving plate, or individual plates.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the egg white until very light and foamy.  Add the potatoes and the Essence to the egg whites and toss to coat evenly.

Spread the coated potatoes on the prepared baking sheet, not touching.  Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy; halfway through the cooking time, with a spatula, scrape the potatoes from the baking sheet and turn.  Carefully remove with a spatula to a large serving plate, or individual plates.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  Yukon Gold potatoes -- well scrubbed,
                        and quartered
  13            ounces  butter - (3 sticks plus 2 tbspns) -- divided as called
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2         pound  morel mushrooms -- wiped clean and
                        sliced in half lengthwise if large
     1/2         pound  fiddlehead ferns -- rinsed
  3        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  dark chicken stock
     1/2         pound  crawfish tails
  6                     salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  diced pancetta
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1 1/2         pounds  whole ramps -- woody stems
                        removed, rinsed

Place the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water by 1 inch.  Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until fork tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain in a colander.

Return the potatoes to the saucepan.  Add 4 ounces (1 stick) of the butter, the cream, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.  With the heat on medium-low, mash and stir the mixture until well blended, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Adjust seasoning, to taste, and cover to keep warm.

Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the fiddlehead ferns and blanch until just tender, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and shock in an ice bath.  Drain on paper towels.  Add the ramps to the boiling water and blanch until just tender, about 2 minutes.  Drain in a colander and shock in an ice bath.  Drain on paper towels and set aside.

Heat the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large saute pan over a medium-high heat.  Add the morels and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the shallots and garlic.  Season with the salt and pepper, and cook until the mushroom liquid has been released, about 4 minutes.  Add the stock, and bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring occasionally until the volume is reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Add the crawfish tails and stir well to mix.  Lower the heat to medium-low, and gradually add 6 ounces (1 1/2 sticks) of butter several pieces at a time, stirring constantly to incorporate.  Add the fiddlehead ferns and toss until they are heated through.  Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.

Season the salmon on both sides with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper per fillet.  In a large skillet or 2 smaller skillets, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat.  Add the salmon and sear for 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Remove from the heat.

Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the pancetta and cook until golden brown and some of the fat is rendered.  Add the shallots and saute for 1 minute.  Add the ramps, and salt and pepper to taste, and cook, stirring, until tender yet still firm, 3 to 4 minutes.

Divide the morel ragout among 6 dinner plates.  Place a dollop of mashed potatoes in the middle of the plate and top with a salmon fillet.  Spoon the ramps on top of the fish and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     recipes Savory Pie Crust -- (see recipe)
  1                     frying chicken - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3               cups  low-sodium chicken broth
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  poultry seasoning
  2          teaspoons  chicken rub seasoning
                        = (Emeril's Chicken Rub recommended)
  1              large  russet potato -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        = (abt 2 cups)
  2               cups  sliced carrots (1/4"-thk slices)
  1                cup  coarsely chopped onions
  1                cup  fresh corn kernels -- cut from the cob
                        = (2 medium ears)
  1                cup  quartered button mushrooms
  1                cup  frozen lima beans
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter -- room temperature
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  1         tablespoon  water

Divide the piecrust dough into 4 separate portions and form into 4 disks.  Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before rolling 2 of the portions of dough out to fit into 2 (9-inch) deep dish pie pans.  Trim the edges of the dough so that 1/2-inch dough hangs over the sides of the pans.  Roll the remaining 2 portions of dough out and refrigerate (placed on a baking sheet with plastic or parchment between dough), along with the prepared pie pans, until the filling is chilled and you are ready to bake the potpies.

Season the chicken pieces with the salt and pepper.  Heat a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot over high heat and brown the chicken pieces on both sides in the olive oil, working in batches if necessary, about 5 minutes on each side.  Drain all fat from the Dutch oven and add the chicken broth, bay leaf, poultry seasoning, and chicken rub seasoning.  Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the chicken is very tender and falling from the bone, about 1 hour.  Transfer the chicken pieces to a plate and set aside until cool enough to handle.  When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones and tear into bite-size pieces.  Set aside.

While the chicken is cooling, add the potatoes, carrots, onions, corn, mushrooms, lima beans and heavy cream to the Dutch oven and return to a boil.  Cover the pot, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the vegetables are very tender, about 30 minutes.

Combine the flour and butter in a mixing bowl to form a thick paste-like mixture.  Ladle some of the hot chicken broth into the mixing bowl and whisk to combine with the flour-butter mixture.  When smooth, add this mixture to the pot and stir to combine well.  Bring the sauce to a low boil and continue to cook until the sauce is thick and smooth, about 5 minutes.  Add the reserved chicken meat, stir to combine, and remove from the heat.  Discard the bay leaf, taste, and adjust the seasoning if necessary.  Set aside to cool completely.  Once cooled, refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and position the oven rack on the lowest rung of the oven.

Divide the chilled filling between the 2 pastry-lined pie pans and, using a spatula, smooth the filling to the edges.  Place the egg in a small bowl and beat with 1 tablespoon of water.  Lightly brush the edges of the overhanging pastry with some of the egg mixture.  Top each pie dish with one of the rolled out portions of dough and trim edges so that they match the edges of the dough lining the pie pans.  Using your fingers, pinch edges of dough together and roll inward so that the edges sit inside of the edges of the pie pans.  Decoratively crimp the edges using your fingers, a fork, or a crimping tool.  Using the tip of a sharp knife, cut several decorative slits in the top of each pastry to allow steam to vent while cooking.  Brush the top of each potpie with some of the egg wash.

Bake the potpies for 20 minutes.  Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue baking the potpies until the crusts are golden brown and the filling is heated through, about 40 minutes longer.

Remove the potpies from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.  Cut the potpies into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 2 (9-inch) deep-dish potpies; 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  diced pineapple
  2                     jalapeÒos, abt 2 1/2" long -- halved, seeded
                        = (this amount will vary depending upon
                        the heat index of the jalapeÒos)
  2               cups  water
  2               cups  sugar

Combine all of the ingredients in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring often.  Once the mixture comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the pot to simmer until the fruit is tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Once the fruit is cooked, remove from the heat, and, working in batches, puree the mixture in a blender*(fruit and liquid).  Use caution when pureeing hot liquids in a blender; only fill the blender 1/3 to halfway full, and remove the feed tube to allow the steam to escape.  Hold a damp cloth over the hole of the feed tube to keep the puree from spewing out.  (Alternatively, allow the mixture to cool slightly before pureeing.)

When all of the fruit is pureed, transfer to a non-reactive container and allow it to chill thoroughly in the refrigerator before processing in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Remove the sorbet from the machine and place in a lidded, freezer-safe container and place in the freezer for at least 2 hours before serving.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

* Caution:  When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes.  Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway.  If using a blender, release one corner of the lid.  This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions.  Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.

Combine all of the ingredients in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring often.  Once the mixture comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the pot to simmer until the fruit is tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Once the fruit is cooked, remove from the heat, and, working in batches, puree the mixture in a blender*(fruit and liquid).  Use caution when pureeing hot liquids in a blender; only fill the blender 1/3 to halfway full, and remove the feed tube to allow the steam to escape.  Hold a damp cloth over the hole of the feed tube to keep the puree from spewing out.  (Alternatively, allow the mixture to cool slightly before pureeing.)
</DirT>

When all of the fruit is pureed, transfer to a non-reactive container and allow it to chill thoroughly in the refrigerator before processing in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions.  Remove the sorbet from the machine and place in a lidded, freezer-safe container and place in the freezer for at least 2 hours before serving.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  chorizo -- outer casings
                        removed, cut into 1" pieces
  1 1/2         pounds  ground pork
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  4              large  hamburger buns
                        = (or 4 (6") lengths French bread, halved
                        crosswise)
  1                cup  coarsely-grated pepper jack cheese -- (optional)
                        === GREEN CHILE MAYONNAISE ===
  1                cup  good-quality mayonnaise
                        = (homemade is best)
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1                     poblano pepper -- roasted and peeled
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the grill to medium-high.

Place the chorizo in a food processor and process until finely chopped (sausage should appear crumbly.)  Transfer to a large bowl and add the ground pork, garlic, Worcestershire, Essence, salt and cayenne and mix gently but thoroughly, being careful not to overwork the mixture.  Form the mixture into 4 (1-inch) thick patties, about 8 ounces each, and place on the grill.  Cook to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium.  During the last 2 minutes of grilling, toast the buns and sprinkle the cheese over the tops of the burgers, if desired, and cook until melted.

Transfer the burgers to the bottom of the buns and place on plates.  Generously top each burger with 2 tablespoons of the Green Chile Mayonnaise and place the tops of the buns over the sauce.  Serve immediately.

Green Chile Mayonnaise:  In the bowl of a food processor, combine the mayonnaise, garlic, poblano, and lime juice and process until smooth.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2               cups  grated Cheddar
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  finely chopped pimientos

              Pulled Pork Sandwiches With Homemade BBQ Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pork shoulder roast - (abt 6 to 8 lbs)
                        = (Boston Butt or Picnic roast)
  4          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  10                    sandwich buns - (to 12)
                        === HOMEMADE BARBECUE SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  finely-chopped onions
  6                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2 1/4      teaspoons  sweet paprika
  2          teaspoons  Essence
  2          teaspoons  dry mustard
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1                can  tomato paste - (6 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  water
     3/4           cup  cider vinegar
  6        tablespoons  dark brown sugar

Remove the pork from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature before proceeding.  Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil.  Season the roast well on all sides with the Essence, salt, and cayenne pepper.  Place a roasting rack inside the roasting pan and place the seasoned pork on the rack, fat-side up.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 4 hours.

Remove the foil from the roast and continue to bake until the roast is very tender and will pull apart easily with a fork, about 2 hours longer.  Remove the pork from the oven and set aside to cool slightly.  Remove any excess fat from the roast and discard if desired; I just love the crunchy bits of skin left on top!  Using 2 forks or your hands, shred the pork into bite-sized pieces.  Serve with buns and Homemade Barbecue Sauce to make sandwiches.

For the Homemade Barbecue Sauce:  In a medium non-reactive saucepan set over medium-high heat, add the butter and, when melted, add the onions and cook until they are very soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, paprika, Essence, ground mustard, salt, crushed red pepper, black pepper, and cayenne pepper and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes, or until the tomato paste begins to brown.  Add the water, cider vinegar, and dark brown sugar, and stir to combine.  Reduce the heat to low and cook until the sauce has thickened and the flavors have come together, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Set aside to cool before using.  The sauce may be made up to 1 week in advance and refrigerated in an airtight, non-reactive container.  (Makes about 3 cups sauce)

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1                cup  fresh corn kernels cut from the cob
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                can  pumpkin puree - (15 oz)
  3        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  ground cloves
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- sifted
     1/2           cup  cake flour -- sifted
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
  6               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Cane syrup or maple syrup -- for drizzling
                        = (Steen's recommended)
                        Powdered sugar -- for garnish

Heat an 8-inch saute pan over medium heat and add the oil and butter to the pan.  When the oil is hot, add the corn to the pan and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes.  Season the corn with 1/4 teaspoon salt and the white pepper.  Continue to cook the corn, stirring often, for an additional 5 minutes.  Remove corn from pan and set aside on a plate to cool.

In a separate bowl, combine pumpkin puree, brown sugar, eggs, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and whisk to combine.  When the corn is cooled, fold it into the pumpkin base.  Gently stir the all-purpose flour, cake flour, and baking soda into the pumpkin base.  Stir just until the ingredients are combined, so as not to over-mix.  Wrap bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.

In a large 6-quart pot, heat the vegetable oil to 325 degrees.  Remove the fritter batter from the refrigerator and carefully spoon heaping tablespoonfuls of the fritter batter into the hot oil to fry.  Cook no more than 6 at a time, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, turning when necessary, until the fritters are a golden brown.  Remove the fritters from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate.  Transfer to an aluminum foil pie pan and place in oven until all of the fritters have been made.

To serve, pile the fritters onto a serving plate and drizzle with cane syrup.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve while hot.

This recipe yields 24 fritters.

                           Pumpkin Creme Brulee

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  4          teaspoons  sugar
  8              large  egg yolks
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  1                cup  mashed cooked pumpkin

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Arrange 8 (1/2-cup) ramekins or custard cups in a large metal baking pan.

In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, brown sugar, and 1/4 cup granulated sugar.  Bring to a bare simmer over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Remove from the heat.

In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks until frothy and lemon-colored.  Slowly add 3/4 cup of the hot cream mixture, whisking constantly.  Add the egg mixture to the remaining hot cream, and whisk.  Add the vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin, and whisk until smooth.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a large bowl.  Divide among the prepared custard cups.

Add enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the cups.  Bake until the custards are just set in the center but not stiff, 45 minutes to 55 minutes.  Remove from the oven and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 3 hours or overnight.

Sprinkle each custard with 1/2 teaspoon of the remaining sugar.  Using a kitchen torch, caramelize the sugar.  (Alternately, preheat the broiler, and broil until the sugar melts and caramelizes, watching closely to avoid burning and rotating the cups, about 1 to 2 minutes.)  Place on small dessert plates and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  whole milk
     1/2                vanilla bean -- halved lengthwise
     1/3           cup  sugar
  4 1/2      teaspoons  all-purpose flour
  3              large  egg yolks
  4          teaspoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  apricot jam
  2          teaspoons  kirsch or brandy
  1                     fully-baked 10" pastry crust -- (listed below)
  1               pint  fresh raspberries - (to 1 1/2)
                        === BASIC SWEET CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4             ounces  cold butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/4" pieces
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  2        tablespoons  ice water - (to 3)

To make the pastry cream, in a medium pot combine the milk and vanilla bean, scraping the vanilla seeds into the pot.  Scald over medium heat.  Remove from the heat.

In a medium bowl, mix the sugar and flour.  Add the egg yolks and beat until pale yellow and frothy.  Whisking constantly, add 1/3 cup of the hot milk to the egg mixture, then beat back into the hot milk.  Return to medium heat, and whisking constantly, cook until thick, 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean bowl, and discard the vanilla bean.  Stir in the butter.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to prevent a skin from forming.  Refrigerate until cool, about 2 hours.

In a small saucepan, combine the jam and kirsch and heat until dissolved.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

Spread the pastry cream evenly over the pastry crust.  Arrange the fruit in an even, decorative pattern over the cream and brush with the jam glaze.  Let sit for 10 minutes before serving.

For the Basic Sweet Crust:  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large bowl.  Using your fingers, work in the butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add 2 tablespoons of ice water and work with your fingers until the water is incorporated and the dough comes together.  Add more water as needed to make a smooth dough, being careful not to over-mix.  Form the dough into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to fit into a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Press the dough into the pan and cut until trim with the edges.  Line with parchment pastry and pie weights or dry beans, and bake until set, 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove the paper and weights and bake until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.

Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack until ready to fill.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Season the fish on both sides with salt, pepper, and Essence.

Saute the fennel and onions in olive oil until golden brown, about 8 minutes.  Lay the fish on top, and add the vermouth and fish stock.  Cover the pot and bake until the fish is cooked and still tender, 10 to 12 minutes.

Remove from the oven and transfer the fish, fennel, and onion to a platter.  Tent to keep warm.

Transfer the cooking juices and the 3 onion rings to a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Add the orange juice and cook until reduced by half again, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer to a blender, and puree on high speed.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Arrange the fish, vegetables and rice on 4 large plates.  Drizzle the fish with the orange vinaigrette, garnish with the fennel fronds, and serve.

For the Rice With Peas And Pine Nuts:  In a medium saucepan, bring the water, salt, and olive oil to a boil.  Add the rice, stir well, cover tightly, and reduce the heat to low.  Cook, covered without stirring, until almost all the water is absorbed, 17 to 18 minutes.  Add the peas without stirring.  Cook until all the water is absorbed and the rice is tender, an additional 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let sit covered, without stirring, for 10 minutes.  Fluff the rice with a fork, and add the pine nuts and parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  12       tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (6 oz) -- cut small pieces
  2              large  eggs
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1              pinch  cinnamon
                        === FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  candied fruit -- finely diced
  1         tablespoon  sweet Marsala
  4             ounces  ricotta -- drained in a
                        cheesecloth set over a bowl until thick
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  granulated sugar
  1              large  egg -- separated
     1/4      teaspoon  powdered cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  finely-grated lemon zest
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for egg wash
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar

For the Pastry:  In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt.  Work in the butter using your fingers.  In a small bowl, beat together the eggs, vanilla, zest, and cinnamon.  Work into the dough and knead until smooth.  Form into 2 equal pieces.

One at a time, roll out both pieces of dough between 2 sheets of lightly floured waxed paper to about 1/8-inch thickness.  Keep the dough between the sheets of waxed paper and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly grease a large piece of parchment paper and place on a large baking sheet.  Set aside.

For the Filling:  In a small bowl, combine the candied fruit and Marsala.  Let the fruit soak for 30 minutes.

In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, the egg yolk, cinnamon, and lemon zest.  Stir in the candied fruit.  Gently fold together to avoid breaking up the ricotta.

In a small bowl, whip the egg white with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar until stiff peaks form.  Fold the meringue into the ricotta mixture.

Remove the pastry from the refrigerator and cut each piece in half lengthwise.

Lay 1 piece of dough flat on the buttered parchment paper and brush the edges with egg wash.  Spread half of the filling down the center.  Top with a 2nd sheet of dough and press together to adhere.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.  Brush the tops with egg wash and sprinkle with the remaining sugar.

Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool before cutting into individual 1/2-inch thick pieces.  Serve either warm or at room temperature.

(Alternately, arrange the filling in evenly spaced spoonfuls down the bottom sheets of pastry, as though making ravioli.  Top with a 2nd sheet of pasta and press gently to form pockets of filling.  Brush with the egg wash and sprinkle with sugar.  Cut into individual pieces and bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool before serving either warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  Olive Salad -- (see recipe)
                        === BASIL SPREAD ===
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                cup  basil leaves - (packed)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === SANDWICH ===
  2             medium  eggplants - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- ends trimmed,
                        and cut crosswise into 1/2" slices
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced provolone cheese
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced mozzarella
  2              large  round Italian seeded breads*
                        = (or use seeded Italian baguettes,
                        enough for 4 servings)

Make the Olive Salad at least 1 day in advance.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, or up to 2 weeks in advance.  Remove from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature before serving.  (Leftovers can be stored in an air-tight container for up to 2 weeks.)

Make the Basil Spread.  In the bowl of a food processor or blender, place the garlic and basil and process on high while adding the olive oil in a steady stream.  Continue to process until well blended.  Season with salt, to taste, and set aside until ready to assemble the sandwiches.  (The basil spread can be made up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated, with a thin film of oil over the top to prevent discoloration.  Allow to come to room temperature before using.)

Light the grill or preheat the broiler.

If using the broiler, arrange the eggplant slices in a single layer on 2 lightly greased or nonstick baking sheets.  Lightly brush the eggplant slices on both sides with the olive oil.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Grill or broil in batches, until the slices are tender, lightly browned, and have released most of their moisture, about 10 minutes total.  (If you do this on nonstick baking sheets, the slices should brown on both sides without needing to be turned.)  Remove from the oven and keep warm until ready to assemble the sandwiches.

When you are ready to assemble the sandwiches, slice the bread in half horizontally and spread the bottom half with some of the Basil Spread.  Reserve any leftover spread for another use.

Divide the eggplant slices evenly among the bottom halves of the sandwiches and top each sandwich with half of the sliced provolone and half of the sliced mozzarella.  Finally, top each sandwich with about 1 cup of the Olive Salad, and then place the top of the bread on top.  Press lightly, cut each sandwich into quarters, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

* Cook's Note:  Muffulettas are traditionally made on special round, seeded Italian breads made specifically for this purpose.  The breads are rustic in texture and not too thick (about 2 to 2 1/2 inches high).  If you cannot find a similar type of bread, you could either use a seeded Italian baguette cut into 6-inch lengths for 1 person (in which case you would need 4 of these portions for this recipe), or you could partially hollow out 2 thick round Italian breads or cut portions out of the middle to make the breads less thick.

Make the Olive Salad at least 1 day in advance.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, or up to 2 weeks in advance.  Remove from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature before serving.  (Leftovers can be stored in an air-tight container for up to 2 weeks.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the Basil Spread.  In the bowl of a food processor or blender, place the garlic and basil and process on high while adding the olive oil in a steady stream.  Continue to process until well blended.  Season with salt, to taste, and set aside until ready to assemble the sandwiches.  (The basil spread can be made up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated, with a thin film of oil over the top to prevent discoloration.  Allow to come to room temperature before using.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Light the grill or preheat the broiler.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If using the broiler, arrange the eggplant slices in a single layer on 2 lightly greased or nonstick baking sheets.  Lightly brush the eggplant slices on both sides with the olive oil.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Grill or broil in batches, until the slices are tender, lightly browned, and have released most of their moisture, about 10 minutes total.  (If you do this on nonstick baking sheets, the slices should brown on both sides without needing to be turned.)  Remove from the oven and keep warm until ready to assemble the sandwiches.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When you are ready to assemble the sandwiches, slice the bread in half horizontally and spread the bottom half with some of the Basil Spread.  Reserve any leftover spread for another use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the eggplant slices evenly among the bottom halves of the sandwiches and top each sandwich with half of the sliced provolone and half of the sliced mozzarella.  Finally, top each sandwich with about 1 cup of the Olive Salad, and then place the top of the bread on top.  Press lightly, cut each sandwich into quarters, and serve.

                  Rosemary And Garlic Roast Leg Of Lamb

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bone-in leg of lamb - (abt 6 to 7 1/2 lbs)
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  8                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  chopped fresh herbs
                        = (combination of rosemary, chives, and
                        parsley)
  2               cups  diced onions
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  red wine

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Using your hands, rub the lamb all over with the lemon juice.  Pat the garlic and rosemary evenly all over the surface of the meat.  Season the meat with the salt and pepper and place the lamb in a roasting pan.  Place the lamb in the oven and roast for 30 minutes.

Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to cook for about 1 hour longer for medium-rare, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the roast registers about 145 to 150 degrees (be careful that the thermometer does not touch the bone.)  Remove lamb from pan and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.

Position the roasting pan over your stove burners.  Add mixed herbs and onions to pan, and stir to combine with pan drippings.  Add chicken stock and wine to deglaze the pan, scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon to release any fond.  Reduce over high heat until sauce consistency.  Strain before serving, if desired.  Slice lamb and serve with sauce drizzled over the top.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  all-purpose flour
                        = (abt 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tbspns)

  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  3        tablespoons  ice water

Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl.  Incorporate the butter pieces and shortening by hand, working the fat into the flour with your fingertips until the dough starts to come together and form small pea shapes.  Work the ice water into the dough with your fingers until it just comes together, being careful not to over-mix.

Form the crust into a disk shape, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to rest for at least 30 minutes before rolling out to fit into a pie pan.

This recipe yields 1 (9- or 10-inch) pie crust.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2 1/2         pounds  spinach -- washed
                        = (3 cups cooked and roughly chopped)
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  roughly-chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  Italian seasoning -- plus
  2          teaspoons  Italian seasoning
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  3               cans  quartered artichoke hearts - (8 1/2 oz ea) -- tough outer leaves
                        removed
  6              large  eggs
  3               cups  heavy cream
  2               cups  milk
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  12              cups  cubed (1") day-old French bread - (to 14)
  1              pound  Brie -- (optional), rind
                        removed and cut into 1/2" cubes
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley leaves

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon olive oil.

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil.  Add the spinach and cook until just wilted, about 30 seconds.  Drain and rinse with cold water.  Once cool, squeeze as much water from spinach as possible then roughly chop and reserve.

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook until golden brown and tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and cook, stirring, until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the artichokes and cook, stirring, another 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and reserve.

Combine the eggs, cream, milk, lemon juice, remaining 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, remaining 2 teaspoons salt, and remaining 1 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.  Whisk to combine.  Add the bread, spinach, artichoke mixture, brie, 1/4 cup Parmesan, and parsley and stir to combine.  If bread does not absorb all of liquid immediately then let rest until this happens, about 20 minutes.

Pour the bread pudding mixture into the prepared dish.  Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan over the top and drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Bake until firm in the center and golden brown, about 1 hour.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     center cut salmon fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- with skin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2         pound  fresh pea shoots
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === WARM LENTIL RAGOUT ===
  8             ounces  French green lentils
  3              whole  garlic cloves -- smashed, plus
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2                     bay leaves
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
  6             ounces  chorizo sausage -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1                cup  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  2               cups  veal reduction
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions (scallions)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Season the salmon lightly with salt and pepper.

In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat.  Add the salmon, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is crisp, about 5 minutes.  Turn and cook for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and transfer the salmon to a platter.

In a clean large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the pea shoots and cook, stirring, until slightly wilted but still bright green, about 30 seconds.  Season lightly with salt and remove from the heat.

To serve, spoon the lentil ragout onto 4 large plates.  Arrange the salmon and pea shoots on top and serve.

For the Warm Lentil Ragout:  In a medium saucepan, combine the lentils, garlic, bay leaf, and thyme.  Cover with water by 1 inch, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until just tender yet still firm, 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain and rinse under cold running water.  Drain well.  Discard the garlic, bay leaf, and thyme.  Place the drained lentils in a large bowl and set aside.

In large skillet, cook the chorizo over medium-high heat until browned and the fat is rendered, about 4 minutes.  Add the shallots and minced garlic, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes, lentils, and herbs and cook for 1 minute.  Add the veal reduction and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.  Add the green onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm until ready to serve with the seared salmon.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  4                     anchovy fillets -- chopped
  1 1/4           cups  chopped seeded plum tomatoes
  2          teaspoons  drained small capers
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  white wine
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice -- or to taste
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2                     pairs shad roe - (4 lobes) -- with unbroken
                        membranes
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        === FOR SERVING ===
                        Baby arugula
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        Extra-virgin olive oil

To make the sauce, heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet or medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until starting to color, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the anchovies, lower the heat, and stir, crushing them into a paste against the sides of the pan.  Add the tomatoes, capers, red pepper flakes, and white wine and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes.  Add the parsley, butter, and lemon juice, and stir to combine.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasonings to taste.  Cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

Combine the flour and Essence in a shallow dish.  Dredge the roe in the flour, shaking to remove any excess.

In a large skillet or saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the roe and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side.  (The roe still will be slightly pink inside.)  Remove and lightly season with salt and pepper.

Divide the roe among 4 plates and serve with the tomato-anchovy sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

To make the sauce, heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet or medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until starting to color, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the anchovies, lower the heat, and stir, crushing them into a paste against the sides of the pan.  Add the tomatoes, capers, red pepper flakes, and white wine and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes.  Add the parsley, butter, and lemon juice, and stir to combine.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasonings to taste.  Cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

<DirT>
Combine the flour and Essence in a shallow dish.  Dredge the roe in the flour, shaking to remove any excess.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large skillet or saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the roe and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side.  (The roe still will be slightly pink inside.)  Remove and lightly season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the roe among 4 plates and serve with the tomato-anchovy sauce on the side.

     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  sugar
  4                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped green onions
                        = (green and white parts)
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  16             large  shrimp -- peeled, de-veined
  2          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  8                     round rice paper wrappers - (8 1/2" dia)
  8              small  romaine lettuce leaves -- rinsed, patted dry,
  1                     ribs removed, and torn into bite-size piec
  1              ounce  alfalfa or radish sprouts
  32                    fresh mint leaves
  32            sprigs  fresh cilantro
  1              large  carrot -- peeled, shredded

Put 2 cups hot water in a large bowl and add the noodles.  Soak them until softened but slightly resilient, 20 to 30 minutes.  Drain them and pat dry on paper towels.  Put in a bowl and cover.

Combine 4 cups water, the ginger, lemon, soy sauce, sugar, bay leaves, green onions, garlic, salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Season the shrimp with the Essence and add to the boiling water.  Boil for 2 minutes, and then remove the pan from the heat and allow the shrimp to sit in the hot liquid for 2 minutes, or until cooked through.  Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the shrimp from the water and let cool.

When the shrimp are cool enough to handle, cut in 1/2 lengthwise.  Fill a large bowl with hot water.  Place a clean kitchen towel next to the bowl.  Submerge 1 rice paper wrapper in the water and soak it until softened, about 1 minute.  Carefully remove the rice paper from the water and lay it flat on the towel.

In the center of the sheet, layer 1/8 of the soaked noodles, 4 lettuce pieces, about 20 sprouts, 4 shrimp halves arranged side by side in a row, 4 mint leaves, 4 cilantro sprigs, and 1/8 of the carrots.  Pull the bottom up over the filling, fold over the sides, and roll up like an egg roll.  Place seam-side down on a plate and repeat the process with the remaining rice papers and filling.  Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 8 summer rolls.

  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  Essence

  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic

     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  Canadian whiskey
  2        tablespoons  whole grain mustard
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2                     bay leaves
                        === CARAMELIZED ONIONS ===
  4             ounces  unsalted butter
  2             pounds  yellow onions -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme

                        === GARNISH ===
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme -- garnish

Season the chops on both sides with 2 tablespoons of the Essence.

Combine the flour, cornstarch and remaining tablespoon of Essence in a shallow bowl.  Dredge the pork chops in the flour mixture.

In a large cast-iron skillet or saute pan, heat the oil over high heat.  Add the pork chops in batches and cook until golden brown and medium, 5 to 6 minutes per side.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.

To serve, spoon the beans into the center of 6 large plates.  Top with the pork chops and spoon the onions over the chops.  Garnish each plate with thyme and serve immediately.

For the Slow-Cooked White Beans:  In a large pot, place the beans and cover with water by 3 inches.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until the beans are just tender, about 1 hour and 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Drain and set aside.

In a large pot, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until brown and the fat is rendered, about 6 minutes.  Add the onions, cayenne, Essence, salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until the onion is soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the tomatoes and their juices, and cook for 2 minutes.

Add the beer, syrup, sugar, stock, whiskey, mustard, Worcestershire and bay leaves.  Stir well and cook for 1 minute.  Add the beans and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer covered for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.  Remove the lid and continue to simmer until tender, about 30 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally and adding more water as needed to cover the beans.

Remove from the heat and adjust seasoning, to taste.  Serve with the Pan-Fried Pork Chops.

For the Caramelized Onions:  In a large skillet or saute pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and lower the heat to medium-low.  Cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and caramelized, 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Add the thyme and salt to taste, and stir.  Remove from the heat and keep warm until ready to serve.

     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat a fryer to 360 degrees.

Season the flour with Essence and place in a shallow dish.  Dredge the eel in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess.

Fry the eel until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove to a paper towel-lined plate.

In a large bowl, combine the sturgeon, onions, chives, vinegar, oil, some of the Buttermilk Dill Dressing, salt, and pepper, and toss gently.

In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, oil, salt, and pepper, and drizzle over the lettuces.  Place 1/4 head of lettuce on each of 4 large salad plates.  Arrange the sturgeon mixture over the lettuce.  Top with the fried eel.  Drizzle each serving with 3 tablespoons of the dressing.  Place 1 teaspoon of the caviar in the center and serve.

For the Dilled Buttermilk Dressing:  Combine the egg and dill in the bowl of a food processor and process on high speed for 15 seconds.  With the machine running, add the oil in a thin stream and process until it forms an emulsion.  Transfer to a bowl and whisk in the buttermilk, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.  (Makes 2 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Choupique caviar is the roe of the Bowfin, a bony, prehistoric, fresh water fish indigenous to south Louisiana.  "Choupique" is the Cajun name for the Bowfin, and the fish's naturally black eggs resemble that of the sturgeon, with a distinctive, lively flavor.  Should you use this roe in other recipes, be forewarned that Choupique caviar turns red when heated or cooked.  If you're feeling extravagant, use Beluga or Sevruga caviar instead of the Choupique.  Salmon roe also makes a great substitute.

                            Standing Rib Roast

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              heads  roasted garlic
  3 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2       teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1                     standing rib roast of beef - (6 1/2 lbs) -- fat trimmed in one
                        strip and reserved
  1 1/2           cups  red wine -- plus
  1                     more cup red wine if making au jus -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  beef stock -- plus
  2                     more cups beef stock if making au jus -- (optional)

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Separate the heads of roasted garlic into cloves and squeeze the roasted garlic out of the peels.  Place the garlic in a small bowl and mash with the back of a fork until mostly smooth.  Add 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, the rosemary and thyme, and stir to blend.  Pat this mixture evenly over the top and sides of the roast.  Place the trimmed strip of fat over the garlic-herb mixture and tie with kitchen string in several places to secure the fat onto the top of the roast.

Season the roast all over with the remaining 2 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper.  Place the roast in a roasting pan and add 1 1/2 cups red wine and 1/2 cup beef stock to the bottom of the pan.  Roast for 20 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and continue to roast to the desired degree of doneness, about 18 minutes per pound for rare and 22 minutes per pound for medium.  Let stand at least 5 minutes before carving.  De-fat the pan juices and serve alongside the beef.

If making au jus, place the roasting pan on the stove burners over medium-high heat.  Add 1 cup red wine and scrape the browned bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Add 2 cups beef stock and season with salt and pepper.  Continue to cook until the wine is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.  Strain the sauce through a sieve to remove the solids before serving.  De-grease, if necessary.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- melted, and
                        slightly cooled, plus
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  6              large  eggs -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  milk -- room temperature
  3 1/3           cups  granulated sugar
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3             pounds  strawberries -- rinsed, hulled,
                        and sliced
     1/2           cup  orange-flavored liqueur -- plus
                        a little more for drizzling
                        = (Grand Marnier recommended)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  orange zest
  2 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  5        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and grease a 9- by 13-inch glass casserole with the 2 teaspoons of butter and set aside.

Combine the eggs and milk in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until frothy.  Add 1 1/3 cups of the sugar and continue to beat at high speed until the mixture is quite thick and pale yellow, about 7 to 10 minutes.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.  Fold this mixture gently into the egg mixture.  Gently stir in the melted butter and then transfer the batter to the prepared baking pan and bake in the center of the oven until risen and golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack before proceeding.

Make the strawberry topping by combining the strawberries, remaining 2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup orange liqueur, and orange zest in a large bowl and tossing to combine.  Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until all sugar is dissolved.  Refrigerate, covered, until ready to assemble the dessert.

Make the whipped cream by combining the heavy cream with the confectioners' sugar in a large bowl and beating with an electric mixer or whisk until slightly thickened.  Add the vanilla and continue to beat until the mixture nearly forms stiff peaks.

When ready to assemble the dessert, poke holes all over the cake using a cake tester or toothpick.  Drizzle cake with a little orange liqueur.  Cut the cake into 1 1/2-inch cubes and place half of the cake cubes on the bottom of a deep-sided dessert bowl.  Add half of the strawberry mixture over the top of the cake cubes, juices and all, spreading strawberries evenly with a spatula and allowing the juices to absorb into the cake.  Top with the remaining cake cubes and then the remaining strawberries.  Top with the whipped cream and serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 hour in advance before serving.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and grease a 9- by 13-inch glass casserole with the 2 teaspoons of butter and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the eggs and milk in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until frothy.  Add 1 1/3 cups of the sugar and continue to beat at high speed until the mixture is quite thick and pale yellow, about 7 to 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.  Fold this mixture gently into the egg mixture.  Gently stir in the melted butter and then transfer the batter to the prepared baking pan and bake in the center of the oven until risen and golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack before proceeding.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the strawberry topping by combining the strawberries, remaining 2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup orange liqueur, and orange zest in a large bowl and tossing to combine.  Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until all sugar is dissolved.  Refrigerate, covered, until ready to assemble the dessert.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the whipped cream by combining the heavy cream with the confectioners&apos; sugar in a large bowl and beating with an electric mixer or whisk until slightly thickened.  Add the vanilla and continue to beat until the mixture nearly forms stiff peaks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to assemble the dessert, poke holes all over the cake using a cake tester or toothpick.  Drizzle cake with a little orange liqueur.  Cut the cake into 1 1/2-inch cubes and place half of the cake cubes on the bottom of a deep-sided dessert bowl.  Add half of the strawberry mixture over the top of the cake cubes, juices and all, spreading strawberries evenly with a spatula and allowing the juices to absorb into the cake.  Top with the remaining cake cubes and then the remaining strawberries.  Top with the whipped cream and serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 hour in advance before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12       tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- plus
  1         tablespoon  cold unsalted butter
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  confectioners' sugar -- plus
                        more for garnish
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     3/4      teaspoon  salt -- plus a pinch
  4                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1 1/3           cups  granulated sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  lemon zest
     2/3           cup  fresh lemon juice -- strained
     1/4           cup  whole milk
  2        tablespoons  limoncello -- (optional)
                        = (or other lemon-flavored liqueur)

Lightly butter a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with 2 teaspoons of the butter and line with 1 sheet of parchment or waxed paper.  Butter the top of this sheet of paper with 1 teaspoon of the remaining butter and then lay a second sheet of parchment or waxed paper crosswise over the first sheet.  The parchment should be cut large enough so that the sides are even with the top of the baking dish; this extra paper will function as handles to help you remove the lemon squares from the pan later.  Set pan aside.

In a large bowl combine 1 3/4 cups of the flour, 2/3 cup of the confectioners' sugar, the cornstarch, and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and mix thoroughly.  Cut the remaining 12 tablespoons of butter into small pieces and add to the flour mixture.  Using your hands, 2 forks, or a pastry blender, work the butter into the flour mixture until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  Transfer the butter-flour mixture to the prepared baking dish and press into an even 1/4-inch layer along the bottom and partly up the sides of the pan.  Refrigerate for 30 minutes.

While the crust is chilling, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Bake the crust until golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes.

While the crust is baking, assemble the filling by combining the eggs, granulated sugar, flour, and lemon zest in a medium bowl and whisking until smooth.  Stir in lemon juice, milk, limoncello, and remaining pinch of salt and mix well.

When the crust is golden brown, remove it from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.  Stir the lemon mixture again, then pour onto the warm crust.  Bake until the filling is set, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Grasp the waxed paper that lines the 2 longest sides of the baking dish and remove the bars from the pan by pulling up gently.  The entire dessert should easily dislodge and come away from the pan.  Transfer to a cutting board and, using a clean knife, cut into squares, wiping knife after each cut.  Place a small amount of confectioners' sugar into a small sieve, and sprinkle the bars with the sugar.  Serve immediately, or refrigerate, wrapped with plastic wrap, up to 2 days, until ready to serve.

This recipe yields about 24 (1 1/2 to 2-inch) squares.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  bittersweet chocolate
  3              large  egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/4           cups  sweet dessert wine
                        = (such as Vin Santo)
  2              large  egg whites
     1/4           cup  cooled brewed espresso
                        = (or other strong coffee blend)
  1                cup  ricotta
  1                cup  heavy cream
  4             ounces  ladyfingers - (to 5)
                        Cocoa powder -- for garnish
                        === Chocolate-Dipped Coffee Beans ===
  6             ounces  semisweet chocolate
  1                cup  dark roasted coffee beans

Place the chocolate in the top of a double boiler or in a bowl set over a pot of simmering water, and stir until melted.  Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature.

In the top of a double boiler or in a bowl set over a pot of simmering water, beat the egg yolks and 3 tablespoons of sugar until pale yellow and frothy.  Add 1/2 cup of the wine and whip until thick, being careful not to let the mixture boil.  Remove from the heat and fold in the chocolate.  Cool to room temperature.

In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form, and fold into the cooled custard mixture.

In a bowl, combine the coffee, ricotta, and 2 tablespoons sugar and set aside.

In a separate bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form.  Add the remaining teaspoon of sugar and whip until stiff peaks form.

Dip the ladyfingers into the remaining 3/4 cup of dessert wine and arrange them in the bottom of a square 9-inch baking dish.  Cover with half of the ricotta, half of the custard, and half of the whipped cream.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients, ending with whipped cream on top.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours.

To serve, sift the cocoa powder evenly over the top and decorate with the Chocolate-Dipped Coffee Beans.  Cut into equal pieces and serve.

For the Chocolate-Dipped Coffee Beans:  In the top of a double boiler set over simmering water, melt the chocolate, stirring until smooth.  Remove from the heat and let cool and thicken slightly.

In batches, drop the beans into the melted chocolate, coating completely on all sides.  Remove and place on a baking sheet lined with waxed paper.  Let dry completely.  Store in an airtight container at room temperature.  (Makes 1 cup)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SWEET RED BEAN PASTE ===
     1/2         pound  dried adzuki beans
  3               cups  cold water
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     3/4           cup  lard or peanut oil
                        === VANILLA ICE CREAM ===
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2               cups  whole milk
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1                     vanilla bean -- halved lengthwise
  6                     egg yolks
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Crystallized ginger -- for garnish
                        Chopped peanuts -- for garnish

Pick over the beans and remove any stones or broken beans.  Place in a large pot or bowl and cover with water by 3 inches.  Soak overnight.  Drain and place the beans in a heavy, medium pot with the water.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 1 to 2 hours.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

Strain the beans through a fine strainer set over a medium pot, and discard the pulp.  Add the sugar and oil and cook over medium heat, stirring, until the mixture forms a thick, sweet paste, 20 to 30 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  Refrigerate before using as a topping for ice cream or in other desserts.

Combine the cream, milk, and sugar in a medium, heavy saucepan.  Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the pan and add the vanilla bean halves.  Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Remove from the heat.

Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl.  Whisk 1 cup of the hot cream into the egg yolks.  Gradually add the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream, to the hot cream.  Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to keep a skin from forming.  Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.

Remove from the refrigerator and pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine.  Freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.

Spoon the ice cream into bowls and top each with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the red bean paste and garnish with chopped peanuts and crystallized ginger.

Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2                     plum tomatoes - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- halved lengthwise
  1              large  yellow onion - (abt 10 oz) -- sliced 1/2" thick
  5             ounces  green zucchini -- sliced on the

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Place the potatoes in a medium pot and cover with water by 1-inch.  Bring to a boil and cook until just tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain and when cool enough to handle, remove the skins.  Slice horizontally into 1/2-inch thick slices.

Peel stems of cardoons with a vegetable peeler.  Discard leafy tops.  Blanch peeled cardoons in a pot of boiling water with milk, until tender, about 3 minutes.  Remove and cool.  Cut into 1/2-inch pieces.

In a small bowl, combine thyme, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper.

In a large oval casserole dish, alternately layer at an angle the potatoes, mozzarella, peppers, tomatoes, onions, and zucchini, seasoning between each layer with garlic, thyme, red pepper mixture, salt, and pepper.  Drizzle with the olive oil and bake until the vegetables are tender and beginning to turn golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.  Sprinkle the cheese over the top and return to the oven until the cheese is melted, 5 to 8 minutes.

Remove from the oven and serve hot.
