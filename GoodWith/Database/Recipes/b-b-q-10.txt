                Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     turkey breast half - (2 to 2 1/2 lbs) -- with skin and bone
  1 1/2           cups  soft bread crumbs - (2 slices)
     1/2           cup  snipped dried apricots
     1/4           cup  chopped toasted pecans
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
                        = (or apple juice)
     1/4      teaspoon  dried rosemary -- crushed
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic salt
  1         tablespoon  Dijon-style mustard
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  margarine or butter -- melted

Remove bone from turkey breast.  Cut a horizontal slit into thickest part of turkey breast to form a 5- by 4-inch pocket.  Set aside.

In a medium mixing bowl combine bread crumbs, apricots, pecans, margarine or butter, sherry or apple juice, rosemary, and garlic salt.  Spoon stuffing into pocket.  Securely fasten opening with water-soaked wooden toothpicks or tie with heavy string.  Stir together mustard and oil; set aside.

Arrange preheated coals around a drip pan in a covered grill.  Test for medium heat above pan.  Place turkey on grill over drip pan.  Cover and grill for 1 to 1 1/4 hours or until instant-read thermometer inserted in center of turkey breast (not in stuffing) registers 170 degrees, brushing with mustard mixture during the last 15 minutes.

Remove turkey from grill and cover with foil.  Let stand for 15 minutes before slicing.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Dried apricots and pecans star in the stuffing for this grilled turkey breast.  Use kitchen shears to snip the dried apricots. It's easier, faster, and less messy than a knife and cutting board.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
     1/2           cup  chopped green sweet pepper
  1              small  onion -- chopped - (1/3 cup)
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  prepared mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  caraway seed
  1                cup  drained sauerkraut
  6                     fresh bratwurst - (abt 1 1/2 lbs total)
  6                     hoagie buns -- split

Melt the butter or margarine in a small skillet over medium heat.  Add the pepper and onion.  Cook over medium heat about 5 minutes or until vegetables are tender.  Stir in the brown sugar, mustard, and caraway seed.  Add the drained sauerkraut and toss to mix.

Fold a 36- by 18-inch piece of heavy foil in half to make an 18-inch square.

Place the sauerkraut mixture in the center of the foil square.  Bring up opposite foil edges and seal with a double fold.  Fold in the remaining foil edges to completely enclose the sauerkraut mixture, leaving some space in the packet for steam to build.

Prick bratwurst in several places with a fork or tip of a sharp knife.

For a charcoal grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan in a grill that has a cover.  Test for medium heat above the drip pan.  Place the bratwurst and the foil packet with sauerkraut mixture on the grill rack over the drip pan.  Cover and grill for 20 to 25 minutes or until bratwurst juices run clear, turning once.

For a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium.  Adjust for indirect cooking.  Place bratwurst and foil packet on grill rack; cover and grill as directed above.

                          Basic Beer-Can Chicken

Recipe By     :Steve Raichlen
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BARBECUE RUB ===
     1/4           cup  kosher or sea salt
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar
     1/4           cup  sweet paprika
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === CHICKEN ===
  1                can  beer - (12-oz)
  1              whole  chicken - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  Barbecue Rub -- (see above)
                        = (or your favorite commercial brand)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2               cups  hickory or cherry wood chips or chunks

Soak wood chips for 1 hour in water and/or beer to cover, then drain.

To prepare rub:  In small bowl, combine salt, brown sugar, paprika and pepper.  Stir to mix.  (Note: Use fingers; they work best.)  Store rub in airtight jar away from heat and light.  Will keep at least 6 months.

To prepare charcoal grill:  Set up grill for indirect grilling.  Preheat to medium.  Place large drip pan in center.  Toss all wood chips or hunks on coals.

Or to prepare gas grill:  Place all wood chips or chunks in smoker box or in smoker pouch.  (To make pouch, wrap soaked chips in foil to make a pillow-shape and poke a few holes in top of pouch.  Place pouch under grate over burner.)  Preheat on high until you see smoke.  Reduce heat to medium.

To prepare beer can:  Pop tab off beer can.  Pour 3/4 cup beer over soaking wood chips or chunks, or reserve for another use.  Using church key-style can opener, make 2 more holes in top of can.  Set aside.

To prepare chicken:  Remove packet of giblets from body cavity of chicken.  Set aside for another use.  Remove and discard fat just inside body and neck cavities.  Rinse chicken, inside and out, under cold running water.  Drain.  Using paper towels, blot dry, inside and out.  Sprinkle 1 teaspoon rub inside body cavity and 1/2 teaspoon inside neck cavity.  Drizzle oil over outside of bird.  Rub or brush oil over skin.  Sprinkle outside of bird with 1 tablespoon rub.  Rub it all over skin.  Spoon remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons rub into beer through hole in top of can.  (Note: Don't worry if beer foams up; this is normal.)

To position chicken:  Hold bird upright, with opening of body cavity at bottom.  Lower bird onto beer can so can fits into cavity.  Pull chicken legs forward to form tripod so bird stands upright.  (Note: If cooking on roaster, fill it with the beer mixture and position chicken on top, following manufacturer's instructions.)  Tuck tips of wings behind chicken's back.

To cook chicken:  Stand chicken up in center of hot grate over drip pan and away from heat.  Cover grill.  Cook chicken for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, or until skin is dark golden brown and very crisp and meat is cooked through (about 180 degrees on instant-read meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh but not touching bone).  Add 12 fresh coals per side after 1 hour.  (Note: If chicken skin starts to brown too much, loosely tent bird with foil.)

To serve chicken:  Using tongs, hold bird by can and carefully transfer to upright position to platter.  Let chicken rest for 5 minutes.  Carefully lift it off can.  (Note: Take care not to spill hot beer or otherwise burn yourself.)  Halve, quarter, or carve chicken.  Serve.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Wash chicken and pat dry.  Remove neck, liver and heart and pull out excess fat.  With poultry shears, cut along each side of backbone and remove.  Pull bird open and turn skin side up on counter.  Press chicken, using a heavy frying pan if necessary, to flatten its rib cage.

Mix all remaining ingredients in a glass or ceramic dish large enough to hold chicken.  Place chicken in marinade, turning to coat completely.  Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 1 day.

Preheat grill to medium hot (when you can hold your hand 5 inches above grill for 5 to 6 seconds).  With a wadded paper towel, oil grate liberally.  Place chicken, skin-side down, on grill.  On top of the chicken, place a heavy cookie sheet or roasting pan, weighted with 3 or 4 bricks.

Cover grill and cook about 20 minutes, until skin is well-browned.  Remove pan, turn chicken over and grill, covered, about 10 minutes more without weights.  Use an instant-read thermometer to measure internal temperature of bird at thickest part of thigh.  It should read at least 165 degrees.

Remove chicken from grill, cover with foil and let rest 5 minutes before carving and serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  pecan halves
                        = (and/or other shelled nuts)
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted
                        = (no substitute for butter)
  2        tablespoons  coffee liqueur
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  4          teaspoons  red chile powder
                        = (New Mexico-style or
                        ground Ancho chiles)
  1              quart  coffee ice cream
                        = (or reduced-fat coffee ice cream)
     1/2           cup  chocolate ice cream topping - (to 1)

Toss together the pecan halves and/or other nuts, butter, liqueur, sugar, and red chile powder.  Place in a single layer on a foil tray.  Turn off all but one burner of a gas grill or prepare smoker.  The temperature inside the grill or smoker should be about 225 degrees.

Grill tray of nuts about 40 minutes or until they are dried and slightly crisp.  (Nuts will crisp as they cool.)  Watch closely to prevent overbrowning.  Cool completely in a single layer; separate nuts if necessary.  Store, covered, up to 3 days.

For each serving, place a scoop of ice cream in a serving bowl, top with 1 to 2 tablespoons of chocolate ice cream topping and about 2 tablespoons candied nuts.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  You'll have to hide these spicy candied nuts after smoking them on your gas grill or in your smoker.  They make tasty snacks all by themselves and may disappear before dessert time.

Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit
                Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine -- softened
  2        tablespoons  light-colored corn syrup
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  3               cups  sliced peeled cooking apples - (3 medium)
  1               pint  vanilla ice cream

For topping, combine brown sugar, butter or margarine, corn syrup, and cinnamon in a small bowl; set aside.

Tear off a 36- by 18-inch piece of heavy foil.  Fold in half to make an 18-inch square.  Place apples in the center of the foil square.  Drizzle with topping.  Bring up opposite foil edges, and seal with a double fold.  Fold in remaining edges to completely enclose the apples, leaving space for steam to build up.

Grill for 30 to 35 minutes or until apples are tender.  Serve apples warm with ice cream.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Nutritional facts per serving:  Calories: 325,  total fat: 13g,  saturated fat: 6g,  cholesterol: 29mg,  sodium: 132mg,  carbohydrate: 52g,  fiber: 2g,  protein: 3g,  vitamin A: 15%.

Comments:  Like a caramel apple pie without the pastry crust, this dessert is best served warm, topped with ice cream, in big bowls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     fully-cooked bratwurst or knockwurst
  2             ounces  Monterey Jack cheese with caraway seed
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
  5             slices  bacon
  5                     French-style rolls -- halved lengthwise
                        = (or frankfurter buns)
                        === OPTIONAL CONDIMENTS ===
                        Catsup
                        Mustard
                        Chopped onion
                        Pickle relish

Cut a lengthwise slit in each bratwurst or knockwurst about 1/2 inch deep.  Cut cheese into five 2 1/2- by 1/2- by 1/4-inch strips.  Insert a cheese strip and some of the green onion into each brat or knockwurst.  Wrap a slice of bacon around each.  Fasten the bacon with wooden toothpicks.

For a charcoal grill, arrange preheated coals around a drip pan in a grill that has a cover.  Test for medium heat above the pan.  Place brats, cheese-side up, on the grill rack directly over the pan.  Cover and grill for 5 to 10 minutes or until bacon is crisp and cheese is melted.

For a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium.  Adjust for indirect cooking.  Place brats on grill rack; cover and grill as directed above.

Place brats in French-style rolls or buns.  If desired, serve with catsup, mustard, chopped onion, and/or pickle relish.

This recipe yields 5 servings.

Comments:  To grill these dynamite brats at the park, stuff them with the cheese and wind the bacon around them.  Pack the brats with ice packs in a cooler and you're ready to go.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  hickory chips
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped green onions
  3        tablespoons  nonfat plain yogurt
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped seeded jalapeÒo - (to 4)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2             pounds  lean ground beef or turkey
  6             ounces  Monterey Jack cheese with jalapeÒos -- cut 6 slices
  8                     Kaiser rolls -- split, toasted
                        Leaf lettuce -- as needed
                        Sliced tomato -- as needed
                        === LIME MAYONNAISE ===
     1/3           cup  reduced-fat mayonnaise or salad dressing

  1           teaspoon  lime juice
  1           teaspoon  Dijon-style mustard

At least 1 hour before needed, soak hickory chips in enough water to cover.  In a medium bowl combine green onions, yogurt, jalapeÒo peppers, salt, and black pepper.  Add beef or turkey; mix well.  Shape mixture into 8 patties about 3/4-inch thick.

                        Chimichangas On The Grill

Recipe By     :Andrea Chesman
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  canola or olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  3               cups  cooked black beans
                        = (or 2 [15-oz] cans, drained)
  1 1/2           cups  diced tomatoes - (fresh or canned)
  1         tablespoon  minced chipotle en adobo -- or to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     flour tortillas - (10" dia)
  8             ounces  Monterey jack cheese -- grated
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro

Heat 2 tablespoons of the canola or olive oil in a medium-size skillet or saucepan.  Add the garlic and cumin and cook, stirring, until the oil smells fragrant, about 2 minutes.  Add the beans and tomatoes and cook until heated through, about 10 minutes.  Using a potato masher, mash the beans.  Then stir with a wooden spoon to make a fairly smooth mixture.  Stir in the chipotle en adobo and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Prepare a medium-low fire on the grill.

Heat 1 flour tortilla directly over a gas burner or in a dry skillet over medium-high heat, turning to warm both sides.  Sprinkle about 1/4 cup of the Monterey Jack in a line across the center of the tortilla.  Spread about 1/3 cup cup of the beans on top.  Sprinkle with the cilantro.  Fold in the sides and roll up the tortilla to enclose the filling.  Place on a baking sheet, seam-side down.  Repeat with remaining tortillas.  Brush the tortillas with the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil.

Transfer the tortillas, seam-side down,  to the grill, and grill, turning occasionally, until heated through and browned, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Serve hot, passing salsa on the side.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Traditionally, chimichangas are deep-fried or pan-fried burritos.   But there's no need for frying when the heat of the grill can brown the tortilla and give it a lovely crispy texture.  A spoonful of chipotle en adobo gives the black beans a special smoky flavor.  Chimichangas should be cooked over a low fire.  If you like, keep the fire hot for grilling potatoes or corn as an accompaniment, and grill the chimichangas off to the side, away from the intense heat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     bananas -- see * Note
  1         tablespoon  safflower oil
     1/3           cup  dark rum
  2        tablespoons  molasses
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  4             scoops  vanilla ice cream
     1/4           cup  pistachios -- shelled
  4                     lime wedges

* Note:  Bananas should be a little firm for this dish.

In a small sauce pan, over medium heat, whisk together rum, molasses, butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes, until well-blended.  Be careful, as rum will most likely ignite.

Rub the bananas (cut in half lengthwise) with oil.  Grill each side, over medium heat, for about 2 minutes.

Place bananas on separate serving dishes with a scoop of ice cream, drizzle a little sauce over bananas, sprinkle a few pistachios on top and garnish with a wedge of lime.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  grated grapefruit peel
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
  1         tablespoon  grated tangerine peel
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh mint
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2         pounds  peeled and deveined shrimp -- uncooked
                        = (large or 16 to 20 per lb size)
  4                     skewers

In medium bowl, stir together all ingredients except shrimp.  Stir in shrimp to coat; cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.

Heat grill.  Remove shrimp from marinade, keeping them coated with citrus peel and mint; discard remaining marinade.  Thread shrimp onto 4 (10- to 12-inch) metal skewers.  Place on gas grill over medium heat or on charcoal grill 4 to 6 inches from medium coals.  Cook 5 to 6 minutes or until shrimp turn pink, turning once.  Serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Ideas:  Rice or orzo or with a vinegared salad of green beans and almonds.

Comments:  Citrus fruit and mint provide the flavoring for a very summery marinade that takes just minutes to make.  Light and simple, these zesty grilled shrimp are great fare for family barbecues or weekend get-togethers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  apple or cherry wood chips
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  celery seed
     1/8      teaspoon  onion salt
  1               dash  ground cloves
  1               dash  ground red pepper -- (optional)
  4             ounces  bulk pork sausage
                        = (or bulk turkey sausage)
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
     1/2           cup  corn bread stuffing mix
     1/4           cup  diced cranberries
     1/2           can  diced green chili peppers - (4-oz can) -- drained
  2        tablespoons  snipped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  apple juice - (to 2)
                        = (or water)
  4                     pork loin rib chops, 1 1/2" thick

At least 1 hour before smoke cooking, soak wood chips in enough water to cover.  Drain before using.

For rub, in a small bowl combine black pepper, celery seed, onion salt, cloves, and if desired, ground red pepper.  Set aside.

For stuffing, in a small saucepan cook the sausage and onion until sausage is brown and onion is tender.  Drain well.  Stir in the stuffing mix, cranberries, green chili peppers, and parsley.  Toss with enough apple juice just to moisten.

Trim fat from chops.  Make a pocket in each chop by cutting horizontally from the fat side almost to the bone.  Spoon stuffing into pockets.  If necessary, secure openings with wooden toothpicks.  Sprinkle rub evenly over chops; rub in with your fingers.

In a charcoal grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan.  Test for medium heat above the pan.  Sprinkle the drained wood chips over the coals.  Place chops on the grill rack over drip pan.  Cover and smoke for 35 to 40 minutes or until the juices run clear.

In a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium.  Adjust for indirect cooking.  Smoke as above, except add drained wood chips according to the manufacturer's directions.

At least 1 hour before smoke cooking, soak wood chips in enough water to cover.  Drain before using.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For rub, in a small bowl combine black pepper, celery seed, onion salt, cloves, and if desired, ground red pepper.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For stuffing, in a small saucepan cook the sausage and onion until sausage is brown and onion is tender.  Drain well.  Stir in the stuffing mix, cranberries, green chili peppers, and parsley.  Toss with enough apple juice just to moisten.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Trim fat from chops.  Make a pocket in each chop by cutting horizontally from the fat side almost to the bone.  Spoon stuffing into pockets.  If necessary, secure openings with wooden toothpicks.  Sprinkle rub evenly over chops; rub in with your fingers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a charcoal grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan.  Test for medium heat above the pan.  Sprinkle the drained wood chips over the coals.  Place chops on the grill rack over drip pan.  Cover and smoke for 35 to 40 minutes or until the juices run clear.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium.  Adjust for indirect cooking.  Smoke as above, except add drained wood chips according to the manufacturer&apos;s directions.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  4           teaspoon  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  snipped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (abt 1 1/4 lbs)
  4             slices  bias-cut Italian or French bread, 1" thk
     1/4           cup  semi-soft cheese with herbs
                        = (or semi-soft goat cheese [chevre])
  1                cup  roasted red sweet peppers - (7-oz jar) -- cut into strips
     1/2           cup  fresh watercress, basil, or
                        baby spinach leaves

In a small dish whisk together the oil, vinegar, thyme, salt, and crushed red pepper.  Remove and reserve 2 tablespoons of the marinade.

Place chicken between 2 sheets of waxed paper; pound lightly with a meat mallet to make an even thickness about 1/2-inch thick; place in a plastic bag.  Add the remaining marinade.  Seal bag and marinate about 15 minutes at room temperature or up to 1 hour in the refrigerator.

Lightly grease the rack of a grill or lightly coat with nonstick cooking spray.  Preheat grill.  Brush cut sides of bread with reserved marinade; place bread, cut-side down, on grill rack.  If using a covered grill, close the lid.  Grill until lightly toasted.  (For a covered grill, allow 1 to 2 minutes; for an uncovered grill, allow 2 to 4 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling.)  Remove bread from grill; set aside.

Place chicken on the grill rack.  If using a covered grill, close the lid.  Grill until chicken is tender and no longer pink.  (For a covered grill, allow 3 to 4 minutes; for an uncovered grill, allow 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling.)  Remove from grill and spread or sprinkle with cheese.

To serve, place one chicken breast on each grilled bread slice.  Top with roasted pepper strips and watercress.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Here is an easy recipe since the thin-sliced chicken cutlets cook quickly and remain juicy and tender.

  1              pound  ground turkey or beef
  4             medium  green onions -- chopped - (1/4 cup)
  1                cup  cooked wild rice
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill
                        = (or 1 tspn dried dill weed)
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  6                     French rolls -- split
                        === DILLED DIJON SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise or salad dressing
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh dill

To make parsley sauce:  In small bowl, whisk together parsley, oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, capers, salt and pepper.  Cover.  Refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours.

To prepare grill:  Prepare charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill for direct grilling over high heat.  If you do not have grill basket, lay piece of oiled, heavy-duty aluminum foil -- slightly larger than fish -- on grill.  Poke several holes in foil.

To grill fish:  Using pastry brush, generously coat both sides of fish with oil.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place fish on grill -- in grill basket or on foil.  (Note: If fish has skin, place it skin-side down.)  If using grill basket, turn fish once during grilling; if using foil, do not turn it.  Grill until fish flakes when poked with fork but is still a bit opaque in center.  (Note: Grilling time will vary according to thickness of fillets but should not take longer than 12 minutes total.)

To serve:  Transfer fish to platter.  Drizzle with some parsley sauce.  Serve with additional sauce on side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh or frozen large shrimp in shells
  1              large  garlic bulb
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1                     red or yellow sweet pepper -- quartered lengthwise
  1                     onion -- cut into 1/2" slices
  3               cups  packaged dried cavatelli - (8 oz)
                        = (or bow tie pasta)
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  shredded Asiago or Parmesan cheese

Thaw shrimp, if frozen.  Peel and devein shrimp, leaving tails intact.  Rinse shrimp; pat dry with paper towels.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to grill.

With a sharp knife, cut off the top 1/2 inch from garlic bulb to expose the ends of the individual cloves.  Leaving garlic bulb whole, remove any loose, papery outer layers.

Fold an 18- by 9-inch piece of heavy foil in half to make a 9-inch square.  Place garlic bulb, cut-side up, in center of foil.  Drizzle bulb with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the oil.  Bring up opposite edges of foil and seal with a double fold.  Fold remaining edges together to completely enclose garlic, leaving room for steam to build.

For a charcoal grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan.  Test for medium heat above the pan.  Place garlic on greased grill rack over drip pan.  Cover and grill for 30 minutes.  (For a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium.  Adjust for indirect cooking.  Grill as above.)

Meanwhile, thread shrimp onto long metal skewers, leaving a 1/4-inch space between pieces.  In a small bowl combine the remaining oil and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice; brush over shrimp and vegetables.

Add skewers to grill over drip pan; add vegetables to grill directly over coals.  Cover and grill for 8 to 10 minutes more or until garlic is soft, shrimp are opaque, and vegetables are tender, turning shrimp and vegetables once halfway through grilling.  Remove from grill.  Cool garlic and vegetables slightly.  Coarsely chop vegetables.

While shrimp and vegetables are grilling, cook pasta according to package directions; drain.  Return pasta to hot pan.

Squeeze garlic pulp into a small bowl.  Thoroughly mash garlic pulp.  Add butter, salt, and black pepper; mix well.  In a large bowl combine pasta and garlic mixture; toss to coat.  Add shrimp, vegetables, remaining lemon juice, and cheese; toss gently to mix.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  As any Italian cook knows, garlic, butter, shrimp, and pasta were made for each other.  But using roasted garlic can make the best even better.

                       Garlic-Grilled Whole Chicken

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  broiler-fryer chicken - (2 1/2 to 3 lbs)
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/2                lemon -- sliced
     1/2                red sweet pepper -- sliced
  1         tablespoon  snipped fresh basil
                        = (or 1 tspn dried basil, crushed)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  olive oil or cooking oil
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
                        Steamed new potatoes -- (optional)
                        Fresh oregano -- (optional)

Remove the neck and giblets from chicken.  Twist wing tips under the back.  Cut one of the garlic cloves lengthwise in half.  Rub skin of chicken with cut edge of garlic.  Place garlic halves, lemon slices, and sweet pepper slices in cavity of chicken.  Mince remaining two cloves of garlic.  Combine minced garlic, basil, and salt; set aside.

Starting at the neck on one side of the breast, slip your fingers between skin and meat, loosening the skin as you work toward the tail end.  Once your entire hand is under the skin, free the skin around the thigh and leg area up to, but not around, the tip of the drumstick.  Repeat on the other side of the breast.  Rub garlic mixture over entire surface under skin.  Securely fasten opening with water-soaked wooden toothpicks.  Stir together oil and lemon juice; brush over chicken.

Arrange preheated coals around a drip pan in a covered grill.  Test for medium heat above pan.  Place chicken, breast-side up, on grill over drip pan.  Cover and grill for 1 to 1 1/4 hours or until chicken is no longer pink and the drumsticks move easily in their sockets, brushing occasionally with oil-lemon mixture.

Remove chicken from grill and cover with foil.  If desired, serve on a platter with steamed new potatoes and garnish with fresh oregano.  Let stand for 5 minutes before carving.

This recipe yields 5 servings.

Nutritional facts per serving:  Calories: 245,  total fat: 15g,  saturated fat: 4g,  cholesterol: 79mg,  sodium: 127mg,  carbohydrate: 2g,  fiber: 0g,  protein: 25g,  vitamin A: 9%,  vitamin C: 28%,  calcium: 1%,  iron: 8%.

Comments:  A mixture of garlic and basil inserted under the skin and a combination of lemon, sweet pepper, and additional garlic in the cavity flavor every bite of this grilled chicken.

                           Ginger Pear Crumble

Recipe By     :Patti Bess
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit
                Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  whole-wheat pastry flour
                        = (or all-purpose white flour)
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest -- grated
  1         tablespoon  fresh ginger -- grated
     1/4           cup  brown sugar -- may double
     1/4           cup  butter
  5               cups  pears -- sliced
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
                        Whipped cream or frozen yogurt -- to serve

Prepare grill for indirect heat.

Mix the flour, lemon zest, ginger, and brown sugar in a bowl.  Using a pastry cutter, two knives, or a food processor, cut the butter into the flour mixture until the mixture is crumbly but not sticky.

Place the pear slices in an 8- by 8-inch square baking dish, spreading them evenly.  Sprinkle with lemon juice.  Spoon the crumb mixture over the top of the pears.

Bake on the grill for 20 to 30 minutes, checking for doneness periodically (when the pears are tender and the top is browned).  This dish will be juicy.

Serve straight from the grill with just a dollop of whipped cream or frozen yogurt (as desired).

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This simple dessert is just enough to satisfy.  Try adding a small amount of ginger to the whipped cream as well.

Place the pear slices in an 8- by 8-inch square baking dish, spreading them evenly.  Sprinkle with lemon juice.  Spoon the crumb mixture over the top of the pears.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake on the grill for 20 to 30 minutes, checking for doneness periodically (when the pears are tender and the top is browned).  This dish will be juicy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve straight from the grill with just a dollop of whipped cream or frozen yogurt (as desired).
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This simple dessert is just enough to satisfy.  Try adding a small amount of ginger to the whipped cream as well.

                       Greek Grilled Shrimp Skewers

Recipe By     :Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarbrough
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained, and
                        coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated lemon peel
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2         pounds  peeled and deveined shrimp -- uncooked
                        = (large or 16 to 20 per lb size)
  14            ounces  canned artichoke hearts -- drained, halved
  8                     cherry tomatoes - (to 12)
  4                     skewers
  1                cup  crumbled feta cheese - (4 oz)

In large bowl, stir together oil, garlic, capers, dill, oregano, lemon peel, fennel seeds (crush fennel seeds with mortar and pestle, flat side of meat mallet or bottom of saucepan), salt and pepper.  Stir in shrimp to coat; cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 4 hours.

Heat grill.  Equally divide and thread shrimp, artichoke hearts and tomatoes onto 4 (10- to 12-inch) metal skewers.  [See variation.]  Brush marinade over shrimp.  Place on gas grill over medium heat or on charcoal grill 4 to 6 inches from medium coals.  Cook 3 minutes; turn.  Place feta on shrimp [messy!].  Cook an additional 3 minutes or until shrimp turn pink and cheese is melted.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variation:  Rosemary Skewers.  Cut 12- to 14-inch long boughs of rosemary.  Strip the leaves from 10 to 12 inches from bottom, leaves a decorative tip.  Soak in water as you would bamboo skewers.  When grilling, protect the rosemary leaves from flame (use foil or position away from burner).

Serving Ideas:  Orange sections and almond biscotti make a great dessert.

Comments:  Inspired by the flavors of the Greek isles, these shrimp skewers are elegant enough for a sit-down dinner party but easy enough for a Saturday picnic.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GLAZE ===
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/4           cup  honey
  3        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
                        === FRUIT ===
                        Bananas -- as needed
                        Peaches -- as needed
                        Pineapple -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  1              pinch  cinnamon

To make honey glaze:  Stir together butter, honey and lime juice until smooth.  (Makes 1 cup)

To prepare bananas:  Peel bananas.  Slice each in half crosswise and then lengthwise.  Add pinch of ground cinnamon and/or 2 tablespoons of dark rum to honey glaze.  Using pastry brush, coat banana pieces with glaze.  Grill over direct medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes, turning gently, until light brown.

To prepare peaches:  Cut peaches in half.  Remove pits.  Toss fruit gently in bowl with honey glaze.  Grill, cut-side down, over medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning after 7 to 8 minutes.

To prepare pineapple:  Cut off top of pineapple.  Peel.  Slice fruit into 3/4-inch-thick rounds.  Add 2 tablespoons dark rum to honey glaze.  Using pastry brush, coat both sides of each slice with glaze.  Grill over direct medium heat for 12 to 15 minutes, turning once halfway through.

To serve:  Divide fruit into bowls.  Add ice cream.

Comments:  Serve warm fruit with a dollop of vanilla ice cream and any leftover glaze.  The glaze recipe makes enough to coat 3 to 4 pounds of fruit.  Use a mixture of bananas, peaches (nectarines or plums work just as well) and pineapple.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  cucumber -- seeded, chopped
  1                cup  cooked or canned black beans -- rinsed, drained
     1/4           cup  snipped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                     pickled jalapeÒo pepper -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder - (to 1)
  3              large  tomatoes -- halved
  1              large  sweet onion -- sliced 1/2" thick
                        = (such as Vidalia)
  1                     loaf French bread

Transfer vegetables to a cutting board; cool slightly and coarsely chop.  Add chopped vegetables to the cucumber mixture; toss to combine.

Meanwhile, halve the French bread lengthwise.  Cut each bread half crosswise into 3 pieces.  Using a fork, hollow out the bread pieces slightly.  Grill the bread pieces, cut-sides down, about 1 minute or until toasted.  Spoon the bean mixture into the bread pieces; sprinkle sandwiches with cheddar cheese.  Place the sandwiches on the grill rack, filled-sides up; close lid and grill for 1 to 2 minutes or until cheese is melted.

         Grilled Giant Pork Chops With Sweet Peach Barbecue Sauce

Recipe By     :Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     loin or rib pork chops, 1 1/2" thk -- 12 to 14 oz ea
                        === SPICE RUB ===
  3        tablespoons  ground coriander
  3        tablespoons  ground paprika
  2        tablespoons  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  freshly-cracked black pepper
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  peeled red onion -- peeled, and
                        sliced thin
  3                     pitted peaches -- pitted, and
                        diced medium
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2             medium  ripe tomatoes -- diced medium
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     1/3           cup  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground allspice
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste

To prepare grill:  Build multi-level fire in grill, leaving one-quarter of bottom free of coals.  Bank coals in remaining three-quarters of grill so they are three times as high on one side as on the other.  Heat until all coals are ignited and temperature has died down to medium.  (Note: If you can hold your hand about 5 inches above grill grid over area where coals are deepest for 4 to 5 seconds, temperature is correct.)

To make Spice Rub:  Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine coriander, paprika, cumin, salt, pepper and brown sugar.  Mix well.  Rub pork chops generously on both sides with mixture.  Set aside.

To make Sauce:  In large sautÈ pan or skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil until it is hot but not smoking.  Add onions.  SautÈ, stirring occasionally, for 11 to 13 minutes, or until golden brown.  Add peaches, ginger and tomatoes.  Cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes.  Stir in vinegar, orange juice, sugar, allspice, salt and pepper.

Bring mixture to a boil.  Reduce heat.  Simmer for 20 minutes, or until mixture is reduced by half and has thickened slightly.  Taste for seasoning.  Transfer sauce to blender or food processor.  Puree until smooth (note: be careful with hot liquid).  Reserve 1/4 cup sauce for basting.  Pour remaining sauce into small serving bowl.

To cook chops:  Put chops on grill over coals.  Cook, turning once, until done to your liking, 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium.  During last 30 seconds of cooking on each side, baste chops generously with sauce.  (Note: To check for doneness, poke meat with finger to check its firmness level.  If you're unsure, nick, peek and cheat: Make 1/4-inch cut in thickest part of chop and peek at center to be sure it is just slightly less done than you like it.)

To serve:  Serve chops hot, passing remaining barbecue sauce on side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Cook's Notes:  Keep in mind that you might have to go to a butcher shop to get chops 1 1/2 inches thick and that this recipe requires some stove-top cooking.  Also, the rub and sauce have sugar in them resulting in lots of caramelized flavor, but you have to watch the chops carefully to be sure they don't burn.

To cook chops:  Put chops on grill over coals.  Cook, turning once, until done to your liking, 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium.  During last 30 seconds of cooking on each side, baste chops generously with sauce.  (Note: To check for doneness, poke meat with finger to check its firmness level.  If you&apos;re unsure, nick, peek and cheat: Make 1/4-inch cut in thickest part of chop and peek at center to be sure it is just slightly less done than you like it.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve:  Serve chops hot, passing remaining barbecue sauce on side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook&apos;s Notes:  Keep in mind that you might have to go to a butcher shop to get chops 1 1/2 inches thick and that this recipe requires some stove-top cooking.  Also, the rub and sauce have sugar in them resulting in lots of caramelized flavor, but you have to watch the chops carefully to be sure they don&apos;t burn.

          Grilled Marjoram Chicken Breasts With Dill-Chive Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CHICKEN ===
  6                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (2 to 2 1/2 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped fresh marjoram
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  sour cream
     3/4           cup  nonfat plain yogurt
     1/4           cup  snipped fresh chives
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh dill
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

For the Chicken:  Place the breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and, using your hand, a skillet or a rolling pin, gently flatten each piece to an even thickness of between 1/4 and 1/2 inch.  Transfer to a shallow bowl.  Working 1 at a time, rub both sides of the chicken first with some of the oil, then some of the lemon juice, then sprinkle with marjoram and pepper to taste.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.

Heat a grill for medium-high heat.  Place the chicken on oiled grate and cook for 2 minutes.  Turn and cook for 4 minutes.  Turn and cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 2 more minutes.  Transfer to a cutting board or platter; cover to keep warm.

For the Sauce:  In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, yogurt, chives, dill, salt and pepper.  (May cover and refrigerate for up to 8 hours.)

Serve the chicken warm and pass the sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Three herbs that work wonders together: marjoram, dill and chives.  The marjoram imparts flavor and flecks of color to the chicken and the creamy dill and chive sauce is a refreshing counterpoint.

                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  orange marmalade
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  olive or vegetable oil
  1                     pork tenderloin - (12 to 16 oz)
  1              pound  French bread loaf -- cut thin slices
                        Lettuce leaves -- as needed

Heat coals or gas grill for direct heat.  Mix marmalade and 1 tablespoon of the mustard.

Brush oil over pork.  Cover and grill pork 5 to 6 inches from medium heat 15 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally, until pork is slightly pink in center.  Lightly brush 1 tablespoon marmalade mixture over pork for last few minutes of grilling.

Spread remaining 3 tablespoons mustard on one side of bread slices.  Cut pork into thin slices.  Place lettuce and pork on half of bread slices.  Heat remaining marmalade mixture to boiling; drizzle over pork.  Top with remaining bread.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 sandwiches.

Substitution:  Use Dijon mustard or your favorite mustard.  Yellow, spicy or country-style mustard also would taste delicious.

Special Touch:  For an easy appetizer, serve these sandwiches open-face, omitting the top slice of bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR SALSA ===
  5                     plum tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped white onion
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR BURRITOS ===
                        Vegetable oil -- to prepare grill
  1                     red bell pepper
  1                     yellow bell pepper
  1                can  black beans - (15 oz) -- drained
  6                     chicken chorizo sausages
  6                     flour tortillas - (12" dia)
     1/4          head  iceberg lettuce -- thinly sliced
                        Guacamole -- (optional)
                        Sour cream -- (optional)

To prepare salsa:  Combine tomatoes, garlic, jalapeÒo, onion, cilantro, lime juice and salt in small bowl; set aside.  (Can refrigerate up to 3 days.)

To prepare burritos:  Oil grill grate.  Heat grill to high.  Place whole peppers on grill.  Cook, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides, about 15 minutes.  Transfer peppers to bowl; cover with plastic wrap.  (Or, place in paper or plastic bag; close bag.)  Remove skins of pepper when cool enough to handle.  Discard stem and seeds.  Chop.  Place in medium bowl.  Stir in beans and salsa; set aside.

Cook sausages on grill until nicely browned on all sides, about 4 minutes.  Move sausages to medium-heat section of grill.  Cook, covered, turning once, until cooked through, about 14 minutes.

Cut sausages into 1/2-inch rounds.  Add sausages to bean mixture.

Place tortillas on grill to warm, about 20 seconds.  Spoon sausage filling on each tortilla.  Sprinkle lettuce on top.  Layer with guacamole and sour cream.  Roll up, folding in both ends.  Serve with guacamole and sour cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This spicy burrito can be made with any type of sausage, including regular chorizo or andouille.  To save time, you can use purchased salsa instead of preparing one as directed.

                       Grilled Sicilian-Style Pizza

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16             ounce  Italian bread shell - (Boboli)
  2                     plum tomatoes -- thinly sliced
  1              large  yellow or red tomato -- thinly sliced
  4             ounces  fresh mozzarella -- thinly sliced
                        = (or buffalo mozzarella cheese)
     1/3           cup  halved pitted kalamata olives
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped escarole or curly endive
     1/4           cup  shredded Pecorino Romano or
                        Parmesan cheese

Top bread shell with tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and olives.  Drizzle oil over all.  Fold a 24- by 18-inch piece of heavy foil in half lengthwise.  Place on foil, turning edges of foil up to edge of pizza.

In a grill with a cover arrange preheated coals around a drip pan for indirect grilling.  Test for medium heat above pan.  Place pizza on the grill rack over the drip pan.  Cover and grill about 8 minutes or until pizza is heated through, topping with escarole the last 2 minutes of grilling.

To serve, sprinkle cheese and freshly ground black pepper over pizza.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Nutritional facts per serving:  Calories: 459,  total fat: 19g,  saturated fat: 4g,  cholesterol: 26mg,  sodium: 893mg,  carbohydrate: 54g,  fiber: 3g,  protein: 24g,  vitamin A: 12%,  vitamin C: 14%,  calcium: 31%,  iron: 18%.

Serving suggestion:  Finish this meal-in-one with a flourish.  Serve with purchased biscotti and a little sweet wine -- such as Vin Santo -- or espresso or cappuccino for dipping.

Comments:  Sicilians like their escarole -- a mild, leafy kind of endive -- sauteed with lots of olive oil and served with chewy bread to sop up the juices.  For maximum flavor in this grilled adaptation of that idea, use the tangy Italian cheese, Pecorino Romano.

Fresh is Best:  They may have the same last name, but the similarity ends there.  Fresh mozzarella -- made from whole milk -- has a much softer texture and sweeter, more delicate flavor than regular mozzarella, which is made in low-fat and nonfat versions and is aged to give it a longer shelf life.  Fresh mozzarella, usually packaged in whey or water and shaped into irregular balls, must be eaten within a few days of purchase.  Itís available in Italian markets and cheese shops and increasingly, in many supermarkets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  small red potatoes -- scrubbed
     1/2      teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt -- divided
  3             pounds  boneless beef sirloin -- cut 1 1/2" cubes
  1 1/2         pounds  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  2              pints  cherry tomatoes
  16             large  white mushrooms
  4             medium  zucchini -- sliced diagonally
                        into 1/2"-thick slices
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 1/4 tspn dried thyme)
  1                     focaccia bread loaf -- sliced
                        === GREEN SAUCE ===
  3             ounces  shallots -- cut up - (2/3 cup)
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  1                cup  chopped fresh parsley leaves
     1/2           cup  capers - (from two 3-oz jars) -- drained
  1                can  flat anchovy fillets - (2 oz) -- drained
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried thyme)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     2/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Soak 3 dozen 12-inch wooden skewers in water to cover 1 hour.

For the Green Sauce:  Chop shallots in food processor; transfer to small bowl and stir in vinegar.  Process parsely, capers, anchovy fillets, 2 teaspoons thyme, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper, except oil, until finely chopped.  Add to shallot mixture.  Stir in the 2/3 cup oil.

Meanwhile, heat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine potatoes, 1/2 teaspoon of the oil and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt in 13- by 9-inch baking pan.  Cover with foil and bake 40 to 60 minutes or until potatoes are tender when pierced with fork.  Cool.

Heat grill.  Loosely thread beef on 9 to 10 skewers.  Loosely thread shrimp on 10 more skewers.  Thread tomatoes, mushrooms and zucchini slices on remaining skewers, using only one type of vegetable per skewer.

Combine remaining 1/3 cup oil, 1 teaspoon of the salt, the 1 teaspoon thyme and the 1/2 teaspoon pepper in small bowl.  Brush over beef, shrimp and vegetables.

Arrange potatoes around edge of barbecue.  Grill mushrooms and zucchini over medium-hot coals (you should be able to hold your hand over the coals at the height of the food for 3 seconds before you have to pull away) until browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes per side.  Transfer to serving platter.

Grill tomatoes just until charred, 1 to 2 minutes; add to platter.  Grill shrimp 3 minutes per side or until firm and opaque.  Grill beef 5 minutes per side for medium-rare (145 degrees).  Transfer shrimp and beef to platter; cover and keep warm.

Grill focaccia until lightly browned and crisped on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes.  Place on serving platter with potatoes, grilled vegetables, beef and shrimp.  Serve with Green Sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Make-Ahead Tip:  Prepare Green Sauce.  Let stand at room temperature up to 8 hours.  Bake potatoes.  Cover and refrigerate up to 24 hours.

Comments:  Steak, shrimp and veggies are skewered for easy grilling and served with a zesty, fresh herb-shallot sauce for this surf-and-turf special.

Meanwhile, heat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine potatoes, 1/2 teaspoon of the oil and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt in 13- by 9-inch baking pan.  Cover with foil and bake 40 to 60 minutes or until potatoes are tender when pierced with fork.  Cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat grill.  Loosely thread beef on 9 to 10 skewers.  Loosely thread shrimp on 10 more skewers.  Thread tomatoes, mushrooms and zucchini slices on remaining skewers, using only one type of vegetable per skewer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine remaining 1/3 cup oil, 1 teaspoon of the salt, the 1 teaspoon thyme and the 1/2 teaspoon pepper in small bowl.  Brush over beef, shrimp and vegetables.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange potatoes around edge of barbecue.  Grill mushrooms and zucchini over medium-hot coals (you should be able to hold your hand over the coals at the height of the food for 3 seconds before you have to pull away) until browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes per side.  Transfer to serving platter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grill tomatoes just until charred, 1 to 2 minutes; add to platter.  Grill shrimp 3 minutes per side or until firm and opaque.  Grill beef 5 minutes per side for medium-rare (145 degrees).  Transfer shrimp and beef to platter; cover and keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grill focaccia until lightly browned and crisped on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes.  Place on serving platter with potatoes, grilled vegetables, beef and shrimp.  Serve with Green Sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make-Ahead Tip:  Prepare Green Sauce.  Let stand at room temperature up to 8 hours.  Bake potatoes.  Cover and refrigerate up to 24 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Steak, shrimp and veggies are skewered for easy grilling and served with a zesty, fresh herb-shallot sauce for this surf-and-turf special.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Asparagus spears
                        Small carrots
                        Eggplant
                        Fennel
                        Sweet peppers
                        Leeks
                        New potatoes
                        Baby zucchini or regular zucchini
                        Olive oil, melted margarine, or
                        melted butter

Before grilling, rinse, trim, cut up, and precook vegetables as directed in "Preparations and Timings for Grilled Vegetables".  To precook any one vegetable, in a saucepan bring a small amount of water to boiling; add desired vegetable and simmer, covered, for the time specified.  Drain well.

To grill, brush vegetables with olive oil, margarine, or butter before grilling to prevent sticking to grill rack.  Cook vegetables on the grill rack directly over medium-hot coals until tender and slightly charred, turning occasionally.  Use the following timings as a guide.  (Actual timings will differ depending on thickness of vegetables, how hot the coals are, and how far the vegetables are form the coals.)

   Preperation and Timings for Grilled Vegetables:

Asparagus:  Snap off and discard tough bases and stems.  Precook 2 minutes, then tie asparagus in bundles of 3 or 4 spears with strips of cooked green onion tops.  Grill bundles 3 to 5 minutes or until vegetables are of desired doneness.

Small carrots:  Cut off carrot tops; wash and peel.  Precook 3 minutes.  Grill 3 to 5 minutes.

Eggplant:  Cut off top and blossom ends.  Cut crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick slices.  Do not precook.  Grill 6 to 8 minutes.

Fennel:  Snip off feathery leaves.  Cut off stems.  Precook whole bulbs 8 minutes.  Cut bulbs into 6 to 8 wedges and grill 8 to 10 minutes.

Sweet Peppers:  Remove stems.  Quarter peppers and remove seeds with membranes.  Cut peppers into 1-inch-wide strips.  Do not precook.  Grill 8 to 10 minutes.

Leeks:  Cut off green tops; trim bulb roots and remove 1 or 2 layers of white skin.  Precook 6 to 10 minutes, then halve leeks lengthwise and grill 5 minutes or until tender.

New Potatoes:  Halve potatoes.  Precook 10 minutes or until almost tender.  Grill 10 to 12 minutes.

Yellow squash (crockneck or straightneck) or zucchini:  Wash; cut off ends.  Cut each vegetable lengthwise into strips.  Do not precook.  Grill 6 to 8 minutes.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  It seems that these days no cookout is complete without grilled vegetables.  Serve them as a side dish for grilled fish or meat, or as an appetizer.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Sandwiches                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Orange Ginger Marinade -- (see below)
  4                     tuna steaks - (4 oz ea)
  3        tablespoons  mayonnaise or salad dressing
  4                     kaiser or sandwich buns -- split
                        Lettuce leaves -- as needed
  1              large  tomato -- sliced
     1/2        medium  cucumber -- thinly sliced
                        === ORANGE GINGER MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame or vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  orange juice
  1           teaspoon  grated gingerroot
                        = (or 1/2 tspn ground ginger)

Make Orange Ginger Marinade:  Mix all ingredients in ungreased square baking dish, 8 by 8 by 2 inches; remove 1 tablespoon marinade and reserve.  Add tuna to remaining marinade; turn to coat.  Cover and refrigerate at least 15 minutes but no longer than 2 hours.

Spray grill rack with cooking spray.  Heat coals or gas grill for direct heat.  Remove tuna from marinade; discard marinade.  Cover and grill tuna 5 to 6 inches from medium heat about 10 minutes, turning once, until fish flakes easily with fork.

Mix reserved 1 tablespoon marinade and mayonnaise; spread on cut sides of buns.  Layer lettuce, tuna, tomato and cucumber in each bun.

This recipe yields 4 sandwiches.

Substitution:  Use your favorite buns in place of the kaiser rolls.

Success Hint:  Fish generally takes about 10 minutes to grill for each inch of thickness.  Add more time if the steaks are thicker, or grill the fish for slightly less time if the pieces are thinner.

                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     red and/or yellow sweet peppers
  2                     Japanese eggplants -- halved lengthwise
  2             medium  zucchini or yellow summer squash -- halved lengthwise
                        = (or 8 to 10 yellow sunburst or
                        pattypan squash) -- see * Note
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2               cups  dried tortiglioni or rigatoni
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
                        = (or red wine vinegar)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  water
  1           teaspoon  bottled roasted minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  cubed fontina cheese - (3 oz)
  1         tablespoon  snipped fresh Italian parsley - (to 2)

* Note:  If using sunburst or pattypan squash, precook for 3 minutes in a small amount of boiling water before grilling.

Halve sweet peppers lengthwise; remove and discard stems, seeds, and membranes.  Brush sweet peppers, eggplants, and zucchini with the 1 tablespoon oil.  To grill, place vegetables on the grill rack directly over medium-hot coals.  Grill, uncovered, for 8 to 12 minutes or until vegetables are tender, turning occasionally.  Remove vegetables from grill; cool slightly.  Cut vegetables into 1-inch pieces.

Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions.  For dressing, in a screw-top jar combine balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar, olive oil, water, bottled roasted minced garlic, salt, and pepper.  Cover and shake well.

Drain pasta.  Rinse with cold water; drain again.  In a large bowl combine pasta and grilled vegetables.  Pour dressing over salad.  Toss lightly to coat.  Stir in cheese; sprinkle with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Nutritional facts per serving:  Calories: 369,  total fat: 19g,  saturated fat: 6g,  cholesterol: 61mg,  sodium: 317mg,  carbohydrate: 40g,  fiber: 5g,  protein: 12g,  vitamin A: 38%,  vitamin C: 113%,  calcium: 12%,  iron: 18%.

Make-Ahead Tip:  Cut up cheese; wrap and refrigerate up to 24 hours.  Prepare dressing; cover and refrigerate up to 24 hours.  Remove from refrigerator about 15 minutes before tossing with salad.

Comments:  Vegetables, sweet and smoky from the grill, give pasta and cheese a jolt of flavor and color.  By doing the grilling ahead, and storing the savory dressing in the refrigerator, this flavor-filled dish is done in the time it takes to simmer pasta.

Halve sweet peppers lengthwise; remove and discard stems, seeds, and membranes.  Brush sweet peppers, eggplants, and zucchini with the 1 tablespoon oil.  To grill, place vegetables on the grill rack directly over medium-hot coals.  Grill, uncovered, for 8 to 12 minutes or until vegetables are tender, turning occasionally.  Remove vegetables from grill; cool slightly.  Cut vegetables into 1-inch pieces.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions.  For dressing, in a screw-top jar combine balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar, olive oil, water, bottled roasted minced garlic, salt, and pepper.  Cover and shake well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain pasta.  Rinse with cold water; drain again.  In a large bowl combine pasta and grilled vegetables.  Pour dressing over salad.  Toss lightly to coat.  Stir in cheese; sprinkle with parsley.

Make-Ahead Tip:  Cut up cheese; wrap and refrigerate up to 24 hours.  Prepare dressing; cover and refrigerate up to 24 hours.  Remove from refrigerator about 15 minutes before tossing with salad.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Vegetables, sweet and smoky from the grill, give pasta and cheese a jolt of flavor and color.  By doing the grilling ahead, and storing the savory dressing in the refrigerator, this flavor-filled dish is done in the time it takes to simmer pasta.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     pan-dressed trout, coho salmon, or
                        walleye - (10 to 12 oz ea)
                        = (scaled, with heads and tails intact)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              small  lemon or lime -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  fresh basil leaves - (packed)
  16                    fresh rosemary, oregano
                        and/or sage branches - (to 20)
  2                     zucchini and/or yellow summer squash -- cut 3/4" pieces
  1             medium  sweet onion -- cut into 8 wedges
  8                     skewers - (8" long)
  8              large  fresh mushrooms
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  snipped fresh rosemary

Rinse fish and pat dry with paper towels.  Season cavity and outside of each fish with salt and pepper.  Place lemon or lime slices and basil leaves in the cavity of each fish.  Lay remaining herb branches over each fish and gently tie with kitchen string in three places.  Grill immediately or cover and chill the fish up to 2 hours.  Transport in an insulated cooler with ice packs.

Thread zucchini pieces and onion wedges on skewers.  Cook vegetable kabobs in a small amount of boiling water in a covered 4 1/2-quart Dutch oven for 5 minutes.  With tongs, carefully lift out kabobs.  Add a mushroom to the end of each skewer.  Place in a shallow container; cover and chill up to 2 hours.  Transport in an insulated cooler with ice packs.

Combine olive oil and the 1 tablespoon snipped rosemary.  Brush fish bundles and vegetables lightly with olive oil mixture.  Grill fish and vegetables using direct or indirect heat.

For direct heat:  Grease grill rack.  Place fish on grill rack directly over medium coals.  Grill about 14 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork, turning halfway through grilling.  Place vegetable kabobs on grill rack directly over coals for the last 6 minutes of grilling, turning kabobs once.

For indirect heat:  Grease rack of a grill with a cover.  Arrange preheated coals around a drip pan.  Test for medium heat above the pan.  Place fish on the grill rack over the drip pan.  Cover and grill about 20 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.  Place vegetable kabobs on grill rack directly over coals for the last 6 minutes of grilling, turning skewers once during cooking.

Snip strings and discard herb branches from fish.  Serve whole or remove heads and skin.  Serve with vegetable kabobs.

This recipe yields 4 main-dish servings.

Comments:  Use the direct grilling method when you're cooking on a small portable grill at the beach.  At home with a larger grill, consider the indirect method.

               Honey Mustard Grilled Salmon And Pasta Salad

                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Honey-Mustard Dressing -- (see below)
  1              pound  salmon fillet, 1/2" thick -- cut into 4 pieces
  2             medium  bell peppers -- cut 3/4" pieces
  1             medium  zucchini -- cut 3/4" pieces
  2               cups  uncooked fusilli (corkscrew) pasta -- (6 oz)
  2               cups  fresh baby salad greens
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried dill weed)
                        === HONEY-MUSTARD DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  white balsamic vinegar
                        = (or white wine vinegar)
     1/4           cup  olive or vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground mustard

Heat coals or gas grill for direct heat.

Make Honey-Mustard Dressing:  Shake all ingredients in tightly covered container.

Brush salmon with about 2 tablespoons of the dressing.  Toss bell peppers, zucchini and 1 tablespoon of the dressing.  Place vegetables in grill basket.  Place salmon, skin-side down, on grill.  Cover and grill salmon and vegetables 4 to 6 inches from medium heat 10 to 15 minutes, shaking grill basket to turn vegetables occasionally, until salmon flakes easily with fork and vegetables are crisp-tender.

Cook and drain pasta as directed on package.  Rinse with cold water; drain.  Mix pasta, vegetables and about 1/4 cup of the dressing.

Arrange salad greens on 4 plates.  Top with pasta mixture.  Place salmon on pasta and vegetables.  Drizzle each serving with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the dressing.  Sprinkle with dill weed.  Serve with remaining dressing.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  White balsamic vinegar is lighter and sweeter in flavor than its darker partner, making it perfect for dressing crisp and delicate salad greens.  Although new to supermarket shelves, this vinegar is sure to become a popular staple in many kitchen cupboards.

                         Hot Honey Shrimp Skewers

Recipe By     :Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarbrough
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  wildflower honey -- see * Note
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  3        tablespoons  cranberry juice frozen concentrate -- thawed
  2          teaspoons  crushed red pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  nutmeg
  1 1/2         pounds  peeled and deveined shrimp -- uncooked
                        = (large or 16 to 20 per lb size)
  4               ears  corn -- husked, and cut
                        crosswise into 1" pieces
  2                     red bell peppers -- cut 1 1/2" pieces
  8                     skewers

* Note:  Wildflower honeys are usually medium to dark in color and more robust in flavor.  Any honey can be substituted in this recipe.

In small saucepan, melt honey with oil over low heat.  Bring to a boil; remove from heat.  Stir in cranberry juice concentrate, red pepper, salt and nutmeg.  Let stand at room temperature 10 to 15 minutes or until cool.

Place shrimp in large bowl; pour honey marinade over shrimp, stirring to coat.  Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.  3 Heat grill.  Alternately thread shrimp, corn and bell peppers onto 8 (8- to 10-inch) metal skewers.  (If corn is difficult to thread, use small knife to cut hole through corn first.)  Place on gas grill over medium heat or on charcoal grill 4 to 6 inches from medium coals.  Cook 8 to 10 minutes or until shrimp turn pink, turning once and basting occasionally with marinade.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Ideas: Nutty wild rice side dish.

Comments:  This piquant honey marinade becomes the barbecue baste once the shrimp go on the grill.  Crushed red pepper provides a spicy kick, but you can adjust the amount to your taste.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  plain low-fat yogurt
     1/3           cup  chopped seeded cucumber
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1             medium  fresh jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, chopped
                        = (or 2 tbspns canned diced green chiles)
  1         tablespoon  snipped fresh mint
                        = (or 1 tspn dried mint -- crushed)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  bottled minced garlic
                        = (or 1/8 tspn garlic powder)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  8             ounces  lean ground beef, pork, or turkey

For sauce, stir together the yogurt and cucumber in a small bowl.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Combine the onion, jalapeÒo pepper, mint, cumin, garlic, and salt in a medium bowl.  Add the ground meat; mix well.  Form mixture into two 3/4-inch-thick patties.

For a charcoal grill, place patties on the grill rack directly over medium coals.  Grill, uncovered, for 14 to 18 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the patty registers 160 degrees, turning once.

For a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium.  Place patties on the grill rack; cover and grill as directed above.

Serve the patties topped with yogurt-cucumber sauce.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  medium chicken breasts - (2 lbs total) -- halved lengthwise
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground red pepper
     1/2           cup  jalapeÒo pepper jelly
  2        tablespoons  snipped fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  lime juice

If desired, remove skin from chicken.

For rub, in a small bowl combine oil, garlic, salt, and red pepper.  Spoon rub evenly over chicken; rub in with your fingers.

For sauce, in a small saucepan combine jalapeÒo jelly, basil, and lime juice.  Cook and stir over low heat until jelly is melted.  Remove from heat.

For a charcoal grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan.  Test for medium heat above the pan.  Place chicken, bone-side up, on grill rack over drip pan.  Cover and grill for 50 to 60 minutes or until tender and no longer pink, turning once and brushing with some of the sauce during the last 5 minutes of grilling.

For a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium.  Adjust for indirect cooking.  Grill as above.

To serve, reheat and pass the remaining sauce with chicken.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (4 to 4 1/2 lbs) -- cut 8 pieces
  1                cup  Jerk Paste -- (see below)
  3        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter -- divided use
  2        tablespoons  molasses
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing
  4                     unpeeled bananas - (to 6) -- halved lengthwise
                        === JERK PASTE ===
  2                     Scotch bonnet or habanero chiles - (to 4)
  1              small  yellow onion -- quartered
  3                     green onions -- cut 1" lengths
  4                     fresh ginger slices - (quarter-sized)
  3                     garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh cilantro - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  Kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  ground allspice
  1         tablespoon  dried thyme
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil

To make the Jerk Paste:  Cut chiles into quarters, including the seeds.  In a food processor fitted with metal blade, combine chilies, yellow onion, green onions, ginger, garlic and cilantro; process to a coarse paste.  Add salt, allspice, thyme, pepper, and brown sugar.  Process until combined.  Then add lime juice, soy sauce and oil.  Process until mixture forms a paste.

Place chicken pieces in a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag or in a shallow baking pan.  Coat all sides of chicken with jerk paste.  Seal bag or cover pan.  Refrigerate 2 to 4 hours.  Occasionally turn bag or rotate chicken pieces to keep sides coated.  Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling.

Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas or electric grill on medium-high.  In a small bowl, thoroughly combine 1 tablespoon of the butter with molasses.  Set aside.

Brush grill grate with vegetable oil.  Place coated chicken directly over medium-low fire.  Cover grill and cook chicken about 12 minutes.  Turn and cover again.  Cook about 12 minutes more, or until juices run clear when pierced with a knife or an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees when inserted into thickest part of breast and thigh.  Transfer to a platter and keep warm while you grill bananas.

Brush bananas with remaining butter.  Grill, cut-side down, until bananas begin to turn golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Turn and grill, skin-side down, 2 minutes more.  Remove from grill and brush generously with molasses glaze.  Serve with chicken.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                     Lemon-And-Herb Rubbed Pork Chops

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4          teaspoons  minced garlic - (abt 8 cloves)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-shredded lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  dried rosemary -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried sage -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     pork loin chops, 1 1/4" thick

For rub, combine the garlic, lemon peel, rosemary, salt, sage, and pepper.  Trim fat from meat.  Rub mixture onto both sides of each pork chop.

For a charcoal grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan in a grill that has a cover.  Test for medium heat above pan.  Place chops on grill rack directly over the pan.  Cover and grill, turning once, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in center of a chop registers 160 degrees and juices run clear (35 to 40 minutes).

For a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium and adjust for indirect cooking.  Place chops on grill rack; and grill as above.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Lemon peel makes the mixture just moist enough to rub easily.  The rub is exactly the right amount for four thick chops.

                          Little Mushroom Bites

Recipe By     :Andrea Chesman
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  mushrooms -- trimmed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     garlic cloves
     3/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  grated white cheese
                        = (such as Parmesan or provolone)
  2        tablespoons  sherry

Prepare a medium-hot fire in the grill with a vegetable grill rack in place.

Remove the stems from the mushrooms and hollow out the caps, reserving the stems and trimmings.  Brush both sides of the mushroom caps with olive oil and sprinkle the inside of the caps with salt and pepper, to taste.

Grill the mushrooms, hollow-side down, until partially cooked, about 5 minutes.  Set aside.

Combine the reserved mushroom stems and trimmings with the remaining olive oil and the garlic and toss to coat.  Grill, tossing frequently, until lightly cooked, about 5 minutes.

Finely chop the mushroom pieces and garlic by hand or in a food processor.  Combine in a medium bowl with the bread crumbs, cheese, and sherry.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Stuff into the mushroom caps, mounding up the filling and pressing with your fingers to pack tightly.

Grill the stuffed mushrooms stuffing-side up, until the mushrooms are completely cooked and the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.

Serve hot or warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variations:  This is a rather simple recipe, and the flavors can be varied as desired.  A tablespoon of chopped fresh herbs is a lovely addition, or a teaspoon of dried herbs can be used.  More garlic or a shallot can be grilled with the mushroom trimmings.  Any wine or stock can be used instead of the sherry.  The bread crumbs can be made with any high-quality white or whole-grain bread.

Comments:  When you are preparing grilled hors d'oeuvres to show off the versatility of the vegetarian grill, these are a sure winner.  The basic recipe focuses on the distinct flavor of the grilled mushroom, but plenty of flavor variations are possible (see above).  The mushrooms can be partly grilled and stuffed ahead of time, then grilled to finish cooking and heat through at the last minute.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     fresh or frozen mahi mahi or
                        pike fillets, 1/2" to 3/4" thk -- (5 to 6 oz ea)
     1/3           cup  snipped fresh cilantro
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-shredded lime peel
     1/3           cup  lime juice
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  4          teaspoons  honey
  1                     fresh jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/4           cups  packaged coleslaw mix
                        = (shredded cabbage with carrot)
  1 1/2           cups  shredded jicama
                        Grilled lemon or lime slices -- (optional)

Thaw fish, if frozen.  Rinse fish; pat dry with paper towels.  Place fish in a shallow dish.

For marinade, in a small bowl combine cilantro, lime juice, oil, honey, jalapeÒo pepper, garlic, and salt; divide in half.  Stir lime peel into one portion of marinade and pour over fish; turn fish to coat.  Cover and marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Reserve the remaining marinade for dressing.

For slaw, in a medium bowl combine cabbage and jicama.  Pour the reserved marinade over cabbage mixture; toss to coat.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Lightly grease the rack of a grill or lightly coat with cooking spray.   Preheat grill.  Drain fish, discarding marinade.  Place fish on the grill rack, tucking under any thin edges.  If using a covered grill, close lid.

Grill until fish just flakes easily when tested with a fork.  (For a covered grill, allow 2 to 3 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness of fish.  For an uncovered grill, allow 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness of fish, gently turning once halfway through grilling.)  Serve the fish with slaw.  If desired, garnish with lemon slices.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Tongue-tingling, but far from fierce, the marinade used for these fish fillets has a hint of honey that makes for a perfect balance of sweet and heat.

  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  2             medium  mangoes -- seeded, peeled,
                        and chopped - (2 cups)
     1/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped green onion

Cook the sweet pepper and onion in hot oil in a large skillet just until tender.  Stir in the mangoes, brown sugar, vinegar, red pepper, and salt.  Bring to boiling.  Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, about 10 minutes or until mangoes are tender.  Cool slightly.  Transfer mixture to a blender container or food processor bowl.  Cover and blend or process until nearly smooth.  Stir in the green onion.

To use, brush chicken, shrimp, fish, or pork with some of the sauce during the last 10 minutes of grilling.  If desired, reheat and pass additional sauce.  Cover and refrigerate remaining sauce up to 2 weeks.

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 cups (ten, 1/4-cup servings).

Nutritional facts per serving:  Calories: 85,  total fat: 3g,  saturated fat: 0g,  cholesterol: 0mg,  sodium: 63mg,  carbohydrate: 15g,  fiber: 2g,  protein: 1g,  vitamin A: 67%,  vitamin C: 115%,  calcium: 2%,  iron: 2%

Comments:  What starts out as a chunky fresh-fruit-and-vegetable salsa you could serve alongside your grilled food, ends up being pureed into a terrific barbecue sauce for the top of it.

                   Marinated And Grilled Summer Squash

Recipe By     :Patti Bess
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small summer squash
                        = (yellow or crookneck)
                        === SUMMER HERB MARINADE ===
  4              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  water
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  fresh oregano leaves
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme leaves
  2        tablespoons  fresh basil leaves

Prepare Summer Herb Marinade:  Add all ingredients to the blender.  Blend until smooth and refrigerate until needed.  (Makes about 3/4 of a cup)

Preheat a gas grill to high, or build a fire in a kettle grill.

Wash and slice squashes lengthwise into quarters or about 1/3-inch-thick slices.

Add marinade to a shallow bowl.  Add squash to the bowl and marinate 30 to 60 minutes turning occasionally to mix marinade with squashes.

Add squashes to a vegetable grilling basket and grill 7 to 10 minutes, turning, until squashes are charred but still fork tender.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Crookneck, zucchini, and the yellow sunburst squash all come to life on the grill.  A grilling basket is a very useful tool on the grill for vegetables so that they will not fall through the grill.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  apple juice
  2        tablespoons  dry bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  chopped onion
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  snipped fresh rosemary
                        = (or 1/4 tspn dried rosemary, crushed)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pound  lean ground lamb
  2        tablespoons  mint jelly -- melted
  4                     pita bread rounds -- halved crosswise
  4                     lettuce leaves
     1/2                cucumber -- thinly sliced
  1              small  tomato -- halved and sliced
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt

In a medium mixing bowl combine apple juice, bread crumbs, onion, garlic, rosemary, and salt.  Add ground lamb and mix well.  Shape into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.

Grill patties on an uncovered grill directly over medium coals for 8 minutes.  Turn patties and brush with mint jelly.  Grill for 6 to 10 minutes more or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in side of patty registers 160 degrees, brushing once or twice with remaining jelly.

To grill by indirect heat:  Arrange preheated coals around a drip pan in a covered grill.  Test for medium heat above pan.  Place patties on grill over drip pan.  Cover and grill for 20 to 24 minutes or until no pink remains, turning patties and brushing with jelly halfway through grilling time.

Open pita bread halves.  Line each with a lettuce leaf and a few cucumber slices.  Place patties in pita bread halves with lettuce, cucumber, tomato, and yogurt.  Serve with remaining pita bread halves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Melted mint jelly makes a lovely and easy glaze for these burgers.  Warm the jelly over low heat to melt it.

                        Mole Rubbed Shrimp Skewers

Recipe By     :Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarbrough
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     New Mexican dried red chile -- veined, seeded
  1 1/2      teaspoons  unsweetened cocoa
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     3/4      teaspoon  salt -- divided
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  sliced almonds -- toasted
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped pepitas -- toasted
                        = (green pumpkin seeds)
  1 1/2         pounds  peeled and deveined shrimp -- uncooked
                        = (large or 16 to 20 per lb size)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil -- divided
  1              large  ripe plantain -- peeled, and cut
                        crosswise into 12 pieces - (3 per skewer)
  4                     skewers

In spice grinder or clean coffee grinder, grind chile until finely powdered.  Add cocoa, cumin, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and cinnamon; grind until well combined.  Add toasted almonds and pepitas; grind until powdered, making sure paste doesn't form.

In large bowl, toss shrimp with 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Stir in spice mixture; toss to coat.  Cover and let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.

In small bowl, combine remaining 2 teaspoons oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Add plantain; toss to coat.

Heat grill.  Alternately thread shrimp and plantains horizontally onto 4 (10- to 12-inch) metal skewers.  Place on gas grill over medium heat or on charcoal grill 4 to 6 inches from medium coals.  Cook 5 to 6 minutes or until shrimp turn pink, turning once.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving:  340 calories,  14g total fat (2.5 g saturated fat),  29 g protein,  27 g carbohydrate,  240 mg cholesterol,  720 mg sodium,  3 g fiber.

Serving Ideas: Fresh tomato salsa

Comments:  This rub is an adaptation of mole, a Mexican sauce made with chiles and unsweetened chocolate.  If you can't find New Mexican red chiles, substitute 1 1/2 tablespoons chile powder and omit the ground cumin.

To toast almonds and pepitas, place on baking sheet; bake at 350 degrees for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.

Plantains are a type of cooking banana.  Skin color, not firmness, is an indicator of ripeness.  Look for fruit that is yellow with some blackish-brown spots.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     chicken drumsticks and thighs -- (abt 3 lbs total)
     1/2           cup  Dijon-style mustard
  3        tablespoons  vinegar
  4          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  snipped fresh thyme
                        = (or 1/8 tspn dried thyme, crushed)
  2        tablespoons  molasses
                        Grilled pesto tomatoes -- (optional)
                        Grilled sourdough bread slices -- (optional)

Remove skin from chicken, if desired.  Place chicken in a 1-gallon sealable plastic bag in a shallow dish; set aside.

For marinade, stir together mustard, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and thyme until smooth.  Pour marinade over the chicken.  Seal the bag and turn to coat the chicken with marinade.  Chill for 4 to 24 hours, turning the bag occasionally.  Drain the chicken, reserving marinade.  Measure 1/3 cup marinade and set aside to use to make the sauce.  Reserve remaining marinade for grilling.

Prepare grill for indirect grilling.  Test for medium heat above drip pan.  Place chicken pieces, bone-side down, on the lightly oiled rack over pan.  Cover and grill for 50 to 60 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in center of thickest portions register 180 degrees, brushing occasionally with marinade.  (Do not brush during the last 5 minutes of grilling.)

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the 1/3 cup reserved marinade and the molasses.  Heat to boiling; reduce heat.  Simmer, covered, for 5 minutes.  Pass sauce with chicken.  Serve with grilled pesto tomatoes and grilled sourdough bread slices, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Experiment with different flavored mustards -- such as whole grain, spicy, or white-wine mustard -- to add an exotic spin to this simple grilling glaze.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Canning                         Grilling
                Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  chopped red sweet peppers
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  4             pounds  fresh peaches
                        = (or 3 [16-oz] packages frozen
                        unsweetened peach slices, thawed)
  1 1/2           cups  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1                can  peach or apricot nectar - (5 1/2 oz)
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  grated fresh ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

In a large skillet cook sweet pepper, onion, crushed red pepper, and garlic in hot oil just until tender.  Remove from heat.

Wash fresh peaches, if using.  Peel and pit peaches.  Place half of the fresh or frozen peaches in a food processor bowl or blender container.  Cover and process or blend until peaches are very finely chopped.  Transfer chopped peaches to a 6-quart Dutch oven or kettle.  Repeat with remaining peaches (you should have 7 cups finely chopped peaches).

Process or blend the pepper mixture until finely chopped.  Transfer to the Dutch oven with peaches.  Add brown sugar, nectar, vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, ginger, and salt.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat.  Simmer, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes or until desired consistency, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat.

Immediately ladle hot sauce into hot, sterilized half-pint canning jars, leaving 1/4 inch headspace.  Wipe jar rims and adjust lids.  Process the filled jars in a boiling-water canner for 15 minutes (start timing when water returns to boil).  Remove jars from canner; cool on racks.

This recipe yields 7 half-pints sauce (fifty-four, 2-tablespoon servings).

Nutritional facts per serving:  Calories: 63,  total fat: 0g,  saturated fat: 0g,  cholesterol: 0mg,  sodium: 31mg,  carbohydrate: 15g,  fiber: 2g,  protein: 1g,  vitamin A: 13%,  vitamin C: 20%,  calcium: 1%,  iron: 1%

Comments:  Brush this sweet pepper and fruit sauce over grilled or roasted meats or brush on beef, pork, or chicken during the last 5 minutes of grilling.

To Present This As a Gift:  You will need a ruler; scissors to cut metal; brass crafting metal; paper punch; silver eyelets and eyelet tool (available in the sewing notion department of crafts, discount, and fabric stores); and 18-inch length of 1/4-inch-wide ribbon.

Measure the height and circumference of the jar lid.  Cut a strip of brass this size.  Use a paper punch to make a hole in the center of the strip every inch.  Use an eyelet tool to secure an eyelet in each punched hole.  Thread the ribbon through the eyelets.  Tie the ends into a bow, securing brass ring around lid.  Include preparation directions (see comments) with gift.

For the tag, cut a small tag from brass.  Add a hole and eyelet at the top.  Thread onto the ribbon before tying into a bow.

Also Try This:  Use colored leather cording or shoelaces instead of ribbon.

           Peanut-Ginger Chicken With Fruit And Cucumber Salsa

Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  creamy peanut butter
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  bottled chili sauce
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  vinegar
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground red pepper - (to 1/2)
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (1 1/4 lbs total)
                        === FRUIT AND CUCUMBER SALSA ===
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh fruit
                        =(such as nectarines, peaches,
                        pears, and/or plums)
     1/2           cup  chopped seeded cucumber
  1                     green onion -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  vinegar

Stir together peanut butter, garlic, water, chili sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, and red pepper in a medium mixing bowl.  Mix thoroughly.  (The mixture will feel stiff at first.)

Place chicken breast halves in a 1-gallon sealable plastic bag set in a shallow bowl; pour marinade over chicken.  Seal bag; turn to coat chicken with marinade.  Chill for 12 to 24 hours, turning occasionally.

Place chicken breast halves on the lightly oiled rack of the grill directly over medium-high heat.  Grill for 12 to 15 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in centers registers 170 degrees and juices run clear, turning occasionally.

To serve, spoon half of the Fruit and Cucumber Salsa onto individual plates.  Place chicken breast halves on salsa; top with remaining salsa.

Fruit and Cucumber Salsa:  In a medium mixing bowl combine all ingredients.  Cover and chill for 1 to 2 hours.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Fresh ginger should be firm with a paper-thin skin.  The strong flavor fades with exposure to air, so peel and grate just before using.  You can ratchet up the kick to this recipe by adding 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper to the marinade.

Comments:  Fresh ginger should be firm with a paper-thin skin.  The strong flavor fades with exposure to air, so peel and grate just before using.  You can ratchet up the kick to this recipe by adding 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper to the marinade.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             slices  cored fresh pineapple, 3/4" thk -- quartered
     1/4           cup  packed brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
                        = (or seasoned rice vinegar)
  2        tablespoons  rum
  4          teaspoons  lime juice
  6                     wonton wrappers -- halved diagonally
  1         tablespoon  butter -- melted
                        = (no substitute for butter)
  3        tablespoons  shredded coconut
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar

Place pineapple in a single layer in a shallow dish.  In a small bowl stir together the brown sugar, vinegar, rum, and lime juice until sugar dissolves.  Pour brown sugar mixture over the pineapple; set aside.

Place a sheet of waxed paper on a cookie sheet.  Lay wonton wrappers on waxed paper.  Brush both sides with melted butter.  Place coconut in a disposable foil pie pan or on a double thickness of heavy foil.

Drain pineapple, reserving brown sugar mixture.  For a charcoal grill, grill pineapple on the rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium coals for 6 to 8 minutes or until heated through, tuning once and brushing occasionally with some of the brown sugar mixture.  Transfer pineapple to dessert bowls.

Add wonton wrappers to grill.  Grill for 2 to 4 minutes or until browned, turning once halfway through grilling.  Transfer grilled wontons to cookie sheet; immediately sprinkle with granulated sugar.  Add coconut in pie pan to grill.  Grill about 2 minutes or until coconut is lightly toasted, using tongs to shake pan back and forth.  Remove coconut from grill.  (For a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium.  Place pineapple, then wonton wrappers and coconut in pie pan on grill rack over heat.  Cover and grill as above.)

To serve, drizzle remaining brown sugar mixture over pineapple and sprinkle with coconut.  Serve with sugared wontons.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                   Piquant Grilled Broccoli And Olives

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  broccoli flowerets
     1/2           cup  pitted ripe olives
     1/2                two-ounce can anchovy fillets -- (optional), drained,
                        and finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  snipped fresh oregano
                        = (or use Italian flat-leaf parsley)
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  5                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  1               dash  salt

In a large saucepan bring a small amount of water to boiling; add broccoli.  Simmer, covered, for 2 minutes; drain.  In a medium bowl combine broccoli and olives.  For marinade, in a small bowl whisk together anchovies (if desired), oregano, vinegar, oil, garlic, red pepper, and salt.  Pour over broccoli and olives; toss to coat.  Marinate at room temperature for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, lightly grease the rack of an indoor electric grill or lightly coat with cooking spray.  Preheat grill.  Drain broccoli and olives, discarding marinade.  On 6-inch skewers, alternately thread broccoli and olives, leaving 1/4 inch between pieces.

Place kabobs on the grill rack.  If using a covered grill, close lid.  Grill until broccoli is light brown and tender.  (For a covered grill, allow 3 to 4 minutes, giving kabobs a quarter turn once halfway through grilling.  For an uncovered grill, allow 6 to 8 minutes, turning occasionally to cook evenly.)  Remove broccoli and olives from skewers.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Broccoli on the grill?  You bet!  This intensely flavored side dish makes a great partner for any grilled or broiled meat or poultry -- or, toss it with hot cooked pasta for a vegetarian entree.

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        medium  eggplant -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" cubes - (abt 3 cups)
  1             medium  zucchini -- halved lengthwise,
                        and sliced 1" thick
     1/2           cup  green and/or yellow
                        sweet pepper in 1" pieces
  1              small  onion -- cut into wedges
     1/4           cup  bottled French salad dressing
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
  3        tablespoons  fine dry bread crumbs
  8                     cherry tomatoes

Preheat grill.  On eight 6-inch skewers, alternately thread eggplant, zucchini, sweet pepper, and onion, leaving 1/4 inch between pieces.  Brush with salad dressing.  Combine the Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs; place on a piece of waxed paper.  Roll the kabobs in the crumb mixture to coat evenly.

Place kabobs on the grill rack.  If using a covered grill, close lid.  Grill until zucchini is crisp-tender.  (For a covered grill, allow 4 to 5 minutes, giving kabobs a quarter turn once halfway through and placing tomatoes on ends of skewers the last 1 minute of grilling.  For an uncovered grill, allow 8 to 10 minutes, turning occasionally to cook evenly and placing tomatoes on ends of skewers the last 2 minutes of grilling.)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  chopped green onion
                        = (or finely chopped white onion)
  2        tablespoons  fine dry bread crumbs
  2                     red serrano peppers -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  3                     canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pound  lean ground beef
  4                     whole wheat hamburger buns -- split
                        = (or eight 1"-thk slices of bread)
                        === OPTIONAL CONDIMENTS ===
                        Roasted red pepper catsup, roasted garlic
                        catsup, or other purchased flavored catsup
  4                     tomato slices
                        Sliced red onion
                        Red serrano peppers

Combine green onion or white onion, bread crumbs, serrano peppers, chipotle peppers, and salt in a large mixing bowl.  Add beef; mix well.  Shape meat mixture into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.

For a charcoal grill, place patties on the grill rack directly over medium coals.  Grill, uncovered, for 14 to 18 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the side of a patty registers 160 degrees, turning once.

For a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium.  Place patties on the grill rack; cover and grill as above.

Grill or toast buns or bread.  Serve burgers on grilled or toasted buns or bread topped, if desired, with flavored catsup, tomato slices, red onion slices, and serrano peppers.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  fresh large shrimp in shells - (abt 10)
  5             slices  turkey bacon -- halved crosswise
     3/4           cup  red, yellow, and/or green
                        sweet pepper in 1" pieces
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-shredded orange peel
                        = (or blood orange peel)
  1         tablespoon  orange juice
                        = (or blood orange juice)
  1           teaspoon  snipped fresh rosemary
  1 1/2           cups  hot cooked rice
     3/4           cup  cooked or canned black beans -- rinsed, drained

Peel and devein shrimp, leaving tails intact.  Rinse shrimp; pat dry with paper towels.  Wrap each shrimp in a half slice of bacon.  On 6-inch skewers, alternately thread shrimp and sweet pepper pieces.  In a small bowl combine 1/2 teaspoon of the orange peel, the orange juice, and rosemary.  Brush over kabobs.

Meanwhile, lightly grease the rack of a grill or lightly coat with cooking spray.  Preheat grill.  Place kabobs on the grill rack.  If using a covered grill, close lid.  Grill until shrimp turn opaque and bacon is crisp.  (For a covered grill, allow 2 1/2 to 4 minutes.  For an uncovered grill, allow 6 to 8 minutes, turning occasionally to cook evenly.)

In a medium saucepan stir together the cooked rice, beans, and remaining orange peel; heat through.  Serve the shrimp and pepper skewers with rice mixture.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Bacon-wrapped shrimp sounds decadent, but it can be everyday fare if you use light turkey bacon.  The subtle smokiness from the bacon combines with a pleasing sweetness from brushed-on herbed orange juice.

                  Saffron Pilaf With Grilled Vegetables

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  jasmine, basmati, or
                        wild-pecan long-grain rice
  1                can  vegetable broth - (14 1/2 oz)
     1/4           cup  water
     1/8      teaspoon  saffron threads
                        = (or dash ground saffron)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  bottled minced garlic
  1                     red sweet pepper -- seeded, quartered
  1              large  zucchini -- halved lengthwise
  1                     eggplant -- sliced 1/2" thick
  1              ounce  herbed semi-soft goat cheese (chevre) -- crumbled
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped hazelnuts or pecans -- toasted

In a large saucepan combine rice, vegetable broth, water, and saffron.  Heat to boiling; reduce heat.  Simmer, covered, about 15 minutes or until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed; keep warm.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine oil and garlic; brush over sweet pepper, zucchini, and eggplant.  Grill vegetables on the lightly greased rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium heat about 10 minutes or until tender, turning once.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Transfer vegetables to cutting board; cool slightly.  Cut vegetables into bite-size pieces; stir into cooked rice.  Top with goat cheese and nuts.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Nutritional facts per serving:  Calories: 333,  total fat: 12g,  saturated fat: 2g,  cholesterol: 7mg,  sodium: 443mg,  carbohydrate: 48g,  fiber: 5g,  protein: 9g,  vitamin A: 5%,  vitamin C: 40%,  calcium: 4%,  iron: 20%.

Serving suggestion:  Start an outdoor feast featuring this Spanish-style pilaf with tapas-style appetizers including olives, grilled vegetables, and cubes of piquant cheese.

Comments:  Similar to paella -- Spain's national dish -- this sunny-colored saffron rice dish is bursting with flavor, but from a rainbow of grilled vegetables instead of the standard shrimp and meat.  Serve it with a hearty red wine.  You may substitute 1/4 teaspoon turmeric for the saffron.

Serving suggestion:  Start an outdoor feast featuring this Spanish-style pilaf with tapas-style appetizers including olives, grilled vegetables, and cubes of piquant cheese.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Similar to paella -- Spain&apos;s national dish -- this sunny-colored saffron rice dish is bursting with flavor, but from a rainbow of grilled vegetables instead of the standard shrimp and meat.  Serve it with a hearty red wine.  You may substitute 1/4 teaspoon turmeric for the saffron.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped fresh pineapple
     1/2           cup  chopped red sweet pepper
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped red onion
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  snipped fresh cilantro or chives
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1              small  fresh jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  1              pound  fresh skinless salmon fillet, 1" thick
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin

For salsa, in a medium bowl combine pineapple, sweet pepper, onion, 2 tablespoons of the lime juice, the cilantro, honey, and jalapeno pepper.  Cover and refrigerate up to 2 hours.

Lightly grease the rack of a grill or lightly coat with cooking spray.  Preheat grill.  Rinse fish; pat dry with paper towels.  Cut into 4 serving-size pieces.  Brush both sides of fish with the remaining lime juice and sprinkle with cumin.

Place fish on the grill rack, tucking under any thin edges.  If using a covered grill, close lid.  Grill until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.  (For a covered grill, allow 4 to 6 minutes.  For an uncovered grill, allow 8 to 12 minutes, gently turning once halfway through grilling.)  Serve the fish with salsa.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  You don't need to have a party to enjoy the sweet-hot fruit salsa that's as pretty as a sprinkling of confetti on top of this grilled salmon.  Serve it with hot cooked rice any night of the week.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh sea scallops
                        = (and/or peeled deveined large shrimp)
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
  2        tablespoons  stone-ground mustard
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1 1/2      teaspoons  soy sauce

Rinse scallops; pat dry with paper towels.  Halve large scallops (you should have about 20 pieces).  Place scallops in a plastic bag set in a shallow dish.

For marinade, in a small bowl combine oil, sherry, mustard, honey, and soy sauce.  Pour over scallops; seal bag.  Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, turning bag occasionally.

Lightly grease the rack of a grill or lightly coat with cooking spray.  Preheat grill.  Drain scallops, discarding marinade.  On 6-inch skewers, thread scallops.  (If using both scallops and shrimp, thread a scallop in the "curl" of each shrimp.)

Place kabobs on the grill rack.  If using a covered grill, close lid.  Grill until scallops are opaque (and shrimp turn pink).  (For a covered grill, allow 2 1/2 to 4 minutes.  For an uncovered grill, allow 6 to 8 minutes, turning occasionally to cook evenly.)

Comments:  A little bit sweet, a little bit tangy, these seafood brochettes -- soaked in a simple marinade of sherry, mustard, honey, and soy sauce -- can be made with scallops, shrimp, or a combination of both.

                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  Belgian white beer
                        = (or pilsner beer)
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2         pounds  peeled and deveined shrimp -- uncooked
                        = (large or 16 to 20 per lb size)
  4                     skewers

In large bowl, whisk together all ingredients except shrimp.  Stir in shrimp to coat.  Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.

Heat grill.  Thread shrimp onto 4 (10- to 12-inch) metal skewers.  Place on gas grill over medium heat or on charcoal grill 4 to 6 inches from medium coals.  Cook 5 minutes or until shrimp turn pink, brushing occasionally with marinade and turning once.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving:  105 calories,  1 g total fat (.5 g saturated fat),  17.5 g protein,  2 g carbohydrate,  160 mg cholesterol,  275 mg sodium,  0.5 g fiber.

Serving Ideas:  Salty French fries and malt vinegar.

Comments:  Belgian white beer is lightly scented with orange rind and spices, a good match for the shrimp.  But you can substitute any beer.  Marinating overnight infuses the flavors more deeply.  This dish is easily doubled or tripled.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR CREOLE MUSTARD SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  5                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  Creole or other spicy mustard
  2 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  hot red-pepper sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR SKEWERS ===
  2                     red bell peppers -- cut 1" chunks
  2                     green bell peppers -- cut 1" chunks
  2                     red onions -- cut 1" chunks
  1              pound  andouille sausage -- cut 1/2" rounds
  1              pound  large shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        with tails left on

To prepare mustard sauce:  Melt butter over low heat.  Add garlic; cook 1 minute.  Whisk in mustard, lemon juice, Worcestershire and red-pepper sauce.  Add salt and pepper to taste; set aside.  (Store up to 1 week in refrigerator or 2 months in freezer.)

To prepare skewers:  Soak 24 6-inch bamboo skewers in water 30 minutes.  Heat grill or broiler to high.

Thread skewers alternately with pieces of bell peppers, onions, sausage and shrimp.  (For best results, skewer the shrimp lengthwise and the sausage crosswise through the casing.)  Brush each skewer generously with mustard sauce.  Grill until shrimp is pink and sausage is lightly browned, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side.  Serve with remaining mustard sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                Smoking

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     apple or cherry wood chunks - (to 10)
  2        tablespoons  snipped fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley -- (to 3)
  2          teaspoons  finely-shredded lemon peel
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1              whole  roasting chicken - (6 to 7 lbs)
  1                     garlic bulb
  1              small  lemon -- cut into wedges
                        Fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley sprigs

At least 1 hour before smoke cooking, soak wood chunks in enough water to cover.  Drain before using.

For rub, in a small bowl combine the snipped parsley, the lemon peel, and pepper.  Remove the neck and giblets from chicken.  Sprinkle rub evenly over chicken; rub in with your fingers.

With a sharp knife, cut off the top 1/2-inch of garlic bulb to expose the ends of the individual cloves.  Leaving garlic bulb whole, remove any loose, papery outer layers.  Place the garlic bulb and lemon wedges in cavity of chicken.  Skewer the neck skin to the back.  Twist wing tips under back.  Tie legs to tail with 100-percent-cotton string.  Insert a meat thermometer into the center of an inside thigh muscle without touching bone.

In a smoker, arrange preheated coals, half of the drained wood chunks, and the water pan according to the manufacturer's directions.  Pour water into pan.  Place chicken, breast-side up, on the grill rack over water pan.  Cover and smoke for 3 1/4 to 4 hours or until meat thermometer registers 180 degrees.  Add more coals, wood chunks, and water as needed.  Remove chicken from smoker.  Cover chicken with foil; let stand for 15 minutes before carving.

Remove garlic and lemon wedges from chicken cavity.  If desired, season chicken with salt.  Garnish with parsley sprigs and additional lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Gremolata -- the garnish of garlic, lemon, and parsley that's traditionally sprinkled over the Italian dish called osso buco (braised veal shanks) -- gives this smoked bird great flavor.

  2              large  garlic bulbs
                        = (not elephant garlic)
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  fresh orange juice
  2        tablespoons  minced orange zest
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  achiote paste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2             pounds  large shrimp - (24 per lb) -- peeled, deveined
  18             small  flour tortillas - (5" dia)
                        === OPTIONAL CONDIMENT ===
  2               cups  salsa verde
                        = (or avocado tomatillo salsa)
                        === SMOKING CHIP OPTION ===
                        Mesquite chips

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees.

Remove the loose, papery outside peels of the garlic bulbs.  With a sharp knife, cut off the top one quarter of the garlic heads, exposing the cloves inside the peels.  Partially enclose each garlic bulb in a packet of heavy duty foil.  Drizzle the garlic evenly with the sherry and olive oil.  Seal the packets tightly, set them on the oven rack, and bake until the garlic is fragrant and tender enough to pierce easily with a paring knife, about 1 hour.  Cool, then squeeze or scoop the softened garlic out of the peels.

In a food processor, combine the garlic puree, wine, orange juice, zest, sugar, achiote paste, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and the red pepper.  Process, stopping once or twice to scrape down the sides of the work bowl, until the mixture is fairly smooth.

In a shallow nonreactive bowl, combine the garlic mixture and the shrimp.  Cover and let stand at room temperature, stirring once or twice, for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, light a direct heat charcoal fire and let it burn down to medium-hot (5 seconds to "ouch") or preheat a gas grill to medium-high.  Position the grill rack about 6 inches above the heat source.

Lift the shrimp from the marinade (reserve it) and divide them among 4 or 5 flat metal skewers.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

When the grill is ready, lightly oil the rack.  Lay the skewers on the rack, cover, and grill, basting once or twice with the marinade and turning once, until the shrimp are lightly marked by the grill and just cooked through while remaining moist, 6 to 8 minutes total.

Meanwhile, wrap the tortillas in 2 or 3 foil packets.  Place in the oven until warm and supple, about 10 minutes.

Remove the shrimp from the grill and transfer to a cutting board.  Coarsely chop the shrimp, then season them with salt and pepper.  Transfer the shrimp to a communal dish or divide among individual plates.  Serve immediately, accompanied by the tortillas and the salsa.  Encourage guests to tear off pieces of tortillas and wrap portions of shrimp and salsa into them, to make informal soft tacos.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Ideas:  Orzo, Black Bean, Cherry Tomato Salad; Sweet and Smoky Corn Relish.

Comments:  Like most of the world's great pick up meals, these messy tacos are compelling food: Start and you won't want to stop.  Those really getting into the back to basics mode may wish to omit the salsa, feeling that the combined flavors of smoky, orange scented shrimp and corn tortillas are sufficient.  Lots of napkins are also a good idea, as is plenty of beer.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             slices  whole-wheat bread -- torn
  3        tablespoons  fresh cilantro
  2                     garlic cloves
  1                can  black beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  1                can  chipotle peppers in adobo sauce - (7 oz)
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1                     egg
     1/2        medium  avocado -- seeded, peeled
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  1              small  plum tomato -- chopped

Place torn bread in a food processor bowl or blender container.  Cover and process or blend until bread resembles coarse crumbs; transfer to a large bowl and set aside.

Place cilantro and garlic in the food processor bowl or blender container; cover and process or blend until finely chopped.  Add beans, 1 of the chipotle peppers, 1 to 2 teaspoons of the adobo sauce (reserve remaining peppers and sauce for another use), and cumin; process or blend using on/off pulses until beans are coarsely chopped and mixture begins to pull away from side.

Add mixture to bread crumbs in bowl.  Add egg; mix well and shape into four 1/2-inch-thick patties.

Grill patties on the lightly greased rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes or until patties are heated through, turning once.

Meanwhile, for guacamole, in small bowl mash avocado.  Stir in lime juice; season with salt and pepper.  Serve patties with guacamole and tomato.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Nutritional facts per serving:  Calories: 178,  total fat: 7g,  saturated fat: 1g,  monounsaturated fat: g,  polyunsaturated fat: g,  cholesterol: 53mg,  sodium: 487mg,  carbohydrate: 25g,  total sugar: g,  fiber: 9g,  protein: 11g,  vitamin A: 9%,  vitamin C: 12%,  calcium: 7%,  iron: 16%.

Serving suggestion:  For burger baskets, place the bean cakes on a bed of purchased baked tortilla chips in a lined basket or bowl and garnish with orange wedges.

Comments:  These spicy bean cakes are finger foods that are filling enough to make a meal.  They're flavored with a chipotle -- a dried, smoked jalapeÒo pepper -- that comes in adobo sauce, a Mexican melange of ground chili peppers, herbs, and vinegar.

                       Spicy Chicken And Star Fruit

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
                        = (or red wine vinegar)
  4          teaspoons  olive oil
     3/4      teaspoon  dried rosemary -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  ground red pepper
  3                     star fruit (carambola) -- sliced
  12                    green onions -- cut 2" pieces
                        = (and/or 4 small purple boiling onions
                        cut into wedges)
  6             medium  boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  3               cups  hot cooked rice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-shredded orange peel -- (optional)
  3        tablespoons  peach or apricot preserves -- (optional), melted

For basting sauce, in a small bowl combine vinegar, olive oil, rosemary, cumin, coriander, black pepper, and red pepper.  On twelve 6-inch skewers, alternately thread star fruit and onions.

Lightly grease the rack of a grill or lightly coat with cooking spray.  Preheat grill.  Place chicken on the grill rack.  If using a covered grill, close lid.  Grill until chicken is tender and no longer pink.  (For a covered grill, allow 4 to 6 minutes, brushing once with basting sauce the last 1 minute of grilling.  For an uncovered grill, allow 12 to 15 minutes, turning and brushing once with basting sauce halfway through grilling.)  Remove from grill; cover and keep warm.

Add kabobs to the grill rack.  If using a covered grill, close lid.  Grill until kabobs are heated through.  (For a covered grill, allow about 3 minutes.  For an uncovered grill, allow about 5 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling.)  Brush kabobs with basting sauce.

To serve, if desired, toss rice with orange peel.  Serve chicken and kabobs over rice.  If desired, drizzle with preserves.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Nutritional facts per serving:  Calories: 313,  total fat: 5g,  saturated fat: 1g,  cholesterol: 66mg,  sodium: 69mg,  carbohydrate: 35g,  fiber: 2g,  protein: 29g,  vitamin A: 4%,  vitamin C: 27%,  calcium: 5%,  iron: 16%.

Comments:  It's a match made in heaven.  The celestial star fruit (also called carambola) is a striking addition to this chicken dish that's a little bit Italian and a little bit Indian.

For basting sauce, in a small bowl combine vinegar, olive oil, rosemary, cumin, coriander, black pepper, and red pepper.  On twelve 6-inch skewers, alternately thread star fruit and onions.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly grease the rack of a grill or lightly coat with cooking spray.  Preheat grill.  Place chicken on the grill rack.  If using a covered grill, close lid.  Grill until chicken is tender and no longer pink.  (For a covered grill, allow 4 to 6 minutes, brushing once with basting sauce the last 1 minute of grilling.  For an uncovered grill, allow 12 to 15 minutes, turning and brushing once with basting sauce halfway through grilling.)  Remove from grill; cover and keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add kabobs to the grill rack.  If using a covered grill, close lid.  Grill until kabobs are heated through.  (For a covered grill, allow about 3 minutes.  For an uncovered grill, allow about 5 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling.)  Brush kabobs with basting sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, if desired, toss rice with orange peel.  Serve chicken and kabobs over rice.  If desired, drizzle with preserves.

Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  bacon
  1                     beef flank steak - (1 to 1 1/4 lbs)
                        = (or top round steak)
     3/4      teaspoon  lemon-pepper seasoning
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed, and
                        well drained
  2        tablespoons  fine dry bread crumbs
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme -- crushed

In a large skillet cook bacon over medium heat just until brown, but not crisp.  Drain on paper towels.  Set aside.

Trim fat from steak.  Score steak by making shallow diagonal cuts at 1-inch intervals in a diamond pattern.  Repeat on other side.  Cut steak in half lengthwise.  Place a portion of steak between 2 pieces of plastic wrap.  Working from the center to the edges, pound lightly with the flat side of a meat mallet into a 10- by 6-inch rectangle.  Remove plastic wrap.  Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of the lemon-pepper seasoning and 1/8 teaspoon of the salt.  Arrange 4 bacon slices lengthwise on steak.  Repeat with the remaining portion of steak.

Preheat grill.  For filling, in a medium bowl combine spinach, bread crumbs, thyme, and the remaining lemon-pepper seasoning.  Spread half of the filling over each portion of steak.  Starting from a short side, roll up each portion into a spiral.  Secure with wooden toothpicks at 1-inch intervals, starting 1/2 inch from one end.  Cutting between the toothpicks, slice each portion into six 1-inch pinwheels.  On each of six 6-inch skewers, thread 2 pinwheels.  Remove toothpicks.

Place pinwheels on the grill rack.  If using a covered grill, close lid.  Grill until steak is desired doneness.  (For a covered grill, allow 6 to 7 minutes for medium (160 degrees).  For an uncovered grill, allow 12 to 14 minutes for medium (160 degrees), turning once halfway through grilling.)  To serve, remove pinwheels from skewers.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Popeye would serve these beef pinwheels with pride.  Overstuffed with spinach and smoky bacon, they are handsome to look and especially tasty to eat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  soft bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1               dash  ground ginger
  1 1/2         pounds  lean ground beef
  6                     hamburger buns -- split, toasted
                        === OPTIONAL CONDIMENTS ===
                        Sliced cucumbers
                        Lettuce leaves

Stir together the soft bread crumbs, onion, water, sugar, soy sauce, garlic, and ground ginger in a large mixing bowl.  Add the ground beef and mix well.  Shape the meat mixture into six 3/4-inch-thick patties.

For a charcoal grill, place patties on the grill rack directly over medium coals.  Grill, uncovered, for 15 to 18 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the side of a patty registers 160 degrees, turning once.

For a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium.  Place patties on the grill rack; cover and grill as above.

Serve burgers in buns topped, if desired, with sliced cucumbers and lettuce.

Comments:  You'll love these hearty burgers with Oriental-flavor.  To test for medium heat, you should be able to hold your hand over the heat at the height of the food for 4 seconds before having to pull away.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (abt 1 lb total)
     1/2           cup  rice wine

           Tomato Ravioli With Grilled Portobellos And Spinach

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  4              large  fresh portobello mushrooms - (to 5) -- stems removed
                        = (abt 1 lb total)
  1            package  refrigerated cheese-filled
                        sun-dried-tomato-flavored ravioli - (9 oz)
  4               cups  torn spinach
  1         tablespoon  snipped fresh basil
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Grated Parmesan cheese -- (optional)

Combine 1 tablespoon of the oil and the garlic.  Lightly brush rounded side of mushrooms with garlic-oil mixture; sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.  Grill the mushrooms on the rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes or until slightly softened, turning once halfway through cooking.  Slice into bite-size pieces.

Meanwhile, cook the pasta in lightly salted water according to package directions, adding spinach to the water with pasta the last 1 minute of cooking; drain.

Place pasta and spinach in a large bowl; add the mushrooms.  Toss with remaining oil, basil, the 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and the 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  If desired, serve with additional grated Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Nutritional facts per serving:  Calories: 336,  total fat: 18g,  saturated fat: 7g,  cholesterol: 61mg,  sodium: 500mg,  carbohydrate: 31g,  fiber: 3g,  protein: 16g.

Serving suggestion:  Warm up wedges of focaccia on the grill to nibble alongside this pretty pasta dish.

Comments:  Rosy-hued purchased sun-dried tomato ravioli are dotted with a green duo of spinach and sweet basil.  Slices of smoky, garlic-infused grilled portobello mushrooms are substantial enough you won't notice the absence of meat.

Bella Portobello: Meaty portobello mushrooms are the mature form of the cremino mushroom, a brown variation of the white button mushroom.  Portobellos are great for the grill -- simply brush them with olive oil and garlic.  The grilled result can be eaten like a steak, sliced and tossed with pasta, rolled in a tortilla with grilled red peppers, or slipped between slices of grilled focaccia or bread.

           Tortellini Kabobs With Roasted Tomato Dipping Sauce

Recipe By     :Andrea Chesman
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TORTELLINI ===
  12            ounces  fresh or frozen cheese tortellini
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === ROASTED TOMATO DIPPING SAUCE ===
  1                     tomato -- halved horizontally
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  2                     garlic cloves
  6                     basil leaves
     1/2           cup  lowfat sour cream
                        = (or nonfat sour cream)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare a medium-hot fire in the grill.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the tortellini.

Cook the tortellini according to the package directions.  Drain well.  Toss with the olive oil.

Brush the cut side of the tomato halves with a little olive oil.  Grill, cut-side down, until tender and grill-marked, about 10 minutes.

Peel the tomato.  On a cutting board, in a mortar and pestle, or in a food processor, chop the tomato, garlic, and basil until you have a fine paste.  Stir into the sour cream.  Add salt and pepper, to taste.

Thread the tortellini onto skewers.  They will stay on the skewers best if they are threaded through the filled part of the tortellini.  Grill, turning once, until lightly charred, about 2 minutes per side.

Serve the kabobs at once, passing the dipping sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Variation:  Mini Ravioli Kabobs.  You can often find fresh or frozen mini ravioli in the same supermarket case as the tortellini.  Cook according to the package directions.  Weave onto the skewers, trying to pierce each ravioli twice as it is threaded on.  Grill and serve with the sauce as above.

Comments:  This is one of those "If you can boil water..." recipes -- it is a simple recipe that produces delicious and beautiful results.  The dipping sauce is optional but quick to make, and it does enhance the dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  dried sage
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  dried rosemary
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard (preferably Colman's)
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  granulated garlic or garlic powder
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2             pounds  tri-tip roast -- trimmed of fat

Combine all spices and rub mixture generously over meat.  Cover and let marinate overnight in refrigerator.  Let meat come to room temperature before grilling.

Prepare grill for indirect grilling, arranging coals evenly on either side of the grate and leaving a fire-free space in the middle.  (For gas grills, preheat grill with all burners on, then turn off burner that will be directly under the food while it's cooking.)  Sear meat for 2 to 3 minutes per side directly over the heat, then move meat to area with no fire or coals.  Place a drip pan under meat, cover grill and roast for 15 minutes.

Begin checking internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer.  Remove roast when temperature registers 125 to 130 degrees for medium-rare, and up or down by 10 degree increments depending on how you prefer your meat.  Let meat rest, loosely covered with foil, for 5 to 15 minutes before slicing thinly across the grain and serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                    Turkey (Or Chicken) Pepper Kabobs

Recipe By     :Traci Goodman, Paducah, KY

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  unsweetened pineapple chunks
     1/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  prepared mustard
  1              pound  turkey tenderloin -- cut 1" cubes
                        = (or chicken)
  1              large  sweet onion -- cut 3/4" pieces
  1              large  green pepper -- cut 1" pieces
  1              large  sweet red pepper -- cut 1" pieces

Drain pineapple, reserving 1/4 cup juice (discard remaining juice or save for another use).  In a bowl, combine the reserved pineapple juice, brown sugar, oil, Worcestershire sauce, garlic and mustard; mix well.  Pour 1/3 cup into a large resealable plastic bag; add the turkey.  Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.  Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade.

Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill.  Drain and discard marinade from turkey.  On eight metal or soaked wooden skewers, alternately thread vegetables, turkey and pineapple.  Grill, uncovered, over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes on each side or until meat is no longer pink, turning three times and basting frequently with reserved marinade.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Nutritional Analysis One serving (2 kabobs):  262 calories,  4 g fat (1 g saturated fat),  82 mg cholesterol,  110 mg sodium,  24 g carbohydrate,  3 g fiber,  31 g protein.  Diabetic Exchanges:  4 very lean meat,  2 vegetable,  1 fruit.

Comments:  This is a summertime favorite at our house.  While the turkey is a nice change of pace and goes great with the sweet basting sauce and pineapple, the recipe also works well with chunks of chicken.

Categories    : Grilling                        Sandwiches
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  milk
     1/2           cup  finely-shredded carrot
     1/4           cup  finely-sliced green onion
     1/4           cup  soft whole-wheat bread crumbs
     1/4      teaspoon  dried Italian seasoning -- crushed
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4         pound  lean ground turkey or chicken
     1/4           cup  Dijon-style mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder
  4                     whole-wheat hamburger buns -- toasted
                        === OPTIONAL CONDIMENTS ===
                        Lettuce leaves
                        Shredded zucchini
                        Sliced tomato
                        Curry mustard

Stir together milk, carrot, green onion, bread crumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic salt, and pepper in a medium mixing bowl.  Add ground turkey; mix well.  Shape the mixture into four 1/2-inch-thick patties.  Lightly grease the grill rack.

For a charcoal grill, place patties on the greased grill rack directly over medium-hot coals.  Grill, uncovered, about 12 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the side of a patty registers 165 degrees, turning once.

For a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium-hot.  Place patties on grill rack; cover and grill patties as directed above.

Meanwhile, stir together mustard and curry powder.

Serve patties on buns topped, if desired, with lettuce leaves, shredded zucchini, sliced tomato, and curry mustard mixture.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt or seasoned salt
  4                     hamburger buns -- split, toasted
                        === OPTIONAL CONDIMENTS ===
                        Sliced sweet onion
                        Cooked bacon slices
                        Dill pickle
                        Sliced tomatoes
                        Shredded lettuce
                        Colby and Monterey Jack cheese slices
                        Mayonnaise
                        Catsup
                        Mustard

Combine pork, wild rice, pepper, and salt in a mixing bowl.  Mix well.  Shape into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.

For a charcoal grill, place patties on the grill rack directly over medium coals.  Grill, uncovered, for 14 to 18 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into side of a patty registers 160 degrees, turning once.

For a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium.  Place patties on the grill rack; cover and grill as above.

Serve on buns topped with your choice of condiments.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                         Yogurt-Marinated Chicken

Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  fat-free yogurt
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     3/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
                        = (or 1 tbspn minced fresh gingerroot)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  6                     skinless bone-in chicken breast halves -- (6 oz ea)

In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first nine ingredients; add the chicken.  Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.

Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill for indirect heat.  Drain and discard marinade.  Grill chicken, covered, bone-side down over indirect medium heat for 20 minutes.  Turn; grill 20 to 30 minutes longer or until juices run clear.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This tender marinated chicken gets its zing from chili powder and cumin.  For variety, Naheed sometimes adds a tablespoon of tomato paste to the marinade or replaces the chili powder with chopped green chilies.  It's a sure fire hit at summer cookouts.
