Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  Australian fish - (1 1/2 to 2 lbs) -- scaled, gutted,
                        such as Barramundi, Murry Cod or skate
  2             medium  rock lobsters -- split in half
  2             pounds  medium prawns -- peeled, deveined,
                        head and tail left intact
  2             medium  King crabs
                        Olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              dozen  Rock or Sydney Rock oysters
  2        tablespoons  tamarind paste
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1              small  jalapeÒo -- seeded, chopped
  3        tablespoons  dark cane syrup
  3        tablespoons  dark molasses
  2        tablespoons  ketchup
  2        tablespoons  water
  4              whole  lemons -- split in half
                        Chopped parsley -- for garnish

Preheat the grill.  Using a small sharp knife, make several slashes on both sides of the whole fish.  Season the whole fish, lobsters, prawns, and crabs with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Place the whole fish and crab on the grill.

In a small food processor, combine the tamarind, garlic, jalapeÒo, cane syrup, molasses, ketchup and water.  Season with salt and pepper.  Process until smooth.  Brush the seafood with the tamarind mixture, several times while grilling.  The grilling time will vary according to size.

The whole fish and crabs should go on first, they usually take about 6 to 8 minutes, depending on weight.  The lobsters with take about 6 to 7 minutes.  The prawns and oysters about 4 to 6 minutes, again depending on size.  The lobster and crab shell will turn bright reddish pink and the prawns will turn pink and their tails will turn in.

Place all of the fish on a large platter.  Squeeze the lemons over the seafood and garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields about 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3             ounces  ground andouille sausage
     1/2           cup  chopped yellow onions

     1/2           cup  chopped peeled seeded fresh tomatoes
  2               cups  cubed potatoes -- blanched until
                        fork tender
  1                     cup veal reduction
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions
  4                     salmon fillets - (6 oz ea) -- skin removed
  1 1/4           cups  Sweet Barbecue Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  flour
  1                     onion -- cut thin rings
  2               cups  vegetable oil
  1                cup  Emerilís Homemade Worcestershire Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley

Preheat the fryer to 360 degrees.

Season the flour with salt and pepper.  Dredge the onions in the seasoned flour.  In a saucepan, heat the vegetable oil.

  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh lemon zest
     1/2         stick  butter -- cut 10 equal slices
                        Shaker of confectionersí sugar

In a nonreactive saucepan, over medium heat, combine the blueberries and corn syrup.  Bring to a boil and cook for a couple of minutes.  Remove from the heat and with a hand potato masher, mash the berries.  Keep warm.

In a small mixing bowl, sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the buttermilk, egg, and butter until fully incorporated.  Add the sifted ingredients to the milk mixture and whisk until slightly smooth, but still have some lumps.  Fold in the lemon zest and allow the batter to sit for a couple of minutes.

Lightly grease a griddle over medium heat.  Cooking in batches, pour 1/4 cup of the batter onto the hot griddle for each pancake.  Cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until the batter bubbles and is golden brown, flip over and continue to cook until golden brown.  Repeat the above process with the remaining batter.

Stack the pancakes on each serving plate.  Place a pat of butter between each layer.  Drizzle the pancakes with the syrup and garnish with the confectionersí sugar.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE BROWNIES ===
  1           teaspoon  solid vegetable shortening
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/3           cup  cocoa powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2                     eggs
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening -- melted
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips
                        === FOR THE PUDDING ===
  4               cups  heavy cream
  6        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        === TO ASSEMBLE ===
  1                cup  mini marshmallows
     1/2           cup  chopped pecan pieces
     1/2           cup  mini chocolate chips
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar
     1/4           cup  cocoa powder
  2        tablespoons  milk
     1/2           cup  caramel sauce
  2               cups  sweetened whipped cream
                        Shaker of powdered sugar
                        Fresh mint sprigs

For the Brownies:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 10-inch spring-form pan with the teaspoon of shortening.  In a mixing bowl, combine all of the ingredients, except for the chocolate chips.  Mix well.  Fold in the chocolate chips.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread the batter evenly over the pan.  Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool completely.

For the Pudding:  In a small bowl, combine 6 tablespoons of the cream and cornstarch together and mix to form a paste.  In a 2-quart, nonstick saucepan, over medium heat, bring the cream to a simmer.  Add the paste and remaining ingredients stirring constantly until the chocolate melts.  Continue to cook for 8 minutes, stirring often, until creamy and thick.

Remove from the heat and pour into a glass bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap down on the surface of the pudding to keep a skin from forming.  Let cool to room temperature.

To assemble:  Spread the pudding evenly over the brownie.  Sprinkle the marshmallows, pecans and mini chocolate chips over the pudding.

For the frosting:  In a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar, cocoa powder and milk, mix well.  Drizzle the chocolate frosting and caramel sauce over the top.  Cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.

Remove from the refrigerator and slice into individual servings and place on serving plates.  Garnish with a dollop of whipped cream, powdered sugar and fresh mint.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon of the oil.  Add the dough, turn once and cover with plastic wrap.  Place in a warm, draft free area and let rise for 2 hours, or until double in size.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Divide the dough in half, working with one half of the dough at a time, divide the dough into 6 pieces.  Form each piece into round balls.  Roll each ball into 4-inch rounds.  Place the rounds on parchment-lined baking sheets.  Lay 4 slices of the tomatoes over each round of dough.  Season with salt and crushed red pepper.  Lightly brush the tops of each round of dough with olive oil.  Allow the rounds to rest for 20 minutes.

Place in the oven and bake for 15 minutes.  Repeat the above process with the remaining dough.  Remove the pans from the oven and sprinkle each round with both of the cheeses.  Place back in the oven and bake until the cheese melts.  Remove from the oven and serve warm.

This recipe yields 12 rounds.

             Charcoal Grilled Sardines - {Sardinhas Assadas}

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  red bell pepper
  1              large  green bell pepper
                        Drizzle of Portuguese olive oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             pounds  Idaho potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into eighths
  1              pound  vine-ripe tomatoes -- cored, and
                        sliced 1/4" thick
  1             medium  yellow onion -- sliced 1/4" rings
  2              dozen  fresh medium sardines -- washed, patted dry
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish
  1             bottle  Vino Verde -- chilled

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Season the peppers with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Place on a baking sheet and roast until the skin blisters, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool completely.  Remove the skin and seeds.  Slice the peppers into strips, about 1/2-inch thick.

Place the potatoes into a saucepan, over medium heat and cover with water.  Season with salt.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 12 minutes.  Remove from the heat and drain.  Toss the potatoes with olive oil, salt and pepper.

Season the tomatoes with olive oil, salt and pepper, and set aside.  Season the onions with olive oil, salt and pepper, and set aside.

On a large platter, arrange the potatoes, peppers, tomatoes, and onions over half of the platter.

Preheat the grill.  Season the sardines with salt.  Let stand for 1 hour and then rinse off and pat dry.  (Salting the fish before cooking results in a firmer flesh.)

Season the sardines with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Place on the grill and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, depending on size.  Grill the sardines in batches, keeping the cooked sardines, warm.

Place the sardines on the platter.  Drizzle the sardines with olive oil.  Garnish with parsley.  Serve with a glass of the Vino Verde.

This recipe yields about 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  honey tangerine juice
  8                     fresh hearts of palm

     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced roasted red bell peppers
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced roasted yellow bell peppers
  2             medium  honey tangerines -- peeled, pith
                        removed and segmented
     1/4           cup  fresh tarragon leaves
  2               cups  chiffonade fresh spinach -- stems removed
                        Salt -- to taste

  4             pounds  stone crab claws -- cooked, shells
                        cracked and removed, meat chilled
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves

In a small nonreactive saucepan, combine the sugar, vinegar, and fruit juice, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by three-fourths, or the mixture has thickened like syrup.  Remove from the heat and pour the mixture into a small glass bowl.  Let cool completely.

Slice each heart of palm into thin strips.  In a mixing bowl, combine the hearts of palm, onions, peppers, tangerine segments, tarragon and spinach.  Season with salt and pepper.  Toss with enough olive oil to moisten the salad.  In another mixing bowl, toss the crab claws with olive oil, salt and pepper.

To serve, mound the hearts of palm salad in the center of each plate.  Lay a couple of the crab claws around the salad.  Drizzle the entire plate with the Gastrique.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  4               cups  half-and-half
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  6                     egg yolks
  4             ounces  milk chocolate -- finely chopped
  4             ounces  white chocolate -- finely chopped

Fill half of saucepan with water, place over medium heat and bring to a simmer.  Place the chocolate in a small stainless mixing bowl.  Place over the saucepan and melt until smooth, stirring occasionally.

In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the half-and-half and sugar.  Bring to a simmer.  In a small mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth.  Add 1 cup of the hot liquid to the egg yolks and whisk until smooth.  Add the yolk mixture to the saucepan of liquid and whisk until incorporated.  Bring the liquid back to simmer and continue to cook for 4 to 6 minutes or until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.

Remove from the heat and stir in the melted chocolate.  Whisk until smooth.  Pour the mixture into a glass bowl and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the mixture.  This will prevent a skin from forming while cooling.  Cool the mixture completely.

Stir in the chocolate pieces.  Process the mixture according the ice cream machines instructions.

This recipe yields about 1 quart of ice cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2         pound  chorizo or other fresh pork sausage -- finely ground
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  fine dried bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
                        Creole seasoning -- see * Note
  1 1/4           cups  water
  1 1/2         pounds  Manila clams - (to 2 lbs) -- shucked
  2               cups  basic butter sauce
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a large sautÈ pan, over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil.  Add the sausage and cook until the meat is browned, about 4 minutes.  Add the onions and garlic.  Season with salt and pepper.  Continue to cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and pour into a medium mixing bowl and cool completely.

In another mixing bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the oil, the bread crumbs, parsley and cheese.  Season with Creole seasoning and mix well.  Add the sausage mixture and water to the bread crumbs.  Mix well.

Grease the bottom of a 10-inch pie pan with the remaining tablespoon of oil.  Arrange the clams in 1 layer in the bottom of the pan.  Season with Creole seasoning.  Cover the clams with the sausage mixture, packing it firmly down onto them.  Bake on the center rack of the oven until the top is golden brown, about 18 to 20 minutes.

Remove from the oven and spoon onto serving plates.  Drizzle the plates with some of the sauce.  Garnish with green onions.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped seeded red bell pepper

                        Salt -- to taste

  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1              pound  lump crabmeat -- picked over for
                        shells and cartilage
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions, green parts only
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1         tablespoon  Creole mustard
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  1 1/2           cups  dried fine bread crumbs
  1                cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  bleached all-purpose flour
  3          teaspoons  Creole seasoning, (Essence) -- see * Note
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  water
  2              large  Idaho potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into shoestrings
  1             recipe  Fresh Horseradish Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1             recipe  Roasted Corn And Tomato Salad -- (see recipe)

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Melt the butter in a small sautÈ pan over medium heat.  Add the onions, celery and bell peppers.  Season with salt and cayenne.  Cook, stirring, until the vegetables are soft and slightly golden, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Cool for 5 minutes.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the crabmeat, green onions, cheese, parsley, mustard, mayonnaise, the cooled vegetables and 3/4 cups of the bread crumbs.  Mix well.  Divide the mixture into 10 equal portions and form them into 1-inch-thick cakes (patties).

In a shallow bowl, combine the flour with 1 teaspoon of the Essence.  In another bowl, whisk the egg with the water.  In a third bowl, combine the remaining 3/4 cup bread crumbs and 1 teaspoon of the Creole seasoning.

Heat the remaining 1 cup oil to 360 degrees in a large sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  Dredge the cakes first in the seasoned flour, tapping off any excess, then in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off.  Dredge the cakes in the seasoned bread crumbs, coating them evenly.  Gently lay the cakes, 3 to 4 at a time, in the oil and fry until lightly golden, about 4 minutes on each side.

Preheat the fryer.  Fry the potatoes in batches until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally for overall browning.

Melt the butter in a small sautÈ pan over medium heat.  Add the onions, celery and bell peppers.  Season with salt and cayenne.  Cook, stirring, until the vegetables are soft and slightly golden, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Cool for 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large mixing bowl, combine the crabmeat, green onions, cheese, parsley, mustard, mayonnaise, the cooled vegetables and 3/4 cups of the bread crumbs.  Mix well.  Divide the mixture into 10 equal portions and form them into 1-inch-thick cakes (patties).
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a shallow bowl, combine the flour with 1 teaspoon of the Essence.  In another bowl, whisk the egg with the water.  In a third bowl, combine the remaining 3/4 cup bread crumbs and 1 teaspoon of the Creole seasoning.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the remaining 1 cup oil to 360 degrees in a large sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  Dredge the cakes first in the seasoned flour, tapping off any excess, then in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off.  Dredge the cakes in the seasoned bread crumbs, coating them evenly.  Gently lay the cakes, 3 to 4 at a time, in the oil and fry until lightly golden, about 4 minutes on each side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the fryer.  Fry the potatoes in batches until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally for overall browning.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain the cakes on paper towels.  Season the cakes with the remaining teaspoon Creole seasoning.  Drain the potatoes on paper towels.  Season with salt.  Spoon the horseradish sauce in the center of each plate.  Lay the crab cakes in the center of the sauce. Spoon the corn and tomato salad over each cake.  Pile the potatoes on top of the salad.  Garnish with parsley.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  baby leeks, cleaned
                        Drizzle of olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste

                        Creole seasoning -- see * Note
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              pound  fresh crabmeat -- picked over
                        for cartilage
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions, green part only
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  fine dried bread crumbs
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallots
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Season the leeks with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Place on a baking sheet and roast until tender, about 30 minutes.

For the sauce:  In a small saucepan, over medium heat, combine the shallots, garlic and wine.  Bring to a boil and reduce by half.  Whisk in the butter, 1 cube at a time, until all of the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon.  Strain through a fine mesh sieve.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the parsley and mix well.

To serve, lay the fillets in the center of each serving plate.  Place the baby leeks around the fillets.  Drizzle the sauce over the entire plate.  Garnish with parsley.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  1                cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  1              pinch  salt
  5                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  Vanilla Pastry Cream -- (see below)
  6             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- melted in a
                        double boiler together with
  1         tablespoon  shortening
                        Shaker of powdered sugar
                        === PASTRY CREAM ===
  5              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  cornstarch
  2 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  1 1/2           cups  sugar

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a saucepan, over high heat, whisk the butter and milk together, until all the butter has melted.  Bring the liquid up to a boil.  Whisk in the sugar.  Combine the flour, baking powder and salt.  Slowly stir in the flour mixture and continue to stir until the mixture forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan.

Remove from the heat and turn into a bowl of an electric mixer.  Beat the dough on medium speed and add the eggs, 1 at a time.  Continue beating until the dough no longer looks slippery.  Remove the dough from the mixer and cool.

Place the dough in a pastry bag fitted with a round tip and pipe out 3-inch logs onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, about 2 inches apart or use a large spoon and spoon them onto the baking sheet.  Place the pan in the oven and bake for 10 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and continue to cook for 25 minutes.  Do not remove the sheet from the oven until the rounds are firm to the touch.

Cool the shells before filling.  Place the pastry cream in a pastry bag, fitted with a round tip, and fill each shell with the filling.  Dip the top of each eclair in the chocolate.  Set aside until the topping as set.  Place the eclairs on a platter.  Garnish with confectionersí sugar

For the Pastry Cream:  In a mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, cornstarch, and 1 cup of the heavy cream.  Whisk to blend well.  Set aside.

Combine the remaining 1 1/2 cups cream and sugar in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.  Whisk to dissolve the sugar and bring to a gentle boil, about 10 minutes.  Slowly add the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly and cook until it thickens, about 5 minutes.  Be forewarned; the mixture will break.  Donít be alarmed.  Pour it into a glass bowl.  Press a piece of plastic wrap down over the surface of the mixture to prevent a skin from forming.  Let cool completely at room temperature.

When cooled pour the mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip.  Beat at a medium speed to combine the mixture.  If it will not combine, warm another 1/2 cup heavy cream and slowly add it to the mixture.  Whip until you have a thick and creamy custard.  (Yields about 2 cups)

This recipe yields about 1 dozen eclairs.

     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  Creole seasoning -- (see * Note)
  4                     bone-in dry aged rib-eye steaks -- (abt 20 to 22 oz ea)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     English muffins -- split in half
  4        tablespoons  butter -- at room temperature
  2                     fresh ham steaks - (abt 6 oz ea)
  3               cups  water
     1/2      teaspoon  white vinegar
  8                     eggs -- individually cracked
                        into 8 cups
  4                     egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  water
  1         tablespoon  Creole Mustard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne -- to taste
     1/2         pound  butter -- melted and warm
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh mild herbs, such as
                        tarragon, chervil, parsley, basil, etc.
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves

Preheat a griddle.  Brush the muffins with the butter.  Place the muffins on the hot griddle and pan-fry for 2 minutes on each side.  Remove the muffins from the griddle and set aside.

Heat a skillet over medium heat.  Add the ham steak and sear for a couple of minutes on each side.  Remove the ham steaks and cut into 8 portions.

Bring a pot of salted water and vinegar to a boil.  Slide the whole eggs into the water 1 at a time.  When the water returns to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the eggs are set, watch carefully and remove the eggs when the yolks are still soft, about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.  Remove the eggs from the water and drain on a paper-lined plate.  Season the eggs with salt and pepper.

In a stainless steel bowl set over a pot of simmering water over medium heat, whisk the egg yolks with the lemon juice, water, and mustard, together.  Season with salt and cayenne.  Whisk the mixture until pale yellow and slightly thick.  Be careful not to let the bowl touch the water.  Remove the bowl from the pot and whisking vigorously, add the butter, 1 teaspoon at a time, until all is incorporated.  Fold in the fresh herbs.

To serve:  Place a piece of the ham on each English muffin.  Lay the poached eggs on top of the ham.  Spoon the Hollandaise sauce over the eggs.  Garnish the eggs with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  butter
  4             ounces  Macadamia nuts -- roughly chopped
  2               cups  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  butter
  1              stick  butter -- room temperature
  1                cup  heavy cream -- room temperature
     1/2         pound  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/2         pound  milk chocolate -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  oil -- divided

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Line an 8- by 8- by 1 1/2-inch square pan with aluminum foil, allowing the foil to hang over the edges of the pan.  Grease the pan with 1 teaspoon of butter.

Place the nuts on a round cake pan and place in the oven.  Toast until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes.  If you shake the pan a couple of times in the oven, it helps for overall browning.  Remove from the oven and cool.

In a 2-quart saucepan, over medium heat, combine the sugars, salt, vanilla, butter, and cream.  Stir constantly until fully incorporated, about 1 minute.  Bring the mixture to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reaches 254 degrees (hard ball stage) on a candy thermometer, about 15 minutes after the mixture comes to a boil.

Sprinkle the nuts over the butter of the prepared pan.  Pour the sugar mixture over the nuts and place in a draft-free area and allow to cool completely.  Place the both chocolates in separate bowls over pots of simmering water.  Stir occasionally until all of the chocolate is melted and smooth.  Stir 1/4 teaspoon of the oil into each chocolate.

To temper the chocolates:  Dip the bottom of each bowl of chocolate in a bowl of cold water and stir the chocolate until it begins to thicken.  Immediately remove from the cold water and place back over the pot of simmering water.  Stir over the hot water just long enough to make the chocolate liquid again.  Remove the bowl from the heat.  Set aside until ready to use.

Turn the caramel out onto a cutting board.  Using a sharp knife, cut into 1-inch squares.  In a cool and draft-free area of you kitchen, dip half of the nut caramels in the semi sweet chocolate and the remaining in the milk chocolate, coating completely and shaking off the excess.

Place the chocolates on a piece of parchment paper and allow let sit for a couple of hours or until the chocolate sets.  Place the chocolates on a serving platter and serve.  They will keep for 1 week in an airtight container.  Do not refrigerate.

This recipe yields about 4 1/2 dozen chocolates.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active yeast
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3               cups  flour - (to 4 cups)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  chunky fresh tomato sauce
  4             ounces  capicolla ham -- diced small
  4             ounces  homemade mozzarella cheese -- diced small
     1/4           cup  chiffonade basil

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees with a baking stone.

       Emeril's Peanut Butter And Banana Sandwich With Homemade Bam

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  unsalted peanuts
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2             pounds  new potatoes -- thinly sliced,
                        about 1/8" thick
                        Creole seasoning -- see * Note
  6             medium  bananas
  1                     loaf Chocolate Chip Sandwich Bread -- (see recipe)
                        Roll of plastic wrap
  12                    plastic sandwich bags

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place the peanuts on a baking sheet and place in the oven.  Cook until the peanuts are toasted, about 6 to 8 minutes.  (Shake the pan a couple of times, for overall browning).  Remove the pan from the oven and place the peanuts in a food processor while they are still warm.  Add the oil, salt and sugar.  Process until smooth.

Remove the ends of the bread and cut into slices 1/4-inch thick.  Using a toaster, toast each slice until golden.

Preheat the fryer.  Fry the potatoes in batches until crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally for overall color.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with Creole seasoning.

To assemble, spread some of the peanut butter over each slice of bread.  Peel and slice the bananas 1/4-inch thick.  Lay the slices of bananas over the peanut butter.  Put 2 pieces of bread together, forming the sandwich.  Wrap the sandwich tightly in plastic wrap.  Place some the chips in each plastic sandwich bag.  Pack each in a lunch box.  Eat during your lunch time.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place the peanuts on a baking sheet and place in the oven.  Cook until the peanuts are toasted, about 6 to 8 minutes.  (Shake the pan a couple of times, for overall browning).  Remove the pan from the oven and place the peanuts in a food processor while they are still warm.  Add the oil, salt and sugar.  Process until smooth.

Remove the ends of the bread and cut into slices 1/4-inch thick.  Using a toaster, toast each slice until golden.

Preheat the fryer.  Fry the potatoes in batches until crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally for overall color.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with Creole seasoning.
</DirT>

To assemble, spread some of the peanut butter over each slice of bread.  Peel and slice the bananas 1/4-inch thick.  Lay the slices of bananas over the peanut butter.  Put 2 pieces of bread together, forming the sandwich.  Wrap the sandwich tightly in plastic wrap.  Place some the chips in each plastic sandwich bag.  Pack each in a lunch box.  Eat during your lunch time.

                        Colored buttercream in pastry bags
                        with assorted tips
                        === SPONGE CAKE FOR WEDDING CAKE X 2 ===
  15            ounces  flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  12             large  eggs -- separated
  15            ounces  sugar
  8             ounces  butter -- melted and cooled
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === BUTTERCREAM ===
  4               cups  sugar
  1 3/4           cups  water
  16                    egg whites
  1           teaspoon  salt
  5             pounds  butter -- softened to room
                        temperature and cut into pieces
  4        tablespoons  vanilla

Sponge Cake For Wedding Cake:  This recipe will need to be made twice, each time you will bake 1 (12- by 2-inch) layer, 1 (9- by 2-inch) layer and 1 (6- by 2-inch layer.  Do not double this recipe -- make it twice, separately.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line the bottom of 1 of each size of the pans with parchment paper.

Sift the flour with the salt.  In a mixer fitted with a whip attachment, beat the egg yolks with 8 ounces of sugar until light and fluffy and tripled in volume.  Beat the egg whites with the remaining 7 ounces of the sugar until soft peaks form.  Fold the egg yolks gently into the egg whites.  Gently fold in the sifted flour.  Gently fold in the melted butter and the vanilla.

Pour the batter into each of the 3 pans.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until center is set.  Remove from the oven and run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen it and cool on wire racks.  Repeat this procedure to make 1 more layer of each size.

For the Buttercream:  In a saucepan, combine sugar and water.  Heat to a temperature of 248 degrees on a candy thermometer.  In an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the egg whites with the salt until they hold stiff peaks.  With the mixer running, drizzle the hot syrup into the whites being careful not to hit the whip with the hot syrup.  Beat mixture at medium speed until cooled to room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes.

Turn the mixer down to low and add the softened butter, piece by piece.  It is very important that the butter and the meringue are the same temperature.  If the buttercream begins to break, slowly heat it up to about 95 degrees over a double boiler, while whisking.  Return to the mixer and beat until it comes back together.  Continue adding butter.  Mix in the vanilla.

To assemble:  Cut each of the cooled cakes in half horizontally.  Stack each of 4 layers of each size, icing in between each layer on a corresponding size cake circle.  Make 3 separate 4-layer cakes.  Ice each of the cakes separately.

Place the 12- by 2-inch cake on a large platter.  Cut 3 lengths of the wooden dowel that are as long as the 12-inch cake is high.  Insert the dowels in a triangle pattern in the center of the 12-inch cake.  Cut 3 more dowels that are as long as the 9-inch cake is high.  Carefully place the 9-inch cake on top of the 12-inch cake in the center, on top of the dowels.  Insert the dowels into the center of the 9-inch layer in a triangle pattern.  Carefully place the 6-inch layer on top of the 9-inch layer.  Decorate with fruit, flowers and marzipan.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                        Oil -- for frying
  3              dozen  large freshly-shucked oysters
                        Creole seasoning -- see * Note
  1                cup  all-purpose flour

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     ripe mangos -- peeled, cored,
                        and medium diced
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  chiffonade fresh mint leaves
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
  1         tablespoon  butter -- plus
     1/3           cup  butter -- at room temperature
     1/3           cup  solid vegetable shortening
  1 3/4           cups  sugar
  3                     eggs -- at room temperature
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3          teaspoons  baking powder
  1                cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1             recipe  Fresh Coconut Ice Cream II -- (see recipe)

For the Mangos:  In a mixing bowl, mix all the ingredients.  Cover with plastic wrap and set aside while making the cake.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper.  Butter the entire pan with 1 tablespoon of the butter.

For the Cake:  Using an electric mixer, fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the 1/3 cup butter, shortening, and sugar together.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and mix well.  Sift the flour, salt and baking powder.  Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk.  Mix well.  Add the vanilla.

Pour into the prepared pan.  Place in the oven on the middle rack.  Bake until the top is golden and the cake springs back, about 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool for 5 minutes in the pan.

Place a piece of parchment paper over the rack and carefully invert the cake onto a wire rack.  Carefully remove the parchment paper on the bottom of the cake.  Allow the cake to cool completely.

Slice the cake into 24 equal pieces.  Place 2 pieces of the cake in each serving bowl.  Spoon some of the mango mixture over the cake.  Place a couple of scoops of the ice cream on top of the mango mixture and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  1             medium  honeydew
     1/2           cup  vodka - (to 1 cup)
  4               cups  rock or sea salt
  1                     container edible flowers
  4              dozen  raw oysters
  4             ounces  Sevruga caviar
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves

In a small saucepan, over medium heat, combine the water and sugar.  Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes to make a simple syrup.  Remove syrup from the heat and cool completely.

Using a sharp knife, remove the outer skin of the melon.  With a spoon, scrape out the seeds and discard.  Dice the melon into small pieces.  In the cup of a blender, combine the melon and simple syrup to taste.  Process until smooth.  Add the vodka and process until smooth.

Pour the mixture into nonreactive cake pan and freeze until firm.  Remove from the freezer and allow to sit for a couple of minutes.  Using a knife, scrape the melon mixture back and forth, spoon the mixture into a plastic container with a lid.  (The consistency of the mixture should be slushy.) An electric ice cream machine can also be used.  Cover and freeze until ready to use.

Place the rock salt on the large oval platter.  Lay the oysters on top of the salt.  Place the flowers around the oysters.  Spoon some of the Melon/Vodka Granita over each oyster.  Top the granita with some of the caviar.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/4         pounds  fresh spinach -- stemmed, cleaned,
                        and patted dry
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
     1/4         pound  goat cheese
  24             small  freshly-shucked oysters
                        === DOUGH ===
  3               cups  flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  6        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  1                     egg
     3/4           cup  milk
                        Solid vegetable shortening -- for deep-frying

In a large saute pan, over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the spinach.  Season with salt and pepper.  Saute until wilted.  Add the shallots and the garlic.  Continue to saute for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.

In a mixing bowl, combine the wilted spinach and the cheese.  Mix well.  Season the mixture with salt and pepper.

For the dough:  Sift the flour, salt and baking powder into a mixing bowl.  Cut in the shortening until it resembles coarse meal.  In a small bowl, beat the egg with the milk.  Gradually add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, working it into a thick dough.  Break the dough into 24 equal pieces.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough pieces into thin rounds, about 2 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter.  Spoon a heaping tablespoon of the filling in the center of each round and place an oyster on top of the filling.  Season the oyster with salt and pepper.  Fold over and crimp the edges with a fork.

Heat the shortening in a deep pot or an electric fryer to 360 degrees.  Fry the pies, a couple at a time, until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels, season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 24 portions.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  fresh strawberries -- washed, stemmed,
                        and quartered
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  4               cups  half-and-half
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split in half,
                        and scraped
  6                     egg yolks

In a food processor or blender, combine the strawberries and 1/2 cup of the sugar.  Process until smooth.

In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the half-and-half and sugar.  Bring to a simmer.  In a small mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth.  Add 1 cup of the hot liquid to the egg yolks and whisk until smooth.  Add the yolk mixture to the saucepan of liquid and whisk until incorporated.  Bring the liquid back to simmer and continue to cook for 4 to 6 minutes or until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.

Remove from the heat and stir in the strawberries.  Whisk until smooth.  Pour the mixture into a glass bowl and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the mixture.  This will prevent a skin from forming while cooling.  Cool the mixture completely.  Process the mixture according the ice cream machine's instructions.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 quarts ice cream.

  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon leaves
  3        tablespoons  capers
  1         tablespoon  caper juice
  2              large  fresh lobsters -- cooked, tail and
                        claw meat removed, shells discarded
     1/2          pint  red teardrop or small pear tomatoes
     1/2          pint  yellow teardrop or small pear tomatoes
     1/4           cup  fresh chervil leaves
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
                        Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil
                        === FOR THE TOMATOES ===
  2              large  green tomatoes -- cored, and
                        ends removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
  1                cup  vegetable oil

In a blender, combine the egg, mustard, lemon juice, and hot sauce.  Blend on high until smooth.  With the blender running, slowing add enough oil until the mixture is thick.  Season with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

In a mixing bowl, combine half of the mayonnaise, shallots, garlic, and tarragon.  Mix well.  Roughly chop the capers and add to the mayonnaise mixture.  Add the caper juice and mix well.

In a large cast-iron skillet, over medium heat, add the oil.  Dredge the tomato slices in the flour mixture, coating both sides completely.  When the oil is hot, pan-fry the tomatoes until golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Remove the tomatoes and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt and pepper.

Add the teardrop tomatoes and the chervil to the lobster salad and mix well.  Arrange the fried tomatoes in the center of each serving plate.  Mound the Lobster Salad in the center of the fried tomatoes.  Drizzle with olive oil.  Garnish with parsley.

                        Cayenne -- to taste
                        Freshly ground white pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  cooked medium-grain rice
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped tarragon leaves
                        Casings, 1 1/2" dia and about 4 feet long
                        Olive oil
  1             medium  mirliton or chayote -- peeled, cored,
                        and julienne
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
                        Creole seasoning -- see * Note
  1                cup  Remoulade II -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions, green part only

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a food processor, combine the shrimp, onions, garlic, cream, and cognac.  Season with salt and pepper.  Turn the mixture into a mixing bowl.  Stir in the rice and tarragon.  Season with salt, cayenne and black pepper.  To test the seasoning of the sausage, pan-fry a small piece of the filling for a couple of minutes on each side.  Re-adjust the seasoning if needed.  Either using a feeding tube or a funnel, stuff the sausage into the casings and make 3-inch links.

Bring a large saucepan of salted water up to a boil.  Poach the sausage for about 5 minutes, or until the sausage is firm to the touch and plump.  Remove from the water and allow to cool.  Lightly brush the sausage with olive oil.  Place on the grill and cook for 2 minutes on each side.  Remove from the heat.

Season both the mirlitons and flour with Creole seasoning.  Dredge the mirlitons in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess.  Fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with Creole seasoning.

To serve, spoon some of the Remoulade in the center of each serving plate.  Criss-cross 2 of the links in the center of sauce.  Mound some of the mirliton in the center of the sausages.  Garnish with green onions.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Desserts                        Ice Cream


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  hazelnuts
  4               cups  half-and-half
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  6                     egg yolks

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Place the hazelnuts on the baking sheet and roast until golden, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool completely.  Roughly chop the nuts and set aside.

In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the half-and-half and sugar.  Bring to a simmer.  In a small mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth.  Add 1 cup of the hot liquid to the egg yolks and whisk until smooth.  Add the yolk mixture to the saucepan of liquid and whisk until incorporated.  Bring the liquid back to simmer and continue to cook for 4 to 6 minutes or until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.

Pour the mixture into a glass bowl and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the mixture.  This will prevent a skin from forming while cooling.  Cool the mixture completely.  Stir in the nuts.  Process the mixture in an ice cream machine.

This recipe yields about 1 quart of ice cream.

                  Homemade Chocolate Chip Sandwich Bread

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           envelope  dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  warm water -- (about 110 degree)
  3 1/2           cups  bleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  semisweet chocolate chips
  1              large  egg -- beaten

Combine the yeast, sugar, 2 tablespoons of the oil, and water in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Beat on low speed for 1 minute.  Add the flour, salt and chocolate chips.  Beat at low speed until all of the flour is incorporated, about 1 minute.  Then beat at medium speed until the mixture forms a ball, leaves the sides of the bowl, and climbs up the dough hook.

Remove the dough from the bowl.  Using your hands, form the dough into a smooth ball.  Lightly oil a bowl with 1 teaspoon of the oil.  Place the dough in the bowl and turn it to oil all sides.  Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm, draft-free place until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Remove the dough from the bowl and place on a lightly floured work surface.  Knead the dough a couple of times and form into a 6-inch loaf.  Grease a loaf pan with the remaining 1 teaspoon of the oil.  Place the dough into the prepared pan.  Using a sharp knife, make 3 slits across the top of the dough.  Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm, draft-free place until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.

Brush the top of the bread with the beaten egg.  Place in the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until slightly brown and hollow sounding when the top is tapped.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

                           Kangaroo Fried Pies

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  ground kangaroo meat
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  finely-chopped onions
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  4             ounces  cheddar or gouda -- grated
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions, green part only
                        Flour -- for dusting
  1             recipe  Spit Pea Soup -- (see recipe)
                        === PASTRY FOR FRIED PIES ===
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  6        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  1              large  egg
     3/4           cup  milk

In a large skillet, over medium heat, add the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the kangaroo.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the onions and garlic.  Season with salt and pepper.  Continue to cook until the meat is fully cooked.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.

In a mixing bowl, combine the meat mixture and cheese.  Mix well.  Stir in the green onions.

For the Pastry For Fried Pies:  Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a large mixing bowl.  Add the shortening and with your hands or a fork, mix until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  In a small bowl, whisk the egg and milk together.  Gradually add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and mix until a smooth ball forms.  Cover the ball of dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Remove from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature.  (Yields enough pastry for 12 large or 24 small pies)

Divide the pastry dough into 24 equal portions.  On a lightly floured work surface, roll out each dough piece into a thin round about 5 inches in diameter.  Put about 2 tablespoons of the mixture in the center of each round, fold the dough over, and crimp the edges together with a fork.

Preheat the oil to 360 degrees.  Fry the pies in batches, 2 to 3 at a time, until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt.

Ladle the Spit Pea Soup into the serving bowls.  Float a couple of the pies in the soup and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  creme fr‚iche
     1/2           cup  fresh cream cheese -- at room temperature
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh dill leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  1         tablespoon  chopped lemon zest
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  6              large  Norwegian smoked salmon slices
  36                    toasted melba bread rounds or squares
  8             ounces  Beluga caviar
                        === GARNISH ===
  36            sprigs  fresh dill
                        Sour cream

In a mixing bowl, combine the cream fraiche, cream cheese, dill, chives, and lemon zest.  Mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.

Place the slices of salmon on a piece of plastic wrap, with the small end closest to you, on a flat surface.  Season the slices of salmon with the pepper.  Spread some of the cheese mixture evenly over each slice of salmon.  Trim ends to make even.  Then, beginning at the bottom, roll up the salmon, jelly-roll style, securely, pressing to close.  Wrap each salmon roll in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

About 30 minutes before serving, place the salmon rolls in the freezer, this will make slicing easy.  To serve, using a chefís knife, slice the salmon into 1/2-inch slices.  Remove the plastic wrap and discard.  Place the salmon on the toasted melba.  Using a pear-handle spoon, place some caviar on top of the salmon.  Garnish with a sprig of dill and sour cream.

This recipe yields about 36 servings.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  4               cups  water
  3             pounds  swamp cabbage (hearts of palm)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh mild herbs, such as
                        basil, tarragon, chervil, parsley, etc.
                        === FOR THE ROASTED POTATOES ===
  4             pounds  new potatoes -- scrubbed, quartered
                        Drizzle of olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste

For the Flank Steak:  Season both sides of the flank steak with salt and pepper.  Place in a large plastic sealable bag and set aside.

In a mixing bowl, combine the onions, garlic, cilantro, chilies, olive oil and vinegar.  Season with salt and pepper.  Whisk well.  Pour the marinade over the meat and seal the bag completely.  Shake the bag several times to distribute the marinade.  Place in the refrigerator and marinate overnight.

Remove from the bag, discarding the marinade and bring to room temperature.  Preheat the grill.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

For the cabbage:  In a large saucepan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ until wilted, about 4 to 6 minutes.  Add the shallots and garlic.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ for 1 minute.

Add the water and bring to a boil.  Add the swamp cabbage.  Season with salt and pepper.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the cabbages are tender, about 1 hour.  Remove from the heat and stir in the fresh herbs.  Season with salt and pepper.  Keep warm.

For the potatoes:  In a large mixing bowl, toss the potatoes with olive oil, salt and cracked black pepper.  Place on a large baking sheet and roast until tender, about 45 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally.

Place the steak on the grill and cook for 6 to 8 minutes on each side for medium-rare, moving the meat several times during cooking.  Remove the steak from the grill and rest for 5 minutes.

Slice the steak into individual servings.  Serve with the Swamp Cabbage and Roasted Potatoes.  Garnish with green onions.

This recipe yields 8 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CORN CAKES ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  fresh sweet corn kernels
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/2           cup  bleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  masa harina flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
     3/4           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  Creole Seasoning -- see * Note
                        === FOR THE SALMON SALAD ===
  1                     house-smoked salmon fillet - (8 oz) -- skin off
  6              large  hard-boiled eggs
  1         tablespoon  capers -- finely minced
  1           teaspoon  caper juice
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise - (to 1/2 cup)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                can  Beluga Caviar - (7 oz tin)
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

For the Corn Cakes:  Heat the olive oil in a medium-size saute pan over medium heat.  Add the corn, shallots, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and the black pepper and cook, stirring, until the corn and shallots are tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Combine the eggs and cream in a large mixing bowl and whisk to blend well.  Add the cornmeal, flour, masa harina, baking powder, cayenne, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the water.  Mix well.  Fold in the corn-and-shallot mixture.

Heat 1/2 teaspoon of the vegetable oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat.  When the oil is hot, but not smoking, gently drop the batter, 1 tablespoon at a time, into the pan.  You can cook about 8 cakes at a time.  Cook until the cakes are lightly golden on both sides, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side.  Repeat until all of the oil and the batter are used up.  Drain the cakes on paper towels.  Sprinkle with the Creole seasoning.

For the Salmon Salad:  In a mixing bowl, flake the salmon into small pieces.  Chop the eggs and add to the salmon.  Add the capers and caper juice.  Mix well.  Stir in enough mayonnaise to desired consistency.  Mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.

To assemble, spread a tablespoon of the salmon salad over each corncake.  Place on a large platter.  Top the salmon with the caviar.  Garnish with chives.

This recipe yields 32 appetizer servings.

For the Corn Cakes:  Heat the olive oil in a medium-size saute pan over medium heat.  Add the corn, shallots, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and the black pepper and cook, stirring, until the corn and shallots are tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the eggs and cream in a large mixing bowl and whisk to blend well.  Add the cornmeal, flour, masa harina, baking powder, cayenne, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the water.  Mix well.  Fold in the corn-and-shallot mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat 1/2 teaspoon of the vegetable oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat.  When the oil is hot, but not smoking, gently drop the batter, 1 tablespoon at a time, into the pan.  You can cook about 8 cakes at a time.  Cook until the cakes are lightly golden on both sides, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side.  Repeat until all of the oil and the batter are used up.  Drain the cakes on paper towels.  Sprinkle with the Creole seasoning.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Salmon Salad:  In a mixing bowl, flake the salmon into small pieces.  Chop the eggs and add to the salmon.  Add the capers and caper juice.  Mix well.  Stir in enough mayonnaise to desired consistency.  Mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble, spread a tablespoon of the salmon salad over each corncake.  Place on a large platter.  Top the salmon with the caviar.  Garnish with chives.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  large Gulf shrimp -- in their shells
  2        tablespoons  Creole seasoning -- see * Note
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
     1/4           cup  chopped onions
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  3                     bay leaves
  3                     lemons -- peeled, sectioned
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Traditional Southern Biscuits -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Peel the shrimp, leaving only their tails attached.  Reserve the shells and set aside.  Sprinkle the shrimp with 1 tablespoon Creole seasoning and fresh cracked black pepper.  Use you hands to coat the shrimp with the seasonings.  Refrigerate the shrimp while you make the sauce base.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large pot over high heat.  When the oil is hot, add the onions and garlic and sautÈ for 1 minute.  Add the reserved shrimp shells, the remaining Creole seasoning, the bay leaves, lemons, water, Worcestershire, wine, salt, and black pepper.  Stir well and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.  Remove from the heat, allow to cool for about 15 minutes.

Strain into a small saucepan.  There should be about 1 1/2 cups.  Place over high heat, bring to a boil, and cook until thick, syrupy, and dark brown, for about 15 minutes.  Makes about 4 to 5 tablespoons of barbecue sauce base.

Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over high heat.  When the oil is hot, add the seasoned shrimp and sautÈ them, occasionally shaking the skillet, for 2 minutes.  Add the cream and all of the barbecue base.  Stir and simmer for 3 minutes.  Remove the shrimp to a warm platter with tongs and whisk the butter into the sauce.  Remove from the heat.

Mound the shrimp in the center of a platter.  Spoon the sauce over the shrimp and around the plate.  Arrange the biscuits around the shrimp.  Garnish with chopped chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  cauliflower florets -- stems trimmed
  3               cups  water
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  fresh salmon fillet -- skinned, and
                        cut into 4 (4-oz) pieces
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  butter
     1/2           cup  fresh baby sweet green peas

Preheat the oven to 225 degrees.

In a large saucepan, combine the cauliflower, water and salt over high heat.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook until the cauliflower is very soft, about 30 minutes.  Remove from the heat and drain.

Put the cauliflower, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and the cream in a food processor and puree until smooth like creamed potatoes.  Season with salt and white pepper.

Put the salmon in a shallow baking pan, rub it with the olive oil, and season with the kosher salt and black pepper.  Bake for 15 minutes.

In a small skillet, heat the butter over medium heat and cook until it browns lightly, about 1 minute.  Add the peas, stir gently, and cook for 1 minute.

Spoon the pureed cauliflower in the center of each plate.  Lay a piece of salmon on top of each and garnish with the peas.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Desserts                        Pies


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  Oreo or other chocolate cookie crumbs
     1/4           cup  melted butter
     1/2         pound  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  4               cups  half-and-half
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split in half
  6                     egg yolks
  2              dozen  Oreo or other chocolate sandwich cookies
  2               cups  whole strawberries
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/2         pound  white chocolate -- melted
  1                cup  Chocolate Sauce -- (see recipe), at
                        room temperature, in a squeeze bottle
                        Oreo cookies -- for garnish
                        Fresh mint sprigs

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a small mixing bowl, combine the cookie crumbs and butter.  Mix well.  Press firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch spring-form pan.  Bake until firm to the touch, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool completely.

Fill half of saucepan with water, place over medium heat and bring to a simmer.  Place the chocolate in a small stainless steel mixing bowl.  Place over the saucepan and melt until smooth, stirring occasionally.

In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the half-and-half, sugar, and vanilla bean with pulp.  Bring to a simmer.  In a small mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth.  Add 1 cup of the hot liquid to the egg yolks and whisk until smooth.  Add the yolk mixture to the saucepan of liquid and whisk until incorporated.  Bring the liquid back to simmer and continue to cook for 4 to 6 minutes or until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.

Remove from the heat and stir in the melted chocolate.  Whisk until smooth.  Pour the mixture into a glass bowl and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the mixture.  This will prevent a skin from forming while cooling.  Cool the mixture completely.  Process the mixture according the ice cream machine's instructions.

Break the cookies into small pieces.  During the last couple of minutes of churning, fold in the cookie pieces.  Remove the ice cream and spread evenly over the prepared crust.  Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until hard.

In a bowl, combine the strawberries and the sugar and mix well.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whip attachment, combine the cream and white chocolate.  Whip until medium-stiff peaks form.

Remove the pie from the freezer and remove the plastic wrap.  Run a sharp knife around the sides of the pan.  Remove the spring-form.  Spread the white chocolate mixture over the top of the pie.

Slice the pie into individual servings.  Place a piece in the center of each serving plate.  Spoon the strawberries next to the pie.  Garnish with a drizzle of the chocolate sauce, cookies and fresh mint.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Preheat the fryer.

Season the vegetables with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Place the vegetables on a roasting pan and roast for 10 minutes.  Remove the vegetables from the oven and cool completely.  Medium dice the vegetables and set aside.

In a large sautÈ pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  SautÈ the roasted vegetables, 1 1/2 cups of the pecans, and garlic for 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Stir in the green onions and keep warm.

In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the Worcestershire sauce, lemons and bay leaves.  Bring the liquid up to a simmer and cook until it reduces by two-thirds, about 4 minutes.  Whisk in the butter, 1 cube at a time, until all of the butter is incorporated.  The sauce should be thick and coat the back of a spoon.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh sieve.  Keep the sauce warm.

In a food processor, combine the remaining 1 1/2 cups of the pecans, breadcrumbs, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Process until fully incorporated.  Remove and season with Creole seasoning.  Season the fillets with the Creole seasoning.

In a large, ovenproof sautÈ pan, heat the remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil.  When the oil is hot, add the fillets, pretty-side down first.  SautÈ the fillets for 4 minutes on the first side and carefully flip over.  Cover the top of each fillet with a quarter of the pecan crust.  Place in the oven and cook for 5 minutes.

Fry the potatoes until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove the potatoes and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt and pepper.

To serve, spoon the sauce in the center and around the rim of each plate.  Mound the shoestrings in the center of each plate.  Place 3 piles of the relish around the shoestrings of each plate.  Gently lay each fillet on the pile of shoestring potatoes.  Garnish with parsley.

                        Drizzle of olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped basil
     1/4           cup  fresh thyme leaves
  2          teaspoons  garlic -- chopped
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  fresh pencil asparagus -- trimmed
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon leaves
  1              pound  Peekyoe crab meat -- picked over
                        for cartilage
                        Drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cups  maiche lettuce -- cleaned
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley leaves
                        Croutons -- (optional)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Cut the tomatoes in half and using a small spoon, remove the seeds.  Season with olive oil, basil, thyme, garlic, salt and pepper.  Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, seed-side down and roast for 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool.

Season the asparagus with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and roast until tender, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool.

In a mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, and tarragon.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mix well.  Fold in the crabmeat.

Line a 12 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch rectangle porcelain terrine mold with plastic wrap, allowing the plastic to hang over the mold by 2 inches.  Line the bottom of the mold with half of the tomatoes.  Lay half of the asparagus over the tomatoes.  Spoon half of the crab mixture over the asparagus, using the back of the spoon, press the crab mixture slightly into the vegetables.

Repeat the above process with the remaining ingredients.  Cover the terrine tightly with the plastic wrap.  Place a couple of weights or 3 (1 pound) cans on top of the plastic to press the terrine.  Refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 2 days.

Remove from the refrigerator.  Using an electric knife, slice the terrine into 1/2-inch slices.  Remove the plastic wrap.  Place 2 slices of the terrine onto each serving plate.  Drizzle each slice with the extra-virgin olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mound some the maiche in the center of the plate.  Garnish with parsley.  Serve with the croutons, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/4         pounds  fresh spinach -- stemmed, cleaned,
                        and patted dry
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  1                cup  goatís cheese
  4                     sheets phyllo dough
  2               cups  mesclun greens -- washed
     1/2          pint  grape tomatoes
                        Drizzle of truffle oil

In a large sautÈ pan, over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the spinach.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ until wilted.  Add the shallots and garlic.  Continue to sautÈ for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.

In a mixing bowl, combine the wilted spinach and cheese.  Mix well.  Season the mixture with salt and pepper.

Stack the sheets of phyllo dough on top of each other and cut them into thirds.  You will have a total of 12 sheets.  Divide the sheets into four 3 sheet stacks.  Lightly brush the top sheet of each stack with a teaspoon of vegetable oil.  Put 1/4 cup of the spinach mixture on the bottom edge of each oiled sheet.  Fold in the ends toward the center about 1/4-inch.  Then, beginning at the bottom, roll up the phyllo securely, pressing to close.  Lightly brush each strudel with the remaining oil.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper.  Place the strudels on the paper about 2 inches apart and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Cut each strudel in half diagonally and serve warm.

In a bowl, toss together the mesclun and tomatoes.  Season with salt and pepper and toss with the truffle oil.  Make a bed of salad on a plate.  Serve the warm strudels on top of the salad.

This recipe yields 12 strudels.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  light brown sugar
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1                cup  flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  flour
  2             pounds  fresh rhubarb -- trim root end,
                        peel and cut 1/4" thick
  2             pounds  strawberries -- hulled, sliced
     1/4           cup  rum
  1                cup  sliced almonds
  1                     unbaked 10" pie shell -- (see below)
  8             scoops  Vanilla Bean Ice Cream
                        === PIE DOUGH ===
  2               cups  flour
  1              pinch  salt
     2/3           cup  lard
  3        tablespoons  ice water - (to 4 tbsons)

In a mixing bowl combine the flour and salt.  Add the lard and work it in with your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Form the dough into 2 smooth balls.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  (Yields 2 pie doughs)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large sautÈ pan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter.  Add the sugar, 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of the flour.  Stir the mixture for 1 minute, to dissolve the sugars.  Add the rhubarb and cook for 4 to 6 minutes.  Add the strawberries and continue to sautÈ for 3 minutes.  Add the rum and carefully flame the mixture.  SautÈ for 1 minute.  Mix thoroughly and remove from the heat.  Cool the mixture.

In a mixing bowl, combine the remaining butter, brown sugar, flour and sliced almonds.  Using your hands, blend well, until the mixture resembles a crumb-like texture.  Pour the rhubarb and strawberry filling into the pie shell.  Sprinkle the crumb filling evenly over the fruit filling.  Place the pie in the oven and bake for 45 minutes.  Remove the pie from the oven.  Let the pie cool before serving, about 10 minutes.  Slice and serve warm with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1                     boneless lamb loin lamb - (abt 3 1/2 to 4  -- trimmed
  5                     fresh garlic cloves -- peeled, halved
  1                cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon zest
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  rich lamb or veal stock
  1             recipe  Couscous -- (see recipe)
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

Make 10 slits throughout the loin of lamb.  Stuff each slit with a piece of garlic.

In a mixing bowl, combine the oil, rosemary, and zest.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mix well.  Rub the entire loin of lamb with the rosemary mixture.  Wrap the loin tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours.

Remove the lamb from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature.  Remove the plastic wrap and discard.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the lamb in a roasting pan and place in the oven.  Roast for 15 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and continue to slow-roast for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees.

Remove from the oven and set the lamb on a carving board, reserving the pan juices.  Allow the lamb to sit for about 10 to 15 minutes before serving.  The roast will be a perfect medium-rare.

Pour off most of the fat from the pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons of the fat and the brown particles.  Place the pan on the stove over medium heat, stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Season with salt and pepper, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly thickened.

Slice the lamb into individual slices.  Serve with the Couscous and the pan sauce.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1              pound  rock shrimp
  1             medium  avocado -- peeled, diced small
     1/2           cup  thinly bias-sliced scallions
  4             ounces  Monterey Jack cheese -- grated
  4             ounces  sharp cheddar cheese -- grated
  12             large  flour tortillas

Combine the fruit, onions, jalapeÒo, and cilantro in a mixing bowl.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the lime juice and olive oil.  Mix well.  Set aside.

In a sautÈ pan, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and shrimp.  Season with salt and pepper.  Continue to sautÈ for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the shrimp turn bright pink.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.

Slice each quesadilla into thirds.  Serve with the fruit salsa and a dollop of the sour cream.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  medium-size shrimp -- shells, heads on
  6               cups  water
  1             medium  yellow onion -- quartered
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  flour
  1                cup  chopped yellow onion
     1/2           cup  chopped green bell pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  2                     hard-boiled eggs -- shelled, chopped fin

Peel the shrimp and reserve the shells and heads.  Refrigerate the shrimp and put the shells and heads in a large saucepan.  Add the water, onions, bay leaves, and 1 tablespoon of the salt.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer, uncovered for 30 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh strainer.  Discard the peelings and set the shrimp stock aside.

Combine the oil and flour in a large cast-iron pot or enameled cast-iron Dutch oven over medium heat.  Stirring slowly and constantly, make a roux the color of peanut butter, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, and celery and cook, stirring, until soft, 6 to 8 minutes.  Add the shrimp stock and whisk to blend the roux.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered for 1 1/2 hours.

Add the shrimp, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the cayenne and cook for 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley.  Ladle into individual soup bowls, garnish with the chopped egg, and serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
  2        tablespoons  brunoise red peppers
  2        tablespoons  brunoise yellow peppers
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1              pound  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        and finely chopped
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1              dozen  cooked crab claws
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
                        Creole seasoning -- see * Note
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Chopped cilantro -- for garnish

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a medium sautÈ pan, over medium heat, heat the olive oil.  When the oil is hot, add the onions and peppers.  Season the vegetables with salt and cayenne.  SautÈ for 2 minutes.  Add the green onions, garlic, and parsley.  SautÈ for 30 seconds.

Remove the mixture from the heat and turn into a mixing bowl.  Cool the mixture for 2 minutes.  Add the shrimp, egg, bread crumbs and cheese and mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.  Form the mixture into 12 balls and with your hands, flatten each ball.

Season the crab claws with Creole seasoning.  Form the shrimp mixture around the meat of each crab claw.  If the filling is sticking to your hands, try wetting your hands and then form the filling around the claws.  Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes, this will make the claws easier to handle.  Season the flour with Creole seasoning.

Preheat the wok for frying.  Holding the claw end, carefully dredge in the flour mixture.  Fry in batches until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally for overall browning.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with Creole seasoning.  Place the stuffed claws on a serving platter.  Garnish with cilantro.

This recipe yields 12 stuffed claws.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  hot sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  24            medium  prawns -- head and tail intact
                        and the shell from the body removed
  24                    wooden skewers -- soaked in water
  2               cups  fresh sweet corn kernels -- blanched
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/2           cup  chopped red onion
  1               pint  cherry tomatoes -- halved
     1/2           cup  chopped red bell pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped yellow bell pepper
  1              pound  fresh asparagus -- cleaned, and
                        roasted until tender
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions, green part only

In a small mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, mustard, lemon juice, hot sauce, and garlic.  Season with salt and pepper.  Whisk to blend well.  Season the prawns with salt and pepper.

Place 2 prawns on each skewer and place in a large resealable plastic bag.  Pour half of the dressing over the prawns, seal the bag and shake several times to evenly distribute the dressing over each prawn.  Place in the refrigerator and allow to marinate for 1 hour.

Remove from the bag and bring to room temperature.  Preheat the grill.  Place skewers on the grill and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until the prawns turn bright pink and their tails curl in.

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the corn, basil, onion, tomatoes, and bell pepper.  Add the remaining dressing and toss to mix.  Cover and chill for at least 2 hours before serving.

Using 3 to 6 spears of asparagus, form a triangle in the center of each serving plate.  Spoon the corn and tomato mixture in the center of each plate.  Lay 2 to 3 skewers on top of the salad.  Garnish with green onions.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  light corn syrup
  1              pinch  salt
     1/4           cup  water
  2                     egg whites
  2             sticks  butter -- at room temperature
  1                cup  chopped toasted almonds
     1/2           cup  dried cherries -- reconstituted, and
                        roughly chopped

In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, salt and water.  Cook, stirring, until sugar is dissolved.  Cook, without stirring, until the mixture reaches the hard ball stage, ( 250 to 260 degrees).  This is when a small amount of the mixture dropped in cold water forms a hard ball.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with a whip attachment, whip egg whites until stiff, but not dry.  While the machine is running and in a steady stream, add 1/4 of the syrup to the egg whites, and continue whipping until mixture holds its shape.  Place the syrup back over the heat and cook until the hard crack stage is reached, 300 degrees.  This is when the mixture separates into hard and brittle threads when dropped in cold water.

With the machine running and in a steady stream, add the remaining syrup to the egg white mixture and continue whipping until the mixture holds is shape.  Add the butter, a tablespoon at a time and whip until very thick and satiny.  Fold in the almonds and cherries.  Press into a buttered 8- by- 8 by 2-inch pan, smoothing top.  Let stand until firm.  Turn out of pan, and cut in 1 1/2- by 1-inch pieces.  Wrap each piece individually in waxed paper.

This recipe yields about 4 dozen candies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     dried bay leaves
  2               cups  thinly-sliced yellow onions
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2             pounds  Roma tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1                cup  water
  4                     tuna steaks - (6 to 7 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1              pound  Idaho potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" fries
  20                    green Portuguese olives

Preheat the fryer.

In a large sautÈ pan, with a lid, over medium heat, add the oil.  When the oil is hot, crush the bay leaves into the oil.  Cook for 30 seconds.  Add the onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ until wilted, about 4 to 6 minutes.

Add the garlic, tomatoes and water.  Season with salt and pepper.  Bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 30 minutes.

Season both sides of the tuna with salt and pepper.  Add the tuna to the pan, spooning some of the tomato mixture over the steaks, cover and cook until the tuna is tender, about 12 to 15 minutes.

Fry the potatoes until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.  Season with salt and pepper.

To serve, remove the steaks from the pan and place on a serving plate.  Add the parsley to the sauce and mix well.  Spoon the tomato mixture over the tuna.  (If you want the sauce thinner, add in a little water.)  Pile the fried potatoes next to the tuna.  Garnish with 4 to 5 of the olives and serve.

In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the half-and-half, sugar, and vanilla bean with pulp.  Bring to a simmer.  In a small mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth.  Add 1 cup of the hot liquid to the egg yolks and whisk until smooth.  Add the yolk mixture to the saucepan of liquid and whisk until incorporated.  Bring the liquid back to simmer and continue to cook for 4 to 6 minutes or until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.

                Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE COOKIES ===
  6             ounces  macadamia nuts
     3/4         pound  unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- at room temperature
  1                cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  6              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2               cups  bleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  bleached all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR THE ICE CREAM ===
  4               cups  half-and-half
  2        tablespoons  ground wattleseed
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  wattleseed extract
  1                cup  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  5                     egg yolks

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

For the cookies:  Place the nuts on a small baking sheet and place in the oven.  Roast until golden, about 4 to 6 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool.  Using a small food processor, grind the nuts.

Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle on medium speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.  Cream the mixture until it is smooth and fluffy.  Add the egg yolks 1 at a time, mixing in between each addition.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Beat for 1 minute and add the vanilla.

Combine the flour, ground nuts and salt in a medium-size mixing bowl and mix well.  Add to the butter mixture and mix on low speed until it is fully incorporated.  Increase the speed to medium and mix until the batter is thick and creamy, about 2 minutes.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl and paddle.

Generously dust a large sheet of parchment or waxed paper with flour.  Spoon the dough down the center of the paper, fold the paper tightly over the dough, and roll into a cylinder about 3 inches in diameter and 12 to 14 inches long.  Refrigerate for 8 hours.

Reduce the heat of the oven to 350 degrees.

Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and peel away the paper.  Using a sharp knife, cut the dough crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Place them on the baking sheet about 2 inches apart.  Bake until lightly golden, about 20 minutes.

Remove the cookies from the oven and let cool completely in the pan.  Remove the cookies from the pan using a spatula or thin knife.  Repeat the process until all of the dough is used.  (Yields 2 1/2 dozen cookies)

For the ice cream:  In a nonreactive saucepan, combine the half-and-half, powdered wattleseed, vanilla, wattleseed extract, sugar, and salt, over medium heat.  Bring the cream to the boiling point and scald it.  Remove from the heat.  Beat the egg yolks in a bowl.  Add the cream mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, to the beaten eggs, whisking in between each addition, until all is used.

Pour the mixture into a saucepan, and cook, stirring, over medium heat, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the mixture becomes thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve.  Pour the filling into the ice cream machine and follow the manufacturerís instructions for churning time.  (Yields about 1/2 gallon)

Spoon the ice cream into serving dishes and serve with the cookies.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the cookies:  Place the nuts on a small baking sheet and place in the oven.  Roast until golden, about 4 to 6 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool.  Using a small food processor, grind the nuts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle on medium speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.  Cream the mixture until it is smooth and fluffy.  Add the egg yolks 1 at a time, mixing in between each addition.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Beat for 1 minute and add the vanilla.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the flour, ground nuts and salt in a medium-size mixing bowl and mix well.  Add to the butter mixture and mix on low speed until it is fully incorporated.  Increase the speed to medium and mix until the batter is thick and creamy, about 2 minutes.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl and paddle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Generously dust a large sheet of parchment or waxed paper with flour.  Spoon the dough down the center of the paper, fold the paper tightly over the dough, and roll into a cylinder about 3 inches in diameter and 12 to 14 inches long.  Refrigerate for 8 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reduce the heat of the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and peel away the paper.  Using a sharp knife, cut the dough crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Place them on the baking sheet about 2 inches apart.  Bake until lightly golden, about 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the cookies from the oven and let cool completely in the pan.  Remove the cookies from the pan using a spatula or thin knife.  Repeat the process until all of the dough is used.  (Yields 2 1/2 dozen cookies)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the ice cream:  In a nonreactive saucepan, combine the half-and-half, powdered wattleseed, vanilla, wattleseed extract, sugar, and salt, over medium heat.  Bring the cream to the boiling point and scald it.  Remove from the heat.  Beat the egg yolks in a bowl.  Add the cream mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, to the beaten eggs, whisking in between each addition, until all is used.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the mixture into a saucepan, and cook, stirring, over medium heat, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the mixture becomes thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve.  Pour the filling into the ice cream machine and follow the manufacturerís instructions for churning time.  (Yields about 1/2 gallon)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon the ice cream into serving dishes and serve with the cookies.
