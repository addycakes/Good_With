                         Amazing Low-Fat Cannoli

Recipe By     :Steven Raichlen
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  2              pints  no-fat or low-fat ricotta cheese
  6        tablespoons  sugar -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  rosewater
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  1           teaspoon  water
  1         tablespoon  melted butter or canola oil
                        = (or more spray oil)
  1         tablespoon  chopped toasted pistachio nuts
                        === TO FINISH THE CANNOLI ===
                        Spray oil -- as needed
  12                    four-inch wonton wrappers

The night before, place the ricotta in a yogurt strainer or cheesecloth or paper-towel-lined strainer over a bowl.  Drain overnight in the refrigerator.  Discard the whey.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly spray 12 cannoli tubes with spray oil.  Starting with the corner of one wonton wrapper in the center, roll the wrapper around the tube.  Glue the opposite corner to the tube with a dab of cornstarch paste.  Brush the outside of the cannoli with melted butter or oil, or spray with more oil.  Roll up all the wrappers the same way.  Bake the cannoli until golden brown and crisp, about 4 to 6 minutes.  Let cool slightly, then slide the pastry shells off the tubes.  Let the shells cool to room temperature on a wire rack.

Finish the filling:  In a large bowl, combine the drained ricotta, sugar, rosewater, and vanilla and whisk to mix.  Correct the sweetness, adding sugar or rosewater to taste.  Transfer the filling to a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip.  The recipe can be prepared several hours ahead to this stage.  Store the shells in an airtight container.  Store the filling in the refrigerator, up to 24 hours.

Just before serving, pipe the ricotta mixture into the pastry shells, a little into each end.  As you withdraw the piping tube, make a rosette at each end.  Sprinkle the ends with chopped pistachios and serve at once.

This recipe yields 12 cannoli.

Comments:  There is a secret to this lowfat version of the popular Sicilian dessert: The pastry tubes are made with Chinese wonton wrappers, which are baked instead of fried.  The recipe is extremely easy to make, but you must start the night before to drain the cheese.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     eggs
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  anise oil or extract
  6          teaspoons  baking powder
  4 1/2           cups  flour

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In an electric mixer, or with a wire whisk, beat eggs, sugar, oil, and anise until well blended.

On low speed, gradually mix in baking powder and 3 cups of flour.  Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead in the additional 1 1/2 cups flour to make a soft dough.  The dough should be soft but not sticky.  Dust with flour if dough is too sticky to handle.

Divide the dough into four equal pieces and roll each piece to form a 12-inch-long loaf.

Place on a parchment-lined cookie sheet, spacing loaves 3 inches apart.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove cookie sheet from the oven.

Using two metal spatulas, carefully lift the loaves off the cookie sheet and onto a wire cooling rack.  Cool.  Place cooled loaves on a cutting board.  Using a large sharp knife, slice loaves diagonally into 1/2-inch-wide strips and place in a single layer on the cookie sheet.

Return to the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Remove cookie sheet from the oven.  Cool toasted biscotti on a wire cooling rack.  Store in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 48 cookies.

Comments:  Using anise extract or oil produces a greater flavor than using the actual Anisette or Sambuca liqueur.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
  3        tablespoons  warm water
                        === FILLING ===
  1              stick  butter
  1                cup  fresh white bread crumbs
  1 1/2         pounds  cooking apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and coarsely grated
     1/3           cup  raisins
     1/3           cup  dried currants
     1/3           cup  superfine sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated lemon rind
                        Sifted confectioners' sugar -- to serve

Sift the flour and salt together.  Make a well in the center and pour in the egg and oil.  Add the water gradually, stirring with a fork, to make a soft sticky dough.  Work the dough in the bowl until it leaves the sides clean, then tip out onto a lightly-floured surface and knead for about 15 minutes or until the dough feels smooth and elastic.  Form into a ball, place in a bowl, and cover with a warm cloth.  Leave to rest for 1 hour.

Melt half the butter in a saucepan and cook the bread crumbs until they are crisp and golden.  Add the apples, raisins, dried currants, superfine sugar, cinnamon, and lemon rind.

Warm a rolling pin, and flour a large clean dish towel.  Place the dough on the towel and roll it out to a rectangle as thinly as possible, lifting and turning it to prevent it from sticking to the cloth.  Using the backs of your hands, gently stretch the dough, working from the center to the outside until it is paper thin -- you should be able to read through the dough, but to do this takes years of practice and patience.  Then leave the dough to rest for 15 minutes.

Melt the remaining butter and use most of it to brush all over the dough.  Spread the filling on the dough to within 1 inch of the edges.  Lift the two corners of the dish towel nearest to you and roll the dough away from you.  Place the dough on a greased baking sheet and form into a horseshoe.  Brush all over with the remaining melted butter.  Bake in a preheated oven, 400 degrees, for about 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees for a further 30 minutes.

Serve warm or cold, dusted with confectioners' sugar and cut into thick slices.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

            Apple, Walnut, And Bacon Flautas With Blue Cheese

Recipe By     :Leland Atkinson
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     bacon slices - (to 4)
  3                     Granny Smith or other tart green apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and diced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Juice of 1 lime
  2          teaspoons  brown sugar - (packed) -- or to taste
     1/4           cup  walnuts -- toasted, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1                cup  crumbled blue cheese - (4 oz)
                        = (or aged goat cheese)
  6                     yellow or blue corn tortillas - (8" dia)

For the filling, cook the bacon in a large sautÈ pan or skillet over mediurn heat until the fat has rendered and the bacon is brown but not crisp, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon, leaving the fat in the pan.  SautÈ the apples in the bacon fat, stirring gently, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until evenly browned and tender, but not mushy.  Add the thyme and remove the apples from the heat.  Add the pepper, lime juice, and brown sugar and stir well.  Pour the apple mixture into a shallow pan and spread it out to cool to room temperature.  Put the cool apple mixture into a medium bowl and stir in the bacon, walnuts, and cheese.

Lay the tortillas on a flat surface in a single layer for 3 to 4 minutes, or until they are leathery but not brittle.  Heat 1 inch of oil in a skillet to 325 degrees, or until it is hot but not sizzling.  Place 1 tortilla in the oil for 1 to 2 seconds, or until it is pliable.  Using tongs, place the tortilla on a paper towel to drain.  Repeat this step with the remaining tortillas.  Drain them well, blotting the surfaces to take away excess oil.  Spoon about 4 tablespoons of the filling in a line down the center of a tortilla and roll it into a tight cylinder.  Close the seam with a toothpick.  Repeat to roll and seal the remaining tortillas.  The flautas may be prepared to this point up to 24 hours in advance, but they must be covered airtight with plastic wrap to keep them from drying or splitting.  Refrigerate the flautas until ready to serve them.

When ready to serve the flautas, heat 3 to 4 inches of oil to 375 degrees, or until sizzling but not smoking, in a large, heavy pot or deep-fryer.  Using tongs, add 3 or 4 flautas to the oil and fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden and crisp.  Using tongs, transfer the flautas to a baking sheet lined with paper towels.  Place the flautas on a wire rack or grill screen set on a baking sheet.  Put the pan in the warm oven.  Repeat the process to fry the remaining flautas.  Remove the toothpicks and serve the flautas at once.  If you like, cut the flautas in half on the diagonal with a serrated knife before serving.

This recipe yields 6 flautas.

Comments:  Serve these just as they are for noshing, or serve them on salad greens that have been tossed in a light sherry or red-wine vinaigrette.

  1           teaspoon  honey - (to 2)
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
                        === OPTIONAL ===
  1         tablespoon  chopped walnuts - (to 2)
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut the acorn squash in half and remove the seeds.  Bake the squash upside down for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine the apple, honey, lemon juice, nuts, and cinnamon.  Fill the squash halves with this mixture and bake for another 30 minutes, or until the squash is soft.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Look for acorn squash with dark green skins that have "the kiss of the sun" -- a large spot of orange.  Although not a guarantee, it is usually an indication that the flesh will be deep orange and sweet.

Categories    : Ham                             Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  4                     lean country ham steaks - (abt 6 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped shallots
     1/2           cup  small-cubed ripe tomatoes
  1                cup  Chablis
                        = (or other dry white wine)
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        SautÈed Spinach And Tomatoes -- (see recipe)

Over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a nonstick skillet large enough to hold all the ham in one layer.  Add the ham steaks and cook for about 2 minutes.  Turn and cook on the other side for about 1 minute.  Transfer to a platter and keep warm.

In the same skillet, add the shallots and tomatoes and cook, stirring, until wilted.  Add the wine, bring to a boil, and simmer until most of the wine has evaporated.  Add the cream and salt and pepper to taste and return to a simmer.  Cook, stirring, for about 3 minutes.

Place a fine mesh strainer over a small bowl and pour the tomato and cream mixture through it, using a rubber spatula to push the solids through.  Return the sauce to the skillet and allow it to simmer briefly.  Swirl in the remaining butter and check for seasoning.

To serve, divide SautÈed Spinach and Tomatoes among 4 warmed serving plates.  Place a steak over each serving of vegetables and spoon the sauce over all.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Ham with cream is one of those cherished Burgundian dishes.  This is a version of it, to be served with sautÈed spinach and tomatoes.

                               Beef Sausage

Recipe By     :Joyce Goldstein
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Sausage

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  boneless beef shoulder -- finely ground
     1/2         pound  beef fat -- finely ground
  6                     garlic cloves - (to 8) -- finely minced
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  cracked black peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten, if
                        making patties or meatballs
                        Olive oil -- for frying, if
                        making patties or meatballs

In a bowl, combine all the ingredients except the eggs and olive oil and mix well.  Divide into 2 or 3 equal portions and shape each portion into a sausage about 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Wrap each sausage well in aluminum foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate.

If you want to cook this mixture as patties or meatballs, just after making, bind it with the eggs, then fry in olive oil until golden on both sides and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes.  If you have stored it in the refrigerator, slice off lengths as needed, and fry them in olive oil until golden.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  As Jews were forbidden to eat pork, they developed a sausage made from beef.  It is called luganega, related to lucanica, a sausage from Basilicata in the south.  Arabic influence is revealed in the use of savory sweet spices.  The flavorful mixture can be stuffed into well-washed beef sausage casings purchased from your butcher, but it is just as easy to shape the mixture into long sausages, wrap them in aluminum foil or plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 5 or 6 days.  When you need some sausage, you can just cut off the amount you want.  You can also shape this mixture into patties or meatballs for cooking.  This recipe is based on a description from La cucina veneziana by Giuseppe Maffioli.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2             pounds  boneless top round steak -- cut 3/4" cubes
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1                cup  beef broth
     3/4           cup  dry sherry
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Hot cooked wild rice -- (optional)
                        Finely-chopped parsley

Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet until hot.  Add the beef and cook, turning constantly, until brown on all sides, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and keep warm.

In the remaining juices, sautÈ the onion and garlic until wilted, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and carefully blend in the flour.  When smooth, add the broth, sherry, salt, and pepper.  Return the beef to the pan, and return the pan to medium-high heat.

Heat to boiling, stirring constantly, then reduce the heat to produce a gentle simmer.  Simmer only as long as it takes to bring the beef to the desired level of doneness (rare, medium, etc.).  Sauce should be thickened by that time.

Serve over wild rice, if desired, and sprinkle with the parsley before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  It's hard to beat the flavor of a good piece of beef, though the mix of garlic and sherry in this sauce is a commendable enhancement.  It's a fast cook, in either a wok or large skillet.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  walnuts
  8        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts
                        = (abt 1 1/3 lbs in all)
                        Salt -- to taste

  2        tablespoons  red-wine vinegar
     1/2         pound  multicolored or plain bow ties
  1              bunch  watercress - (abt 5 oz) -- large stems removed

In a large nonstick frying pan, toast the walnuts over moderate heat, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Remove the nuts from the pan and chop.

In the same pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over moderate heat.  Season the chicken breasts with 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper.  Cook the breasts until browned and just done, 4 to 5 minutes per side.  Remove the chicken from the pan and let rest for 5 minutes before cutting the meat into chunks.

In a medium glass or stainless-steel bowl, combine the remaining 6 tablespoons oil, the vinegar, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Add the chicken.

In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the bow ties until just done, about 15 minutes.  Drain the pasta and toss it with the walnuts, the chicken-and-vinaigrette mixture, and the watercress.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Chicken and walnuts always taste great together.  Here the combination is enhanced by the peppery bite of watercress.

                  Braised Stuffed Trout With Herb Crust

Recipe By     :Jacques PÈpin
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  dried shiitake or porcini mushrooms - -- (1 cup)
  1 1/2           cups  hot water
  6             ounces  domestic mushrooms -- washed and sliced
                        = (2 1/2 to 3 cups)
                        Vegetable cooking spray
                        = (or 1/2 tspn canola oil)
  1              small  leek - (3 to 4 oz) -- trimmed, chopped,
                        and washed - (1 cup)
  1             medium  onion - (4 oz) -- peeled, chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
  6              whole  trout - (10 oz ea) filleted -- skin removed and
                        split in half to make 12 fillets
  2             slices  bread -- processed into
                        crumbs in a food processor - (1 cup)
  2        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives

Place the dried mushrooms in a bowl, add the water, and soak the mushrooms until they are softened, about 30 minutes.  Remove the mushrooms from the water.  Pour the liquid into another bowl, discarding any sand or dirt that has collected at the bottom, and reserve the liquid.

Remove and discard the stems from the dried mushrooms (which tend to be tough) and place the caps in the bowl of a food processor with the domestic mushrooms.  Chop coarsely.

Heat a large nonstick skillet and coat it lightly but evenly with vegetable cooking spray or brush it lightly with the canola oil.  Add the leeks and onions and sautÈ them for 1 minute.  Add the chopped mushrooms, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.  SautÈ the mixture for 3 minutes longer.  Set the skillet aside off the heat.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place 6 of the fish fillets in a single layer in a baking dish.  Divide the mushroom mixture evenly over the fillets, then cover with the remaining 6 fillets, arranging them in the opposite direction of the fillets undeneath.  Pour the reserved mushroom soaking liquid over them.

Mix the bread crumbs with the olive oil, chives, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl.  Sprinkle this mixture over the fish.  Bake the fillets for 15 minutes, then broil them for 1 to 2 minutes directly under the heat, if needed, to brown the crumbs nicely on top.  Serve within the next 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving:  436 calories;  14.6 g fat (31% of calories);  2.6g saturated fat;  162mg cholesterol;  475mg sodium.

Comments:  Trout is nutritious, delicious, a good buy, and available year-round.  Buy your trout in a store that carries whole fresh trout (some stores have them alive in fish tanks), and have your fishmonger cut them into fillets.  You will need about two 3-ounce fillets of completely cleaned fish per person, which is the yield from a 10-ounce trout.  Use dried shiitake or porcini mushrooms, which are usually much more flavorful than the fresh varieties.  The liquid these are soaked in is used to cook the fish in this recipe.

                         Bucatini Alla Carbonara

Recipe By     :Sophia Loren
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4             ounces  pancetta or bacon -- diced
                        Generous pinch minced Italian parsley
  5                     egg yolks - (to 6)
  2        tablespoons  light cream
  3        tablespoons  freshly-grated pecorino or Parmigiano -- plus
                        additional to serve
  1 1/4         pounds  bucatini

Heat the oil and butter in a pan, then add the pancetta and parsley; sautÈ over medium heat to brown the pancetta well.  In a bowl beat together the egg yolks, cream, and cheese.

Meanwhile, cook the bucatini until just a! dente.  Drain the pasta well, and turn it out into a serving dish.  Working quickly, pour first the pancetta mixture, then the beaten egg mixture over the pasta.  Toss quickly to coat the strands with the sauce; the eggs will cook in the heat of the pasta.  Serve immediately while still hot.  Pass additional cheese at the table.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Sophia Loren's acclaimed film Two Women was shot mostly in a mountainous region two to three hours from Rome.  Not far from the location was a small all-male community of charcoal workers who offered the cast and crew this pasta dish, Maccheroni alla Carbonara.  The maccheroni -- the pasta -- were home-made, long, rather thick strands, with no hole through the center, irreverently called strozzapreti ("priest stranglers").  The incomparable director, Vittorio De Sica, and Sophia asked for seconds, and Loren made sure she was invited the next day to take notes on the recipe.

This recipe is faithful to the way the men prepared it, but it will never have the same flavor as it did then.

Carbonara is often served with a healthy sprinkling of freshly ground pepper over it, which some food scholars maintain represents a dusting of carbon powder.  There also are those who say the dish was invented because the essential ingredients, bacon and eggs, were supplied by American GIs to cooks using charcoal burners in Rome itself, but Loren's experience would disprove this.  Probably the GIs were simply the source of ingredients for a dish that already existed.  In any case, Bucatini alla Carbonara remains a Roman specialty that a number of restaurants proudly prepare.  If you cannot find bucatini, use thick spaghetti or penne.

                   Cannellini With Mustard Cream Sauce

Recipe By     :Karen Lee with Diane Porter
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  leek, white and light green parts -- cleaned chopped
                        = (abt 1 1/4 cups)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh parsley
     1/2           cup  white wine
  2               cups  cooked cannelloni beans -- homemade or canned
                        = (or other white beans)
  2         tablespoon  coarse-grain mustard*
  3        tablespoons  half-and-half

*  Note:  You can use Grey Poupon's Country Dijon Mustard, available at supermarkets.  Try different kinds of mustard -- each will lend its own unique flavor.

In a heavy-bottom saucepan, sautÈ the leek in the olive oil until it begins to brown, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, and sautÈ for 1 minute.

Add the parsley and wine; simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the beans and heat for 1 to 2 minutes.

Mix the mustard and half-and-half and add to the beans.  Stir and remove from the heat.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Using half-and-half instead of heavy cream keeps this dish low in fat while adding creaminess and softening the bite of the mustard.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  montaslo cheese
                        = (or Parmigiano-Regglano, Asiago, or
                        a mild Provolone)
                        Vegetable oil -- as neded

Grate the cheese on the largest holes of a cheese grater.  Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.  Brush the skillet with oil.  Spread about 2 tablespoons of the grated cheese in a circle about 3 inches in diameter.  Be sure not to make the layer of cheese too thick, or the wafers will be chewy instead of crispy.

Cook the cheese, flattening it if necessary with a wooden spoon or plastic spatula, until melted and golden brown on 1 side, about 2 minutes.  Flip the wafer over.  Use a second spoon or spatula to push the wafer off if it sticks.  Cook the wafer until golden and set, about 1 minute more.  Take care not to let it darken to more than a light gold color or it may become bitter.

Transfer the wafer to paper towels to drain.  Brush out any crumbs from the pan and repeat with the remaining cheese.

When the wafers are completely cooled, they are ready to serve.

This recipe yields about 30 wafers.

TO MAKE AHEAD:  The wafers can be made up to 1 week before serving.  Place them in layers separated by wax paper in an airtight container and store at room temperature.

Comments:  Golden and crunchy, these lacy wafers are perfect with drinks or a glass of chilled white wine before dinner.

In Friuli, frico is made with a local semi-firm cow's milk cheese called montasio, similar to Swiss Emmentaler in flavor and texture.  If montasjo is not a available, substitute Parmigiano-Reggiano, asiago, or a mild provolone.  And, a nonstick skillet is essential.

                            Cheesy Chile Toast

Recipe By     :Paula Hamilton
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  diced green chiles  - (7 oz)
  1            package  shredded Monterey Jack cheese - (8 oz)
     3/4           cup  minced red bell pepper
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  8             slices  French, English muffin, or white bread

Preheat the broiler.  Drain the chiles and combine them in a medium bowl with the cheese, bell pepper, and mayonnaise.  Stir until well blended.

Arrange the bread in a single layer on a baking sheet.  Broil 3 to 4 inches from the heat about 2 minutes, until brown.  Turn the bread over and spread the cheese mixture over the bread.

Return to the broiler and broil about 4 minutes longer, until the cheese melts and begins to brown.  Watch carefully to be sure it doesn't burn.  Cut each slice of bread into quarters and serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This easy hors d'oeuvre is always a company favorite.  If you like bolder flavors, use hot pepper Jack instead of plain Monterey Jack cheese and sprinkle a tight dusting of crushed hot red pepper on top before serving.

                              Chick-Pea Soup

Recipe By     :Nancy Harmon Jenkins
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  dried chick-peas - (1 cup)
                        = (or other dried legumes)
  1                     garlic clove
  1             medium  yellow onion -- cut in half
  3                     ripe tomatoes - (to 4) -- peeled, seeded
                        = (or 2 cups drained canned tomatoes)
  1              stalk  celery, including the top green leaves
  1                     bay leaf
  1              small  dried hot red chile pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        A little extra-virgin olive oil
                        A little finely-minced flat-leaf parsley

Put the chick-peas in a bowl, cover with cool water, and set aside to soak for 6 to 8 hours or overnight.  Then drain and place in a soup kettle with fresh cold water to cover to a depth of 1 inch.  Put the kettle on medium-low heat and when the water commences to boil, lower the heat, cover the kettle, and simmer until the chick-peas are half-cooked -- about 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the age of the beans.  Add simmering water from time to time, if needed.

When you judge the chick-peas to be half-cooked, coarsely chop the garlic, onion halves, tomatoes, and celery and add to the pot, along with the bay leaf, chile pepper, salt, and pepper.  Continue cooking, adding boiling water as necessary, until the chick-peas are tender.  Remove the bay leaf and chile pepper.

Serve immediately, garnished with the olive oil and parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                   Chicken And Yams With Gingered Figs

Recipe By     :Allen Susser
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts
  2              large  yams
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  2              large  egg whites
  12                    figs -- fresh or dried
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh ginger
  1                     vanilla bean
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  arugula leaves
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar

To marinate the chicken:  In a small bowl, combine the cilantro, 1 teaspoon of olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  Marinate the chicken in the herb mixture for 30 minutes.

To prepare the yams:  Peel the yams.  On a box grater, using the largest holes, grate the yams.  Season with the remaining salt and pepper, the allspice, and nutmeg.

To prepare and cook the chicken:  Place the egg whites in a shallow bowl.  Dip the chicken breasts in the egg white then into the seasonedyams.  Pack the yams on the chicken to encrust it completely.  Set this aside in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.

Warm the 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a sautÈ pan and cook the chicken until well browned, turn, and cook through, approximately 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside.

To prepare the figs:  In a shallow pan, poach the figs with the ginger, vanilla bean, and white wine over very low heat for 5 minutes.

To assemble and serve:  Toss the arugula with the extra-virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Arrange on a plate with the chicken.  Cut the figs in half and arrange them around the chicken.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is a light but wonderfully rich and flavorful supper dish that fuses lettuce, protein, fruits, and vegetables.  Fresh figs are available summer and fall, but you can also make this recipe with dried figs for a different, more wintry flavor.

Heat remaining oil in a medium skillet.  Salt and pepper the chicken breasts, dust with flour, then place in the hot oil and quickly brown on both sides.  Add garlic, wine, oregano, rosemary, and parsley, cover, and simmer for several minutes.  Turn off heat and transfer the chicken breasts to a small baking dish.  Place the eggplant slices on top and coat with the pan juices.  Cover and bake about 5 minutes.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- split
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped shallots
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  4             ounces  gorgonzola -- rind removed
                        = (preferably dolce)

Place the chicken breasts between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and pound gently with a rubber mallet or meat pounder to an even 1/4-inch thickness.

Combine the flour, salt, and pepper.  Dip the chicken breasts in the mixture.  Shake to remove excess.

In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the butter and olive oil.  When the butter has melted, add the chicken and cook, turning once, until golden brown, about 4 minutes on each side.  Remove the chicken to a plate and keep warm.

Add the shallots to the skillet and cook for 1 minute.  Stir in the broth and wine, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Cook for 1 minute, or until the liquid is slightly thickened.  Reduce the heat to low.  Return the chicken to the skillet and turn it in the sauce.

Cut the gorgonzola into 4 pieces and place it on top of the chicken.  Cover the skillet and cook just until the cheese is slightly melted, 1 to 2 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder -- or to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  1               dash  ground cumin
     1/2                boneless skinless chicken breast -- cut 2" by 1/4" strip
                        = (abt 4 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil
     1/2         small  onion -- sliced
                        = (abt 1/4 cup)
     1/2        medium  red belt pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into 2" by 1/4" strips
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, chopped fine
  3                     flour tortillas - (6" or 7" dia)
                        = (white or whole wheat)

In a small bowl, combine the lime juice, chili powder, garlic, pepper, and cumin.  Add the chicken strips and toss; set aside for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion and peppers; cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the chicken mixture with juice; cook, stirring, until the chicken is tender and light brown and the vegetables are softened, 4 to 5 minutes.  Taste; adjust seasonings.

Meanwhile, place the tortillas between two paper towels.  Microwave on high until moist and warm, 15 to 20 seconds.  (Or, wrap them in aluminum foil and heat in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes while the vegetables and chicken are cooking.)

To serve, place the warm tortillas on a plate; cover to keep warm.  Spoon the chicken mixture bowl.  Assemble the fajitas as you eat by spooning some of the chicken mixture into the center third of the tortilla and rolling.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Variations: 
     ï To the chicken mixture, add coarsely chopped cilantro (fresh coriander). 
     ï Add chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce, chopped avocado, plain yogurt, lite sour cream, and/or shedded cheese when rolling tortillas. 
     ï For a nontraditional version, spread a layer of chevre (goat cheese) or crumble feta cheese on the tortilla before adding the chicken.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOMATO-SOY MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  low-sodium soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  tomato paste
     1/4      teaspoon  minced garlic
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === KABOBS ===
     1/2                boneless skinless chicken breast -- cut 1" squares
                        = (abt 4 oz)
                        Vegetable oil spray
     1/4           cup  fresh pineapple chunks
  6             slices  zucchini, 1/4" thick
                        === SPECIAL EQUiPMENT ===
  3                     eight-inch bamboo skewers
                        = (or one 14" metal skewer)

Soak bamboo skewers in water before threading on the ingredients to prevent them from burning and darkening under the broiler.

In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the marinade ingredients.  Pour half the marinade into the bottom of a shallow glass baking dish or a flat refrigerator container.  Place the chicken on top; pour on the remaining marinade.  Stir gently and cover.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or for as long as 24 hours, stirring occasionally.

Prior to cooking, place the oven broiler rack 4 to 5 inches from the heating element.  Preheat the broiler.

Lightly spray a baking sheet or broiler pan with vegetable oil spray.  Thread the chicken onto three bamboo skewers (reserving the remaining marinade), alternating with the pineapple and zucchini.  Place the skewers on the prepared pan.  Broil for 4 minutes, turn, and baste with the marinade.  Broil until the chicken is cooked through, about 2 more minutes.  Discard the marinade.  Place the skewers on a serving plate.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Per Serving:  238 calories (14% from fat);  34.6g protein;  15.8g carbohydrates; 3.8g fat;  87mg cholesterol;  676mg sodium;  29mg calcium.

Variations: 
     ï For the chicken, substitute about 4 ounces of a firm fish, such as swordfish. 
     ï As you thread the skewers, substitute or add mandarin orange segments, canned pineapple chunks, mushrooms, chunks of green or red bell pepper, onion slices, and/or cherry tomatoes. 
     ï Sprinkle the kabobs with sesame seeds before broiling.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     bacon slices -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/2" pieces
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              large  onion -- cut 1/2" dice
  2             medium  celery ribs -- cut 1/2" dice
                        = (abt 1 cup)
  1              large  carrot -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice - (abt 1 cup)
  3        tablespoons  flour
  3               cups  milk
  1 3/4           cups  chicken broth
     1/2         pound  white or small red potatoes -- scrubbed, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice - (abt 1 1/2 cups)
  2               cups  corn kernels -- fresh or
                        thawed frozen
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1               dash  cayenne
  1               dash  sugar
  2              large  chicken breast halves on the bone -- skin and excess fat
                        removed - (1 to 1 1/4 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives or parsley

In a 5- to 6-quart soup pot, cook the bacon in the olive oil over medium heat until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Add the butter to the same pot and melt over medium heat.  Add the onion, celery, and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, 6 to 8 minutes.

Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes without allowing to color.  Gradually stir in the milk.  Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, whisking until thickened and smooth.  Whisk in the chicken broth and reduce the heat to medium.  Add the potatoes and cook 10 minutes.

Stir in the corn, salt, pepper, cayenne, and sugar.  Add the chicken breasts and cook, partially covered, until white throughout, about 15 minutes.  Using tongs, remove the chicken to a clean work surface.  When cool enough to handle, pull the chicken meat off the bones and tear into bite-size pieces.  Discard the bones.

Return the bacon and chicken to the pot and cook until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.  Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.  Ladle the soup into warm bowls and sprinkle with the chives.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  If you have a big pot and a little time, this recipe can be easily doubled.  Youëll be sure to want leftovers, as this soup tastes even better reheated.

                          Country-Style Chicken

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     roasting chicken - (abt 4 lbs) -- free-range or
                        naturally raised
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  sweet butter
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  white onions -- very thinly sliced
     1/3           cup  dry vin santo
                        = (or dry oloroso sherry)
     1/4           cup  chicken stock -- if necessary
                        = (preferably homemade)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Pull the fat out of the chicken cavity.  Rinse the bird in cool water and dry well, inside and out, with paper towels.  Sprinkle the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper.

In a roasting pan large enough to hold the chicken, melt the butter in the olive oil over medium-low heat.  Add the onions, stir into the fat, and sweat gently, lowering the heat if necessary to keep the onions from browning.  Cook for about 20 minutes or until they are very soft.

Push the onions out to the sides of the pan and set the chicken in the middle.  Place in the preheated oven and roast for 30 minutes, basting every 10 minutes or so with the vin santo or sherry.  Then lower the heat to 325 degrees and continue roasting another 30 minutes, continuing to baste with the vin santo or with the juices in the pan.  If the pan juices reduce too much, baste with chicken stock or hot water.

The chicken is done when a leg moves loosely on its joint or when the juices run clear yellow when pricked with a fork.

Remove the chicken from the oven and set aside to rest for 10 minutes or so before carving.  If the pan juices are too liquid, boil them rapidly over high heat, taking care not to fry the onions.  The onions should be quite brown, but roasted rather than fried, and very soft.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Use a vin santo that is on the dry side for basting the fowl, or, lacking vin santo, use a dryish sherry.  Butter doesn't appear often in the Tuscan country kitchen; it was made, if at all, in the summertime after the calves had been weaned.  It lends extra richness to this dish but, if you prefer, it may be omitted.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/4      teaspoon  water
  1           teaspoon  olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  couscous
     3/4           cup  canned chick-peas -- drained, rinsed
                        = (reserve the liquid)
     1/2           cup  frozen peas -- thawed
  1             medium  carrot -- coarsely shredded
  1              small  tomato -- chopped
  1              small  sweet red or yellow pepper -- chopped
  2 1/2    tablespoons  currants
  2 1/2    tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh chives
  1 1/2    tablespoons  pistachio or pine nuts
  1 1/2    tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  dried marjoram
  1               dash  angostura bitters -- (optional)

In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring the water, salt, and 1 teaspoon of the oil to a boil.  Stir in the couscous.  Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand for 5 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed.  Fluff with a fork.

Transfer the couscous to a large bowl.  Add the chick-peas (without the liquid), peas, carrots, tomatoes, peppers, currants, chives, and nuts.  Toss gently until mixed.

In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, thyme, marjoram, bitters (if using), and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil.  Add 3 tablespoons of the reserved chick-pea liquid; discard the remaining chick-pea liquid.  Mix and pour over the salad.  Toss to mix well.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  boiling potatoes -- unpeeled, quartered
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh chives or parsley

Place the potatoes in a saucepan with lightly salted cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, until parboiled, no more than 5 minutes; they should be barely tender when pierced with a fork.  Drain well and set aside until cool enough to handle.  Shred the potatoes on the large holes of a box grater/shredder held over a mixing bowl.  Toss lightly with a little salt and pepper to taste.

On a nonstick griddle over medium heat, melt the butter with the vegetable oil.  When the butter melts and begins to foam, spread it and the oil evenly over the surface of the griddle and place the shredded potatoes on top.  With the back of a spatula, gently press down on the potatoes to form a compact, even mass 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick.  Do not be concerned if the edges are uneven.  Fry until the underside is browned and crusty, about 5 minutes.  Using the spatula, turn the cake over; you may turn the cake in sections if necessary.  Continue frying until browned and crusty on the second side, 4 to 5 minutes longer.

Transfer  the potatoes to a warmed serving platter or individual plates and garnish with chives or parsley.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Technically speaking, hash browns are diced.  But most restaurants actually make them with shredded potatoes, a technique used here.  The hash browns can also be cooked in a nonstick frying pan or formed into patties.  If you like, add some grated yellow onion with the salt and pepper.  For a glorious side dish, top the finished hash browns with shredded Cheddar cheese, sour cream, and a favorite fresh salsa.

                        Dried-Fruit Harvest Bread

Recipe By     :Mark Miller and Andrew MacLauchlan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  mixed dried fruit
                        = (such as cherries, raisins, apples,
                        pears, apricots, cranberries, figs,
                        prunes, dates, or papaya)
  1                cup  water
                        === DRY INGREDIENTS ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  whole-wheat flour
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
     1/2    tablespoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  canola oil or corn oil
  2                     eggs -- beaten
     1/4           cup  dark molasses
     1/2           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  2        tablespoons  bourbon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Chop the fruit into uniform pieces.

Heat the water in a large sautÈ pan or saucepan, add the dried fruit, and bring to a simmer.  Remove from the heat and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes, or until soft.

Combine the dry ingredients and sift into a mixing bowl.

In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the oil, eggs, molasses, brown sugar, bourbon, and vanilla.  Stir the dry ingredients into the egg mixture with a wooden spoon until combined.

Drain the softened dried fruit and stir it into the batter.

Lightly coat two 7- by 4- by 3-inch loaf pans with softened butter or oil, and lightly dust with all-purpose flour.

Evenly divide the batter between the two loaf pans.

Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick or paring knife comes out clean when inserted in the center.

Let the loaves cool in the pans for 15 minutes.

Turn the loaves out of the pans and serve warm or transfer to a rack to cool completely.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

Comments:  This rich, dark, and hearty bread is ideal for breakfast Christmas morning or during the holiday season.  It is not only a welcome change from yeast breads, it can be a pleasant reminder of the bounty of summer fruits in the middle of winter.  For this recipe, use 1 cup each of the four dried fruits of your choice.  Try to buy unsulphured dried fruit, available at natural food stores, as it has more flavor and none of the chemical preservatives and many people are allergic to sulphur.  This bread keeps, wrapped and refrigerated, for up to 2 weeks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     fresh red chilies
  1         tablespoon  sesame seed oil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 2") -- finely chopped
  4                     monkfish, swordfish, or cod steaks
  6             ounces  cherry tomatoes
  2                     star anise -- roughly broken
  2                     lemon grass stalks -- thinly sliced
                        Grated zest of 1 lemon
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1                cup  cream of coconut
  6             ounces  baby corn
  1                     small bunch scallions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh coriander -- to garnish

Cut the chilies open lengthwise under running water, discard the seeds and stems, and cut the flesh across into very thin strips.

Heat the sesame oil in a large casserole over a medium heat.  Add the garlic and ginger and stir for 1 minute.  Remove the casserole from the heat.  Place the fish steaks, cherry tomatoes, and the star anise in the casserole.  Sprinkle with the sliced chili, the lemon grass, and grated zest.

In a small bowl, mix the lemon juice and the cream of coconut together.  Add a teaspoon of salt, and pour this mixture into the casserole.  Put the casserole over a medium heat until the juices are just bubbling, then cover the dish and place in the center of a preheated oven, 325 degrees, for 40 to 50 minutes or until the fish is just cooked through.

Meanwhile, steam or boil the baby corn until they are cooked but still firm.  Trim the scallions, and chop them across into roughly 1/2-inch pieces, using as much of the green part as possible.

When the fish has cooked, add the corn and scallions to the casserole, cover again, and put the casserole back in the oven for only 5 minutes.  Season the juices if necessary.  Serve sprinkled with the coriander.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1              large  red ripe tomato -- finely chopped,
                        with its juices
  1              large  baking potato - (abt 1 lb)
  1              quart  water
                        = (or fish broth for a richer stew)
  3        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE SEAFOOD ===
  12                    littleneck clams -- scrubbed
  12                    mussels -- scrubbed, threads at
                        the hinge of the shell removed with
                        needlenose pliers
  12                    shrimp or prawns -- peeled, deveined
  1              pound  fish fillets
                        = (possibilities include snapper,
                        mahi-mahi, cod, bass, and swordfish)

Heat the olive oil in a large sautÈ pan (preferably nonstick).  Add the onion and cook over medium heat for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook until the onion and garlic are soft and translucent but not brown, about 2 minutes more.  Add the tomato and cook until soft, about 2 minutes.

Add the potatoes, the water, half the parsley, the bay leaf, the oregano, and salt and pepper and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium and gently simmer the potatoes, uncovered, until half-cooked, about 10 minutes.

Add the clams and mussels, cover the pan, and cook until the shells just begin to open, about 5 minutes.  Discard any clams and mussels that do not open.  Add the shrimp and fish and continue simmering until all the seafood is cooked and the potatoes are soft, about 3 minutes.

Correct the seasoning, adding salt and pepper to taste.  Remove and discard the bay leaf.  Serve fisherman's stew in shallow bowls, with extra bowls for holding the empty clam and mussel shells.  Garnish with the parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving:  350 calories;  36g protein;  8g fat (1g saturated fat);  33g carbohydrate;  95mg cholesterol;  174mg sodium.

Comments:  Here's a stunning fish stew for people who find making bouillabaisse too complicated and time-consuming.  Quile literally, you can make it from start to finish in 30 minutes.  You don't even need fish broth (although using it will make a tastier zuppa).  The more types of seafood you use, of course, the better the stew will be.  Feel free to use all or some of the seafoods called for above, or make substitutions, based on what's freshest and best in your area or at your fish market.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  cauliflower head
                        Sea salt
                        Freshly-grated nutmeg
  2              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  milk
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- for dusting
                        Olive oil -- for frying

Cut away and discard the stalk and green leaves of the cauliflower.  Cut the cauliflower in half and cut the florets away from the inner core.  Soak the florets in salted cold water for 15 minutes.

Place a steamer on the stove with several scrapings of nutmeg in the steaming water.  When it comes to a boil, drain the cauliflower and steam it, covered, for 10 minutes or until tender but firm.  Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process.  Drain the florets thoroughly and pat them dry.

Line a work surface with waxed paper.  Beat the eggs and milk together in a shallow bowl.  Next to it, line up the flour on a plate or piece of waxed paper.  Coat the florets with the egg mixture, letting the excess drip off, and dredge in flour.  Place on the waxed paper and set aside until ready to fry.

When all the florets are coated, pour about 1 inch oil into a 9-inch skillet over medium heat and heat until nearly smoking.  Pan-fry the cauliflower quickly at a high heat until a light golden color.  Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on brown paper or paper towels, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Cauliflower prepared in this way gains a remarkably sweet flavor and a texture similar to crab.  Fried cauliflower can be served as an accompaniment to grilled, baked, or fried fish.

                         Good Friday Sweet Bread

Recipe By     :Anne Bianchi and Sandra Lotti
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  fresh yeast
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1                cup  warm milk
  4               cups  bread flour
                        Vegetable oil -- for oiling
  4                     eggs -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  rose water or Vin Santo
  2               cups  unsalted butter -- room temperature
                        Unsalted butter -- for greasing
     1/2           cup  golden raisins -- soaked 2 hours in
  1                cup  Vin Santo -- and squeezed dry
  2        tablespoons  anise seeds
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten for wash

Two days before Easter:  Dissolve the yeast along with 1/2 teaspoon sugar in the warm milk.

Heap 2 cups flour onto a flat work surface and make a well in the center.  Pour the yeast-milk mixture into the center and, working with both hands, incorporate the flour a little at a time until a smooth elastic dough has formed.  Knead for 5 minutes to activate the yeast and the gluten.

Oil a large bowl, place the dough in it, cover with a cloth and let sit for 12 hours in a warm place.

One day before Easter:  Transfer the risen dough to a floured work surface, knead for 5 minutes, and set aside.

Heap the remaining 2 cups flour onto a flat work surface, make a well in the center and add the eggs, the remaining 1 cup sugar, rose water, and butter.  Using a fork, blend all the ingredients incorporating a little of the flour wall at a time until a ball of dough has formed.

Top with the risen dough and knead the two into one smooth elastic ball.  Place the dough in a large bowl, cover, and let sit until it has doubled its size, approximately 2 hours.  Grease a 12- by 15-inch baking sheet.

Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and add the raisins, anise seeds, and the grated lemon zest.  Knead for 10 minutes, then form a ball and using the blade of a knife, draw a cross in the center.

Place the bread on the center of the greased baking sheet, brush with the egg wash, and let sit for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Bake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean and dry, about 40 minutes.  Let cool on a rack.

Cut the cooled bread into thick wedges and serve.

To Make Ahead:  Wrapped tightly in plastic, the sweet bread will keep for up to 1 week.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

Comments:  The recipe's long preparation is justified by at least one person: Adua Manfredi of Torre del Lago, who says: "Yes, it takes two days, but then again, pasimata is a religious bread, so a little sacrifice is called for."

                        more for the pan
  3              large  egg yolks
  2 1/2           cups  flour - (heaping)
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  7             ounces  whole wheat
                        = (or 1 lb canned cooked wheat [called
                        gran pastiera])
  2 1/4           cups  milk
                        = (if using fresh whole wheat)
                        Minced zest of 1 lemon
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2          teaspoons  vanilla-flavored sugar
                        Minced zest of 1/2 orange
  10            ounces  ricotta cheese
  4              large  eggs -- separated
  1              small  wine glass orange-flower water
  5             ounces  candied citron peel -- finely chopped
  1                cup  superfine sugar
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

If using fresh grain, two days ahead soak it for 24 hours in several changes of water.  The next day, simmer the grain in the milk with the zest of half a lemon for 3 to 4 hours over very low heat.  When it is cooked (or if using canned), stir in a pinch of cinnamon, the vanilla sugar, and the remaining lemon zest and the orange zest.  Set aside overnight for the flavors to mingle.

Make the pastry:  In a large bowl, work together the sugar, butter, and the egg yolks until smooth, then add the flour and gradually incorporate to make a smooth pastry.  Set aside in a cool place for 1 hour or more.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease a 14-inch flan pan with butter.

Finish the filling:  Beat the ricotta with the egg yolks and the orange-flower water.  Add the candied peel and the flavored grain to the mixture.  Beat the egg whites together with the sugar until stiff and fold them very gently into the mixture.

Roll out two-thirds of the pastry and and use to line the flan pan, covering the bottom and sides with an equal thickness.  Pour in the filling.  Roll out the remaining pastry and cut it into long strips and form a lattice top for the tart.  Bake for about 45 minutes until light golden.  Allow to cool and then dust with confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields 10 servings or more.

Comments:  This Pastiera Di Grano is very much an Easter cake, made with grains of wheat -- symbol of wealth and prosperity -- and in large quantities, as the cakes are given as presents to friends.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     center-cut boneless pork loin - -- (2 1/2 lbs)
                        Salt -- as needed
  6                     medium-small new potatoes -- peeled, halved
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano -- sticks removed,
                        crushed until powdery
  6                     fresh basil leaves
  6                     bacon slices or 3 pancetta slices -- cut into strips
  1                     yellow onion -- sliced medium-thin

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Rinse the pork under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels.  Salt the pork on all sides.  Transfer to a roasting pan and add the potatoes.  Pour water into the pan to a depth of 2 inches.  Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, the oregano, and the basil to the water, and stir.  Arrange the bacon strips or pancetta over the pork.

Roast the pork until it is browned on top, about 30 minutes. Turn the pork over, then arrange the onion slices around it.  Continue roasting until the pork is well-browned, about 45 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 160 degrees.

During roasting, check the water level from time to time.  If the water is evaporating too quickly, add 1 or 2 more cups water, or as necessary.  Every 20 minutes, taste the pan gravy and adjust all the seasonings as necessary.

Transfer the roast to a platter and surround with the potatoes and pan gravy.  Allow to stand for 10 minutes before slicing.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                 Grapefruit, Black Olive, And Mint Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  grapefruits
                        = (preferably pink or Ruby Red)
  1                cup  fresh mint leaves -- stems removed
     1/2           cup  sliced black olives
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Several leaves of butter lettuce
                        = (or Iceberg lettuce)

Using a small, sharp knife, cut a slice off the top and the bottom of each grapefruit, cutting deeply enough to expose the fruit.  Then, place each grapefruit upright on a cutting board and thickly slice off the peel in strips, removing all of the white pith and exposing the flesh all around.

Working over a sieve set in a large bowl, and using a small, sharp knife, remove the grapefruit sections by cutting them away from the membrane, first on one side of each section and then on the other.  Let the whole sections fall into the sieve.  Remove any seeds and discard.

Pour off any juice in the bowl and reserve for another use (it makes a refreshing drink).  In the bowl, combine the grapefruit sections, mint leaves, olives, olive oil, lemon juice, and salt.  Toss gently to combine, taking care not to break the grapefruit sections.

To serve, line a platter or individual plates with the lettuce leaves and spoon the grapefruit mixture on top.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Per Serving:  122 calories;  1g protein;  9g total fat (1g saturated fat);  11g carbohydrates;  1g dietary fiber;  0mg cholesterol;  290mg sodium

Comments:  The idea for this unusual salad comes from cookbook author Marion Cunningham.  If you can't envision the unlikely combination, you're in for a treat.  It complements a main course of fish or chicken.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             slices  prosciutto -- fat included
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  2          teaspoons  fresh rosemary leaves
                        = (or 1 tspn dried rosemary)
  2          teaspoons  fresh oregano
                        = (or 1 tspn dried oregano)
  2             sprigs  fresh parsley - (to 3)
     1/4           cup  fresh mint leaves
  6        tablespoons  wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  water
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1                     leg of lamb - (5 to 6 lbs) -- trimmed of fat
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - ( to 3)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste, optional
     3/4           cup  fresh plain bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  finely-minced fresh parsley

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

In a food processor, chop the prosciutto, garlic, rosemary, oregano, and parsley.  Process until finely chopped.  Remove from the bowl and set aside.

In the same food processor, combine the mint leaves, vinegar, water, and sugar.  Process until the mint is finely chopped.  Remove from the bowl and set aside.

Pierce several holes in the leg of the lamb and lard the meat by inserting the chopped prosciutto mixture into the holes.

Pour the oil into a baking pan.  Roll the leg of lamb in it so that the meat is evenly coated with the oil.  Grind a good amount of pepper over and pour 3/4 cup water into the bottom of the pan.  Roast 20 minutes to seal in the juices.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees.  Season with salt, if used, and roast until the meat is almost done, about 2 hours longer.  Baste once in a while with the pan juices.

Combine the bread crumbs and the minced parsley with the mint and vinegar mixture.  Spread this mixture on a large platter or cookie sheet.  Using rubber gloves or a kitchen towel grab the lamb by the bone and roll the leg in the bread-crumb mixture.  Make sure the lamb is evenly coated, if not, pat some of the mixture on the bare spots.  Return the lamb to the oven and continue roasting 10 to 15 minutes longer, or until the lamb is cooked as desired and the crust is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes longer.  Baste once or twice.  Cool 15 minutes before carving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

<DirT>
In a food processor, chop the prosciutto, garlic, rosemary, oregano, and parsley.  Process until finely chopped.  Remove from the bowl and set aside.

In the same food processor, combine the mint leaves, vinegar, water, and sugar.  Process until the mint is finely chopped.  Remove from the bowl and set aside.

<DirT>
Pierce several holes in the leg of the lamb and lard the meat by inserting the chopped prosciutto mixture into the holes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the oil into a baking pan.  Roll the leg of lamb in it so that the meat is evenly coated with the oil.  Grind a good amount of pepper over and pour 3/4 cup water into the bottom of the pan.  Roast 20 minutes to seal in the juices.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees.  Season with salt, if used, and roast until the meat is almost done, about 2 hours longer.  Baste once in a while with the pan juices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the bread crumbs and the minced parsley with the mint and vinegar mixture.  Spread this mixture on a large platter or cookie sheet.  Using rubber gloves or a kitchen towel grab the lamb by the bone and roll the leg in the bread-crumb mixture.  Make sure the lamb is evenly coated, if not, pat some of the mixture on the bare spots.  Return the lamb to the oven and continue roasting 10 to 15 minutes longer, or until the lamb is cooked as desired and the crust is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes longer.  Baste once or twice.  Cool 15 minutes before carving.

         Leek And Red Onion Cobbler With Potato And Cheese Pastry

Recipe By     :Josceline Dimbleby
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ===  FILLING ===
  2             pounds  leeks
  2              large  red onions
     1/4         stick  butter
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  caraway seeds
  4            pinches  chili powder - (to 5)
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        ===  PASTRY TOP ===
  12            ounces  potatoes
  1 1/2           cups  self-rising flour
  1           teaspoon  salt - (rounded)
  3             ounces  strong-flavored grated cheese
  1 1/4         sticks  butter
  1                     egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  grated Parmesan cheese

To make the filling, trim the leeks and cut into 1-inch pieces, using as much of the green part as possible.  Peel the onions and chop into roughly 1-inch pieces.

Melt the butter with the olive oil in a large, deep skillet.  Add the sliced leeks and onions and caraway seeds.  Cook over a medium heat, stirring fairly often, until the leeks and onion have softened.  Season the mixture to taste with the chili powder, and sea salt.  Turn the filling into a large, shallow ovenproof dish.  Leave the filling on one side to cool.  Mean while, make the pastry.

For the pastry, peel the potatoes.  Steam or boil the potatoes until they are soft.  Mash them in a bowl until they are as smooth as possible.  Leave the mashed potatoes until cold.

Sift together the flour and salt in another bowl.  Stir in the grated cheese.  Then add the butter, cut into small pieces, and rub with your fingertips until the mixture resembles rough breadcrumbs.  Work in the cold mashed potato with your hands and knead the mixture to make a smooth dough.  If you are not using the dough immediately, form it into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate.

When the leek mixture is cold, roll the pastry out to about 1/4-inch thickness on a floured board.  Using a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter, cut the pastry into circles, re-rolling the scraps.  Arrange the circles overlapping on top of the leek mixture.  Then refrigerate the dish until you are ready to cook.

To cook, brush the pastry circles with egg yolk and then sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese.  Bake the cobbler in the center of a preheated oven, 400 degrees, for 25 to 30 minutes, until the pastry has turned a rich golden brown.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  As an alternative to leeks, you can use bulb fennel.

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan over very low heat, combine butter and oil.  Add onion, cover, and cook, stirring often, until onion caramelizes, about 1 hour.

Stir vermouth, thyme, salt, and pepper into onion mixture.  Cover and cook for 5 minutes.  Keep warm over very low heat.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Cook shells until tender but still firm to the bite, about 12 to 15 minutes.  Drain thoroughly.

Toss pasta with sauce.  Serve in heated soup plates and sprinkle with Parmesan.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  You can make this just as it is, or add a bit of crisp smoked bacon or ham and some peas.  This sauce is best with a pasta that gives the sauce little "cups" in which to nestle.

Categories    : Condiments                      Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             medium  mangos
  3        tablespoons  vinegar
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh ginger
  1               dash  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  white wine
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1                     whole clove

To prepare the mangos:  Peel and pit the mangos.  PurÈe the pulp in a food processor fitted with a stainless-steel blade.  Add the remaining ingredients and pulse together.

To make the ketchup:  In a heavy-sided saucepan, cook the mixture over a low heat for 1 hour, until well reduced and thickened.  Remove from the heat and cool.  Strain through a fine sieve.  Let set refrigerated for 24 hours.  Now it is ready for use.

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

Comments:  You can make this condiment in large batches because it keeps so well refrigerated, even though it never stays too long.  Use it on fish, seafood, chicken, and roasted vegetables.

                            Marinated Zucchini

Recipe By     :Antonio and Priscilla Carluccio
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4         pounds  young zucchini -- sliced 1/2" thick
                        Olive oil -- for frying
  2        tablespoons  mint leaves
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, cut in half
                        Salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar -- or more to taste

Fry the zucchini slices in abundant hot oil until browned on both sides (not too dark).  The zucchini have to float freely in the oil; if necessary, fry them in batches.  Drain in a sieve to get rid of excess oil and then put them in a porcelain dish.

When all the zucchini have been fried, add the mint leaves and the garlic (which is only to flavor the zucchini and should be discarded before eating).  Season with salt to taste and stir in at least 2 tablespoons of vinegar, more if desired.  Leave to marinate for at least 2 hours.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a delightful little accompaniment for broiled lamb or pork, or to eat as part of an antipasto.

                             Neapolitan Pizza

Recipe By     :Arthur Schwartz
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           envelope  dried yeast - (2 1/2 tspns)
  1                cup  warm water
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  warm water

In a 2-cup glass measure, with a table fork, dissolve the yeast in the 1 cup of warm water.  Stir in 1/2 cup of the flour, cover with a clean dish towel, and let it stand until the mixture foams up to about double -- to 2 cups -- about 30 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of the flour with the salt.  Stir in the yeast mixture and the remaining 1/2 cup of warm water.  Stir until the dough masses together.  Gather the dough into a ball and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface.  Knead, folding and turning the dough onto itself, then pushing it away from you with the heel of your hand, about 10 to 12 minutes, adding, little by little, just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking.  Be careful not to add too much flour or too much at one time.  When you have fmished, the dough should not stick to the board; it should be smooth, silken, slightly damp on the surface, and very elastic.  Dust the dough lightly all over with flour and place in a bowl to rise, covered with a clean dish towel, for about 1 hour, or until it has slightly more than doubled in bulk.

While the dough is rising, and at least 30 minutes before baking, place an oven rack on the lowest level, preferably holding a pizza stone, and preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Punch down the dough and divide into 4 parts.  Alternately, if you intend to use only a portion of the dough immediately, form each fourth into a smooth ball and let those to be used immediately rise on a floured board, a couple of inches apart, covered with a dish towel.  Refrigerate or freeze the remaining balls in plastic bags.

To form the dough into a pizza, flatten the ball of dough into a thick disk.  On a lightly floured board, rotating the disk as you go, flatten the center of the pizza with your fingertips or heel of your hand.  When a ridge of dough starts appearing on the perimeter of the disk, lift the dough up with both hands, and holding on to the ridge, let gravity and the weight of the dough stretch the circle.  Keep turning the dough to get a relatively even 10-inch circle.  Keep pulling the ridge slightly so the circle gets larger.  Be careful not to make the center too thin or the ridge more than 1/2-inch deep.  At some point the pizza will become too flimsy to handle.  Now spread the formed pizza dough onto a large baking sheet or wooden peel that has been lightly dusted with flour.

Top as desired using either recipe, Pizza Alla Marinara or Pizza Margherita.

Bake for 6 to 8 minutes depending on your oven and on how well done you like pizza.  The edge should be tinged with brown.

Note:  Simple herb and olive oil toppings require less cooking time than tomato or other heavier, moister toppings.

This recipe yields four 9- to 10-inch pizza crusts.

Comments:  You can't make the best pizza at home, but you can make very, very good pizza, and whatever it may objectively lack is made up for by the pleasure and satisfaction of producing it yourself.  It's easy, but it takes practice, particularly the stretching of the dough.  At first, you won't be able to make an even circle.  After a while, you may still form only amoeba-shaped pies.  It doesn't matter.  What counts is the taste of the dough and the finesse of the topping.  Neapolitans don't burden their pizzas with heavy toppings.  For a pizza Margherita (see recipe), still the most popular, the tomatoes are barely cooked, if cooked at all; the mozzarella is applied sparingly, and there's no more than a torn leaf or two of basil.  Pizza Alla Marinara (see recipe), the simplest and oldest type, is topped by only crushed tomatoes, a drizzle of olive oil, a light scattering of chopped garlic, and a couple of pinches of oregano.  Above is the basic dough for any pizza you make.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE MARINADE ===
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  Chinese plum sauce
  1              small  serrano chile -- seeded, minced
                        = (or 1/4 tspn cayenne chile powder)
                        === FOR THE STEAKS ===
  2                     boneless strip sirloin steaks - -- (abt 10 oz ea)
                        === FOR THE SESAME-GINGER DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  unseasoned rice vinegar
     1/3           cup  julienned pickled ginger
     1/4           cup  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
                        === FOR THE SALAD ===
  1              small  Bibb or butter lettuce head -- leaves separated
                        = (or mizuna lettuce)
  1              bunch  watercress -- stemmed
  1                     red onion -- julienned
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, julienned
  1                cup  bean sprouts
  2                     scallions -- sliced on a diagonal
  1                     cucumber -- peeled, seeded,
                        and sliced on a diagonal
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds -- for garnish

Thoroughly combine all the marinade ingredients in a large dish.

Turn the steaks in the marinade and cover the dish with plastic wrap.  Marinate at room temperature for at least 1 hour, turning the steaks once.  Or, alternatively, refrigerate overnight (in which case, bring to room temperature before sautÈing).

To prepare the dressing, whisk together all the ingredients in a mixing bowl until emulsified.  Set aside.

Remove the steaks from the marinade and pat dry.  Heat a dry, heavy sautÈ pan or skillet and sear the steaks over medium-high heat for about 4 minutes per side, until just medium-rare.  Remove the steaks from the pan and let rest.

Toss all the salad ingredients together with the dressing in a large mixing bowl.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The plum sauce in the marinade (also called duck sauce) is a sweet-and-sour Chinese condiment made with plums and apricots that, like the pickled ginger in the dressing, is available in most supermarket Asian food sections.

Thoroughly combine all the marinade ingredients in a large dish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn the steaks in the marinade and cover the dish with plastic wrap.  Marinate at room temperature for at least 1 hour, turning the steaks once.  Or, alternatively, refrigerate overnight (in which case, bring to room temperature before sautÈing).
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the dressing, whisk together all the ingredients in a mixing bowl until emulsified.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the steaks from the marinade and pat dry.  Heat a dry, heavy sautÈ pan or skillet and sear the steaks over medium-high heat for about 4 minutes per side, until just medium-rare.  Remove the steaks from the pan and let rest.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Toss all the salad ingredients together with the dressing in a large mixing bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The plum sauce in the marinade (also called duck sauce) is a sweet-and-sour Chinese condiment made with plums and apricots that, like the pickled ginger in the dressing, is available in most supermarket Asian food sections.

          Pasta, Tofu, Pork, And Chinese Cabbage In Ginger Broth

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  canned low-sodium chicken broth
                        = (or homemade stock)
  6        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  rice-wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  mirin
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  Asian sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4         pound  spaghettini
     3/4         pound  Chinese cabbage -- cut 2" pieces
     1/2         pound  firm tofu -- cut 3/4" cubes
     1/3         pound  pork loin chop -- cut into 1/8" slices
                        about 1/2" wide and 1 1/2" long
  3                     scallions, including green tops -- sliced

In a medium stainless-steel saucepan, combine the broth, soy sauce, vinegar, mirin, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, sugar, and salt.  Bring just to a simmer, stirring occasionally.

In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the spaghettini until almost done, about 8 minutes.  Drain.  Return the pasta to the pot.

Add the hot ginger broth to the pasta along with the cabbage and tofu.  Bring back to a simmer and cook for 1 minute.  Add the pork and scallions.  Remove from heat and let sit until the pork is just done, about 1 minute.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Serve this Asian pasta in a bowl with a spoon as well as a fork so that you can get all the flavorful broth.  We use spaghettini here, but if you have dried Chinese egg noodles, use them.

Mirin Substitute:  In place of mirin, a sweet low-alcohol Japanese cooking wine, you can use 3 tablespoons sweet sherry, or 3 tablespoons dry sherry plus 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  mixed dried herbs
                        = (use any combination of dried rosemary,
                        thyme, basil, savory, chives, oregano,
                        and mint that you like)
  3 1/2         ounces  sliced Italian pancetta -- cut into strips
                        = (if not available, use blanched bacon)
  6                     eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  washed mixed salad greens -- torn bite size
  3        tablespoons  Pontormo Dressing -- (see recipe)

Place the olive oil, herbs, and pancetta in a large skillet and cook over medium heat.  When the pancetta is transparent, after 5 to 7 minutes, beat together the eggs, salt, and pepper and scramble them in the pan.  They shouldn't be too dry.  If you see they are drying, take them off the heat and continue stirring.

Dress the greens with the Pontormo dressing and mix with the eggs.  Serve immediately.  (If you want a bit of crunch, croutons are a nice touch.)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Pontormo was a reclusive sixteenth century painter who lived in Florence.  He and Il Rosso Fiorentino are credited with being the first artists to break away from the High Renaissance.  Pontormo and Rosso were great gourmands.  This dish, a warm salad of eggs mixed with greens, was one of Pontormo's favorites.

                      Puree Of Broccoli With Garlic

Recipe By     :Jacques Pepin
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  broccoli with very tight heads - -- (1 3/4 lbs)
  1                cup  water
  1             medium  potato - (abt 9 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  virgin olive oil

Separate the broccoli into stalks.  Using a vegetable peeler, remove the fibrous outer layer from the stems.  Cut the stalks (including the florets) into 2-inch lengths.

Place the broccoli in a large saucepan with the water, potatoes, garlic, and salt.  Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat to low, and boil gently for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.  (You should have about 1/2 cup of liquid remaining.)

Place the contents of the saucepan in the bowl of a food processor and add the butter and oil.  Process the mixture for about 45 seconds, until it is very smooth.  Transfer the purÈe to a serving bowl and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving:  87 calories;  1.9g fat (18% of calories);  0.6g saturated fat;  2mg cholesterol;  392mg sodium.

Comments:  The combined flavors of broccoli and garlic make this appealing purÈe a perfect accompaniment for plain roast meat and poultry.  Potato serves as thickening agent here, and a little butter and oil are added at the end as a flavor enhancer.

                      Ricotta With Cocoa And Brandy

Recipe By     :Viana La Place
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  whole-milk ricotta
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  dark cocoa -- plus
                        extra for sifting over top
  3        tablespoons  brandy
     1/4           cup  unpeeled almonds -- toasted, and
                        coarsely chopped (see Note)
                        Powdered sugar -- as needed

Note:  To toast the nuts, spread on a baking sheet and toast in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes.

To remove the lumps in the ricotta, use a spatula to push it through a fine-mesh sieve, repeating the process a second time if desired.  Alternatively, whirl the ricotta in a blender or food processor until smooth.

In a bowl, combine the ricotta with the sugar, cocoa, and brandy, and stir well to combine.  Refrigerate until needed.

To serve, spoon the mixture into small ice cream goblets (like the little metal ones available in restaurant-supply stores) or small soufflÈ cups.  Dust with cocoa powder, sprinkle the top with toasted almonds, then dust with powdered sugar.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Not too rich but wonderfully cream tasting, ricotta requires just minimal flavoring to become the best of desserts.  Use Dutch-process cocoa, with its dark color and pronounced bittersweet taste.  Add a little brandy for kick, toasted nuts for crunch, and that's all you need.

                   Rigatoni With A Thick Mushroom Sauce

Recipe By     :Carol Field
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh mushrooms
                        = (preferably brown, cremini, or
                        portobello mushrooms)
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 5)
  2                     garlic cloves -- cut in half
     1/8      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth
     1/2                chicken bouillon cube
  1 1/2    tablespoons  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Salt -- to taste (optional)
  4             quarts  water - (at least)
  1         tablespoon  coarse sea salt
  1              pound  short tubular pasta
                        = (such as mezze maniche or rigatoni
                        Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- for tossing

Clean the mushrooms with a moist paper towel or mushroom brush.  Put the butter and oil in a large, heavy sautÈ pan and using the largest holes in the grater, grate the mushrooms directly into it.  Add the garlic cloves and red pepper flakes and turn the heat to medium.  SautÈ until the mushroom liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes.  Add the chicken broth and the bouillon cube, which intensifies flavor and may also eliminate the need for salt, and cook over high heat for 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove from the heat, discard the garlic cloves, if you wish, add the parsley, and set aside while the pasta finishes cooking.  Taste for salt.

While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot with at least 4 quarts of water to a rolling boil and add the coarse sea salt and the pasta.  Cook according to the manufacturer's instructions, until al dente.  Drain the pasta well and toss it into the pan with the sauce.  Mix the pasta and sauce together over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat, stir well one final time, and finish by tossing with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Andreina Pavani Calcagni dreamed up this pasta sauce and should be acclaimed!  The secret lies in finding the right mushrooms.  Be sure to get brown (not cultivated white button) mushrooms.  They are known by various names: cremini, Italian mushrooms, golden mushrooms, or portobellos, which are simply brown mushrooms grown to maturity until their caps have opened to reveal chocolate-brown gills.  Grating the mushrooms concentrates their taste and brings out their intense, deeply woody flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lemon
  1                     roasting chicken - (abt 5 lbs)
                        Grated zest of 1 lemon -- then the
                        lemon cut into quarters
                        Grated zest of 1 orange -- then the
                        orange cut into quarters
  3        tablespoons  grated peeled fresh ginger root
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5        tablespoons  margarine -- melted,
                        = (or olive oil)
  4        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2           cup  fresh orange juice
  3        tablespoons  honey
                        Orange sections -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cut the lemon into quarters.  Rub the outside of the chicken with one of the lemon quarters, then discard.

In a small bowl, stir together the lemon and orange zests and 1 tablespoon of the grated ginger.  Rub this mixture evenly in the cavity.  Put the lemon and orange quarters inside the bird.

Place the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan.  Sprinkle it with salt and pepper.  In the now-empty small bowl, combine the melted margarine or olive oil, lemon and orange juices, honey, and the remaining 2 tablespoons ginger.  Mix well.

Place the chicken in the oven and roast, basting with the citrus juice mixture at least 4 times during cooking, until the juices run clear when the thigh is pierced with a knife, about 1 hour.

Transfer to a serving platter and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.  Carve the chicken.  Garnish with orange sections.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variation:  Use 4 tablespoons pomegranate juice in place of the lemon juice.

Comments:  Ginger arrived in Italy with Arabic traders or North African Jewish immigrants, so it's likely that this is a Sicilian or Livornese recipe.  Most Italians would use ground ginger, but since fresh, ginger is so plentiful at our markets, why not use it?

                   Roasted Olives With Fennel And Lemon

Recipe By     :Michele Scicolone
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  imported black olives
                        = (such as Alfonso or Gaeta)
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/2                lemon -- scrubbed, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  fennel seed
  1              pinch  crushed red pepper

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Spread the olives, garlic, and lemon slices in an 8-inch baking pan.  Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with fennel seeds and red pepper.  Bake for 45 minutes, stirring the olives 2 or 3 times.

Transfer the olives to a serving bowl arid serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

To Make Ahead:  These olives keep well, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Comments:  Roasting black olives emphasizes their flavor and makes them taste almost chocolatey.  Choose plump, meaty, not-too-salty olives like Alfonsos or Gaetas and serve them warm with crusty Italian or French bread.  The leftover oil is sensational when used as a dip for good bread, or drizzle it over mixed salad greens.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  4              large  eggs -- separated
  3                     egg whites -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  finely-grated orange zest
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon Juice

                          Sausage With Potatoes

Recipe By     :Vincent Schiavelli
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  potatoes
                        = (russet, Yukon Gold, or Yellow Finn)
  3                     bell peppers -- assorted colors
  1             medium  onion
  2 1/2         pounds  thin or thick sweet (mild) Italian sausage -- preferably in a
                        coil rather than links
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  dry red wine
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Peel the potatoes and cut them into strips about 3 inches long and 1/2-inch thick.  Put them in a bowl with just enough cold water to cover and set them aside to soak.

Seed the peppers and cut them into pieces about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide.  Peel the onion, slice it fairly thin, and separate into rings.

Arrange the sausage in a coil in the center of a large roasting pan.  Drain the potatoes and place them on either side of the sausage.  Arrange the peppers and onion rings on top of the potatoes.  Drizzle the olive oil over the vegetables.  Season with salt and black pepper.

Roast for 20 minutes, then pour the wine over the sausage and vegetables.  Turn the vegetables.  Using a metal spatula, carefully loosen any potatoes that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan.  Roast for 20 to 40 minutes more, depending on the thickness of the sausage, or until the sausage and potatoes are cooked through.  Sprinkle with oregano and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This recipe for Italian sausage brings out its hearty, rustic goodness.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  red onion -- thinly sliced
  2              large  lemons -- halved lengthwise,
                        seeded, and sliced 1/4"-thick half-moons
  2               cups  red wine vinegar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  salt
  16             large  sea scallops - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  baby spinach leaves -- rinsed, spun dry
  10       tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat the grill or broiler.  Soak 4 bamboo skewers in water.

In a large mixing bowl, stir together the onion, lemons, 2 cups vinegar, the water, sugar, and salt until well mixed and let stand 1 hour.

On each of the skewers, thread 4 scallops alternately with the marinated lemon pieces,  beginning and ending with lemon pieces.  Season with salt and pepper and grill until just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.

While the scallops cook, toss the baby spinach in a mixing bowl with 6 tablespoons of the olive oil and the remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar and mix until evenly coated.  Divide the spinach among 4 plates.

Strain the onions and place in 4 small piles around the rim of each plate.  Place a scallop skewer over the spinach on each pile.  Drizzle each with 1 tablespoon of the remaining olive oil and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  When these skewers are offered as an occasional entrÈe special at Po, they air quite popular  The trick to buying scallops is to make sure they are hand harvested and have not been treated with tripolyphosphate, a preservative used to extend their freshness that causes them to swell with water and become flaccid and heinous.

                   Spaghetti With Garlicky Bread Crumbs

Recipe By     :Nancie McDermott
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  spaghetti
  3              large  garlic cloves
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  Italian seasoned bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling, salted water until tender, 8 to 9 minutes.  Drain, but leave some water clinging to the pasta.

Meanwhile, chop the garlic.  In a large frying pan, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the bread crumbs and cook, stirring often, until the crumbs are golden and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.  Transfer to a small bowl, leaving most of the oil in the pan.

Add the garlic to the frying pan and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.  Stir in the parsley, salt, and pepper and remove from heat.

Add the pasta to the frying pan and toss.  Add the bread crumbs and toss well.  Adjust seasonings and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Use ready-made bread crumbs for the utmost speed, but if you have a few spare minutes and a loaf of excellent bread left over, recycle it into a supply for your pantry.  Toast bread slices until quite dry, crush or grate them into crumbs and store airtight in a glass jar.

                   Spaghetti With Uncooked Tomato Sauce

Recipe By     :Sophia Loren
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  spaghetti
  2             pounds  not quite ripe tomatoes -- chopped
     1/2         pound  fresh mozzarella -- thinly sliced
  2             medium  red or Vidalia onions - (or less) -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  pitted Sicilian green olives -- roughly chopped
  2        tablespoons  drained capers
     1/4           cup  minced Italian parsley
  10                    fresh oregano leaves - (to 12) -- chopped
                        = (or 1/4 tspn dried oregano)
  1                     garlic clove - (to 2) -- crushed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Freshly-grated Parmigiano cheese -- (optional)

Cook the pasta until just at dente.  While the pasta is cooking, place in a large serving bowl the tomatoes, mozzarella, onions, olives, capers, parsley, oregano, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste.  Pour the oil over and toss gently.

When the pasta is ready, pour it into a colander and quickly rinse it under cold water; drain well and add the warm spaghetti to the bowl.  Toss to combine, remove the garlic if desired, and serve.  Pass the cheese at the table.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Cool and refreshing, this is excellent summer fare, especially with a chilled light white wine.  You can top the spaghetti with grated Parmigiano, but it isn't essential.

Recipe By     :Nicola Hill
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed
                        = (or 1 lb fresh spinach)
  1           teaspoon  butter
  4                     eggs -- separated
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
                        Oakleaf or salad bowl lettuce -- for garnish
                        === FILLING ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1 1/2           cups  sliced medium mushrooms
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  milk
  1              pinch  nutmeg

Line a 12- by 8-inch jelly-roll pan with nonstick parchment and then oil lightly, or make a case of the same measurements with aluminum foil.

Place the spinach in a saucepan with the teaspoon of butter and cook until completely softened.  Drain the spinach well, chop if fresh, and place in a large bowl.  Add the egg yolks, beating them well into the chopped spinach and season to taste.

Whisk the egg whites in a large grease-free bowl until just holding their shape.  Using a metal spoon, quickly fold them into the spinach mixture.  Spoon the mixture into the prepared jelly-roll pan, sprinkle the grated Parmesan over the surface, and bake in a preheated oven, 400 degrees, for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Filling.  Heat the butter in a small saucepan.  Add the sliced mushrooms and cook gently until softened.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for an additional 1 minute.  Slowly stir in the milk and cook the sauce until thickened.  Stir in the nutmeg and seasoning to taste.

Remove the spinach roulade from the oven and invert onto a sheet of waxed paper.  Quickly spread the mushroom filling over the surface and gently roll the roulade up.  Cut into thick slices and serve immediately with a lettuce garnish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

           Spring Potato And Watercress Salad With Horseradish

Recipe By     :Michele Scicolone
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  small waxy potatoes -- scrubbed
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh horseradish
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  watercress bunch -- tough stems removed
                        = (abt 4 cups)

Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan with cold water to cover and salt.  Bring to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife, about 20 minutes.  Drain and slice thin.

In a bowl, whisk together the yogurt, olive oil, horseradish, salt, and pepper until smooth and well blended.

Pour half the dressing over the potatoes and mix well.  Add the watercress and drizle with the remaining dressing.  Toss gently and serve.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Theo Schoennegger, the chef at New York's fashionable San Domenico Restaurant, prepares this tangy potato salad, which is from his home region of Alto Adige.  The yogurt and olive oil blend surprisingly well in this recipe, which goes well with cold ham or chicken, poached salmon, or grilled leg of lamb.

In a small frying pan over medium heat, gently toast the almonds in a teaspoon of the olive oil until they are golden brown.  Remove the almonds to a cutting board and chop them as fine as you can.  In the oil remaining in the pan (adding a little more if necessary), toast the bread crumbs until they are golden brown and very crisp.  Combine the bread crumbs with the almonds in a small bowl.

Add 2 tablespoons of oil to the frying pan.  Over medium-low heat, stir in the anchovies and crush into the oil with a fork.  Mix the anchovies and oil with the bread crumbs, add lots of black pepper, and set aside.  Add the remaining oil to the frying pan and gently sweat the garlic and onion over medium-low heat until they are soft but not brown.  Add the tomato sauce and cook for about 3 or 4 minutes, or just long enough to mix the flavors.  Add the basil and set aside.

Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil, drop in the pasta, and cook until al dente -- about 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain and dress with the tomato sauce and half the bread crumb mixture.  Sprinkle the remaining crumb mixture over the top and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  An old tradition links the feast of San Giuseppe (St. Joseph) on March 19 with mid-Lenten festivals, a brief but joyful holiday, reminding us that we're halfway to Easter but still within the constraints of the Lenten fast.  Pino Marchese, who spent his childhood in Bari's old town, says they used to make big bonfires (falo) for San Giuseppe in the main piazzas of the old town, using discarded furniture, broken-up chairs, even the heavy wooden gates that swung back to admit people to the family courtyard.  Of course, no one very much observes the Lenten fast these days, but San Giuseppe continues to be celebrated in Bari with this dish.

Lasagnette are not like what we call lasagna pasta.  Rather they are inch-wide strips of curly-edged ribbon pasta, but similar shapes will also do.  If you can't find anything similar, use the widest tagliatelle or fettuccine available.

                           Sweet And Sour Tuna

Recipe By     :Francesca Romina
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  tuna fillets, abt 3/4" thick
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  yellow onion -- sliced
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sugar - (heaping)
  3        tablespoons  tawny Port or sweet Marsala wine
  10                    Sicilian green olives -- pitted, and
                        cut into strips

Dredge the tuna in the flour, shaking off the excess.  In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and sautÈ until translucent, about 5 minutes.

Push the onion slices to one side of the pan.  Add the tuna and cook, turning once, until the fish flakes when tested with a fork, about 3 minutes on each side.  Stir in the vinegar, sugar, wine, and olives.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.  Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow the tuna to stand for 10 minutes to absorb the pan juices,  then serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This dish is one of Sicily's oldest recipes.  Serve the tuna with your favorite salad, cheese, bread, and a full-bodied wine.

If the orange juice adds too strong of an orange taste for your liking, simply replace part or all of the juice with milk or water.  These taste good spread with a little peanut butter to boost protein and add satiety.

If the orange juice adds too strong of an orange taste for your liking, simply replace part or all of the juice with milk or water.  These taste good spread with a little peanut butter to boost protein and add satiety.

Recipe By     :Nancy Harmon Jenkins
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     garlic cloves - (to 3) -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3 1/3         pounds  fresh ripe tomatoes -- cut in chunks
                        = (or 28-oz can whole tomatoes, with
                        juice, chopped)
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        = (omit if using canned tomatoes)
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar

In a heavy nonreactive saucepan over medium-low heat, sweat the garlic in the oil until it begins to soften, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, salt if you wish, and sugar, raise the heat slightly, and cook rapidly, stirring frequently, while the tomatoes give off their juice and cook down to a thick mass -- 15 to 20 minutes.  Watch the mixture carefully toward the end to make sure it doesn't scorch.

Put the sauce through the fine disk of a food mill, discarding the seeds, bits of skin, and other residue.  If the sauce seems thin, return it to medium-low heat and continue cooking, stirring constantly and watching very carefully, until it reaches the desired consistency.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  dry white beans
                        = (pea, navy, or great Northern)
  4               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or lower-salt canned chicken broth)
  2              large  carrots - (abt 9 oz) -- trimmed, peeled,
                        and cut into 1" pieces - (1 1/2 cups)
  1                     celery stalk -- washed, trimmed,
                        and thinly sliced - (1/2 cup)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        = (adjust if canned broth is used)
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
  2                     bay leaves
  3                     whole cloves
  1             medium  onion -- peeled
  2             pounds  boneless skinless turkey breast -- cut into about 2"
                        by 1/2" by 1/4" strips
  1              small  tomato - (3 oz) -- seeded, and
                        coarsely chopped - (1/2 cup)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, crushed,
                        and finely chopped - (1 tspn)
     1/2      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce

Sort the beans, discarding any stones or damaged beans.  Wash the beans in a sieve under cold water.

Place the beans in a large pot with the stock or broth, carrots, celery, salt, thyme, and bay leaves.  Push the cloves into the onion and add the onion to the pot.

Bring the mixture to a boll, cover, reduce the heat to low, and boil very gently for about 1 1/2 hours (stirring every 15 to 20 minutes to keep the mixture from sticking to the bottom of the pot), until the beans are soft and tender but not mushy and most of the liquid has been absorbed.

Remove the onion from the pot.  Remove the cloves from the onion and discard them.  Coarsely chop the onion and add it to the pot with the turkey, tomatoes, parsley, and garlic.  Bring the mixture back to a boil and boil it gently for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the turkey is opaque and cooked through.

Remove and discard the bay leaves, then serve, sprinkled with the hot-pepper sauce, within the next hour.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per Serving:  311 calories;  3.8g fat (11% of calories);  1.2g saturated fat;  66mg cholesterol;  270mg sodium.

Comments:  Cassoulet is an earthy dish from the southwest of France.  Traditionally, it contains white beans, poultry, and meat or sausage.  In this leaner, healthier version, turkey breast is used, adding it at the end of the cooking period so it doesn't overcook and dry out.  It is best to let the finished cassoulet sit for a few minutes before serving.

                             Tuscan Pot Roast

Recipe By     :Nancy Harmon Jenkins
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2         pounds  beef, such as top round -- rolled and tied
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- thinly sliced
  2             medium  carrots -- scraped, sliced thin
  2             medium  yellow onions -- thinly sliced
  1                     thick celery stalk -- thinly sliced
  3             sprigs  rosemary, leaves only -- chopped
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  dry red wine
  1              pound  very ripe fresh tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
                        = (or 1 cup chopped canned tomatoes)
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Using a small sharp knife, make incisions all over the meat to a depth of 1/4 to 1/2 inch and insert the garlic slices in them.

In a heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, gently sautÈ the carrots, onions, celery, and rosemary in the oil until the vegetables are beginning to soften but not brown.  Add the garlic-studded beef, raise the heat to medium, and brown the beef on all sides, turning frequently.  Add the wine and let it boil until reduced to about 1/2 cup.  As soon as it's reduced, stir in the tomatoes.  Cover and let simmer for about 1 hour.

Work the butter and flour together to make a paste, then stir thoroughly into the cooking juices.  Cover tightly, reduce the heat to low, and let cook at a bare simmer for 2 hours longer, adding a little hot water, wine, or broth if the liquid in the pan reduces too much.

When the meat is done, lift it out of the cooking juices and set aside to rest for about 15 minutes, then slice off three thin slices of meat.  Chop them with a knife as finely as possible.

Degrease the juices in the pan, setting aside about 1/2 cup of the meat juices to garnish the meat.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the chopped meat to the remaining juices and serve this as a sauce over pasta for a first course.  Serve the meat as a second course with the reserved juices as a garnish.  (This is often served with a contorno of purÈed potatoes.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  With the exception of the glorious bistecca Chianina, Tuscans don't eat a lot of beef.  Once the T-bones have been removed from a Chianina carcass, however, something has to be done with the rest of the meat, and stracotto is one thing to do with it.  This kind of pot roast exists all over Italy, a real Sunday dish, elegant, flavorful, and practical for the cook, since the sauce for the pasta and the meat cook all at once and together.  Americans may find it odd to serve two courses with the same fundamental flavors, but to Italians it's perfectly normal.  What makes this particular treatment Tuscan is the presence of a robust Chianti wine in the sauce.  Any flavorful, red wine with a good acidic balance will do.

           Venetian White Bean Soup With Pasta And Beef Sausage

Recipe By     :Joyce Goldstein
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  dried white or borlotti beans -- picked over, rinsed
                        = (abt 14 oz)
  7        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     onions -- finely chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- finely chopped
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
     3/4         pound  freshly-made or purchased fresh fettuccine -- cut into
                        maltagliati (irregular 1 1/2" pieces)
                        = (or use dried tubetti pasta)
  2               cups  meat broth -- more or less
     1/2         pound  Beef Sausage (see recipe) meat mixture -- rolled into tiny
                        meatballs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the beans in a saucepan with cold water to cover generously and bring to a boil.  Boil for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand for 1 hour.  Drain well, add fresh water to cover, and again bring to a boil.

Meanwhile, warm 4 tablespoons of the olive oil in a sautÈ pan over medium heat.  Add the onions, celery, and carrots and sautÈ until softened, about 10 minutes.  Add to the beans and return to a boil.  Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beaus are tender, about 1 1/2 hours.

Remove the bean mixture from the heat.  Scoop out and reserve about 2 cups of the beans.  PurÈe the remaining beans in batches in a blender or food processor, and place the purÈe, the reserved beans, and any cooking liquid in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil; if the mixture is too thick, thin with hot water.

While the soup is reheating, cook the pasta in boiling water until al dente, then drain.  Add to the bean soup.  At the same time, bring the meat broth to a gentle boil, add the meatballs, and poach until cooked through, about 5 minutes, depending on their size.  Add the meatballs and the broth to the bean soup and simmer for 10 minutes to blend the flavors.  Stir often with a wooden spoon so the beans don't scorch and stick to the bottom of the pan.  If the soup begins to thicken too much, you may need to add a little hot water.

Just before serving, season the soup with salt and pepper.  Ladle into warmed bowls and drizzle with the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil.  Grind a little pepper over the top and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Here's a Venetian version of pasta e fagiol that calls for fresh pasta and homemade beef sausage.  It is a wonderfully homey and filling bean soup that can be a meal-in-a-bowl.  If you like, add 2 cups chopped cooked Swiss chard or curly endive during the last 10 minutes of cooking.

Place the beans in a saucepan with cold water to cover generously and bring to a boil.  Boil for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat, cover, and let stand for 1 hour.  Drain well, add fresh water to cover, and again bring to a boil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, warm 4 tablespoons of the olive oil in a sautÈ pan over medium heat.  Add the onions, celery, and carrots and sautÈ until softened, about 10 minutes.  Add to the beans and return to a boil.  Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beaus are tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the bean mixture from the heat.  Scoop out and reserve about 2 cups of the beans.  PurÈe the remaining beans in batches in a blender or food processor, and place the purÈe, the reserved beans, and any cooking liquid in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil; if the mixture is too thick, thin with hot water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the soup is reheating, cook the pasta in boiling water until al dente, then drain.  Add to the bean soup.  At the same time, bring the meat broth to a gentle boil, add the meatballs, and poach until cooked through, about 5 minutes, depending on their size.  Add the meatballs and the broth to the bean soup and simmer for 10 minutes to blend the flavors.  Stir often with a wooden spoon so the beans don&apos;t scorch and stick to the bottom of the pan.  If the soup begins to thicken too much, you may need to add a little hot water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Just before serving, season the soup with salt and pepper.  Ladle into warmed bowls and drizzle with the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil.  Grind a little pepper over the top and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Here&apos;s a Venetian version of pasta e fagiol that calls for fresh pasta and homemade beef sausage.  It is a wonderfully homey and filling bean soup that can be a meal-in-a-bowl.  If you like, add 2 cups chopped cooked Swiss chard or curly endive during the last 10 minutes of cooking.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  butter or margarine
  2               cups  sugar
  3               cups  sifted all-purpose flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  unsifted all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  broken walnuts
  4              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1                cup  milk -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  12             whole  large walnut halves -- (as garnish)
                        == CHOCOLATE-WALNUT BUTTER CREAM ICING ==
  4             ounces  unsweetened chocolate
  2        tablespoons  strong coffee
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                cup  butter or margarine
  1                cup  broken walnuts

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter two 9- by 5-inch loaf pans.

Cut the butter into cubes in a large mixing bowl.  Gradually add the sugar and beat until creamy.

In a separate bowl, sift together the 3 cups flour, baking powder, and salt.  Toss the broken walnut pieces with the unsifted tablespoon of flour and set aside.

Add the eggs one at a time to the creamed mixture, beating well after each egg is added.

Combine the milk with the vanilla and almond extracts.  Alternately add the flour mixture and the milk mixture to the creamed mixture, beating well after each addition.  Add the floured walnut pieces and continue to beat until well blended.

Spoon equal portions of the batter into each loaf pan.  Bake for 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cakes comes out clean.  Let the pans cool, then turn out the cakes onto a rack.

In a double boiler, combine the chocolate and coffee for the icing and heat, stirring often, until the chocolate is melted and blended with the coffee.

In a mixing bowl, combine the yolks, salt, and sugar.  Set this bowl in a basin or large stockpot of simmering water and beat rapidly with a wire whisk until the mixture runs from the whisk in a ribbon.

Add the chocolate mixture to the yolk mixture.  Continue to beat over the simmering water.  Gradually add the butter a little at a time.  Remove the bowl from the heat and continue to beat, using a wooden spoon, until the icing thickens and becomes spreadable.  Beat in the walnuts and beat until smooth and a bit lighter.

Spread the top of each cake with the icing, and garnish the tops with the walnut halves.

This recipe yields 2 cakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             quarts  water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  salt -- plus
                        extra salt to taste
  1              pound  yellow bell peppers -- halved, seeded
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped fine
  1              large  onion -- chopped fine
  1              small  carrot -- chopped fine
  3             ounces  pancetta -- cubed
  1                cup  canned or homemade beef broth or water -- or more as needed
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  penne
  4        tablespoons  freshly-grated pecorino Romano cheese

Bring the water to a boil in a large pot and add the 1 1/2 tablespoons of salt.  Preheat the broiler.  Place the peppers, skin-side up, 2 to 3 inches from the heat, and watch them carefully.  When the skin blackens, turn them over to blacken on the other side.  It will take about 10 minutes.  Remove the peppers and place them in a plastic bag for 15 minutes, then peel off the skin and chop them.

In a large, heavy saucepan, place the olive oil, the chopped celery, the onion, carrot, and pancetta.  Stir to mix well and heat over medium until the vegetables start to color, 15 to 20 minutes.  Add the chopped peppers and half the broth to the vegetable mixture and stir.  Keep adding broth as the mixture dries out (you might need more than a cup).  It should be slightly soupy, like thick vegetable stew.  Then add the chopped parsley and salt and pepper to taste.

Add the penne to the boiling water.  When it is very at dente, drain, add it to the peppers, and cook for another 5 minutes.  Mix in the pecorino and serve.

This recipe yields 4 first course or 2 main course servings.

Bring the water to a boil in a large pot and add the 1 1/2 tablespoons of salt.  Preheat the broiler.  Place the peppers, skin-side up, 2 to 3 inches from the heat, and watch them carefully.  When the skin blackens, turn them over to blacken on the other side.  It will take about 10 minutes.  Remove the peppers and place them in a plastic bag for 15 minutes, then peel off the skin and chop them.

In a large, heavy saucepan, place the olive oil, the chopped celery, the onion, carrot, and pancetta.  Stir to mix well and heat over medium until the vegetables start to color, 15 to 20 minutes.  Add the chopped peppers and half the broth to the vegetable mixture and stir.  Keep adding broth as the mixture dries out (you might need more than a cup).  It should be slightly soupy, like thick vegetable stew.  Then add the chopped parsley and salt and pepper to taste.

Add the penne to the boiling water.  When it is very at dente, drain, add it to the peppers, and cook for another 5 minutes.  Mix in the pecorino and serve.
