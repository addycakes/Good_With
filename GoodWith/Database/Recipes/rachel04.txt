Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  potatoes -- peeled, cubed
                        = (such as russet)
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
                        = (or softened cream cheese)
  1              large  egg yolk
     1/2           cup  cream
                        = (for a lighter version substitute
                        vegetable or chicken broth)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 3/4         pounds  ground beef or ground lamb
  1                     carrot -- peeled, chopped
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  beef stock or broth
  2          teaspoons  Worcestershire
     1/2           cup  frozen peas
  1           teaspoon  sweet paprika
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves

Boil potatoes in salted water until tender, about 12 minutes.  Drain potatoes and pour them into a bowl.  Combine sour cream, egg yolk and cream.  Add the cream mixture into potatoes and mash until potatoes are almost smooth.

While potatoes boil, preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add oil to hot pan with beef or lamb.  Season meat with salt and pepper.  Brown and crumble meat for 3 or 4 minutes.  If you are using lamb and the pan is fatty, spoon away some of the drippings.  Add chopped carrot and onion to the meat.  Cook veggies with meat 5 minutes, stirring frequently.

In a second small skillet over medium heat cook butter and flour together 2 minutes.  Whisk in broth and Worcestershire sauce.  Thicken gravy 1 minute.  Add gravy to meat and vegetables.  Stir in peas.

Preheat broiler to high.  Fill a small rectangular casserole with meat and vegetable mixture.  Spoon potatoes over meat evenly.  Top potatoes with paprika and broil 6 to 8 inches from the heat until potatoes are evenly browned.  Top casserole dish with chopped parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Salt -- as needed
  8             pieces  jumbo pasta shells
  1 1/2         pounds  ricotta cheese
                        = (or part skim ricotta cheese)
  1              pound  mozzarella -- diced
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1                cup  shredded Asiago
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     fresh basil leaves - (to 7) -- torn or shredded

Preheat oven or broiler to 450 degrees.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Salt water and add pasta.  Cook shells 12 to 15 minutes, they should be softened but still undercooked at the center.  Drain pasta and cool.

Combine ricotta, 1/2 of the diced mozzarella, a couple of handfuls of Parmigiano and 1/2 of the Asiago.  Add parsley to the cheeses and stir to combine.

To a small saucepot over moderate heat add oil, garlic and onions.  Saute onions and garlic 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes and season sauce with salt and pepper.  Simmer sauce 5 minutes and stir in basil leaves

Pour a little sauce into the bottom of a shallow medium-sized casserole dish.  Fill shells with rounded spoonfuls of cheese mixture and arrange them seam-side down in casserole dish.  Top shells with remaining sauce and remaining mozzarella and Asiago cheeses.  Place shells in very hot oven or 8 inches from hot broiler and cook 6 to 8 minutes to melt cheeses and bubble sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

  2        tablespoons  butter
  1              pound  packaged baby carrots
  1                     rutabaga -- peeled, diced
  1                     onion -- diced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  chicken or vegetable stock
                        === LAMB ===
  8                     loin lamb chops
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === COLCANNON ===
  4             medium  to large all-purpose potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
                        Coarse salt -- for boiling water
  2               cups  chicken or vegetable stock
  1               head  dark curly kale -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  whole milk
     1/4      teaspoon  fresh or grated nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  ground thyme
  2                     scallions -- sliced
                        A handful of fresh parsley -- chopped
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
                        Prepared store-bought Irish soda bread or
                        brown bread -- warmed, for passing
                        at table
                        Softened sweet butter -- for the bread

For braised vegetables:  Heat a skillet with a cover over medium to medium-high heat.  Add butter, carrots, rutabaga and onion.  Cook veggies 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add broth or stock, bring to a simmer, and reduce heat and cover.  Cook vegetables 15 minutes or until fork tender.  Remove from heat and set aside.

Preheat broiler to high for lamb.

Boil potatoes for 15 minutes in salted water.  Drain potatoes and return them to the hot pot and mash.

Heat stock or broth to a simmer.  Chop kale tops, discarding tough stems.  Add kale to broth and cover.  Simmer 10 to 12 minutes.

Place chops about 6 to 8 inches from broiler and cook 5 minutes on each side.  Remove from broiler and season chops with salt and pepper on both sides.  Let chops rest 3 to 5 minutes.

In a large skillet over moderate heat melt butter and add milk.  Season with nutmeg and thyme and add scallions to the pan.  Remove kale from cooking liquid to the milk and butter mixture using a slotted spoon.  Stir in 1/2 cup of cooking liquid.  Add mashed potatoes to milk and kale and stir until combined and creamy, 1 or 2 minutes.  Stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Serve the chops along with vegetable colcannon.  Warm up store-bought Irish soda bread or brown bread with soft, unsweetened butter.  This makes a nice starter, side or ending to this meal.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Line work surface with more waxed paper.  Pour 1/2 cup flour into 2 piles on opposite sides of the work space.  Add cornmeal, paprika, salt and pepper to 1 pile of flour.  Beat eggs and water in a pie plate or shallow dish.

Cut steaks into 4 portions and coat in flour, eggs, then seasoned flour and cornmeal.

Add 2 tablespoons oil to hot pan and cook 2 steaks at a time.  Brown steaks about 2 minutes per side, or until cooked and remove from the pan.  Add 2 tablespoons more oil and repeat with remaining 2 steaks.  Remove steaks to serving platter and pour off all but 2 to 3 tablespoons of drippings.  Add 2 tablespoons flour to drippings and cook 2 minutes.  Whisk in broth and season with salt and pepper.  Whisk half-and-half or cream into gravy.  When gravy bubbles, remove from heat.

Serve steaks and warm biscuits with gravy on top.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  heavy whipping cream -- 1/4 cup reserved
                        to thin if fondue begins to thicken
  4                     bittersweet chocolate bars - (3 1/2 oz ea) -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  Frangelico or Amaretto liqueur -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped hazelnuts or almonds -- (optional)
                        === SUGGESTED DIPPABLES ===
                        = (choose 3 or 4 of the following)
                        Hazelnut or almond biscotti

                        Cubed pound cake

Arrange your favorite dippables in piles on a platter along side chocolate fondue with fondue forks, bamboo skewers or seafood forks, as utensils, for dipping.

                        === DESSERT FILLING ===
  2               cans  pitted black cherries - (16 oz ea)
  1                     orange -- zested
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1                     rounded tablespoon cornstarch
  3        tablespoons  warm water
  2            jiggers  Kirsch or Amaretto liquer
     1/3           cup  confectioners' sugar -- plus
                        additional for dusting
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted

For the crepe batter, combine flour and salt in a bowl and make a well in the center.  Add eggs milk and brandy to the well and whisk to combine.  Stir in melted butter.  Cover batter and set aside for 25 minutes.

For the white sauce, cook butter and flour 2 minutes over moderate heat in a preheated medium saucepan.  Whisk in milk and season sauce with salt, pepper, nutmeg and cayenne.  Simmer over low heat 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in cream and heat sauce through, another 5 minutes over low heat.  Turn burner to warm and stir sauce occasionally to avoid a skin forming.  Whisk in a little milk if sauce thickens too much to ladle.

To assemble fillings, place cheeses in small bowls with serving spoons.  Cook broccoli florets in simmering water or in 1 cup of water in the microwave for 3 minutes on high.  Drain and place steamed broccoli in a bowl.  Defrost spinach in the microwave oven and drain well.  Transfer drained spinach to a kitchen towel and wring to remove any residual liquid.  Fluff spinach with finger tips and set into a small serving dish.  Place chopped ham into a bowl with serving fork.  Drain and separate lump crab meat and place in a serving dish with a seafood fork.

For the bacon and mushroom filling, heat a small skillet over medium high heat.  Add oil and bacon and saute 3 minutes.  Add chopped shallots and sliced mushrooms.  Season the filling with salt and pepper and cook 5 minutes until mushrooms are just tender.  Transfer filling to a serving bowl.

To make the dessert filling, drain cherries over a saucepan to catch the juice.  Heat the juice, orange zest and cinnamon to a bubble over moderate heat.  Combine cornstarch with water and stir to the hot juice.  Remove the cinnamon stick.  Allow sauce to thicken then stir in cherries and Kirsch or Amaretto and keep sauce warm over very low heat.  When your are ready to serve dessert, place filling in crepes, wrap and brush with melted butter.  Top crepes with powdered sugar and serve.

When guests arrive, allow them to help make their own crepes to order.  Crepes should be made in a nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Cover the bottom of the pan with just enough batter to coat.  Turn the crepes with a toothpick or a very thin spatula.

Possible combinations for fillings:  cheese or cheeses melted into white sauce with broccoli and/or spinach, warm white sauce with crab, ham with cheese or ham with cheesy white sauce, cheese with bacon mushroom filling, etc.  The fillings are only limited by one's taste buds.

This recipe yields 6 servings, 24 crepes.

Toast 8 thick slices of farmhouse-style bread under a preheated broiler 6 inches from heat.  Combine softened butter and mustard.  Spread the toasted bread with mustard butter.

Cut sliced ham into smaller pieces to process.  Grind the ham in your food processor.  Spread the toast with ground ham.  Arrange steamed asparagus spears on top of the layer of ham.  Top each toast with a few grinds of black pepper and a mound of fontina cheese.

Return toasts to hot oven under broiler and cook toasts until cheese melts and lightly browns at edges.  Arrange ham and asparagus toast on a platter and serve.

This recipe yields 8 toasts.

                   Five Spice Beef And Pepper Stir-Fry

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  Jasmine or short-grain white rice -- prepared to
                        directions on package
  2               cups  beef broth or stock
  2        tablespoons  wok or clear oil
  1 1/2         pounds  beef sirloin or beef tenderloin tips -- trimmed, and
                        placed in freezer for 5 to 10 minutes,
                        then thinly sliced
  2                     green bell peppers -- seeded, and
                        diced into 1" pieces
  1             medium  onion -- diced
     1/2           cup  dry cooking sherry
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
                        = (Tamari recommended)
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  3                     diagonally thinly-sliced scallions -- for garnish
     1/2           cup  smoked whole almonds -- for garnish

Boil water for rice and prepare to package directions.

Place beef broth in a small pot over low heat to warm the liquid.

Heat a wok shaped skillet or pan over high heat.  Add oil (it will smoke) and meat bits.  Stir-fry meat 3 minutes and remove from pan or move off to the side of the wok.  Return pan to heat and add peppers and onions.  Stir-fry veggies 2 minutes.  Add meat back to the pan.  Add sherry and stir fry until liquid almost evaporates -- 1 minute.  Add soy sauce to the pan.

Dissolve cornstarch with a ladle of warm beef broth.  Add beef broth to the pan, then add cornstarch combined with broth, the five-spice powder and black pepper.  Stir sauce until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Adjust seasonings.  Add more soy or salt if necessary.

Remove stir-fry from heat.  Fill dinner bowls with beef stir-fry and top with a scoop of rice.  Scoop rice with ice cream scoop to get a rounded ball.  By placing rice on top of stir-fry, rice will stay firm and not soak up too much sauce.  Garnish with chopped scallions and smoked almonds.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
  1              quart  vegetable stock
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2               cups  arborio rice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine or dry sherry
  1              pound  triple washed spinach -- chopped
  1                cup  basil leaves - (loosely packed) -- chopped or torn

Add wine or sherry and allow liquid to absorb, 1 minute.  Add half of the stock or broth and reduce heat slightly.

When risotto has cooked almost to al dente, about 18 minutes, fold in spinach, basil and parsley.  Season risotto with nutmeg, salt and pepper and stir in any remaining broth.  Risotto will cook 22 minutes, total.  Stir in cheese and serve immediately.

  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        extra for drizzling
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                     shallot -- chopped
     1/2         pound  button mushrooms and stems -- cleaned, and
                        finely chopped in food processor
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  dry cooking sherry
  4                     tournedos of beef filet mignon, 1" thick
  8             ounces  mousse pate
                        = (available in specialty cheese and
                        appetizer cases of larger markets)
  1                     sheet frozen prepared puff pastry - (11" b -- defrosted
  1                     egg -- beaten with
                        a splash of water
  1                     large head broccoli -- trimmed, and
                        cut into spears

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Heat a small skillet over medium heat.  Add oil, butter, shallot and chopped mushrooms.  Season mushrooms with salt and pepper and saute 5 minutes.  Add sherry to the mushrooms and let the liquid evaporate.  Remove mushrooms from the heat.

In a nonstick skillet over high heat, sear meat 2 minutes on each side in a drizzle of oil.  Remove skillet from the heat and season meat with salt and pepper.

Cut mousse into 4 pieces, 2 ounces each, sliced in half horizontally.  Spread the puff pastry sheet out on to a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper.  Quarter the dough with a sharp knife.  Roll each piece of dough into a 10- by 6-inch rectangle.  On each rectangle of dough, place 1/4 of the cooked mushrooms.  Top mushrooms with 2 ounces pate and 1 tournedo of beef.  Wrap dough up and over the meat.  Seal the dough with egg wash and trim excess.  Use leftover dough bits to make decorative garnishes for the tops of your Wellingtons.

Turn the wrapped Wellingtons over and cover with egg wash using a pastry brush.  Affix dough garnishes with egg wash.  For a simple decoration, roll dough bits into a long, thin spaghetti like string and make swirls on each Wellington.  Bake beef Wellingtons 10 minutes or until golden.  Let stand 5 minutes, then serve.

Steam broccoli spears in 1-inch simmering salted water, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until just tender.  Transfer spears to a serving plate or individual dinner plates along side Wellingtons.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until ready to serve.

Pork and Bell Pepper Filling:  Heat a small to medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add oil and pork to hot pan.  Break up pork as it browns, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add peppers to the pork and season mixture with cumin, cayenne sauce, allspice, salt and pepper.  Reduce heat to moderate and cook filling 5 minutes longer.  Add 1/2 cup water to the pork.  Reduce heat to low to keep filling warm.

Yellow Pico de Gallo:  Combine all Pico de Gallo ingredients in a small bowl and serve.

To assemble bar, arrange taco shells next to the stove top.  Serve the fillings from the skillets they were cooked in.  Place toppings in small dishes on opposite side of the stove top.  Tex Mex Red Beans And Rice (see recipe) or store bought refried beans make a great side dish.

This recipe yields 10 tacos.

  2             quarts  chicken broth
  3             pounds  all-purpose potatoes -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  1              pound  fresh triple washed spinach -- stems picked, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  grated or ground nutmeg

     2/3         pound  prosciutto di Parma
  1                     ripe cantaloupe

Transfer the prosciutto from the deli papers to a serving dish, separating the slices and lay them out like a ribbon on to the plate.  "Fluffed up" prosciutto is much easier to pull from a serving plate.

To choose a ripe melon, give it a sniff and a good squeeze.  Melon will be very fragrant and will give slightly to pressure when squeezed.  Cut a thin slice of the melon skin away where it was attached to the vine.  Trim a thin slice off the opposite side.  Stand the melon upright.  Using a sharp knife, clean the skin off the melon by cutting strips working from the top to the bottom all around the circumference.  Turn the cleaned melon upside down and trim away any missed spots.  Cut it in half and scoop out the seeds.  Cut cleaned cantaloupe into thin slices or wedges and arrange on a serving plate.  Pile prosciutto onto melon slices and enjoy!

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        some for drizzling at the table
  4              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     carrots -- peeled, diced
  2                     celery ribs -- chopped
  1                     fresh laurel leaf or 1 dried bay leaf
                        = (fresh bay is available in herb section
                        of larger markets)
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cans  small white beans -- such as Goya brand
                        = (cannellini beans may be substituted)
  6               cups  chicken stock or broth
  2               cups  tomato sauce
  3               cups  stale chewy Italian bread -- crust removed,
                        and bread torn into pieces - abt 1/2 loaf
  1              small  white onion -- thinly sliced or
                        finely chopped for garnish
  1                cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for garnish

Heat a deep, heavy bottomed pot over moderate heat.  Add oil, garlic, onions, carrots, celery and bay to the pot.  Season vegetables with salt and pepper and saute until they begin to soften 5 to 7 minutes.  Add beans, stock and tomato sauce.  Bring soup to a boil over medium-high heat.  Remove lid and stir in torn stale bread.  Stir soup and incorporate bread as it breaks down.

When soup is becomes thick and bread is distributed evenly, adjust seasoning and serve the soup in shallow bowls.  Some ribolittas are so thick, the spoon can stand upright.  This is a subjective technique.  Make yours as thick or thin, as you like with the addition of either more bread or additional stock or water.

Top shallow bowlfuls of soup with thinly sliced or finely chopped raw onion, a drizzle of extra- virgin olive oil and a generous sprinkling of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  dry red wine

Heat a grill pan over high heat.  Drizzle chicken thighs with oil, season with salt, pepper and rosemary.  Grill chicken 5 minutes on each side and remove from heat to rest for 5 minutes.

Place stock in a small bowl and cover.  Heat in microwave on high for 2 minutes.  Remove stock from microwave with oven mitt.  Add dried porcini to the dish and replace the cover.  Steep porcinis in stock 5 to 10 minutes to reconstitute mushrooms.  This may also be done on the stovetop.  Simmer broth, and mushrooms for 10 minutes over low heat.

In a medium skillet, add 2 tablespoons olive oil, saute pancetta, crushed garlic and chopped shallot over medium heat for 3 minutes, to crisp pancetta at edges.  Add sliced portobello mushrooms to the pan and season with salt and pepper.  Saute mushrooms 10 minutes, or until dark and tender.  Add flour and cook 1 minute.  Add red wine to the pan and reduce by half, about 1 minute.  Add reserved stock and porcini mushrooms to the pan and simmer together 1 to 2 minutes longer to combine.

Slice chicken thighs and fan out on a plate.  Ladle thick mushroom sauce down over sliced chicken and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     shallot -- chopped
  2               cans  quartered artichoke hearts in water - -- (14 oz ea), drained
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley leaves
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained
  16                    sea scallops
     1/2           cup  dry vermouth

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 2 turns of the pan of olive oil, about 2 tablespoons and the chopped shallots to the pan.  Cook shallots in oil a minute or so, add artichoke hearts and toss to heat through.  Season artichokes with salt and pepper and combine with parsley and capers.  Transfer artichokes to a serving dish.

Wipe out pan and return to the heat, raising heat a bit.  Season drained and trimmed scallops with salt and pepper.  Add 1 turn of olive oil to the very hot pan and immediately place the scallops in the pan.  Sear the scallops in a single layer, causing them to caramelize, 2 minutes on each side.  Add vermouth to the pan and cook out the alcohol, 1 to 2 minutes.  Arrange the scallops in vermouth over top of the artichokes and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Cook shallots in oil a minute or so, add artichoke hearts and toss to heat through.  Season artichokes with salt and pepper and combine with parsley and capers.  Transfer artichokes to a serving dish.

Wipe out pan and return to the heat, raising heat a bit.  Season drained and trimmed scallops with salt and pepper.  Add 1 turn of olive oil to the very hot pan and immediately place the scallops in the pan.  Sear the scallops in a single layer, causing them to caramelize, 2 minutes on each side.  Add vermouth to the pan and cook out the alcohol, 1 to 2 minutes.  Arrange the scallops in vermouth over top of the artichokes and serve.

Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  pure maple syrup
     1/3           cup  dark soy -- Tamari
     1/2           cup  sweet hot mustard
     1/2           cup  sesame seeds
                        = (a mix of black and white or all white)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil -- total
  1 1/3         pounds  chicken breast tenders
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === DRESSING ===
  1 1/2                 inches fresh ginger root -- grated or minced
  3        tablespoons  rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  Chinese duck sauce
                        = (or apricot all fruit spread)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
                        === SALAD ===
  1                     bag mixed baby greens - (5 to 6 oz)
     1/4                English or seedless cucumber -- halved lengthwise,
                        then thinly sliced on an angle
     1/2           cup  shredded carrots
  4                     scallions -- thinly sliced on
                        an angle
     1/4         pound  snow peas -- sliced on an angle
                        Fried Chinese noodles for garnish -- (optional)
                        = (perhaps leftover from take out)

Combine syrup, soy and sweet hot mustard in a bowl.  Season chicken tenders with salt and pepper on both sides.  Add chicken tenders to 1/2 of the marinade and coat.  Set aside.  Reserve the remaining 1/2 for dressing.

Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Spread sesame seeds on a sheet of waxed paper or into a shallow dish.  Waxed paper will speed your clean up.  Dip the tenders into the sesame seeds.  Coat the pan with a thin layer of oil.  Cook chicken in small batches 3 minutes on each side and remove to plate.

Whisk ginger, vinegar and the reserved marinade together then stream in the oil while you are continuing to whisk dressing.

Combine all of the salad ingredients in a bowl.  Toss with dressing and serve, topping with sesame chicken tenders.  Toss some crunch into your salad with fried noodles, if you have any leftover packets from ordering Chinese take out, for the last time!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- defrosted, and
                        squeezed dry
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  ground or freshly-grated nutmeg
  4             ounces  feta with black pepper or plain feta -- crumbled tiny bits
  1                     egg -- beaten
  3        tablespoons  sour cream
  4                     sheets phyllo pastry dough - (13" by 17") -- defrosted
  3        tablespoons  melted butter

Place oven rack in center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.

Preheat a small pan over medium to medium-high heat.  Add oil and onion and saute 5 minutes.  Place onion in a bowl.  Add chopped dry, defrosted spinach and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Add feta to the bowl and combine it with spinach.  Add beaten egg and sour cream to the bowl and combine with cheese, spinach and onion.

On a large work surface, place 1 sheet of phyllo.  Paint half of the sheet with a little melted butter, paying extra attention to your perimeter.  Fold sheet in half.  Pile 1/4 of your spinach mixture into a log shape, working 2 inches from bottom and each side.  Tuck bottom up and fold both sides in, then roll and wrap upwards until you reach the edge of the dough sheet.  Each pastry will resemble an egg roll.  Paint the seam and the ends of the roll with butter and set roll seam-side down on a cookie sheet.  Repeat and make 4 rolls.  Bake 15 minutes or until lightly golden all over and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts - -- (6 oz ea)
                        Plastic food storage bags or waxed paper
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz)
  2        tablespoons  butter
  12             small  crimini or button mushroom caps
  2                     garlic cloves -- cracked
  1              small  shallot -- quartered
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  part-skim ricotta cheese
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano or Romano
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh-grated or ground nutmeg
                        Toothpicks -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1                cup  chicken broth

Place breasts in the center of a plastic food storage bag or 2 large sheets of waxed paper.  Pound out the chicken from the center of the bag outward using a heavy-bottomed skillet or mallet.  Be firm but controlled with your strokes.

Defrost spinach in the microwave.  Transfer spinach to a kitchen towel.  Twist towel around spinach and wring it out until very dry.  Transfer to a medium-mixing bowl.

Place a nonstick skillet over moderate heat.  When skillet is hot, add butter, mushrooms, garlic and shallot.  Season with salt and pepper and saute 5 minutes.  Transfer mushrooms, garlic and shallot to the food processor.  Pulse to grind the mushrooms and transfer to the mixing bowl, adding the processed mushrooms to the spinach.  Add ricotta and grated cheese to the bowl and the nutmeg.  Stir to combine the stuffing.  Return your skillet to the stove over medium-high heat.

Place a mound of stuffing on each breast and wrap and roll breast over the stuffing.  Secure breasts with toothpicks.  Add 3 tablespoons oil to the pan, 3 turns of the pan.  Add breasts to the pan and brown on all sides, cooking chicken 10 to 12 minutes.  The meat will cook quickly because it is thin.

Remove breasts; add butter to the pan and flour.  Cook butter and flour for a minute, whisk in wine and reduce another minute.  Whisk in broth and return breasts to the pan.  Reduce heat and simmer until ready to serve.

Remove toothpicks.  Serve breasts whole or, remove from pan, slice on an angle and fan out on dinner plates.  Top stuffed chicken breasts or sliced stuffed breasts with generous spoonfuls of the sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  4                     vine ripe tomatoes, red or yellow -- tops trimmed,
                        and seeded
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling, plus
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
                        = (or 1 slice 1/2"-thk stale crusty
                        bread, torn)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  2               cups  arugula leaves -- the tops of 1 bunch
  4                     New York Strip steaks, 1" thick
  3        tablespoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
                        Olive oil or cooking spray -- to coat skillet
     1/4           cup  good brandy
  2        tablespoons  butter

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high to high heat.

Arrange tomatoes on a broiler pan.  Drizzle tomatoes with oil and season with salt and pepper.  Combine bread crumbs, cheese, red pepper flakes, garlic, arugula and 1 tablespoon oil in food processor and pulse grind to form stuffing.  Stuff tomatoes to the rims with arugula mixture and place in the center of the oven.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes.  Let tomatoes stand 5 minutes before serving.

Let steaks sit 10 minutes once removed from the refrigerator.  Coat steaks liberally on both sides with coarse black pepper.  To a very hot pan, drizzle oil to thinly coat the cooking surface.  It will smoke.  Add steaks immediately.  Sear and seal the steaks, cooking them 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare doneness.  Reduce heat a bit and cook 5 minutes longer for medium to medium-well doneness.  Remove steaks and let stand 5 minutes.

Add brandy to the skillet and warm, then ignite.  Add butter to the skillet, then spoon pan juices over steaks.  Serve stuffed tomatoes along side steaks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  3             medium  russet potatoes -- scrubbed, dried
                        Fine salt -- as needed
                        === STEAKS ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     NY strip steaks, 3/4" thk - -- (10 to 12 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  1              large  shallot -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  dry red wine

Heat 1 1/2 to 2 inches oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat to 325 degrees.  Cut potatoes into thin slices lengthwise.  Cut each slice into thin shoestring strips.  Place cut potatoes on paper towels.  Place 2 generous handfuls of potatoes at a time into hot oil, in 2 batches.  Par cook the potatoes 2 minutes and transfer to a towel lined plate.

Raise heat to medium-high up to 375 degrees.  Allow oil to rise to a higher temperature, 3 to 5 minutes.  Return potatoes to oil in 2 batches to crisp them, cooking them to a deep, golden brown color, another 2 to 3 minutes per batch.  Remove potatoes from oil to clean towels to drain.  Season with fine salt and serve.

For steaks, heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add a little oil to the pan, 1 turn.  Season steaks with salt and pepper.  Place steaks in skillet and sear 2 minutes on each side.  Reduce heat to medium and cook steaks 6 minutes longer for medium-rare, 8 for medium to medium-well.  Remove steaks to a warm plate to rest.

Add 2 tablespoons butter and the shallots to the pan.  Cook shallots 2 or 3 minutes, add flour to the pan and cook a minute longer.  Whisk wine into pan and lift pan drippings up.  Add the last tablespoon of butter and remove the pan from the heat.

Spoon wine and shallot sauce over the steaks and serve with hot, shoestring potatoes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Raise heat to medium-high up to 375 degrees.  Allow oil to rise to a higher temperature, 3 to 5 minutes.  Return potatoes to oil in 2 batches to crisp them, cooking them to a deep, golden brown color, another 2 to 3 minutes per batch.  Remove potatoes from oil to clean towels to drain.  Season with fine salt and serve.

For steaks, heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add a little oil to the pan, 1 turn.  Season steaks with salt and pepper.  Place steaks in skillet and sear 2 minutes on each side.  Reduce heat to medium and cook steaks 6 minutes longer for medium-rare, 8 for medium to medium-well.  Remove steaks to a warm plate to rest.

Add 2 tablespoons butter and the shallots to the pan.  Cook shallots 2 or 3 minutes, add flour to the pan and cook a minute longer.  Whisk wine into pan and lift pan drippings up.  Add the last tablespoon of butter and remove the pan from the heat.

<DirT>
Spoon wine and shallot sauce over the steaks and serve with hot, shoestring potatoes.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
                        Salt -- as needed
     1/2           cup  milk
  4             ounces  cream cheese
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil or vegetable oil -- plus
                        some for drizzling
  2             slices  bacon -- chopped
  1              small  McIntosh apple -- chopped
  2                     celery ribs from the heart -- finely chopped
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped sage leaves
                        = (or 1 tspn ground dried sage)
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped thyme leaves
                        = (or 1 tspn dried thyme leaves)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     store-bought corn muffins
  8                     thin boneless center-cut pork loin chops
  2             pounds  sugar snap peas
  1                cup  chicken broth or water
  1         tablespoon  butter

Cover potatoes with water and season with salt.  Cover pan to bring potatoes to a quick boil.  Boil potatoes until tender, about 12 minutes.  Drain potatoes and return them to the hot pot to dry.  Set aside.

Heat milk, cream cheese and onion over medium-low heat until cream cheese melts into milk and mixture bubbles.  Pour hot milk and cream cheese into the potatoes and mash to desired consistency.  Add a little extra milk for softer potatoes.  Season with salt, to your taste, and transfer to a serving dish.  Garnish with chopped chives.

Preheat a medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add oil and bacon to the skillet and cook 2 minutes.  Add apple, celery and onion and season the mixture with herbs, salt and pepper.  Reduce heat to medium.  Cook vegetables 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Crumble the corn muffins into the pan and combine stuffing.

Preheat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat.  Drizzle chops with oil and season with salt and pepper.  Cook chops 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Do not over cook.  The chops should be firm but still giving off juices.

In a medium saucepan, place snap peas and broth and 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high heat.  When the liquid boils, cover the pan and reduce heat to low.  Simmer snap peas 3 to 5 minutes, until tender but still green.  Remove pan from heat and season snap peas with salt, to taste.

To assemble stuffed chops, set a thin chop on dinner plate or serving plate.  Mound the pork chop with stuffing, allowing some to spill onto the plate, then top with a second chop.  Repeat with 3 remaining servings.  Pass potatoes and snap peas to complete the meal.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  8             slices  almond toast or anisette toast -- cut 1" pieces
                        = (Stella D'Oro brand recommended)
     1/4           cup  tamari dark soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4                     thinly-cut chicken cutlets - (to 8) -- depending on size
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  mahi mahi
  1                     ripe lime
                        === PEANUT DRESSING ===
  3        tablespoons  white vinegar

     1/2           cup  white grape juice concentrate

  3        tablespoons  peanut butter
  2                     inches fresh ginger root -- grated
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped nuts
                        === CHILI GARLIC SWEET HOT DRESSING ===
  3        tablespoons  white vinegar
                        = (or rice wine vinegar)
     1/3           cup  pepper jelly
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  hot chili oil
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil

Arrange salad bar ingredients in serving dishes and bowls as you prep them: romaine, baby mixed greens, bean sprouts, daikon radishes, carrots, scallions, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, mint leaves, basil leaves, nuts and sweet almond or anise "croutons".

Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat.

Combine soy and oil in a shallow dish.  Add chicken and turn to coat.  Season chicken with salt and pepper.  Drizzle fish with oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill chicken 3 minutes on each side.  Cut chicken into strips on an angle and pile onto a serving plate.  Grill fish 4 to 5 minutes on each side, until opaque.  Squeeze lime over the fish and break into chunks as you transfer it to a serving plate.

Combine all ingredients, except oil, for peanut dressing in a blender.  Blend for 30 seconds, then open lid and continue dressing by streaming in oil.  Transfer dressing to a serving dish and sprinkle the dressing with a spoonful of nuts from your salad bar to garnish the dish.

For garlic dressing, whisk vinegar, jelly, garlic, black pepper and chili oil together.  Stream in vegetable oil while continuing to whisk.  When the oil is incorporated, transfer dressing to a small dish to serve.

This recipe yields up to 6 servings.

                         The Last Course Sampler

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3         pound  pecorino cheese
                        = (any sheep's milk cheese)
     1/3         pound  Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/3         pound  Gorgonzola
  1                     ripe red-skinned pear -- sliced
  1                     bulb fresh fennel -- trimmed, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  red grapes
  2                     navel oranges - (to 3) -- skins cleaned,
                        and dried
  1                     Sicilian blood orange -- skin cleaned,
                        and dried, (optional)
  2            jiggers  brandy - (to 3)

Arrange the 3 cheeses on a large board or platter.  The pecorino may be sliced.  The Parmigiano needs a small sharp cheese knife to crumble it.  The Gorgonzola will need a spreader.

Slice pear and set it along side the Gorgonzola for spreading.  Arrange the grapes in small clusters around the cheeses.  Arrange the fennel slices near the Parmigiano and pecorino cheeses.

Slice whole oranges into disks and arrange them on a shallow dish.  Douse the orange slices with brandy and serve with cheese course.  Use 1 jigger of brandy for each sliced orange.  To eat the oranges, rip the skin and "unroll" each slice.  Easy.  Delicious.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  fresh ravioli - (12 to 14 oz)
                        = (filled with cheese, spinach or
                        mushroom and cheese)
                        Salt -- as needed
  1                cup  cornmeal
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Romano
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated or ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/3         pounds  turkey cutlets
  2        tablespoons  fresh rosemary leaves -- chopped
                        = (the yield of a few sprigs, stripped)
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Fresh bay leaves -- 1 for each cutlet
                        = (or small dried bay leaves)
  2                     lemons -- zested and juiced
  1                cup  dry white wine or dry vermouth
                        Rapini With Golden Raisins -- (see recipe)

Place a large pot of water to boil over high heat.  Add a healthy dose of salt to boiling water to season it.  Add ravioli and cook to package directions for al dente.

Pour cornmeal onto a plate and combine with grated cheese, then season with nutmeg and black pepper.  Heat a medium nonstick skillet over moderate heat and add 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter.  Drain ravioli.  Dust hot, cooked ravioli with cornmeal.  Add coated ravioli to the skillet and brown on both sides, 3 or 4 minutes total.

While pasta is working, preheat a large skillet for cutlets over medium to medium-high heat.  Season turkey cutlets with chopped rosemary, salt and pepper.  Choose small fresh or dried bay leaves or halve large leaves with kitchen scissors.  Press a small bay leaf or 1/2 leaf into each turkey cutlet.

Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil to the pan; 2 turns around the pan in a slow stream.  Turn cutlets over as you set them into the pan so that the bay leaf faces down.  Cook the cutlets in a single layer, working in 2 batches if necessary.  Saute the cutlets 4 or 5 minutes on each side.  Transfer to a warm plate.

Add the lemon zest and juice to the pan and deglaze the pan with wine or vermouth, pulling up any pan drippings with a whisk.  Add remaining tablespoon butter to the pan, whisk it in and pour the pan sauce down over the cutlets.  Serve the cutlets along side the fried ravioli with Rapini With Golden Raisins or a green tossed salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  linguini
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        some for drizzling
  3             slices  pancetta or bacon -- chopped
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  16                    crimini or button mushrooms -- chopped
  1              pound  veal scaloppini -- cut 1" strips
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1                cup  dry white wine
  16                    pitted large green olives -- coarsely chopped
                        Handful chopped flat-leaf Italian parsley
  1         tablespoon  butter -- cut into pieces
     1/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Romano

Place pasta water on to boil and cook linguini 8 minutes, to al dente in salted water.  Drain and reserve.  Keep warm.

Preheat a large, heavy skillet over medium to medium-high heat.  Add 1 turn of the pan or 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil and the pancetta or bacon.  Cook pancetta or bacon 1 to 2 minutes alone, then add onions and cook another 2 or 3 minutes.  Add mushrooms to the pan and cook together with the onions 3 to 5 minutes.

Season veal strips with salt and pepper.  In a second skillet preheated over medium-high heat, add 1 1/2 turns of extra-virgin olive oil and 1 clove smashed garlic.  Quick-fry half of the veal, searing each side of the strips 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer cooked veal strips and garlic to a plate and repeat.

Add all of the cooked strips and garlic to the onions and mushrooms then add wine to the pan and lift up all of the drippings.  Cook wine down to evaporate the alcohol about 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir olives and parsley into veal and mushrooms.

Serve portions of veal, mushrooms and green olives on a bed of hot linguini tossed with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, butter and grated cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                       Yogurt And Fruit Dessert Cup

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     single-serve cup fruit-flavored
                        custard-style low-fat yogurt
     1/4           cup  granola or Grape Nuts
  1                cup  cut fruit

Layer custard style fruit yogurt with granola or Grape nuts and chunks of cut fruit.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Comments:  The fruit costs more cut than fresh, but when your cooking for 1, whole pineapples and melons can be daunting.  Here, it's worth the extra cost to treat your body to some fresh fruit.
