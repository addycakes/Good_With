Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  fine yellow cornmeal
     1/2           cup  cake flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1              stick  unsalted butter - (4 oz) -- softened
     1/4           cup  almond paste -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1 1/4           cups  confectioners' sugar -- plus more for
                        dusting
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2                     eggs
  4                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sour cream

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Grease an 8-inch round cake pan with vegetable spray.  An alternative is to butter and flour the cake pan.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, cake flour and baking powder and set aside.

Using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and almond paste on high speed until smooth, about 5 minutes.  Reduce speed to low and slowly add confectioners' sugar.  Mix until thoroughly combined and light and fluffy.  Raise speed to high and add the vanilla extract, whole eggs and egg yolks, 1 at a time.  Mix until well combined.  Reduce speed to medium and add the sour cream and dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated.

Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the surface with a spatula.  Bake in the lower third of the oven for 35 minutes, or until the cake is golden and pulls away from the sides of the pan.  Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool.  Remove from pan and dust with confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  1              pound  assorted sliced deli meats
                        = (such as salami, spicy capocollo,
                        prosciutto, mortadella, and bresaola)
     1/2         pound  Parmigiano-Reggiano -- cut irregular chunks

                        radishes, red and orange bell peppers,
                        and cherry tomatoes)
                        === MARINATED OLIVES ===
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper flakes
  1 1/2           cups  Sicilian cracked green olives
  1 1/2           cups  kalamata olives
  2         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil leaves
                        === ROASTED PEPPER SALAD ===
  3                     red bell peppers
  2                     orange bell pepper
     1/3           cup  pitted kalamata olives -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  drained capers

Roasted Pepper Salad:  Preheat the broiler.  Cover a heavy baking sheet with foil.  Arrange the bell peppers on the baking sheet.  Broil until the skins brown and blister, turning the peppers over occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Enclose the peppers in a resealable plastic bag.  Set aside until cooled to room temperature, about 20 minutes.

Peel, seed, and cut the peppers into 1/2-inch thick strips.  Toss the pepper strips, olives, oil, capers, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl to combine.  Cover and refrigerate up to 2 days.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  2              large  eggs -- beaten to blend
  2               cups  Risotto With Mushrooms And Peas -- (see recipe), cooled
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
  1 1/2           cups  dried Italian-style bread crumbs
  2             ounces  mozzarella -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        Salt -- to taste

Pour enough oil in a heavy large saucepan to reach the depth of 3 inches.  Heat the oil over medium heat to 350 degrees.

Stir the eggs, risotto, Parmesan, and 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs in a large bowl to combine.  Place the remaining breadcrumbs in a medium bowl.  Using about 2 tablespoons of the risotto mixture for each, form the risotto mixture into 1 3/4-inch-diameter balls.  Insert 1 cube of mozzarella into the center of each ball.  Roll the balls in the bread crumbs to coat.

Working in batches, add the rice balls to the hot oil and cook until brown and heated through, turning them as necessary, about 4 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the rice balls to paper towels to drain.  Season with salt.  Let rest 2 minutes.  Serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for greasing pan
  1            package  instant polenta - (16 oz)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Grease an 11- by 17-inch baking sheet pan with oil.  Line pan with waxed paper.  The oil will secure the waxed paper onto the pan.

In a large pot bring to a boil 2 quarts of salted water.  Stir in extra-virgin olive oil.  When water has reached a boil, reduce heat to medium-high and slowly add the polenta, whisking constantly for 3 minutes.  When polenta is thick and smooth, pour it into the prepared pan.  Spread the polenta evenly.

Bake in oven for 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and allow to cool in pan.  Note: the polenta will not brown or change in color.  When cool enough to handle, cut into any shape you desire.  I like to cut out 2-inch circles.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              stick  unsalted butter - (4 oz)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1              quart  whole milk -- room temperature
  1              pinch  fresh nutmeg
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  grated fontina
     1/2         pound  thinly-sliced prosciutto -- julienned
  1              pound  dry rigatoni
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- diced

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Bechamel sauce:  In a 2-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the flour and whisk until smooth, about 2 minutes.  Always stirring, gradually add the milk and continue to whisk until the sauce is smooth and creamy.  Simmer until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  This will take approximately 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in nutmeg, 1/2 cup fontina, prosciutto and season with salt and white pepper.  Set aside.

In a large pot, bring to a boil 6 quarts of salted water.  Add the rigatoni and cook for about 5 minutes.  Since you will be cooking the pasta a second time in the oven, you want to make sure the inside is still hard.  Drain in a colander.  Return pasta to the pot and pour in bechamel sauce.  Using a wooden spoon, mix well until all the pasta is coated with the sauce.

Into a greased 13- by 9-inch baking dish, pour the pasta with cream sauce.  Smooth out top and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup fontina.  Dot the top with diced butter and bake in oven for 25 minutes or until bubbling and the top is golden brown.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  softened unsalted butter
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1              pinch  sea salt

In a bowl of a food processor add flour, butter, Parmesan cheese, rosemary and salt.  Pulse until crumbly, but sticks together when pressed with fingers.  Pour onto a floured pastry board and gather into a ball.  Cover it with plastic wrap and allow dough to rest in refrigerator for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Remove dough from the refrigerator and allow it to warm slightly, about 10 minutes.  Place rested dough on a lightly floured pastry board and roll out to 1/2-inch thickness.  Line a baking sheet with a silpat mat or parchment paper.  Using a 2-inch cookie cutter, cut out circles and place them on the baking sheet, 1-inch apart.  Gather dough scraps into a ball.  Roll out leftover dough and cut additional circles.  Continue until all the dough is used.  If the dough becomes too soft and the butter starts to melt, place it back into the refrigerator to firm up again.

Place in oven and bake 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown.

This recipe yields 26 savory cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dried Italian-style bread crumbs
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     2/3           cup  grated Pecorino Romano
     1/3           cup  grated provolone
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  flank steak
  1                cup  dry white wine
  3 1/4           cups  Simple Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        = (or store-bought marinara sauce)

Stir the first 5 ingredients in a medium bowl to blend.  Stir in 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Season mixture with salt and pepper and set aside.

Lay the flank steak flat on the work surface.  Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture evenly over the steak to cover the top evenly.  Starting at 1 short end, roll up the steak as for a jelly roll to enclose the filling completely.  Using butcher's twine, tie the steak roll to secure.  Sprinkle the braciole with salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium heat.  Add the braciole and cook until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes.  Add the wine to the pan and bring to a boil.  Stir in the marinara sauce.  Cover partially with foil and bake until the meat is almost tender, turning the braciole and basting with the sauce every 30 minutes.  After 1 hour, uncover and continue baking until the meat is tender, about 30 minutes longer.  The total cooking time should be about 1 1/2 hours.

Remove the braciole from the sauce.  Using a large sharp knife, cut the braciole crosswise and diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Transfer the slices to plates.  Spoon the sauce over and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Cover partially with foil and bake until the meat is almost tender, turning the braciole and basting with the sauce every 30 minutes.  After 1 hour, uncover and continue baking until the meat is tender, about 30 minutes longer.  The total cooking time should be about 1 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the braciole from the sauce.  Using a large sharp knife, cut the braciole crosswise and diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Transfer the slices to plates.  Spoon the sauce over and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  broccoli florets - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
     1/2         pound  green beans
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced thin
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes -- plus more if desired
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large pot, bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil.  Have ready a large bowl of ice water.  Place broccoli into pot and cook for 2 minutes.  You just want to parboil the broccoli at this point since you will saute it later on.  Using a spider strainer, remove broccoli from pot and shock it in a bowl of ice water.  When broccoli is completely cool, place it in a colander and allow to drain.

Refresh the bowl of ice water.  Bring the water back to a boil.  Add green beans and cook for 4 minutes.  Like the broccoli, you just want to parboil the green beans.  Remove green beans from pot with spider strainer and add to ice water.  When green beans are completely cool, add them to the colander and allow to drain.

In a large saute pan, heat olive oil.  When almost smoking, add the garlic and saute for about 45 seconds.  When the garlic starts to brown, remove immediately and discard.  Overcooking the garlic will impart a very bitter taste to the dish.  Add the red pepper flakes, broccoli and green beans to the pan and cook for 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     chicken cutlets - (3 oz ea) -- pounded to evenly
                        flatten
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     paper-thin prosciutto slices
  1                     box frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
  1                can  low-salt chicken broth - (14 oz)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice

Place the chicken cutlets flat on the work surface.  Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper.  Lay 1 slice of prosciutto atop each chicken cutlet.

Squeeze the frozen spinach to remove the excess water.  Season the spinach with salt and pepper.  In a small bowl, toss the spinach with 1 tablespoon of oil to coat.

Arrange an even, thin layer of spinach atop the prosciutto slices.  Sprinkle the Parmesan evenly over each.  Beginning at the short tapered end, roll up each chicken cutlet as for a jellyroll.  Secure with a toothpick.

Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a heavy large skillet over high heat.  Add the chicken and cook just until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Add the chicken broth and lemon juice, and scrape the browned bits off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Bring the liquid to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium.  Cover and simmer until the chicken is just cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Transfer the chicken to a platter.

Simmer the cooking liquid over high heat until it is reduced to about 2/3 cup, about 5 minutes.  Season the cooking liquid with salt and pepper, to taste.  Remove toothpicks from the chicken.  Drizzle the reduced cooking liquid over the chicken and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1                     container mascarpone cheese -- (6 ounces)
     2/3           cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        Chocolate Zabaglione -- (listed below)
  2 1/2           cups  espresso coffee -- warmed
  24                    crisp ladyfinger cookies
                        = (Savoiardi recommended)
                        Unsweetened cocoa powder -- for garnish
                        Dark chocolate shavings -- for garnish
                        === CHOCOLATE ZABAGLIONE ===
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream or heavy cream
     1/4           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  dry Marsala
  1              pinch  salt

Place the mascarpone cheese in a large bowl and set aside.  With an electric mixer, beat the cream and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone.  Then fold in the chilled Chocolate Zabaglione.  Cover and refrigerate.

Whisk the warmed espresso and the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar in another medium bowl until blended.  Line a 9 1/4- by 5- by 2 3/4-inch metal loaf pan with plastic wrap, allowing the plastic to extend over the sides.  Working with 1 cookie at a time, dip 8 cookies into the espresso, and arrange in a single layer side by side over the bottom of the prepared pan.

Spoon 1/3 of the mascarpone mixture over the cookies to cover.  Repeat dipping 8 of the cookies in the espresso and layering the cookies and remaining mascarpone mixture 2 more times.  Dip the remaining 8 cookies in the espresso and arrange side by side atop the tiramisu.  Press lightly to compact slightly (the last layer will extend above the pan sides).  Cover the tiramisu with plastic and refrigerate at least 6 hours.

Unwrap the plastic from atop the tiramisu.  Invert the tiramisu onto a platter.  Remove the plastic.  Sift the cocoa over the tiramisu, and with a vegetable peeler or sharp knife, make dark chocolate shavings and sprinkle over top.

Chocolate Zabaglione:  Add cream and chocolate to a heavy small saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the chocolate chips are melted and smooth.  Set aside and keep warm.

Whisk the egg yolks, sugar, Marsala, and salt in a large glass bowl until blended.  Set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, but do not allow the bottom of the bowl to touch the water.  Whisk the egg mixture over the simmering water until it is thick and creamy, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Using a large rubber spatula, fold the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture.  Cover and refrigerate to chill completely.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Place the mascarpone cheese in a large bowl and set aside.  With an electric mixer, beat the cream and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a medium bowl until soft peaks form.  Fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone.  Then fold in the chilled Chocolate Zabaglione.  Cover and refrigerate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk the warmed espresso and the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar in another medium bowl until blended.  Line a 9 1/4- by 5- by 2 3/4-inch metal loaf pan with plastic wrap, allowing the plastic to extend over the sides.  Working with 1 cookie at a time, dip 8 cookies into the espresso, and arrange in a single layer side by side over the bottom of the prepared pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon 1/3 of the mascarpone mixture over the cookies to cover.  Repeat dipping 8 of the cookies in the espresso and layering the cookies and remaining mascarpone mixture 2 more times.  Dip the remaining 8 cookies in the espresso and arrange side by side atop the tiramisu.  Press lightly to compact slightly (the last layer will extend above the pan sides).  Cover the tiramisu with plastic and refrigerate at least 6 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Unwrap the plastic from atop the tiramisu.  Invert the tiramisu onto a platter.  Remove the plastic.  Sift the cocoa over the tiramisu, and with a vegetable peeler or sharp knife, make dark chocolate shavings and sprinkle over top.

Chocolate Zabaglione:  Add cream and chocolate to a heavy small saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the chocolate chips are melted and smooth.  Set aside and keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk the egg yolks, sugar, Marsala, and salt in a large glass bowl until blended.  Set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, but do not allow the bottom of the bowl to touch the water.  Whisk the egg mixture over the simmering water until it is thick and creamy, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a large rubber spatula, fold the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture.  Cover and refrigerate to chill completely.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  whole raw hazelnuts
  2               cups  sugar
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, plus
                        additional unsalted butter for
                        baking sheets -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  Dutch-process unsweetened cocoa powder -- sieved
  1         tablespoon  honey
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  4                     egg whites - (to 5) -- room temperature
  3             ounces  semisweet chocolate

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.

Spread the hazelnuts in a single layer in a shallow pan and place them in the preheated oven, turning every now and again, until lightly toasted and the skins begin to blister, 15 to 18 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes.  Then, working in batches, rub them between the palms of your hands until the skins loosen and fall away.  (This will take some time and not every bit of skin will rub off.)  Chop the hazelnuts coarsely.

Using a nut mill, blender, or a food processor fitted with the metal blade, grind the hazelnuts to a fine powder.  (If the nuts do become oily, pass them through a sieve to break up any lumps.)  Place in a large mixing bowl and stir in the sugar.

Add the butter, cocoa, honey, and vanilla and mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon.  Add the egg whites, a little at a time, mixing well after each addition.  Add only enough of the whites for the dough to take on the consistency of a loose paste or spritz cookie dough.  Do not worry if all of the egg whites are not used.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or grease them with butter.  Spoon the hazelnut mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a No. 6 star tip.  Pipe out rosettes 1 inch in diameter onto the prepared sheets, spacing the rosettes about 1 1/2 inches apart.  You should have about 60 rosettes in all.  Let the rosettes sit, uncovered, at room temperature overnight.

Preheat an oven to 375 degrees.

Bake the cookies in the preheated oven until firm to the touch but still moist inside, 8 to 10 minutes.  When they are done they will not brown and may even look undercooked, so you must test by touch.  Remove to wire racks to cool completely.

Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in the top pan of a double boiler placed over simmering water.  Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.  Gently turn half of the cookies top-sides down on a flat surface and spread about 1/2 teaspoon chocolate on each of the upturned bottoms.  As each cookie is coated, press a plain cookie onto the chocolate, bottom-side down, to form a "sandwich".  Lay the cookies on their sides on a tray or flat plate and refrigerate for 15 minutes to set the chocolate.  Store in a covered container, at room temperature, for up to 1 week.

This recipe yields about 30 cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BECHAMEL SAUCE ===
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  whole milk -- room temperature
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1 1/2           cups  Simple Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === LASAGNA ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  ground chuck beef
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  ricotta cheese
  3              large  eggs
  1              pound  lasagna sheets -- cooked al dente
  2           packages  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz ea) -- thawed, squeezed dry
  3               cups  shredded mozzarella
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Bechamel Sauce:  In a 2-quart pot, melt 5 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.  When butter has completely melted, add the flour and whisk until smooth, about 2 minutes.  Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to prevent any lumps from forming.  Continue to simmer and whisk over medium heat until the sauce is thick, smooth and creamy, about 10 minutes.  The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of wooden spoon.  Remove from heat and add the nutmeg and tomato sauce.  Stir until well combined and check for seasoning.  Set aside and allow to cool completely.

Lasagna:  In a saute pan, heat extra-virgin olive oil.  When almost smoking, add the ground beef and season with salt and pepper.  Brown meat, breaking any large lumps, until it is no longer pink.  Remove from heat and drain any excess fat.  Set aside and allow to cool completely.

In a medium-sized bowl, thoroughly mix the ricotta and eggs.  Season with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

Into the bottom of a 13- by 9-inch baking dish, spread 1/3 of the bechamel sauce.  Arrange the pasta sheets side by side, covering the bottom of the baking dish.  Evenly spread a layer of all the ricotta mixture and then a layer of all the spinach.  Arrange another layer of pasta sheets and spread all the ground beef on top.  Sprinkle 1/2 the mozzarella cheese on top of the beef.  Spread another 1/3 of the bechamel sauce.  Arrange the final layer of pasta sheets and top with remaining bechamel, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.  Cut the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter into 1/4-inch cubes and top lasagna.

Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.  Place lasagna dish on top, cover and put on the middle rack of the oven and bake until top is bubbling, about 30 minutes.  Remove cover and continue to bake for about 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Bechamel Sauce:  In a 2-quart pot, melt 5 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.  When butter has completely melted, add the flour and whisk until smooth, about 2 minutes.  Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to prevent any lumps from forming.  Continue to simmer and whisk over medium heat until the sauce is thick, smooth and creamy, about 10 minutes.  The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of wooden spoon.  Remove from heat and add the nutmeg and tomato sauce.  Stir until well combined and check for seasoning.  Set aside and allow to cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lasagna:  In a saute pan, heat extra-virgin olive oil.  When almost smoking, add the ground beef and season with salt and pepper.  Brown meat, breaking any large lumps, until it is no longer pink.  Remove from heat and drain any excess fat.  Set aside and allow to cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium-sized bowl, thoroughly mix the ricotta and eggs.  Season with salt and pepper.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Into the bottom of a 13- by 9-inch baking dish, spread 1/3 of the bechamel sauce.  Arrange the pasta sheets side by side, covering the bottom of the baking dish.  Evenly spread a layer of all the ricotta mixture and then a layer of all the spinach.  Arrange another layer of pasta sheets and spread all the ground beef on top.  Sprinkle 1/2 the mozzarella cheese on top of the beef.  Spread another 1/3 of the bechamel sauce.  Arrange the final layer of pasta sheets and top with remaining bechamel, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.  Cut the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter into 1/4-inch cubes and top lasagna.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.  Place lasagna dish on top, cover and put on the middle rack of the oven and bake until top is bubbling, about 30 minutes.  Remove cover and continue to bake for about 15 minutes.

                       Crostata With Raspberry Jam

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  ice water
                        Flour for dusting -- as needed
  1                jar  raspberry preserves - (3/4 cup)
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  sliced almonds -- toasted
                        Powdered sugar for dusting -- (optional)

Mix the flour, sugar, and lemon peel, in a food processor.  Add the butter.  Pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.  Add salt.  Pulse in the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until moist clumps form.  Gather the dough into a ball; flatten into a disk.  Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.

Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Roll out the dough on a floured surface to an 11-inch round.  Transfer the dough onto a heavy baking sheet that has been lined with a silpat or parchment paper.  Stir the lemon juice into the preserve and spread the preserves on top of dough, leaving a 2-inch border.  Fold the dough border over the filling to form an 8-inch round, pleating loosely and pinching to seal any cracks in the dough.

Bake the crostata until the crust is golden, 35 to 40 minutes.  Allow to cool.  Sprinkle with the almonds and dust with the powdered sugar, if you wish.  Slide a metal spatula under the crust to free the crostata from the baking sheet and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  3             medium  eggplants - (abt 4 lbs total)
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Canned vegetable spray
  32            ounces  ricotta cheese
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/2           cup  shredded mozzarella
  8        tablespoons  grated Parmesan
  3        tablespoons  toasted pine nuts
  20                    basil leaves -- chiffonaded
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
  2               cups  Simple Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)

Preheat the grill pan and preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place a rack over a large baking sheet.  Cut the 2 ends off the eggplant.  Cut the eggplants lengthwise, into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Arrange eggplant slices onto rack.  Sprinkle with sea salt to help remove excess moisture and any bitterness from the eggplants.  Set aside for about 10 to 15 minutes.  Rinse off the salt from the eggplants and pat dry with a towel.  Spray hot grill pan liberally with vegetable spray and then place eggplant slices on the grill until lightly browned on each side and tender, about 4 minutes per side.  Remove slices from the grill pan and allow to cool.

In a large bowl, beat eggs until lightly scrambled.  Mix the ricotta in with the egg.  Add mozzarella, 3 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese and toasted pine nuts and gently combine.  Fold in basil just to combine.  Do not overmix.

Place a tablespoon of the cheese mixture on 1 end of the eggplant and roll up tightly.  Place the eggplant rollatini into a greased (with olive oil) 13- by 9-inch baking dish, seam-side down.  Continue with remaining eggplant.  Evenly distribute the tomato sauce on top of the eggplant rollatini.  Season with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle with remaining 5 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese and bake for 15 minutes.  When cooked, drizzle the top with extra-virgin olive oil.

                   Espresso Granita With Whipped Cream

Categories    : Desserts                        Ices/Sorbets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  hot espresso
     2/3           cup  granulated sugar
  2               cups  heavy whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4          teaspoons  confectioners' sugar
  2             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- grated or shaved
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- for garnish

In a 13- by 9-inch glass baking dish, carefully pour in hot espresso and whisk in granulated sugar until dissolved completely.  Place dish in freezer and every hour, scrape the mixture with a large fork to create the granita texture.  The granita will need approximately five hours to completely freeze.  The first time you scrape, the granita will not be frozen solid.  You want to start scraping while it's still slushy so that texture of the granita will be even throughout.

Right before serving, make the whipped cream.  In a large bowl, using an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream until soft peaks.  Add the vanilla extract and confectioners' sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks.

Line up 12 glass Champagne flutes.  Place 1 tablespoon of granita in the bottom of each glass.  Using a different spoon, spread a layer of whipped cream.  Continue layering the granita and whipped cream, ending with the whipped cream.  Sprinkle chocolate over the top of each glass.  Garnish with a sprig of mint.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- plus a pinch
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  12            ounces  asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1/4" to 1/2" pieces
  1                     tomato -- seeded, diced
                        Salt -- to taste

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  3                     firm but ripe peaches -- pitted, quartered
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  brandy
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2           cup  mascarpone cheese -- room temperature
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     3/4           cup  dry white wine

Place a grill pan over medium-high heat or prepare the barbecue (medium-high heat).  Lightly brush the grill pan or rack with oil.  Place the peaches on the grill pan and do not move the peaches, otherwise you will not have those great grill marks.  It takes about 2 to 3 minutes per side to get those grill marks.  Grill the peaches until the grill marks are formed, slightly softened and heated through, about 5 to 6 minutes total.

Meanwhile, stir the sugar, brandy, and lemon juice in a medium bowl to blend.  Set the brandy mixture aside.

As the peaches are ready, remove them from the grill and place them in a shallow baking dish.  Top them with the brandy mixture, and toss to coat.  Set aside for 15 minutes and allow to marinate, tossing occasionally.

Meanwhile, stir the mascarpone and vanilla in a small bowl to blend.

Divide the grilled peach mixture equally among 6 coupe dishes.  Pour the wine over the peaches.  Dollop the mascarpone mixture atop the peaches, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh marjoram leaves
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12            ounces  sea scallops
  12            ounces  squid -- bodies only
  3             ounces  arugula leaves - (abt 6 cups)
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into thin strips
     1/2                yellow bell pepper -- cut thin strips
  1                can  white cannellini beans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
  1              large  radicchio head -- leaves separated

Heat the oil in a heavy medium skillet over medium-low heat.  Add the garlic, let it cook for 1 to 2 minutes and then add the herbs and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Cool to room temperature.  Whisk in the lemon juice.  Season the dressing with salt and pepper, to taste.

Prepare the barbecue (medium-high heat).  Pat the scallops and squid dry with paper towels and thread them onto skewers.  Brush them with 2 tablespoons of the dressing.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill the scallops and squid until just cooked through, turning once, 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Cool completely.  Cut the squid crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide rings.

Combine the arugula, carrots, bell peppers, and cannellini beans in a large bowl.  Toss with 1/2 cup of the dressing to coat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     red bell peppers -- seeded and halved
  3                     yellow squash - (abt 1 lb total) -- sliced lengthwise
                        into 1/2"-thk rectangles
  3                     zucchini - (abt 12 oz total) -- sliced lengthwise
                        into 1/2"-thk rectangles
  3                     Japanese eggplant - (12 oz total) -- sliced lengthwise
                        into 1/2"-thk rectangles
  12                    cremini mushrooms
  1              bunch  asparagus - (abt 1 lb) -- trimmed
  12                    green onions -- roots cut off
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves

Place a grill pan over medium-high heat or prepare the barbecue (medium-high heat).  Brush the vegetables with 1/4 cup of the oil to coat lightly.  Sprinkle the vegetables with salt and pepper.  Working in batches, grill the vegetables until tender and lightly charred all over, about 8 to 10 minutes for the bell peppers; 7 minutes for the yellow squash, zucchini, eggplant, and mushrooms; 4 minutes for the asparagus and green onions.  Arrange the vegetables on a platter.  The key to getting those great grill marks is to not shift the vegetables too frequently once they've been placed on the hot grill.

Meanwhile, whisk the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, parsley, basil, and rosemary in a small bowl to blend.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Drizzle the herb mixture over the vegetables.  Serve the vegetables, warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINATED STRAWBERRIES ===
  1              quart  fresh strawberries -- halved
     1/3           cup  aged balsamic vinegar
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
  3               cups  heavy cream
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  1                     fresh pound cake - (16 oz)
     1/3           cup  amaretto liqueur
  2                     amaretto cookies -- for garnish
                        Demerara sugar -- for garnish

In a small shallow casserole dish, toss the strawberries with vinegar and let stand at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes.  After the strawberries have marinated, check for sweetness, adding sugar if desired.

In a large bowl using an electric mixer, whisk the cream to soft peaks.  Add the vanilla and confectioners' sugar.  Whip until stiff peaks.  Set aside.

Using a serrated knife, slice pound cake lengthwise into 1/2-inch thick slices.  You will only need 4 slices.  Using a 2-inch cookie cutter, cut out circles from each cake slice.  Line up 2 high ball glasses and place 1 cake circle in the bottom of each.  Brush cakes with amaretto liqueur.  Add 2 tablespoons of marinated strawberries and spread evenly.  Using a different tablespoon, add a large dollop of whipped cream and spread evenly.  Add a second layer of cake, pressing down lightly.  Brush with amaretto liqueur.  Add 2 tablespoons of marinated strawberries and spread evenly.  Top with a large dollop of whipped cream, spreading evenly.  Use remaining cake, cream and strawberries to create a more humble trifle dish.

Cover trifles with plastic wrap and refrigerate for impromptu indulgence, keeping in mind that it will store for up to 2 days.

To serve, remove and discard plastic wrap.  Grate amaretto cookie on top and sprinkle with demerara sugar.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- finely chopped
  1             medium  carrot -- finely chopped
  1             medium  zucchini -- finely chopped
  1             medium  summer squash -- finely chopped
  8                     asparagus spears -- cut 1/4" slices
  1              pound  fresh plain lasagna sheets
  2               cups  Simple Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1 1/2           cups  canned white beans -- rinsed, drained
  2           packages  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz ea) -- thawed, squeezed dry
  3               cups  shredded mozzarella
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- halved
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a saute pan over medium heat, add extra-virgin olive oil.  When almost smoking, add the onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the carrot and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the zucchini and squash cook for 5 minutes.  Add asparagus and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from heat when all vegetables are completely cooked but still have a good crunch.  Allow to cool.

Using a 6-inch round cookie cutter, cut circles out of the lasagna sheets.  You will need 18 circles.  Coat the bottom of 6 (6-inch) gratin dishes with a teaspoon of tomato sauce in each.  Place a circle of pasta on the bottom of each ramekin.  Rinse the beans with water and season with salt and pepper.  Divide the beans between each ramekin.  Next, divide the spinach between the ramekins.  Place a second layer of pasta on top and gently press down.  Divide the sauteed vegetables among the ramekins and top with a tablespoon of tomato sauce in each.  Place the third layer of pasta in each ramekin and coat with a tablespoon of tomato sauce.  Sprinkle ramekins with the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, and top each with 1/2 tablespoon of butter.  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place gratin dishes on top.  Bake in oven for 20 minutes or until brown and bubbling.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
     1/2         ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  finely-chopped onions
  10            ounces  white mushrooms -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2           cups  Arborio rice
                        = (or short-grain white rice)
     2/3           cup  dry white wine
     3/4           cup  frozen peas -- thawed
     2/3           cup  grated Parmesan
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring the broth to a simmer in a heavy medium saucepan.  Add the porcini mushrooms.  Set aside until the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes.  Keep the broth warm over very low heat.

Melt the butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add olive oil.  Add the onions and saute until tender, about 8 minutes.  Add the white mushrooms and garlic.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the porcini mushrooms to a cutting board.  Finely chop the mushrooms and add to the saucepan.  Saute until the mushrooms are tender and the juices evaporate, about 5 minutes.

Stir in the rice and let it toast for a few minutes.  Add the wine; cook until the liquid is absorbed, stirring often, about 2 minutes.  Add 1 cup of hot broth; simmer over medium-low heat until the liquid is absorbed, stirring often, about 3 minutes.  Continue to cook until the rice is just tender and the mixture is creamy, adding more broth by cupfuls and stirring often, about 28 minutes (the rice will absorb 6 to 8 cups of broth).  Stir in the peas.  Mix in the Parmesan.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried orecchiette
                        = (or other small shaped pasta)
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     2/3           cup  Italian seasoned dried bread crumbs
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
  1                cup  finely-chopped prosciutto
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves

In a large pot, bring to a boil 6 quarts of salted water.  Cook pasta until al dente, about 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium-sized saute pan, heat the oil until warm.  Since the bread crumbs will cook quickly, you don't want to add them into a hot pan, otherwise they can burn.  Add the breadcrumbs and stir constantly.  Season lightly with salt and pepper since flavored bread crumbs may already have seasoning.  Saute for about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and set aside.

Drain pasta in a colander.  Working quickly, add pasta to the saute pan and stir to combine.  Add Parmesan and the chopped prosciutto.  Mix thoroughly.  Pour into large serving bowl and garnish with chopped parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2            bunches  broccoli rabe -- stems trimmed
  1              pound  orecchiette pasta
  3        tablespoons  olive oil

Meanwhile, when the reserved cooking water is boiling, add the orecchiette and cook until al dente, tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.

Strain the broccoli rabe and add it to the pan with the sausage mixture and toss to coat with the juices.  Add the pasta to the skillet.  Stir in the Parmesan and serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
  1                     dry bay leaf
  2                     whole cloves
                        Cheesecloth -- as needed
                        Kitchen twine -- for bouquet garni
                        and tying the veal shanks
  3              whole  veal shanks - (abt 1 lb per shank) -- trimmed
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        All-purpose flour -- for dredging
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  1              small  onion -- diced 1/2" cubes
  1              small  carrot -- diced 1/2" cubes
  1                     celery stalk -- diced 1/2" cubes
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1                cup  dry white wine
  3               cups  chicken stock
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest

Place the rosemary, thyme, bay leaf and cloves into cheesecloth and secure with twine.  This will be your bouquet garni.

For the veal shanks, pat dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture.  Veal shanks will brown better when they are dry.  Secure the meat to the bone with the kitchen twine.  Season each shank with salt and freshly ground pepper.  Dredge the shanks in flour, shaking off excess.

In a large Dutch oven pot, heat vegetable oil until smoking.  Add tied veal shanks to the hot pan and brown all sides, about 3 minutes per side.  Remove browned shanks and reserve.

In the same pot, add the onion, carrot and celery.  Season with salt at this point to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables.  Saute until soft and translucent, about 8 minutes.  Add the tomato paste and mix well.  Return browned shanks to the pan and add the white wine and reduce liquid by half, about 5 minutes.  Add the bouquet garni and 2 cups of the chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover pan and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is falling off the bone.  Check every 15 minutes, turning shanks and adding more chicken stock as necessary.  The level of cooking liquid should always be about 3/4 the way up the shank.

Carefully remove the cooked shanks from the pot and place in decorative serving platter.  Cut off the kitchen twine and discard.

Remove and discard bouquet garni from the pot.  Pour all the juices and sauce from the pot over the shanks.  Garnish with chopped parsley and lemon zest.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Place the rosemary, thyme, bay leaf and cloves into cheesecloth and secure with twine.  This will be your bouquet garni.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the veal shanks, pat dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture.  Veal shanks will brown better when they are dry.  Secure the meat to the bone with the kitchen twine.  Season each shank with salt and freshly ground pepper.  Dredge the shanks in flour, shaking off excess.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large Dutch oven pot, heat vegetable oil until smoking.  Add tied veal shanks to the hot pan and brown all sides, about 3 minutes per side.  Remove browned shanks and reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the same pot, add the onion, carrot and celery.  Season with salt at this point to help draw out the moisture from the vegetables.  Saute until soft and translucent, about 8 minutes.  Add the tomato paste and mix well.  Return browned shanks to the pan and add the white wine and reduce liquid by half, about 5 minutes.  Add the bouquet garni and 2 cups of the chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover pan and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is falling off the bone.  Check every 15 minutes, turning shanks and adding more chicken stock as necessary.  The level of cooking liquid should always be about 3/4 the way up the shank.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Carefully remove the cooked shanks from the pot and place in decorative serving platter.  Cut off the kitchen twine and discard.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove and discard bouquet garni from the pot.  Pour all the juices and sauce from the pot over the shanks.  Garnish with chopped parsley and lemon zest.

                           Penne A La Carbonara

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  pancetta -- diced 1" cubes
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     eggs -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- room temperature
  1 1/4            cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1              pound  dried penne
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves

Heat a large saute pan, until hot.  Add pancetta and saute until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes.  Season with black pepper and remove pan from heat.

In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and cream.  Season with salt and pepper.  Stir in Parmesan, reserving 2 tablespoons for garnish.

In a large pot, boil 6 quarts of salted boiling water.  Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain pasta in a colander.  Do not rinse with water; you want to retain the pasta's natural starches so that the sauce will stick.

While the pasta is still hot, return it back to the pot.  Add the browned pancetta and mix well.  Add the cream mixture and coat the pasta completely.  It's important to work quickly while the pasta is still warm so that the cream mixture will cook, but not curdle.  Add remaining Parmesan and chopped parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  plain dried bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
     3/4           cup  grated Romano
  1              pound  ground turkey -- preferably dark meat
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  5               cups  Simple Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  dried penne pasta

In a large bowl add bread crumbs milk and mix until well combined.  Mix in eggs and 1/2 cup Romano cheese and mix well.  Add turkey and gently combine, being careful not to overwork the meat.  Season with salt and pepper.  Shape into golf-size balls.

In a large skillet heat the oil over medium-high heat.  When almost smoking, add meatballs and without moving or turning the meat, allow it to brown for about 3 minutes.  Turn meatballs and brown other side.  Continue to cook until all sides are golden brown, about 8 minutes total.  Add tomato sauce and bring to a boil.  Lower heat and allow meatballs to simmer for 5 minutes.  Turn off heat and keep warm on stove.  Be careful not to overhandle the meatballs since they are soft and fragile.

In a large pot, bring to a boil 6 quarts of salted water.  Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes.  Drain pasta in a colander.  Do not rinse pasta with water since you want to retain the pasta natural starches so that the sauce will cling to the penne.

Remove meatballs from sauce and place in serving bowl.  Pour some tomato sauce over meatballs, but leave about 1 cup of sauce in skillet.  Place the cooked penne into the skillet with the remaining sauce and toss well.  Pour sauced pasta into a large serving bowl.  Serve alongside the meatballs.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  water
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2           cups  yellow cornmeal
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/2           cup  heavy whipping cream
  3             ounces  mild Gorgonzola -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in a heavy large saucepan.  Add 1 3/4 teaspoons of salt.  Gradually whisk in the cornmeal.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the mixture thickens and the cornmeal is tender, stirring often, about 20 minutes.  After 10 minutes, you can switch to a wooden spoon for easier stirring.

Turn off the heat.  Add the butter, cream and Gorgonzola and stir until the cheese melts.  Season with additional salt and pepper, to taste.  Transfer the polenta to a bowl and serve.

Note:  If you're making the polenta ahead of time, put it on a double boiler and cover it with plastic wrap to keep it warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar -- plus
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  all purpose flour
  3              large  eggs
  1                     container mascarpone cheese - (8 oz)
     3/4           cup  ricotta cheese
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  chocolate-hazelnut spread
                        = (such as Nutella)
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  hazelnuts -- toasted, husked,
                        and chopped

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Line a heavy large baking sheet with a silpat or parchment paper.  Combine the water, butter, 1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar, and salt in a heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil, stirring until the butter melts.  Add the flour and stir over medium heat for 1 minute.  Cool 5 minutes.

Crack 2 eggs into a measuring cup.  Use a wooden spoon to beat the eggs into the dough, 1 at a time.  Spoon 10 or 12 (1 1/2-inch) mounds of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing 2 inches apart.  Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl to blend.  Gently brush the egg over the dough mounds (do not drip the egg onto the baking sheet).

Bake the pastries until they are amber brown, about 50 minutes.  Allow the pastries to cool completely.

Mix the mascarpone, ricotta, vanilla, and remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar in a medium bowl.  Refrigerate until cold.  Using a serrated knife, cut the tops off the pastry and set aside.  Spoon the mascarpone mixture into the pastries and top with its lid.

Combine the chocolate-hazelnut spread and cream in a small bowl.  Heat in the microwave for about 30 seconds until warm.  Stir the mixture.  Spoon the chocolate-hazelnut sauce atop the pastries.  Sprinkle with the hazelnuts and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  cantaloupe - (abt 3 lbs)
  1             medium  honeydew - (abt 3 lbs)
  1 1/2         pounds  thinly-sliced prosciutto - (abt 36 slices)
  2            bunches  fresh chives -- blanch 36 and save
                        remaining for garnish

Working with 1 melon at a time, cut in halves.  Gently scrape out seeds and membrane and discard.  Using a melon baller, scoop out rounds from flesh and place in large bowl.  Discard skin.

Keep the prosciutto loosely covered with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out as you start to assemble 1 purse at a time.  Place 1 melon ball in the center of a prosciutto slice, gather all sides to the top and secure with a blanched chive.  It may be necessary to overlap a few pieces of prosciutto in order to completely wrap the melon ball.  Place finished purse, seam-side down onto a baking sheet and keep covered.  Repeat with remaining prosciutto and melons.  Can make it only up to 2 hours ahead of time because the salt in the prosciutto will break down the melon.

Scatter the chives onto a decorative platter.  Place prosciutto purses on top and serve.

This recipe yields 36 purses, 12 servings.

Line a heavy large baking sheet with a silpat (nonstick baking mat) or parchment paper.  Tear the dough along the perforations into strips.  Using a pizza cutter or a large sharp knife, cut each dough strip in half lengthwise to form thin strips.  Working with 1 dough strip at a time, roll each dough strip in the Parmesan cheese and twist.  Transfer the dough strips to the prepared baking sheets.

Bake until the breadsticks are golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes.  Cool the breadsticks completely on the baking sheet.

Before serving, wrap 1 slice of prosciutto around each cooled breadstick.  Arrange the prosciutto-wrapped breadsticks on a platter.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

             Pumpkin Ravioli With Sage And Toasted Hazelnuts

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  peeled hazelnuts
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  1              pound  fresh pumpkin ravioli
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  6                     fresh sage leaves
                        A large pinch grated nutmeg
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
  2                     amaretti cookies

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Spread hazelnuts onto a baking tray.  Toast hazelnuts in oven until light golden brown and fragrant, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Allow to cool completely.  Coarsely chop the cooled hazelnuts and set aside.

In a 10- or 12-inch saute pan with high sides, bring 2 quarts of salted water to a boil.  Add the vegetable oil to prevent the ravioli from sticking to one another.  Add ravioli and cook for 4 minutes or until they float to the top.  Using a spider strainer, carefully remove ravioli to a large platter and tent with foil to keep warm.

In a small saute pan, melt the butter.  When butter is sizzling and starts to brown, tear sage leaves into the pan and fry for about 20 seconds.  Remove from heat and stir in nutmeg.  Pour butter sauce over ravioli and sprinkle with toasted hazelnuts.  Grate amaretti cookies over the dish and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              whole  chicken - (abt 4 lbs) -- cut into pieces
                        = (giblets, neck and backbone reserved
                        for another use)
     1/2           cup  low-salt chicken broth
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley leaves

Whisk the vinegar, mustard, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper in small bowl to blend.  Combine the vinaigrette and chicken pieces in a large resealable plastic bag; seal the bag and toss to coat.  Refrigerate, turning the chicken pieces occasionally, for at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Remove chicken from the bag and arrange the chicken pieces on a large greased baking dish.  Roast until the chicken is just cooked through, about 1 hour.  If your chicken browns too quickly, cover it with foil for the remaining cooking time.  Transfer the chicken to a serving platter.

Place the baking dish on a burner over medium-low heat.  Whisk the chicken broth into the pan drippings, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the baking sheet with a wooden spoon and mixing them into the broth and pan drippings.  Drizzle the pan drippings over the chicken.  Sprinkle the lemon zest and parsley over the chicken, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              whole  red snapper - (abt 3 lbs) -- cleaned, scaled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     lemon -- halved
     1/2         small  onion -- chopped
     1/2         small  fennel bulb -- chopped
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  chopped fennel fronds
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1              small  garlic clove -- minced

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Line a heavy large baking sheet with foil.  Oil the foil and fish with 1 tablespoon of oil.  Place the fish atop the foil.  Sprinkle the fish cavity with salt and pepper.  Squeeze 1/2 of the lemon inside the fish cavity.  Fill the cavity with the onion, fennel and rosemary sprigs.  Bake until the fish is just cooked through at the bone, about 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, squeeze the remaining lemon half into a small bowl.  Whisk in the fennel fronds, rosemary, and garlic.  Gradually whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil.  Season the lemon sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Using a sharp knife, separate the 2 fillets from the backbone.  Using a metal spatula, transfer the top fillets to a plate.  Lift the fish backbone from the bottom fillets (the backbone and head should come off together easily), and discard.  Using the spatula, transfer the remaining fillets to plates.  Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper.  Drizzle the lemon sauce over the fish and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Line a heavy large baking sheet with foil.  Oil the foil and fish with 1 tablespoon of oil.  Place the fish atop the foil.  Sprinkle the fish cavity with salt and pepper.  Squeeze 1/2 of the lemon inside the fish cavity.  Fill the cavity with the onion, fennel and rosemary sprigs.  Bake until the fish is just cooked through at the bone, about 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, squeeze the remaining lemon half into a small bowl.  Whisk in the fennel fronds, rosemary, and garlic.  Gradually whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil.  Season the lemon sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Using a sharp knife, separate the 2 fillets from the backbone.  Using a metal spatula, transfer the top fillets to a plate.  Lift the fish backbone from the bottom fillets (the backbone and head should come off together easily), and discard.  Using the spatula, transfer the remaining fillets to plates.  Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper.  Drizzle the lemon sauce over the fish and serve.

Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1                     carrot -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, smashed
  2                     garlic cloves minced
  2               cans  chopped tomatoes in their juice - -- (8 oz ea)
  1             bottle  clam juice - (8 oz)
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  water
  2               cups  plain couscous
  2             pounds  large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1         tablespoon  red pepper flakes
                        Chopped parsley leaves -- for garnish

In a large pot, heat 1/4 cup olive oil.  When almost smoking, add onion, carrot and 1 clove smashed garlic and saute until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the canned tomatoes and their juice, clam juice and white wine.  Bring to a boil and simmer on medium heat for 10 minutes, uncovered.  Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.  Carefully pour tomato mixture in the bowl of a food processor and puree.  Add a couple of tablespoons of water if needed ó you want to end up with a broth.  Check for seasoning.

Return broth to the pot.  Add 1 cup of water and 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and add 2 cups couscous.  Cover pot and remove from heat.  Let rest for 10 minutes, allowing the couscous to absorb all the liquid.  Fluff with a fork and season with salt and pepper.

In a large skillet, add the remaining 1/4 cup oil and the 2 cloves of minced garlic.  Heat the oil, making sure not to burn the garlic.  When the oil is hot, add the shrimp and stirring occasionally, cook the shrimp until they start to turn pink, about 5 minutes.  Be careful not to overcook the shrimp or they will become tough.  Remove from heat and add the lemon juice, red pepper and chopped parsley.  Check for seasoning.

To serve, mound the couscous in the center of a platter and top with the shrimp.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

        Seared Rib-Eye Steak With Arugula And Roasted Pepper Salad

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis

Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        extra for brushing
  2                     beef 1"-thk rib-eye steaks - (16 oz ea)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  arugula -- washed, spun dry
  1 1/2           cups  roasted peppers -- rinsed, patted dry
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  8             ounces  Parmesan block

In a large saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Season steaks with salt and pepper.  When pan starts to smoke, carefully add steaks.  Allow the steaks to cook for about 3 to 4 minutes on 1 side, without moving or piercing the meat.  This will help create a good, crusty sear.  When steaks are brown, flip and sear the other side for 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove meat to a large plate and allow to rest for 10 minutes.

Decoratively line a large platter with arugula.  Tear the roasted peppers into large pieces and scatter over the arugula.  In a small bowl, whisk in the remaining olive oil, balsamic vinegar and any meat juices that may have collected on the plate from the steaks.  Season with salt and pepper.

Slice the steaks across the grain and on a bias into 1 1/2-inch thick pieces.  Lay the slices on top of the salad and drizzle with dressing.  Using a vegetable peeler, shave Parmesan over the dish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  fresh arugula
  1                     garlic clove
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan

Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large saute pan.  When almost smoking, add shallots and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes, being careful not to burn the garlic.  Add the clams and wine.  Cover and simmer for 6 to 8 minutes or until most clams have opened.

Add 2 tablespoons chopped parsley.  Whisk in butter to thicken sauce slightly.

Drain pasta in a colander.  Do not rinse pasta with water ó this will remove the pasta's natural starches.  Place pasta into the clam saute pan and mix thoroughly.  Check seasoning.

Pour pasta into large serving bowl.  Zest lemon over the dish, being carefull not to zest the white part of the lemon, which is bitter.  Garnish with remaining parsley.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried spaghetti
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1         tablespoon  red pepper flakes -- plus more if desired
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh mint leaves

In a large pot, bring to a boil 6 quarts of salted water.  Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Drain pasta in a colander, reserving 2 tablespoons of the pasta water.  The reserved pasta water will help create the sauce.  Do not rinse pasta with water ó you want to retain the pasta's natural starches so that the sauce will stick.

In a large saute pan, heat olive oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic and saute until light brown and fragrant.  It's important not too burn the garlic or else it will become bitter.  Remove and discard the browned garlic.  Add the red pepper flakes and saute for 1 minute.  Carefully add the reserved pasta water and stir to combine.  Place the spaghetti into the pan and mix well for 1 minute.

Remove pan from heat and top with fresh herbs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- for boiling water
  6             ounces  button mushrooms -- sliced
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed, squeezed dry
     1/4           cup  mascarpone
     1/3           cup  grated Parmesan -- plus
                        extra for garnishing
  6                     egg roll wrappers - (6 1/2" by 6 1/2")
  2              large  eggs -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped mushroom
                        = (cremini, shiitake, button)
  2               cups  Simple Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large saute pan heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil.  When almost smoking, add the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper.  Cook until all the liquid has evaporated from the mushrooms, about 6 minutes.  Add spinach and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and place mixture into the bowl of a food processor.  Pulse until you get a coarse texture.  Place in bowl and stir in mascarpone and Parmesan cheese.  Check for seasoning and set aside.

Line up 3 wrappers on a cutting board.  Brush with the egg and water mixture.  Using a tablespoon, arrange 4 dollops of the filling on each wrapper ó 2 on the first row and 2 on the second ó 1-inch apart.  Place another wrapper directly on top, pressing around the filling and sealing the edges.  Using a fluted ravioli cutter, cut out squares of ravioli.  Each filled wrapper will yield 4 raviolis, giving you a total of 12 ravioli.  Place ravioli onto a floured baking sheet and keep covered with a linen towel.

In a large pot, bring to a boil 4 quarts of salted and oiled water.  Carefully add small batches of ravioli, about 3 to 4 at a time.  This will prevent them from crowding in the pot and sticking together.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Using a spider strainer, carefully remove the ravioli and place on the plate.  Tent with foil to keep warm and continue cooking remaining ravioli.

In a saute pan, heat remaining 1/4 cup olive oil.  When almost smoking, add chopped mushrooms and saute until soft and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes.  Carefully pour in tomato sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.

Divide ravioli between 2 serving plates.  Top with mushroom tomato sauce and sprinkle with Parmesan.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

In a large saute pan heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil.  When almost smoking, add the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper.  Cook until all the liquid has evaporated from the mushrooms, about 6 minutes.  Add spinach and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and place mixture into the bowl of a food processor.  Pulse until you get a coarse texture.  Place in bowl and stir in mascarpone and Parmesan cheese.  Check for seasoning and set aside.

Line up 3 wrappers on a cutting board.  Brush with the egg and water mixture.  Using a tablespoon, arrange 4 dollops of the filling on each wrapper ó 2 on the first row and 2 on the second ó 1-inch apart.  Place another wrapper directly on top, pressing around the filling and sealing the edges.  Using a fluted ravioli cutter, cut out squares of ravioli.  Each filled wrapper will yield 4 raviolis, giving you a total of 12 ravioli.  Place ravioli onto a floured baking sheet and keep covered with a linen towel.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large pot, bring to a boil 4 quarts of salted and oiled water.  Carefully add small batches of ravioli, about 3 to 4 at a time.  This will prevent them from crowding in the pot and sticking together.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Using a spider strainer, carefully remove the ravioli and place on the plate.  Tent with foil to keep warm and continue cooking remaining ravioli.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a saute pan, heat remaining 1/4 cup olive oil.  When almost smoking, add chopped mushrooms and saute until soft and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes.  Carefully pour in tomato sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide ravioli between 2 serving plates.  Top with mushroom tomato sauce and sprinkle with Parmesan.

                             Steak Florentine

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  garlic cloves -- halved
  3                     T-bone steaks, 1 1/2" to 1 3/4" thk - -- (abt 1 1/2 lbs ea)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     lemon -- halved
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
                        Grilled Vegetables -- (see recipe)

Rub the garlic cloves over the meat and the bone of the steaks.  Sprinkle the steaks with salt and pepper.  Place in the refrigerator and allow seasoning to permeate the meat, for about 1 hour.  Remove from the refrigerator at least 20 minutes before grilling, allowing the meat to come to room temperature.

Place a grill pan over high heat or prepare the barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill the steaks until cooked to desired doneness, turning once, about 5 minutes per side for rare, 7 minutes per side for medium-rare.  The key to getting those great grill marks is to place the steak down and not move them.  After you flip them, do not shift the steaks.

Allow the steaks to rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing, otherwise all the juices will be run all over your cutting board.  Run your knife along the bone and carve the meat off the bone.  Slice the meat into 1-inch slices.  Transfer the slices to a platter.  Squeeze the lemon over the steaks.  Drizzle with the oil and serve immediately with Grilled Vegetables.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lemons -- halved
  3              whole  garlic cloves -- smashed
  6              large  artichokes
  1                     lemon -- juiced
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh mint leaves
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  4        tablespoons  drained capers
  6             ounces  Italian bread -- crust trimmed,
                        and bread cut into 1/2" cubes
  2 1/2         pounds  plum tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  12                    fresh Italian parsley sprigs -- for garnish

Squeeze the juice from the lemon halves into a large pot of cold water; add the squeezed lemon halves and the whole garlic.  Cut off the top quarter of each artichoke and discard.  Use a small sharp knife to trim the stem of the artichokes.  Starting at the base, bend the tough outer leaves back and snap off where they break naturally, leaving the tender inner leaves.  Trim the outside of the base until no dark green areas remain.  Cut the artichokes in half and then into quarters.  Cut out the fibrous choke and small purple-tipped leaves.  Submerge the artichoke quarters in the lemon water.  Cover and boil until the artichokes are tender, about 45 minutes.  Drain.  Set the artichoke quarters aside to cool to room temperature.

Mix together lemon juice, herbs, garlic, lemon peel, capers, bread, and tomatoes in a large bowl.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Arrange artichokes, cut-side up, on 2 platters.  Spoon the tomato mixture into the center of the artichoke quarters, dividing equally.  Drizzle with olive oil.  Garnish with the parsley sprigs and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pound  mascarpone cheese
  1 1/2           cups  strong espresso -- cooled
  2          teaspoons  dark rum
  24                    packaged ladyfingers
     1/2           cup  bittersweet chocolate shavings -- for garnish

In a large bowl, using an electric mixer with whisk attachment, beat egg yolks and sugar until thick and pale, about 5 minutes.  Add mascarpone cheese and beat until smooth.  Add 1 tablespoon of espresso and mix until thoroughly combined.

In a small shallow dish, add remaining espresso and rum.  Dip each ladyfinger into espresso for only 5 seconds.  Letting the ladyfingers soak too long will cause them to fall apart.  Place the soaked ladyfinger on the bottom of a 13- by 9-inch baking dish, breaking them in half if necessary in order to fit the bottom.

Spread evenly 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers.  Arrange another layer of soaked ladyfingers and top with remaining mascarpone mixture.

Cover tiramisu with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 8 hours.

Before serving, sprinkle with chocolate shavings.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  4              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  plain dry bread crumbs
  2          teaspoons  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  2             pounds  thinly-sliced veal scallopine
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  vegetable oil
  1                     lemon -- cut into wedges

Preheat oven to 175 degrees.

In a shallow dish, beat eggs and season with salt and pepper.  Pour flour into another shallow dish.  Mix together the bread crumbs, basil and thyme in a third shallow dish.  Have ready one large plate.

Season the veal with salt and pepper.  Working with 1 piece of veal at a time, dip it first in the flour, shaking off excess.  Next, place the floured veal into the beaten eggs, coating completely.  Place the veal into the bread crumb mixture and gently press crumbs into the veal.  Set aside on large plate and continue with remaining veal slices.

In a large skillet with high sides, heat the oil to 375 degrees.  Have ready a baking sheet fitted with a rack.  Carefully place 2 pieces of breaded veal in the hot oil and fry until golden brown on both sides, about 6 to 8 minutes total.  Place cooked veal on rack, season with salt and place in oven to keep warm.  Continue with remaining veal.

Serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsalted softened butter - (2 sticks) -- plus
                        extra for buttering molds
  8             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  instant espresso powder
  4              large  eggs
  4              large  egg yolks
     2/3           cup  granulated sugar
  4          teaspoons  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting molds
  3        tablespoons  Frangelico or hazelnut liqueur
  1                cup  fresh raspberries
  1                cup  fresh strawberries
                        Fresh mint -- for garnish

Butter and lightly flour 6 (6-ounce) ramekins.  Tap out any excess flour.

In a small saucepan, bring to a boil 2 inches of water.  In a large glass bowl, add butter, chocolate and espresso powder.  Lower heat and place bowl over the simmering water.  Slowly whisk mixture until the chocolate is almost completely melted.  Remove bowl from heat and continue to whisk until all chocolate has melted.  Allow to cool slightly.

In a large bowl, add eggs, yolks, and sugar.  Using an electric mixer, beat until light and fluffy and pale in color.  Reduce speed to medium-low and slowly pour in the chocolate mixture.  Add the flour and mix until just combined.  Do not overwork the batter.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Divide the batter between the molds.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Place chocolate molds onto baking sheet and place in oven for 7 minutes.  If not baking immediately, cover chocolate molds with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 8 hours.  When ready to bake, place refrigerated chocolate molds onto baking sheet and place in oven for 10 minutes.  The top and sides should be cooked and dry and the inside will be runny.

Using oven mitts, carefully invert each mold onto a plate and let it sit for 10 seconds.  Then lift 1 corner of the ramekin and the cake should slip out.  Sprinkle about 1/2 teaspoon Frangelico over each cake.  Spoon berries around the chocolate cake and garnish with mint.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     carrots -- peeled, chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
  3             ounces  thinly-sliced pancetta -- coarsely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  Swiss chard -- stems trimmed,
                        and leaves coarsely chopped
  1                     russet potato -- peeled, cubed
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                     fresh rosemary sprig
  1                can  cannellini beans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
  2               cans  low-sodium beef broth - (14 oz ea)
  1              ounce  Parmesan cheese rind piece
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the oil in a heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add the onion, carrots, celery, pancetta, and garlic.  Saute until the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes.  Add the Swiss chard and potato; saute for 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and rosemary sprig.  Simmer until the chard is wilted and the tomatoes break down, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, blend 3/4 cup of the beans with 1/4 cup of the broth in a processor until almost smooth.  Add the pureed bean mixture, remaining broth, and Parmesan cheese rind to the vegetable mixture.  Simmer until the potato pieces are tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Stir in the whole beans and parsley.  Simmer until the beans are heated through and the soup is thick, about 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Discard Parmesan rind and rosemary sprig (the leaves will have fallen off of the stem.)

Ladle the soup into bowls and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
