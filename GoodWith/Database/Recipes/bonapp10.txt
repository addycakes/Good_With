  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  chilled unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- cut 1/2" pieces
  6        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if neded
                        === FILLING ===
  8             ounces  bacon -- crosscut 1/4" strips
  1 1/2         pounds  onions -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
  3              large  egg yolks
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

For crust:  Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Add butter and cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 6 tablespoons water and process using on/off turns until mixture forms moist clumps, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dry.  Gather dough into ball.  Shape into log.  Wrap in plastic and chill 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Cut dough crosswise into 12 equal slices.  Roll out each slice on lightly floured surface to 6-inch round.  Transfer each round to 4-inch-diameter tartlet pan with removable bottom.  Press dough onto bottom and up sides of pan.  Trim off excess dough.  Pierce bottom with fork.  Refrigerate 10 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

For filling:  SautÈ bacon in large pot over medium heat until brown, about 9 minutes.  Discard all but 3 tablespoons drippings from bacon.  Add onions to bacon and sautÈ until tender, about 8 minutes.  Cool.

Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add flour and stir 2 minutes (do not brown).  Gradually whisk in milk.  Increase heat to medium-high and boil 1 minute, whisking constantly.  Remove from heat.  Whisk yolks in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in hot sauce.  Mix in onion mixture, salt, pepper and nutmeg.  (Filling can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly, then cover and chill.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place tartlets on baking sheet and bake until golden brown, pressing bottom and sides with back of fork if crust bubbles, about 18 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Spoon filling (about 1/4 cup) into each tartlet.  Bake until tops begin to brown, about 20 minutes.  Transfer tartlets to racks and cool slightly.  Remove from pans.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 12 tartlets.

  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3        tablespoons  ice water - (about)
                        === FILLING ===
  3              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  whole milk
  1           teaspoon  kirsch (clear cherry brandy)

For crust:  Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Add butter and shortening; cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal.

For filling:  Whisk eggs and 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl to blend.  Whisk in cream, milk, kirsch, and spices.  Cook 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until butter begins to brown, about 2 minutes.  Whisk into cream mixture.  Set custard aside.

Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12 1/2-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter pie dish.  Fold dough edges under and crimp decoratively.  Pierce crust all over with fork.  Freeze 20 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line crust with foil.  Fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake 10 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Bake until crust is golden, about 15 minutes longer.  Cool slightly.

Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Arrange apple mixture in pie shell.  Pour custard over.  Bake until knife inserted into center comes out clean, covering crust with foil if browning too quickly, about 40 minutes.  Transfer pie to rack and cool slightly.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  "My mother and I spent a recent afternoon shopping in Gruene, a small town not far from Austin," writes Martha Witebsky of Austin, Texas.  "We loved the tender, fruity cake we had at the River House Tea Room.  Would chef Carol Hill share the recipe for what she calls Hummingbird Cake?"

Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     garlic heads
  4 1/2         pounds  beef short ribs
  3             quarts  water
  1                     white onion -- quartered
  3                     tomatoes - (abt 12 oz) -- halved
     1/2         large  white onion -- cut 1/2"-thk slices
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  16                    dried guajillo chilies - (abt 2 oz) -- stemmed, halved,
                        and seeded
  3              large  dried ancho chilies - (abt 2 oz) -- stemmed, halved,
                        and seeded
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano leaves
  1              pinch  ground cloves
     1/2           cup  distilled white vinegar

Cut 1 head of garlic crosswise in half.  Place in large pot with ribs, 3 quarts water, and quartered onion.  Bring to boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer uncovered until meat is cooked through, about 50 minutes.  Strain, reserving 6 cups meat broth (discard onions and garlic).  Reserve ribs.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Wrap remaining head of garlic tightly in foil and place directly on oven rack.  Place tomatoes and sliced onion on rimmed baking sheet.  Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast garlic, tomatoes, and onion until tender, about 1 hour.  Transfer tomatoes and onion to processor.  Using fingers, squeeze garlic from papery skin into processor.  Blend until smooth.  Set tomato sauce aside.

Place guajillo and ancho chilies in medium bowl.  Add 4 cups reserved meat broth.  Let stand 30 minutes.  Transfer mixture to processor and blend until smooth.  Strain chili sauce into medium bowl, pressing on solids in strainer with rubber spatula to extract as much liquid as possible.

Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add chili sauce; simmer 5 minutes.  Add tomato sauce, cumin, oregano, and cloves.  Simmer 5 minutes.  Add ribs, vinegar, and remaining 2 cups meat broth.  Bring to simmer.  Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until sauce is thick, about 50 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm over medium-high heat until hot.)  Serve ribs with sauce.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  A nice side would be polenta or mashed potatoes.

Cut 1 head of garlic crosswise in half.  Place in large pot with ribs, 3 quarts water, and quartered onion.  Bring to boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer uncovered until meat is cooked through, about 50 minutes.  Strain, reserving 6 cups meat broth (discard onions and garlic).  Reserve ribs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Wrap remaining head of garlic tightly in foil and place directly on oven rack.  Place tomatoes and sliced onion on rimmed baking sheet.  Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast garlic, tomatoes, and onion until tender, about 1 hour.  Transfer tomatoes and onion to processor.  Using fingers, squeeze garlic from papery skin into processor.  Blend until smooth.  Set tomato sauce aside.

Place guajillo and ancho chilies in medium bowl.  Add 4 cups reserved meat broth.  Let stand 30 minutes.  Transfer mixture to processor and blend until smooth.  Strain chili sauce into medium bowl, pressing on solids in strainer with rubber spatula to extract as much liquid as possible.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add chili sauce; simmer 5 minutes.  Add tomato sauce, cumin, oregano, and cloves.  Simmer 5 minutes.  Add ribs, vinegar, and remaining 2 cups meat broth.  Bring to simmer.  Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until sauce is thick, about 50 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm over medium-high heat until hot.)  Serve ribs with sauce.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Pour braising liquid into 4-cup measuring cup.  Spoon off fat, reserving 1 tablespoon.

Heat reserved fat in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Whisk in flour; stir 2 minutes.  Whisk in braising liquid and tomato paste.  Boil until gravy coats spoon lightly, about 2 minutes.  Serve lamb and vegetables with gravy.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "My favorite lamb dish in recent memory was a lamb shank at Bistro 110 here in Chicago," writes Valerie Young of Chicago, Illinois.  "The waiter told me that it was seasoned with cumin, coriander, and curry, then braised for a very long time."

The secret to this recipe?  The lamb marinates overnight in a fragrant oil-and-spice mixture.  If you don't have a spice grinder or coffee grinder, use a mallet to crush the seeds in a resealable plastic bag.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    broccolini stalks -- cut 4" lengths
                        = (or 12 broccoli florets)
  4                     large slices rye bread - (3" by 5")
  3        tablespoons  mustard-flavored mayonnaise
                        = (such as Dijonnaise)
  4                     thin red onion slices
  1                cup  shredded sharp cheddar cheese - (packed)

Preheat broiler.  Steam broccolini until just tender, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to paper towels and pat dry.

Broil bread on baking sheet until lightly toasted, about 1 minute per side.

Spread top side of each bread slice with mustard-flavored mayonnaise.  Top each with onion slice, broccolini and cheese.  Broil until cheese melts and browns, about 2 minutes.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  A relatively new item in the produce section, broccolini is a cross between broccoli and Chinese kale.  It has a milder, sweeter taste than broccoli.  Buy German potato salad, and braise red cabbage to serve warm with the open-face sandwiches.  Gingerbread and chunky applesauce make a perfect finale.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  1           teaspoon  grated lime peel
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

Preheat broiler.  Melt butter in heavy small skillet over medium heat.  Stir in ginger and cayenne.  Remove from heat.  Stir in lime juice and peel.  Season ginger-lime butter to taste with salt and pepper.

Place shrimp in bowl.  Add ginger-lime butter; toss to coat.  Transfer shrimp to small rimmed baking sheet.  Broil until pink and just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.

Transfer shrimp to plate; drizzle with pan juices.  Sprinkle with onions.  Serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled

Comments:  The shrimp could also be skewered and grilled instead of broiled.  Either way, they're lovely arranged atop pimiento-flecked rice pilaf and served with steamed snow peas and a basket of warm corn muffins.  Blueberry or strawberry shortcakes are the perfect dessert.

Comments:  "On a visit to Miami Beach, a friend suggested we try the Gaucho Room at Loews Miami Beach Hotel," writes Anthony M. Stephens of Concord, California.  "I have had many versions of Caesar salad, but none compare to the one I ate there; the house-made herbed croutons and dressing were so fresh.  Would chef Frank Randazzo share his recipe?"

                      Charred Onion And Fennel Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             slices  frozen 5-cheese garlic bread, 3"x3"x1"
  2 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  1             medium  onion -- thinly sliced
  1             medium  fennel bulb -- halved lengthwise,
                        and thinly sliced
  2               cans  Italian herb-seasoned chicken broth -- (14 1/2 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  anise-flavored liqueur -- (optional)
                        = (such as Pernod)
  3                     bay leaves
  1            package  dried stemmed shiitake mushrooms - (1 oz) -- broken 1/2" pieces
  3               cans  kidney beans - (15 to 16 oz ea) -- undrained
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake bread until crisp and cheese begins to melt, about 15 minutes.

Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onion and fennel; sautÈ until deep brown around edges, about 10 minutes.  Stir in broth and thyme.  Simmer, uncovered, until onion and fennel are soft, about 5 minutes.  Stir in liqueur, if desired; simmer 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Ladle soup into bowls; place 1 slice bread atop each.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  New herbed chicken broth is used in this soup; adding the cheese-garlic bread makes it a filling entrÈe.  Serve with a salad of chopped tomato and herbed olives tossed in bottled or fresh balsamic vinaigrette with chopped fresh marjoram.  End with slices of pound cake spread with bottled lemon curd and surrounded by tangerine sections.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  frozen dark sweet cherries - (16 oz) -- thawed, drained
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  4              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
     3/4           cup  whole milk
     1/3           cup  almonds -- toasted, cooled
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        Pistachio or vanilla ice cream -- for serving

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Generously butter six 1-cup custard cups.  Mix cherries, 2 tablespoons sugar, and cornstarch in large bowl.  Divide among prepared cups.

Whisk eggs, vanilla, and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in medium bowl until well blended.  Cook butter in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat until butter begins to brown, about 3 minutes.  Add butter to egg mixture and whisk to blend.  Whisk in milk.  Finely grind almonds, flour, and salt in processor.  Stir nut mixture into custard.  Pour custard over cherries, dividing equally.

Bake clafoutis until set in center, about 35 minutes.  Run knife around sides of clafoutis to loosen.  Slide out onto plates.  Serve clafoutis warm or at room temperature with ice cream.

This recipe yields 6 clafoutis.

Comments:  This traditional French dessert combines all the best qualities of custard, pudding, and cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  7        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             medium  onions -- thinly sliced
  2                     red bell peppers -- very thinly sliced
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- very thinly sliced
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour

Heat 3/4 cup oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onions and sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add all bell peppers, garlic, thyme, and sugar; sautÈ 5 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover and cook until vegetables are very soft, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes longer.  Drain confit and cool; discard cooking oil.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Puree 1/2 cup bell pepper mixture, lemon juice, and 5 tablespoons olive oil in blender until smooth.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  (Bell pepper confit and sauce can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Coat in flour; shake off excess.  SautÈ chicken in skillet until golden, about 1 minute per side.  Transfer skillet to oven and bake chicken until cooked through, turning once, about 12 minutes.

Meanwhile, rewarm bell pepper confit over medium heat.  Stir sauce over low heat just until heated through.  Spoon bell pepper confit onto 4 plates.

Slice chicken diagonally and place atop bell peppers.  Drizzle sauce around chicken and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In this Basque-inspired dish, a bell pepper mixture is slow-cooked to produce an unusual -- and flavorful -- confit.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Hungarian sweet paprika
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter
     1/2                onion -- thinly sliced
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
     1/3           cup  whipping cream

Sprinkle chicken on both sides with 3/4 teaspoon paprika, then salt and pepper.  Melt 1 tablespoon butter in medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chicken and sautÈ until cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer chicken to plate.

Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and onion to skillet.  Reduce heat to medium.  Cover and cook 5 minutes.  Mix in 3/4 teaspoon paprika, then wine and cream.  Boil until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes.

Return chicken and any juices to skillet; simmer to rewarm, about 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings (can be doubled).

Comments:  Steamed Swiss chard and buttered egg noodles sprinkled with chives are nice sides for this Hungarian-inspired meal.  Apple strudel makes the perfect dessert.

                        = (available at Asian markets)
  6             ounces  mung bean sprouts
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh mint
  16                    rice paper rounds - (abt 1/2 pkg) -- see * Note
  8                     large whole iceberg lettuce leaves
  1             bottle  hoisin sauce - (8 oz)
                        = (available at Asian markets)
  2          teaspoons  chili-garlic paste
                        = (available at Asian markets)

* Note:  Thin Vietnamese or Thai wrappers made from rice flour and known as banh trang.  Available at Asian markets.

Heat sesame oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.  Add chicken and onion to skillet and sautÈ 3 minutes.  Stir in kumquats.  Remove from heat.  Cool.  Stir in bean sprouts.

Toss basil and mint in small bowl to combine.

Dip 1 rice paper round into bowl of warm water until soft, about 10 seconds.  Place on clean, moist kitchen towel to drain 1 minute.  Repeat with another rice paper round.  Place second round atop first round for double thickness.  Top with a lettuce leaf, then place 1/8 of chicken-bean sprout mixture near lower edge of round.  Sprinkle with 1/8 of herb mixture.

Fold in sides of round, then roll up, starting near filling.  Repeat with remaining rounds, lettuce leaves, chicken-bean sprout mixture, and herb mixture.  (Can be made 3 hours ahead.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate.)

Whisk hoisin sauce and chili-garlic paste in medium bowl to blend.  Slice each roll diagonally into 4 pieces, for a total of 32 pieces.  Pour sauce into individual shallow bowls and place in center of each of 8 plates; surround with spring rolls and serve.

This recipe yields 8 (appetizer) servings.

Comments:  These spring rolls can also be made with duck instead of chicken.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) -- chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks)
  1                cup  sugar
  4              large  eggs
  4              large  egg yolks
  1              Large  pinch of salt
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour

Butter and flour ten 3/4-cup ramekins.  Melt chocolate and butter in medium bowl set over pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally.  Remove bowl from over water and cool chocolate mixture to lukewarm.

Using electric mixer at high speed, beat sugar, eggs, yolks, and salt in large bowl until batter falls in heavy ribbon when beaters are lifted, about 6 minutes.  Sift flour over mixture and fold in.  Gradually fold in lukewarm chocolate mixture.

Divide mixture among prepared ramekins.  (Can be prepared ahead.  Cover soufflÈs individually with plastic and refrigerate up to 1 day or freeze up to 1 week.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place ramekins on baking sheet; bake soufflÈs until puffed and beginning to crack on top (centers will still be soft), about 18 minutes (19 minutes if frozen), and serve.  These can be prepared ahead.

This recipe yields 10 soufflÈs.

Comments:  "I have been enjoying Aperto restaurant here in San Francisco ever since it opened eight years ago," writes Leslie Appleton, of San Francisco, California.  "Everything prepared in that little kitchen is delicious and attractively presented.  If you could obtain the recipe for the soft-centered chocolate soufflÈs served there, you would make me very happy."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  14            ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate -- chopped
                        = (or semisweet chocolate)
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks)
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup
  6              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  sugar
                        Raspberry sorbet -- for serving

Line 8-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides with 3 layers of plastic wrap, overlapping sides of pan by 8 inches.  Melt bittersweet chocolate, butter, and corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan over low heat, stirring until smooth.  Remove from heat.

Using electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar in large bowl until doubled in volume and pale yellow in color, about 3 minutes.  Fold chocolate mixture into egg mixture (mixture will deflate).  Pour mixture into prepared cake pan.  Cover cake tightly with overhanging plastic wrap.

Place steamer rack on bottom of large pot.  Pour enough water into pot to almost reach bottom of steamer rack; bring to boil.  Place cake on steamer rack.  Cover pot and steam until tester inserted into center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, adding more hot water to pot if necessary, about 2 hours.

Remove cake from steamer.  Refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 6 hours.  (Cake can be prepared up to 3 days ahead of time.  Keep refrigerated.)

Slice cake with knife dipped into hot water and wiped dry.  Top each serving with scoop of raspberry sorbet and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  "I was at a conference in West Vancouver, British Columbia, when I discovered Salmon House on the Hill," writes Beth D'Ambrosio of Pittsford, New York.  "The one thing more breathtaking than the restaurant's view was dessert: a slice of impossibly rich chocolate cake topped with raspberry sorbet."

This dense and fudgy flourless chocolate cake isnít baked -- itís steamed on top of the stove.  The cake will puff up while it steams and fall as it cools.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/4           cups  apple cider
  3        tablespoons  coarse salt
  6                     allspice berries
  1                     bay leaf
  4                     bone-in center-cut pork rib chops -- (10 oz ea)
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick)
  5              large  leeks, white and pale green parts only -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and halved, each half cut into 4 wedges
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
     1/3           cup  Calvados
                        Olive oil -- as needed

Bring 4 cups cider, salt, allspice, and bay leaf to boil in large saucepan, stirring to dissolve salt.  Cool completely.  Place pork in 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Pour brine over.  Cover; refrigerate overnight.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat.  Add leeks; sautÈ until tender, about 7 minutes.  Add cream and simmer until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Creamed leeks can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add apples and sautÈ 10 minutes.  Add sugar and sautÈ until apples are golden, about 6 minutes longer.  Add stock, then Calvados and remaining 1/4 cup cider.  Simmer until liquid thickens slightly and apples are tender, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Set aside.

Prepare barbecue (medium heat) or preheat broiler.  Drain pork.  Rinse under cold water; pat dry.  Brush pork with oil.  Grill or broil to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium.

Meanwhile, rewarm leeks, thinning with 1 to 3 tablespoons water if necessary.  Bring apples to simmer.  Spoon leeks onto plates.  Top with pork, then apples.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Brining the pork makes it especially juicy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  water
  1 1/2           cups  low-fat (1%) milk
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  fat-free sweetened condensed milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Place four 3/4-cup custard cups in 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan.

Stir sugar and 1 tablespoon water in heavy small skillet over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of skillet with pastry brush dipped into water and swirling skillet, about 8 minutes.  Immediately pour syrup into custard cups, dividing equally.

Whisk milk and cinnamon in small saucepan to blend; bring to simmer.  Cover and let cool 15 minutes.

Whisk eggs to blend in medium bowl.  Gradually whisk in cinnamon milk, then sweetened condensed milk and vanilla.  Divide among caramel-lined custard cups.  Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of cups.  Bake custards until set in center, about 55 minutes.  Cool in water in pan.  Remove custard cups from water; cover and refrigerate overnight.

Run small knife around custards to loosen.  To unmold each, place small plate atop custard; firmly holding plate and custard cup together, invert and shake gently, allowing custard and caramel to settle onto plate.

This recipe yields 4.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Place four 3/4-cup custard cups in 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir sugar and 1 tablespoon water in heavy small skillet over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of skillet with pastry brush dipped into water and swirling skillet, about 8 minutes.  Immediately pour syrup into custard cups, dividing equally.

Whisk milk and cinnamon in small saucepan to blend; bring to simmer.  Cover and let cool 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk eggs to blend in medium bowl.  Gradually whisk in cinnamon milk, then sweetened condensed milk and vanilla.  Divide among caramel-lined custard cups.  Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of cups.  Bake custards until set in center, about 55 minutes.  Cool in water in pan.  Remove custard cups from water; cover and refrigerate overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Run small knife around custards to loosen.  To unmold each, place small plate atop custard; firmly holding plate and custard cup together, invert and shake gently, allowing custard and caramel to settle onto plate.

     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/2           cup  honey
  1                cup  mixed dried fruit -- halved if large

(Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.)  Rewarm game hens in sauce over medium-low heat.  Transfer to large platter.

Comments:  This poultry dish features many of the flavors of the classic Moroccan dish bístilla but is much easier to make.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     bag mixed baby greens - (5 oz)
                        = (about 10 cups loosely packed)
  4             ounces  Stilton cheese -- crumbled

Whisk first 10 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  (Dressing can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Bring vinaigrette and figs to simmer in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Simmer until dressing is slightly syrupy, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.

Divide greens among 6 plates.  Sprinkle cheese over greens.  Ladle warm dressing and figs over salads and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "I spent a weekend in North Carolina's Blue Ridge Mountains," writes Elizabeth Haworth of Columbia, South Carolina.  "The Riverwood restaurant in Blowing Rock was a real treat -- I especially enjoyed their fig and Stilton salad with Port dressing.  Would the chef share the recipe for this unusual salad?"

The sweet-tart dressing paired with creamy Stilton cheese strikes a great balance in this winter salad.

  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
  5               cups  chicken stock -- or more if needed
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  3             pounds  assorted fish fillets -- cut into 2" pieces
                        = (sea bass, snapper, and orange roughy)

          Fried Rice With Peppers, Onions And Shiitake Mushrooms

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  long-grain white rice
  2 1/2    tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2              large  eggs -- beaten to blend
  8             ounces  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        and caps sliced
  1              large  red or yellow bell pepper -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2                     green onions -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce -- plus more
                        for serving
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring 1 1/2 cups water and salt to boil in medium saucepan over high heat.  Mix in rice.  Reduce heat to low, cover and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 18 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add eggs.  Cook without stirring until eggs are set and bottom is brown, lifting edge of eggs occasionally to let uncooked portion run underneath, about 3 minutes.  Turn out egg pancake.  Cut in half, then cut crosswise into thin strips.

Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms; sautÈ 4 minutes.  Add pepper and ginger; sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add rice, egg strips, onions and 1 tablespoon soy sauce; toss.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve, passing more soy sauce, if desired.

This recipe yields 2 servings (can be doubled).

Comments:  A salad of snow peas, bean sprouts, chopped peanuts and rice vinegar dressing is a good side dish.  Fresh pineapple topped with coconut shavings ends the meal nicely.

Bring 1 1/2 cups water and salt to boil in medium saucepan over high heat.  Mix in rice.  Reduce heat to low, cover and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 18 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add eggs.  Cook without stirring until eggs are set and bottom is brown, lifting edge of eggs occasionally to let uncooked portion run underneath, about 3 minutes.  Turn out egg pancake.  Cut in half, then cut crosswise into thin strips.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms; sautÈ 4 minutes.  Add pepper and ginger; sautÈ 3 minutes.  Add rice, egg strips, onions and 1 tablespoon soy sauce; toss.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve, passing more soy sauce, if desired.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 servings (can be doubled).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  A salad of snow peas, bean sprouts, chopped peanuts and rice vinegar dressing is a good side dish.  Fresh pineapple topped with coconut shavings ends the meal nicely.

            Garam Sauteed Shrimp And Zucchini With Spiced Rice

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  uncooked large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1                     zucchini -- sliced into rounds
  1           teaspoon  garam masala seasoning
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1            package  garlic and herb rice pilaf - (6.3 oz) -- cooked according
                        to package instructions

Toss first 3 ingredients in bowl to blend.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Melt butter in medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Remove zucchini from bowl; sautÈ until slightly browned, about 1 minute.  Add shrimp; sautÈ until opaque in center, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in cilantro and lemon juice.  Season with salt and pepper.

Divide rice between 2 plates.  Spoon shrimp and zucchini over rice.

Comments:  This dish features garam masala, a flavorful blend of roasted and ground spices used in Indian cuisine and now available in the spice section of most supermarkets.  Accompany the shrimp with bottled tomato chutney or fruit chutney and a basket of warm flatbread.  A mango smoothie with a plate of coconut macaroons is the perfect dessert.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-grated peeled fresh ginger -- (packed)
  10             large  egg yolks
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  4          teaspoons  sugar
                        Strawberries
                        Fresh mint

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Combine cream and ginger in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to simmer over medium heat.  Remove from heat; let stand 20 minutes.

Strain cream into small bowl, pressing on solids in sieve.  Whisk yolks and 1 cup sugar in medium bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in warm cream.

Divide custard among eight 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups.  Place ramekins in large roasting pan.  Pour enough warm water into pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.

Bake custards just until set in center when pan is gently shaken, about 45 minutes.  Remove custards from water bath; chill uncovered until cold, at least 3 hours.  Cover and chill overnight.

Preheat broiler.  Place custards on baking sheet.  Sprinkle each with 1/2 teaspoon of remaining sugar.  Broil until sugar melts and caramelizes, turning sheet for even browning, about 1 minute.  Refrigerate custards until topping is cold and brittle, about 1 hour and up to 2 hours.  Garnish custards with strawberries and mint and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Categories    : First Course                    Restaurant
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dried small white beans
  1             medium  onion -- quartered
  3              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  1                     bay leaf
  7        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  shallots -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  cleaned calamari (tentacles and bodies)
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper

Place beans in large saucepan.  Pour enough water over beans to cover by 3 inches.  Bring to boil.  Remove from heat; cover and let stand 1 hour.  Add onion, thyme, and bay leaf to beans; simmer until beans are tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Drain.  Discard onion, thyme, and bay leaf; return beans to saucepan.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in small skillet over medium heat.  Add shallots and sautÈ until tender, about 4 minutes.  Stir shallots into beans.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.  Rewarm over medium-low heat, stirring and adding more water to moisten if necessary, before serving.)

Place calamari tentacles in medium bowl.  Cut calamari bodies lengthwise in half.  Using sharp knife, score bodies at 1/2-inch intervals in lattice pattern (do not cut through).  Add to bowl.  Add 2 tablespoons oil, lemon juice, and garlic; toss to coat.  Let stand 1 hour.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Drain calamari; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill just until slightly curled at edges, about 30 seconds per side.

Stir parsley into warm beans.  Divide beans among 6 plates.  Top with calamari.  Drizzle remaining 3 tablespoons oil over.  Sprinkle with crushed red pepper.

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings.

                        === SAUCE ===
  1                jar  hoisin sauce sauce - (8 1/2 oz)

     1/3           cup  orange juice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unseasoned rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel

                        === VEGETABLES ===
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  oriental sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  chili-garlic sauce
                        = (available at Asian markets)
  1           teaspoon  fish sauce (nam pla)
                        = (available at Asian markets)
  1              bunch  watercress -- trimmed
  1             medium  cucumber -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into matchstick-size strips
  1             medium  carrot -- peeled, and
                        cut into matchstick-size strips
     3/4           cup  cilantro leaves - (from large bunch)
     1/2                red onion -- very thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SCALLOPS ===
  1 1/2      teaspoons  whole coriander seeds
  1         tablespoon  oriental sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
  12             large  sea scallops
                        Vegetable oil

For sauce:  Mix all ingredients in bowl.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Cover; chill.  Bring to room temperature before using.)

For vegetables:  Mix first 4 ingredients in large bowl.  Add watercress, cucumber, carrot, cilantro, and onion and toss to blend.  Season with salt and pepper.  Let stand 30 minutes or chill up to 1 hour, tossing occasionally.

For scallops:  Stir coriander seeds in small skillet over medium heat until fragrant and slightly darker, about 2 minutes.  Transfer seeds to plastic bag.  Using mallet or hammer, coarsely crack seeds.  Combine sesame oil and ginger in medium bowl; mix in coriander seeds, then scallops.  Let stand at least 30 minutes or chill up to 1 hour.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Thread 3 scallops onto each of 4 skewers.  Brush barbecue rack with oil to prevent sticking.  Grill scallops until just opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side.

Divide vegetables among 4 plates.  Top each with scallops and serve, passing hoisin-orange sauce separately.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer servings.

Comments:  Here, sea scallops take an Asian turn when they are flavored with toasted coriander seeds, grilled, and teamed with a hoisin-orange sauce and vegetable salad.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter -- plus
  4          teaspoons  butter
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  8             ounces  ground sirloin
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in medium skillet over medium heat.  Add onion; sautÈ 5 minutes.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Mix in sirloin, thyme, salt, and pepper.  Shape meat into two 3/4-inch-thick patties.  Coat patties with flour, shaking off excess.

Melt 4 teaspoons butter in same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add patties and cook about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Transfer patties to 2 plates.

Pour off any fat from skillet.  Add wine and boil until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.  Add cream and boil until slightly thickened, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes.  Season sauce with salt and pepper; pour over patties.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Known as bifteck hachÈ in France, this dish would go well with potatoes au gratin from the freezer case and buttered, lightly steamed spinach.  End with chocolate mousse.

Categories    : Desserts                        Restaurant


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  chilled whipping cream
  1                cup  whole milk
  2          teaspoons  instant espresso powder -- dissolved in
     1/4           cup  water
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  coarsely-ground espresso beans
  1              pinch  ground cinnamon
  1                cup  good-quality coffee ice cream -- slightly softened

Combine 1 cup whipping cream, milk, and espresso mixture in heavy large saucepan.  Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into cream mixture; add bean.  Bring mixture to boil.  Using tongs, remove bean; discard.

Whisk sugar and egg yolks in large bowl until pale and thick, about 2 minutes.  Gradually pour hot cream mixture over egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly.  Return mixture to saucepan and simmer over low heat until mixture is thick enough to coat spoon, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes (do not boil).  Remove from heat.  Whisk in espresso beans and cinnamon.  Cover and chill 4 hours.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

Beat remaining 1 cup whipping cream in medium bowl to soft peaks.  Strain custard through fine sieve into another medium bowl.  Place coffee ice cream in large bowl.  Fold in 1/3 of custard to soften ice cream.  Fold in 1/3 of whipped cream.  Fold in remaining custard and whipped cream in 2 more additions each (do not overmix).  Cover with plastic wrap and chill until cold, about 1 hour.

Transfer to freezer; freeze mixture until very cold and thick, about 15 minutes.  Transfer to pitcher and pour into chilled wineglasses at table.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  LiËge is a province of Belgium; cafÈ liËgeois is usually coffee ice cream with whipped cream, but it can also be iced coffee with whipped cream.  This thick drink -- served elegantly in wineglasses -- combines the two styles into one delicious dessert.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  Italian sweet sausage -- casings removed,
                        crumbled into 1/2" pieces
  8             ounces  portobello mushrooms -- stemmed, dark
                        gills scraped out, caps diced
  10            ounces  fresh shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, diced
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano
  1 1/2           cups  Madeira
  6               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick)
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cups  arborio rice - (abt 13 oz)
                        = (or other medium-grain rice)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  freshly-grated Asiago cheese

Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add sausage and sautÈ until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes.  Add all mushrooms, thyme, and oregano and sautÈ until mushrooms are tender, about 10 minutes.  Add 1/2 cup Madeira; boil until almost absorbed, about 1 minute.  Set aside.

Bring stock to simmer in large saucepan; remove from heat and cover to keep hot.  Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onion and garlic and sautÈ until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add rice; stir 2 minutes.  Add remaining 1 cup Madeira; simmer until absorbed, about 2 minutes.  Add 1 cup hot stock; simmer until almost absorbed, stirring often, about 3 minutes.  Continue to cook until rice is just tender and mixture is creamy, adding more stock by cupfuls, stirring often and allowing most stock to be absorbed before adding more, about 25 minutes.

Stir in sausage mixture.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer to serving bowl.  Pass cheese separately.

This recipe yields 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  At the restaurant, this dish is served as a starter.  It would also make a great main course for four.

                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
  2                     kabocha squash - (2 1/2 lbs ea) -- halved horizontally,
                        and seeded
  8               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
  1 1/2           jars  whole roasted chestnuts - (7.4 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  pure maple syrup
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For chipotle crËme fraÓche:  Combine Port, wine, chilies, and tomato paste in heavy small saucepan.  Simmer over medium heat until reduced to thick paste, stirring often, about 12 minutes.  Transfer to small bowl; cool.  Fold in crËme fraÓche.  Cover and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 week.

For soup:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Brush baking sheet with oil.  Place squash halves, cut-side down, on prepared sheet.  Bake squash until very tender, about 1 hour.  Scoop squash from skins.

Measure 6 cups squash and transfer to large pot (reserve any remaining squash for another use).  Add broth and chestnuts to pot.  Bring to boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer soup uncovered until chestnuts are very tender, about 30 minutes.

Mix maple syrup into soup.  Puree soup in batches in blender until very smooth; return to same pot.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Refrigerate until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.)

Rewarm soup.  Ladle into bowls.  Top each serving with chipotle crËme fraÓche.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  In this luscious soup, the restaurant uses a squash that is relatively new to the American market: the kabocha, a beautiful jade-green winter squash with deep orange flesh.  Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores, and some supermarkets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  graham cracker crumbs
     1/2           cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  3              large  ripe mangoes - (abt 13 oz ea) -- peeled, pitted,
                        and coarsely chopped
  3           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  4              large  eggs
                        Sliced peeled pitted mangoes -- for serving

For crust:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Lightly butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Stir cracker crumbs and sugar in medium bowl to blend.  Add melted butter and stir until evenly moistened.  Press crumb mixture firmly onto bottom (not sides) of prepared pan.  Bake until crust is set, about 12 minutes.  Cool completely.  Maintain oven temperature.

For filling:  Puree mangoes in processor until smooth.  Set aside 2 cups mango puree (reserve any remaining puree for another use).  Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in large bowl until smooth.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add 2 cups mango puree and beat until well blended.  Pour filling over crust in pan.

Bake cake until set and puffed and golden around edges (center may move very slightly when pan is gently shaken), about 1 hour 25 minutes.  Cool cake 1 hour.  Refrigerate uncovered overnight.

Run small knife between cake and sides of pan to loosen.  Remove pan sides.  Transfer cake to platter.  Cut into wedges and serve with sliced mangoes.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Pureed fresh mango gives this cheesecake a light and soft texture and subtle tropical fruit flavor.

For filling:  Puree mangoes in processor until smooth.  Set aside 2 cups mango puree (reserve any remaining puree for another use).  Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in large bowl until smooth.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add 2 cups mango puree and beat until well blended.  Pour filling over crust in pan.

Bake cake until set and puffed and golden around edges (center may move very slightly when pan is gently shaken), about 1 hour 25 minutes.  Cool cake 1 hour.  Refrigerate uncovered overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Run small knife between cake and sides of pan to loosen.  Remove pan sides.  Transfer cake to platter.  Cut into wedges and serve with sliced mangoes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     rabbit - (2 3/4 to 3 lbs) -- cut into pieces,
                        and meat finely chopped
                        = (or 1 lb finely-chopped skinless
                        boneless chicken thigh meat)
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1              pound  plum tomatoes -- chopped
  1                can  crushed tomatoes with puree - (28 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  chopped fresh basil - (abt 3 lg bunches)
     1/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  orecchiette (little ear-shaped pasta)
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- as needed

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and garlic and sautÈ until tender and golden, about 5 minutes.  Add chopped rabbit; sautÈ until light brown, about 4 minutes.  Add wine and boil until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes.

Stir in chopped tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, 1 cup basil, crushed red pepper, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.  Season sauce generously with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain.  Return pasta to pot.  Add sauce; toss to coat.  Transfer to bowl.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup basil and Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This hearty entrÈe is made with rabbit, which can be found in the frozen foods section of some supermarkets or ordered from your butcher.  You can also substitute chicken thighs.  The "little ear" shape of the pasta is perfect for trapping the sauce.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (abt 12 oz total)
                        Salt -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     fresh pineapple rounds, 1/4" thk
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  purchased citrus vinaigrette -- plus
  3        tablespoons  purchased citrus vinaigrette
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  4               cups  fresh arugula - (packed)

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle chicken on each side with salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  SautÈ until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer to plate.

Sprinkle pineapple with salt and generously with pepper on both sides.  Add to same skillet and sautÈ until lightly browned, about 1 minute per side.  Transfer to plate with chicken.

Remove skillet from heat.  Add wine to same skillet; stir, scraping up any browned bits.  Stir in 1/4 cup vinaigrette and basil.  Season with salt and pepper.

Place arugula in medium bowl.  Add remaining 3 tablespoons vinaigrette; toss to coat.  Divide salad between 2 plates.  Slice each chicken breast crosswise into 4 slices.  Arrange 4 slices atop each salad.  Arrange 2 pineapple slices on each plate.  Pour pan juices over salads and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Bottled vinaigrette adds a tangy twist to the chicken.  This stylish dish goes well with couscous.  Molasses cookies and vanilla ice cream sprinkled with chopped crystallized ginger would be a lovely finish.

  2             pounds  beets - (abt 6 med) -- trimmed
     1/4           cup  water

       Roasted Vegetable And Prosciutto Lasagna With Alfredo Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  purchased Alfredo sauce
  2             ounces  thinly-sliced prosciutto -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  1 1/2           cups  canned diced tomatoes with
                        Italian seasonings -- undrained
  4                     no-boil lasagna noodles from one 8-oz pkg
  1 1/3           cups  mixed roasted vegetables from deli
                        = (such as eggplant, squash and
                        bell peppers)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Stir Alfredo sauce, prosciutto and basil in small bowl to blend.  Spread 2 tablespoons Alfredo sauce mixture in bottom of two 1 1/2-cup oval-shape gratin dishes or two 2-cup soufflÈ dishes.  Top each with 1/4 cup tomatoes with juices.

Place 1 noodle in each dish, breaking into pieces to fit.  Spread each with 2 tablespoons sauce mixture, then 1/4 cup tomatoes with juices.  Top each with 2/3 cup roasted vegetables.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Make another layer of noodles, breaking to fit.  Top with remaining sauce mixture, dividing equally.  Top each with 1/4 cup tomatoes with juices.

Cover dishes tightly with plastic wrap.  Microwave on high until noodles are tender but still firm to bite, about 10 minutes.  Uncover lasagna and let stand 5 minutes before serving

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  A bagged lettuce mix with "Mediterranean" greens would go nicely here when tossed with red wine vinaigrette and served with ciabatta bread.  End with pears and a plate of bittersweet chocolate-nut toffee.

                 Seared Halibut With Spicy Tomato Chutney

Recipe By     :Neela Paniz
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Restaurant                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  fenugreek seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  nigella seeds (black onion seeds)
     1/2      teaspoon  mustard seeds
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 3/4         pounds  tomatoes -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  turmeric
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     halibut fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Lemon slices

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add fenugreek seeds, nigella seeds, and mustard seeds.  Cover and cook until seeds sizzle and begin to pop, about 45 seconds.  Add garlic and stir 1 minute.  Add tomatoes with juices, coriander, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne.

Boil over medium heat until juices evaporate and mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, 12 minutes.  Season chutney with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Rewarm over low heat, stirring often.)

Mix 1/2 teaspoon turmeric and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne in small bowl.  Sprinkle spice mixture over both sides of fish fillets; rub into fish to adhere.  Sprinkle fish with salt.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add fish fillets and cook until opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side.

Transfer fish to plates.  Top each with warm chutney.  Garnish with lemon slices and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The inspiration for this entrÈe comes from the Bengal delta, where fish is the food of choice.  The area is also known for its use of nigella (black onion) seeds and fenugreek seeds, which are sold at Indian markets.

              Slow Roasted Lamb Shanks With Braised Lentils

Recipe By     :Massimo Ormani
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish
                Restaurant

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  chopped red onions
  1                cup  diced celery
  1                cup  diced peeled carrots
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint
  4              large  lamb shanks - (abt 6 lbs total)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  8               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  4                     juniper berries -- (optional)
  1                     bay leaf
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  butter -- room temperature
                        Braised Lentils -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Spread onions, celery, and carrots over bottom of large roasting pan.  Rub thyme and mint over lamb shanks; sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.  Place lamb shanks atop vegetables.  Drizzle 3 tablespoons oil over.  Roast uncovered 30 minutes.

Pour 1 cup chicken stock over lamb and vegetables in pan.  Reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees.  Continue to roast uncovered until lamb is very tender and almost falls off bones, adding 1 cup stock to pan every 30 minutes and turning and basting lamb occasionally, about 3 hours longer.  Using tongs, transfer lamb shanks to bowl; cover to keep warm.

Transfer vegetables and pan juices to large saucepan; skim fat from surface.  Add remaining 1 cup stock, wine, juniper berries if desired, and bay leaf to saucepan.  Simmer 10 minutes to blend flavors.

Strain, pressing on solids to extract as much vegetable pulp and liquid as possible.  Return strained liquid to same saucepan; bring to boil.  Mix flour and butter to blend in small bowl.  Add to saucepan; whisk until sauce thickens slightly and is reduced to 2 cups, about 2 minutes.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.

Spoon Braised Lentils onto 4 plates.  Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons oil over lentils.  Top each serving with 1 lamb shank.  Spoon sauce over lamb.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Roasting the lamb, instead of braising, intensifies its flavor.

                  Smoked Salmon, Leek, And Dill Frittata

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Omelets


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1             medium  leek, white and pale green parts only -- thinly sliced
  4              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill
  1              ounce  cream cheese -- cut pea-size pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  thinly-sliced smoked salmon or lox -- cut thin strips

Preheat broiler.  Melt butter in medium nonstick ovenproof skillet over medium heat.  Add leek; cover and cook until tender, about 4 minutes.

Whisk eggs and dill in medium bowl to blend; stir in cream cheese.  Pour eggs over leek; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover and cook until edges are set but center is still runny, about 4 minutes.

Scatter salmon over frittata.  Broil until frittata is puffed and golden, about 1 minute.  Cut frittata into 4 wedges.  Place 2 wedges on each plate and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled by using 2 skillets.

Comments:  Of course, you must have toasted bagels with this.  Spinach salad with apple cider dressing would be nice on the side, and warm cherry strudel is a fine finish.

                           Spicy Meatless Chili

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chili                           Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chili powder
  1                can  Mexican recipe stewed tomatoes with
                        juices - (14 1/2 oz)
  8             ounces  frozen veggie crumbles -- thawed
  1                cup  canned red kidney beans -- rinsed, drained
     1/4           cup  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  shredded Mexican-style 4-cheese mix

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add chili powder; stir 1 minute.  Stir in tomatoes with juices, veggie crumbles, beans and 1/4 cup water.

Cook until slightly thickened, breaking up any large tomato pieces and stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Divide chili between 2 soup bowls; top with cheese and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings; can be doubled.

Comments:  Veggie crumbles, a savory blend of vegetable and grain proteins, lend this chili a hearty, ground beef flavor.  Look for it in the frozen foods section of the supermarket.  To go with the chili, warm some of the new flavored tortillas, and add a composed salad of jicama and red onion with poppy seed ranch dressing.  Then splurge with banana splits.

Let stand until lukewarm, about 30 minutes.  Stir in vanilla.  Strain berry mixture, reserving berries and juices separately.

Arrange 15 ladyfingers, side by side and standing upright, around inside of 5- to 6-cup soufflÈ dish (about 7 inches in diameter and 3 inches high).  Arrange 6 ladyfingers in bottom of dish, trimming to fit.  Spoon half of berries into lined dish.  Top with 6 ladyfingers, trimming to fit.  Spoon remaining berries over.  Top with 8 ladyfingers, trimming to fit.  Cover with plastic wrap; place small plate atop pudding to weigh down.  Chill pudding and juices separately overnight.

Peel back plastic wrap.  Invert pudding onto plate.  Spoon some of reserved juices over.  Cut into wedges and serve with Low-fat Vanilla Custard Sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Per serving (without custard sauce):  calories, 206;  total fat, 3 g;  saturated fat, 1 g;  cholesterol, 104 mg.

Comments:  Assemble this modern take on a classic English dessert the day before to allow the juices to be absorbed.  Look for the soft ladyfingers in the cookie or specialty foods aisle of the supermarket.

Categories    : Lamb                            Soup/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  boneless leg of lamb -- cut 1" cubes
  4               cups  water
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1              large  carrot -- chopped
  1              large  fresh dill bunch
  8                     white peppercorns
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place lamb, 4 cups water, onion, carrot, bunch of dill, peppercorns, and salt in heavy large pot.  Bring to boil over medium-high heat, skimming off foam.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until meat is tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours.

Strain broth into medium saucepan.  Boil until reduced to 2 1/3 cups, about 8 minutes.  Meanwhile, remove lamb from vegetables; discard vegetables.

Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add flour and whisk 1 minute.  Whisk in 2 1/3 cups reduced broth.  Cook until sauce thickens and boils, whisking occasionally, about 6 minutes.

Whisk in white wine vinegar, sugar and 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill.  Simmer 3 minutes to blend flavors.  Stir in cream and lamb and simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer to serving bowl.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The long cooking time makes this lamb meltingly tender.  Offer noodles alongside.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1                cup  chopped onion
  2              small  celery stalks -- stalks and
                        leaves chopped separately
  1             medium  leek, white and pale green parts only -- sliced
  1              large  garlic clove -- chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  red-skinned sweet potatoes (yams) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces - (abt 5 cups)
  4               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1                     cinnamon stick
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1 1/2           cups  half-and-half
  2        tablespoons  pure maple syrup
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Remove cinnamon stick and discard.  Working in batches, puree soup in blender until smooth.  Return to pot.  Add half-and-half and maple syrup and stir over medium-low heat to heat through.  Season soup to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cool soup slightly.  Cover and refrigerate soup and celery leaves separately.  Bring soup to simmer before continuing.)  Ladle into bowls.  Sprinkle with celery leaves.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  "While visiting my daughter near Portland, Oregon, I ordered the soup of the day at Motherís Bistro & Bar," writes Roslyn Levy of Palm Harbor, Florida.  "It turned out to be the best sweet-potato soup Iíve ever had."

Buy leafy celery stalks for this soup; the chopped leaves make a great garnish.

     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced fresh mint
  3        tablespoons  minced lemongrass
                        = (available at Asian markets)
  1           teaspoon  minced seeded Thai chile or serrano chile

Combine sliced cabbage, 2 tablespoons lime juice, and 1 tablespoon fish sauce in large bowl; toss to blend.  Season with salt and pepper; set cabbage mixture aside for up to 30 minutes.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper.  Grill until cooked to desired doneness, 3 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Transfer steaks to work surface; cut crosswise into thin slices.

Place sliced steaks in large bowl.  Add shallots, onion tops, cilantro, mint, lemongrass, and chili, then remaining 3 tablespoons lime juice and 2 tablespoons fish sauce.  Toss to blend.  Season salad with salt and pepper.

Divide cabbage mixture among 4 plates.  Top each with beef salad.

This recipe yields 4 main-course servings.

Comments:  Grilled rib eyes are sliced and tossed with mint, lemongrass, chili, and lime juice, then served atop a marinated cabbage mixture in this main-course salad.

Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit
                Restaurant

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PEARS ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  2 1/4         pounds  firm ripe pears - (abt 6) -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2" pieces
     1/4           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  Pinot Grigio
                        = (or other dry white wine)
     1/2                vanilla bean -- halved lengthwise
                        === ZABAGLIONE ===
  8              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  Tuaca liqueur
  2        tablespoons  chilled whipping cream -- plus
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        Powdered sugar -- as needed

For pears:  Melt butter in heavy large skillet over high heat.  Add pears; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add both sugars and wine and stir until sugar dissolves.  Scrape out seeds from vanilla bean and add to skillet; add bean.  Boil until pears are tender and juices in skillet form thick syrup, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Cool.  Discard vanilla bean.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

For zabaglione:  Whisk yolks, sugar, Tuaca, and 2 tablespoons cream in large metal bowl to blend well.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water).  Using electric mixer, beat yolk mixture constantly until mixture thickens and instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers 140 degrees for 3 minutes, about 7 minutes total.  Remove bowl from over water; place bowl in larger bowl of ice water.  Whisk occasionally until mixture is cool, about 3 minutes.

Using electric mixer, beat remaining 1 cup cream and cinnamon in medium bowl until peaks form.  Fold 1/3 of whipped cream into yolk mixture, then fold in remaining cream in 2 additions.  Chill until cold.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep refrigerated.)

Divide pears among 6 dessert glasses.  Spoon zabaglione over each.  Dust with powdered sugar and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Tuaca, a sweet, citrus- and vanilla-flavored Italian liqueur, enhances this sophisticated dessert.  Tuaca is available in many liquor stores.  But if you canít find it, use Grand Marnier or any other orange liqueur.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  1                     green onion -- minced

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  arborio rice

     3/4      teaspoon  salt

  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1              large  egg white
  1         tablespoon  cold water
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  12            ounces  chicken tenders -- halved lengthwise

     1/2         large  red bell pepper -- thinly sliced
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     bag baby spinach leaves - (6 oz)

Mix first 6 ingredients in small bowl for sauce.  Mix egg white, cold water, and cornstarch in medium bowl; mix in chicken.  Let sauce and chicken stand 15 minutes.

Heat wok or large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat 1 minute.  Add oil and tilt to coat.  Add chicken; stir-fry 2 minutes.  Add mushrooms, bell pepper, and garlic; stir-fry until mushrooms are browned at edges, about 3 minutes.  Add sauce; cook until sauce is reduced to glaze, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Mix in spinach and toss 1 minute.

Per serving:  calories, 262;  total fat, 9 g;  saturated fat, 2 g;  cholesterol, 34 mg.

Comments:  Offer either brown or white rice and Asian beer, like Tsingtao.  The chicken is especially tender because of the egg white and cornstarch coating.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24            slices  challah 1/2" thick - (abt 24 oz)
                        = (or other egg bread)
  2               cups  whipping cream
  2               cups  whole milk
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  8              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  dark rum
  2        tablespoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  dried tart cherries
                        Purchased caramel sauce -- heated

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Using 3-inch-diameter round cookie cutter, cut round from each bread slice and arrange on baking sheet.  Toast bread rounds in oven until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Bring cream, milk, and sugar to simmer in heavy large saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar.  Whisk eggs in large bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk hot cream mixture into eggs.  Whisk in rum and vanilla.

Butter eight 1 1/4-cup soufflÈ dishes; arrange on rimmed baking sheet.  Place 1 bread round in bottom of each dish.  Top each with 1 heaping tablespoon dried cherries.  Top cherries in each dish with another bread round.  Top each with another heaping tablespoon dried cherries.  Top cherries in each dish with third bread slice.  Divide custard among dishes, using about 3/4 cup for each.  Let stand 30 minutes, pressing down on bread occasionally.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Bake bread puddings until tops are puffed and brown, about 35 minutes.  Remove from oven; cool 10 minutes.  Serve warm with caramel sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  "My husband isn't usually a bread pudding fan," writes Priscilla Moynihan of Vancouver, Washington, "but he loved the dried-cherry version I had at the Southpark Seafood Grill in Portland, Oregon.  In fact, after he helped me finish it, we ordered another one."

The restaurant prepares this dessert with house-made brioche.  We simplified the recipe by using purchased challah.
