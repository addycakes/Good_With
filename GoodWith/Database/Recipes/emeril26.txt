--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    young artichokes
  2                     fresh lemons
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  olive oil

Trim the outer leaves of each artichoke and the stem to 2 inches long.  Using a peeler, peel the stems of each artichoke.  In a bowl, combine the artichokes and juice from the lemons.  Cover with ice water and allow to sit for 2 hours.  Drain well.  Using your hands, flatten each artichoke to the shape of a flower.

In a large earthenware pan, over medium heat, add the olive oil.  Add the artichokes, side by side and stem up.  Cook the artichokes until tender, turning the artichokes several times for overall browning.  Using a wooden spoon, press each artichoke firmly to the bottom of the pan so that the leaves flatten out.  Continue to cook for 10 minutes.

Carefully sprinkle a little water over the artichokes, this will crisp the artichokes.  Continue to cook for 2 minutes.

Place the artichokes on a large platter and serve.  Garnish with grated pecorino romano cheese.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Tomato And Black Olive Ragout:  In a saucepan heat olive oil and sautÈ onions until translucent, about 4 minutes.  Add garlic and cook another 1 to 2 minutes.  Add tomatoes, tomato paste and olives and cook until sauce is thick and most liquid has evaporated.  Season with herbs and salt and pepper to taste, adding sugar if necessary to correct acidity.  Serve warm on top of Baked Halibut In A Saffron Broth With Mashed Potatoes.

Mashed Potatoes And Saffron Broth:  In a large saucepan combine chicken stock and saffron and bring to a boil.  Add salt to taste, add potatoes and cook, covered, until fork-tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Strain liquid into another large saucepan and reserve.  Add butter to potatoes and stir and mash until completely melted.  Add milk, stir well, and add salt and pepper to taste.  Keep warm while making the halibut.

In a saucepan sautÈ shallots and garlic in olive oil until wilted, about 3 minutes.  Add reserved saffron stock and simmer for 10 minutes.  Add green onions and simmer 5 minutes.  Keep warm until ready to serve.

Halibut:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Season halibut fillets with Creole seasoning on both sides.  Rub fillets with olive oil and place on a lightly-oiled shallow casserole or baking sheet with sides and pour saffron broth around fillets.  Cover filets loosely with parchment paper or aluminum foil and bake for 5 minutes, uncover and bake another 5 minutes, or until flesh flakes easily.

Serve fillets in a large bowl on top of Mashed Potatoes, with Saffron Broth ladled over all and fish topped with a generous dollop of Tomato And Black Olive Ragout.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  Creole seasoning -- see * Note
  4                     bone-in Dry-Aged Rib-Eye steaks -- (20 to 22 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/4           cup  chopped shallots
  1         tablespoon  garlic
     1/4           cup  dry red wine
  1                cup  demi-glace
  4               cups  Mashed Potatoes -- hot, (see below)
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
                        === MASHED POTATOES ===
  2             pounds  potatoes -- peeled, diced
  1              stick  butter -- cubed
     1/2           cup  heavy cream - (to 3/4 cup)
                        Salt -- to taste

In a small bowl, combine the oil and Creole seasoning.  Mix well.  Spread each side of the steaks completely with the Creole seasoning mixture.  Place in a shallow pan, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Remove and bring to room temperature before grilling, about 30 minutes.  Preheat the grill.

In a saucepan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the shallots and garlic.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ for 1 minute.  Add the red wine and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the demi-glace.  Simmer for 2 minutes and remove from the heat, keeping warm.

Place the steaks on the grill and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes on each side for medium-rare.  Remove from the grill and cool for a couple of minutes before serving.  Place the steaks and potatoes on each serving plate.  Spoon a quarter of the sauce over each steak.  Garnish with parsley.

For the Mashed Potatoes:  Place the potatoes in a pot of salted water and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the potatoes until fork tender, about 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and drain.

Place the potatoes back in the pot and return to the heat.  Stir the potatoes, constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes to dehydrated the potatoes.  Remove the potatoes from the heat.  Add the butter.  Using a hand-held masher, mash the butter into the potatoes.  Add enough cream until desired smoothness is achieved.  The potatoes should still be sort of lumpy.  Season the potatoes with salt and pepper.  (Makes 6 to 8 servings)

     1/2           cup  light Karo syrup
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  minced onions
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
                        === FOR THE PORK ===
  8                     double-cut pork loin chops -- abt 2 1/2" to 3" thk
                        and abt 14 to 16 oz ea
                        Creole seasoning -- see * Note

Whisk all of the marinade ingredients together, in a mixing bowl, blending well.  Season the both sides of the pork chops with Creole seasoning.  Place the chops in a large Zip-lock bag.  Pour the marinade over the chops.  Seal and shake the bag to coat the chops evenly with the marinade.  Refrigerate for 24 hours, turning the bag several times.

Drain the pork in a colander, reserving the marinade.  Pour the marinade into a saucepan and simmer over medium-low heat until it is thick and dark, about 30 minutes.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Heat 2 large skillets over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of the oil to each skillet.  Add the pork chops and sear for 3 minutes on each side.  Remove from the pan and place on a wire rack set in a baking pan lined with parchment paper.  Bake for 15 minutes for medium.  Baste the pork chops every 5 minutes with the marinade.

Remove from the oven and rest for 5 minutes before serving.  Spoon the Smoked Gouda Cheese Macaroni in the center of each plate.  Lay a chop on the top and garnish with parsley.

Whisk all of the marinade ingredients together, in a mixing bowl, blending well.  Season the both sides of the pork chops with Creole seasoning.  Place the chops in a large Zip-lock bag.  Pour the marinade over the chops.  Seal and shake the bag to coat the chops evenly with the marinade.  Refrigerate for 24 hours, turning the bag several times.

<DirT>
Drain the pork in a colander, reserving the marinade.  Pour the marinade into a saucepan and simmer over medium-low heat until it is thick and dark, about 30 minutes.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Heat 2 large skillets over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of the oil to each skillet.  Add the pork chops and sear for 3 minutes on each side.  Remove from the pan and place on a wire rack set in a baking pan lined with parchment paper.  Bake for 15 minutes for medium.  Baste the pork chops every 5 minutes with the marinade.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the oven and rest for 5 minutes before serving.  Spoon the Smoked Gouda Cheese Macaroni in the center of each plate.  Lay a chop on the top and garnish with parsley.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TASSO CURING SPICES ===
     1/2         pound  salt
     1/4         pound  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4         ounce  cayenne
  4             ounces  paprika
  2             ounces  garlic powder
  1 3/4         ounces  onion powder
                        === CANAPES ===
  1                     side of salmon - (3 to 4 lbs) -- boned and trimmed
                        Wood chips -- as needed
  2               cups  sour cream
  1              bunch  fresh chives -- minced
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Creole seasoning -- see * Note
  1                     thinly-sliced loaf sandwich bread -- crusts removed
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
  6             ounces  salmon caviar

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a small bowl, combine the tasso curing spices and mix well.  On a large sheet pan spread a piece of plastic wrap.  Sprinkle 3/4 of the tasso curing spices on the wrap, then lay the side of salmon on top.  Cover the salmon with the remaining spices, using more on the head end of the fish.  Wrap the fish securely in the plastic and refrigerate for 4 days.

Soak wood chips in water for at least 30 minutes and prepare the grill.  Drain the chips and place in a stovetop smoker.  Unwrap the fish and place on the smoker, skin-side down.  Cover the smoker and cook for approximately 5 minutes to impart a smoky flavor.

Remove the fish from the smoker, brush the excess cure from the surface of the fish and allow to rest, covered, in the refrigerator at least 1 hour, or overnight.

In a medium bowl, mix together the sour cream, chives, lemon juice, salt and Creole seasoning to taste.  Cover and refrigerate until needed.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Lightly spread the sliced bread with butter and cut into either triangles or squares.  Toast the bread slices in the oven until just golden, about 4 minutes.  Allow to crisp on a cooling rack.

Slice the salmon thinly on a diagonal with a very sharp knife.  Fold 1 slice onto each toast and top with a dollop of chive sour cream and caviar.

This recipe yields approximately 60 canapes.

                Chestnut Ravioli With Sage Browned Butter

Recipe By     :Courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      First Course


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  shelled and skinned roasted chestnuts
  2             ounces  sliced pancetta or bacon -- finely chopped
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onions
  1              large  garlic clove -- smashed
     1/4           cup  water
  1                     Granny Smith apple
  2        tablespoons  finely-grated Parmesan
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  48                    round won ton wrappers - (12 oz pkg)
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh sage

Coarsely chop the chestnuts.  Cook the pancetta in 3 tablespoons butter in a heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp on edges, about 5 minutes.  Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until onion is softened.  Adds chestnuts and water and simmer, stirring, until liquid is reduced by half.  Discard the garlic.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and mash to a coarse paste with a fork.

Peel half of the apple and cut enough of the peeled half into 1/4-inch dice to measure 3 tablespoons.  Reserve remaining unpeeled apple.  Stir diced, peeled apple into the chestnut mixture with Parmesan, parsley and salt and pepper to taste.

Put 1 won ton wrapper on a work surface, keeping the remaining wrappers in plastic wrap, and mound 1 scant tablespoon of filling in center.  Lightly brush the edges of the wrapper with water and top with a second wrapper, pressing down around filling to force out air.  Trim excess dough with a 2 3/4-inch round cookie cutter and seal edges well, pressing them together with your fingertips.  Transfer the ravioli to a dry kitchen towel, then make more in the same manner.

Cut enough of the unpeeled apple into 1/4-inch dice to measure 3 tablespoons and toss with lemon juice.  Heat the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides and butter begins to turn brown.  Stir in sage and cook, stirring, until sage is crisp and butter is golden brown.  Season with salt and pepper.

Add ravioli to a 6-quart pot of salted boiling water, then cook at a slow boil, stirring gently occasionally, until tender, 3 to 5 minutes.  Carefully transfer ravioli with a slotted spoon to a colander to drain.  Slide ravioli into sage butter and cook over moderate heat, stirring gently, 1 minute.  Sprinkle ravioli with unpeeled apple and season with pepper.

This recipe yields 8 first course servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (abt 6 oz ea)
                        Plastic wrap
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
  8        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/4           cup  chopped chives
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1                cup  flour
  2                     eggs -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water
  2               cups  fine dried bread crumbs
                        Oil -- for frying
  1              pound  fresh asparagus -- roasted and hot
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
                        === WELSH RAREBIT SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  flour
     2/3           cup  ale
  10            ounces  extra-sharp cheddar cheese -- grated
  1           teaspoon  English mustard
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2              drops  hot sauce - (to 3 drops)

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat the fryer.  Place each breast between 2 sheets of plastic wrap.  Using a meat mallet, pound each breast out very thin.  Remove the top piece of plastic wrap from each breast.  Season with salt, pepper, and Essence.

Combine butter, chopped chives, and lemon juice.  Cover the top of each breast with some of the butter mixture.  Fold the 2 smaller ends of each breast in by 1 inch.  Beginning with 1 of the long ends, roll each breast up tightly and secure with toothpicks.

In 3 separate plates or bowls place the flour, beaten eggs, and bread crumbs and season each with Essence.

Dredge the stuffed chicken in the flour, shaking off any excess.  Dip each in the beaten egg, letting the excess drip off.  Finally, dredge each rolled breast in the seasoned bread crumbs, coating completely.

Remove the basket from the fryer and add the rolled chicken breast.  Slowly lower the basket into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 8 minutes, turning occasionally for overall browning.  Remove chicken when done and drain on paper towels.  Season with Essence.

To serve, slice each rolled breast into 1-inch pieces and lay in the center of each serving plate.  Place the asparagus around the chicken.  Spoon the sauce over the chicken.  Garnish with chives.

For the Welsh Rarebit Sauce:  Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat.  Add the flour and whisk to make a roux.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Whisk in the ale and boil the mixture for 3 minutes while whisking.  Reduce heat to low, add the Cheddar cheese, mustard, Worcestershire, and hot sauce.  Cook, stirring, until hot but not boiling.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Preheat the fryer.  Place each breast between 2 sheets of plastic wrap.  Using a meat mallet, pound each breast out very thin.  Remove the top piece of plastic wrap from each breast.  Season with salt, pepper, and Essence.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine butter, chopped chives, and lemon juice.  Cover the top of each breast with some of the butter mixture.  Fold the 2 smaller ends of each breast in by 1 inch.  Beginning with 1 of the long ends, roll each breast up tightly and secure with toothpicks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In 3 separate plates or bowls place the flour, beaten eggs, and bread crumbs and season each with Essence.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dredge the stuffed chicken in the flour, shaking off any excess.  Dip each in the beaten egg, letting the excess drip off.  Finally, dredge each rolled breast in the seasoned bread crumbs, coating completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the basket from the fryer and add the rolled chicken breast.  Slowly lower the basket into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 8 minutes, turning occasionally for overall browning.  Remove chicken when done and drain on paper towels.  Season with Essence.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, slice each rolled breast into 1-inch pieces and lay in the center of each serving plate.  Place the asparagus around the chicken.  Spoon the sauce over the chicken.  Garnish with chives.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Welsh Rarebit Sauce:  Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat.  Add the flour and whisk to make a roux.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Whisk in the ale and boil the mixture for 3 minutes while whisking.  Reduce heat to low, add the Cheddar cheese, mustard, Worcestershire, and hot sauce.  Cook, stirring, until hot but not boiling.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  milk
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  6             ounces  semi-sweet chocolate chips
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  10             large  egg yolks -- beaten
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
     1/2           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  butter

Combine the milk, sugar, chocolate, and vanilla in a large nonstick saucepan over medium heat.  Whisk to incorporate the chocolate.  When the mixture comes to a gentle boil or simmers after about 5 minutes, take 1 cup of the chocolate mixture and add it to the yolks.  Whisk well.

Dissolve the cornstarch in the water.  Slowly stir into the hot liquid.  Continue to cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the butter.  Pour into a glass bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap down on the surface of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming.  Cool completely and chill for at least 4 hours.

     1/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Kentucky Bourbon -- to taste
  1             recipe  Southern Cooked Greens II -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions
                        === VENISON MEDALLIONS ===
                        Fresh cinnamon sticks -- as needed

  2               cups  thinly-sliced onions
  2 1/2           cups  veal stock

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Season the potatoes with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Place in the oven and roast until tender, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and peel away the skin from each potato.

In sautÈ pan, over medium heat, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and flour.  Mix well.  Cook for about 10 minutes for a dark roux or until the color of chocolate, stirring constantly.  Add the onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cook until the onions are wilted, about 6 minutes.  Stir in the veal stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes.  Reseason if necessary.  Remove from the heat and keep warm.

Place loin in the oven and roast for about 20 minutes for medium-rare.  Remove from the oven and rest for 5 minutes before slicing.  Place a spoonful of the sweet potatoes in the center of each plate.  Mound the greens around the sweet potatoes.  Lay the slices of venison around the potatoes.  Spoon some of the gravy over the meat.  Garnish with green onions.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7               cups  beef stock or broth -- simmering
  2            pinches  saffron threads - (generous)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  onion -- minced
  1              large  shallot -- minced
  2 1/2           cups  Arborio or Carnaroli rice
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  fresh peas
  2 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- plus more
                        for garnishing, if desired

In a small, heatproof bowl, pour 1/2 cup of stock over saffron threads and let it stand while you begin the risotto.

In a heavy 3- or 4-quart casserole or Dutch oven, heat olive oil and sautÈ onion and shallot until soft and golden, about 6 minutes.  Add rice and cook, stirring continuously, until it begins to turn opaque, about 2 minutes.

Add the wine and stir until evaporated.  Season with salt and pepper.  Begin adding hot stock in 1/2 cup increments, stirring continuously, adding stock only when previous addition is completely absorbed.  Add peas with second stock addition.  Add saffron-infused stock about 10 minutes after adding the wine.  The risotto is done when al dente but creamy, usually 16 to 20 minutes after adding the wine.  You may or may not need all of the stock.

When the rice has reached the desired stage of doneness, turn off the heat and quickly stir in the butter, cream and Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Check seasoning and serve immediately, garnished with additional cheese if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     country ham steaks - (8 oz ea) -- uncooked
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  flour
     3/4           cup  very strong coffee
     3/4           cup  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BUTTERMILK BISCUITS ===
  2               cups  flour -- sifted
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  buttermilk -- plus
  2          teaspoons  buttermilk

Heat a large skillet over high heat and sautÈ ham steaks 4 to 5 minutes on each side.  Remove to a plate and keep warm while you make the sauce.

Add butter and onions to skillet and cook until onions are softened, scraping up any browned bits on pan bottom.  Add flour and stir well to combine.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then add coffee and chicken stock.  Whisk well to combine, then allow sauce to cook until thickened, about 6 minutes.

Add green onions and heavy cream and cook 5 minutes longer.  Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve over ham steaks with Buttermilk Biscuits.

Buttermilk Biscuits:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients and blend thoroughly.  Using your fingers or a pastry blender, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add buttermilk and quickly blend in, making sure to not overwork the dough.

On a lightly-floured surface, roll out the dough with a rolling pin to a thickness of 1/2-inch.  Use a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass, press out as many biscuits as possible.  Gather up scraps and quickly knead back together, then cut out as many additional biscuits as possible.

Place biscuits on prepared baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  chopped onions
     1/4           cup  chopped red bell pepper

     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
  2               cups  artichoke hearts -- cooked, trimmed,
                        and quartered
     1/2         pound  cooked crawfish tails, with fat if possibl
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
     1/2           cup  flour
  2        tablespoons  Creole Seasoning -- see * Note
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  milk
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
  1             medium  eggplant -- cut 1/2" batons
     1/2           cup  olive oil

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a large saucepan heat oil over medium-high heat.  When oil is hot, add butter and then onions, bell pepper and garlic and cook until vegetables are wilted.  Add rice and sautÈ for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until grains begin to look opaque.

Add wine and cook until evaporated, stirring constantly.  Add 3/4 cup of the stock, lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Continue to stir constantly, adding additional stock in half-cup increments as liquid is absorbed by rice.

After rice has cooked for 10 minutes, add green onions and artichoke hearts and cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add crawfish tails, heavy cream, half of the Parmesan cheese and parsley, and stir well to combine.

Remove from heat, let sit for 5 minutes before serving, garnished with Crispy Eggplant and remaining Parmesan cheese.

In a bowl, combine the flour with 1 tablespoon of the Creole seasoning.  In another bowl, whisk egg together with the milk.  In a third bowl, combine cornmeal with remaining tablespoon of Creole seasoning.

Dredge eggplant batons in the seasoned flour.  Transfer to the eggwash, then to the seasoned cornmeal, shaking off any excess.

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat olive oil until very hot.  Add eggplant and fry, turning occasionally, until golden-brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.  With a slotted spoon, remove eggplant to absorbent towels, and sprinkle with salt.  Serve immediately on top of Crawfish-Artichoke Risotto, garnished with remaining grated Parmesan cheese.

                      Creamy Cranberry Bread Pudding

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     brioche challah loaves - (2 lbs ea)
  6               cups  half-and-half
  6               cups  heavy cream
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2                     vanilla beans -- split lengthwise
  18                    eggs
  3               cups  granulated sugar
  3               cups  cranberries
     1/2           cup  orange marmalade
                        Confectionersí sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Cut the crusts off the bread and cut into 1-inch cubes.  You should have about 10 1/2 cups of cubes.  Arrange on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until light golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Watch carefully to make sure they do not brown too much; set aside to cool.  Leave the oven on.

In a saucepan, heat the half-and-half, cream, salt, and vanilla bean over medium heat, stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn't burn or stick to the bottom of the pan.  When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat.  Set aside to infuse 10 to 15 minutes.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar together.  Whisking constantly, gradually add the hot cream mixture.  Strain into a large bowl to smooth the mixture and remove the vanilla bean.  Add the bread cubes, toss well, and let soak until absorbed.  Fold the mixture occasionally to ensure even soaking.

In a food processor pulse the berries to roughly chop them.  Fold them into the soaked bread cubes carefully.  Divide half the bread mixture among 20 ramekins, custard cups, or dessert cups, reserving the rest, filling them half way.  Place a teaspoon of orange marmalade in each ramekin then top off with the remaining soaked bread mixture.

Arrange the puddings in a hot water bath.  Bake until set and golden brown on top, about 30 minutes for individual puddings.  Serve warm or chilled, dusted with confectionersí sugar.

This recipe yields 20 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  bacon -- chopped
  6                     young sweet corn ears
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onions
  1                cup  chopped green bell peppers
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne -- to taste
  2               cups  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
                        (or 1 cup chopped canned tomatoes)
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions

In a large skillet, over medium heat, render the bacon until crispy.  Drain the bacon on paper towels and set aside.  Pour off all of the bacon fat except for 2 tablespoons.

To the pan, over medium heat, add the oil, onions and bell peppers.  Season with salt and cayenne.  SautÈ for 2 minutes.  Add the corn.  Season with salt and cayenne.  Continue to sautÈ for 10 minutes.

Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until the corn is tender.  Stir in the milk and remove from heat.  Stir in the crispy bacon and green onions.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     3/4           cup  honey
  1             bottle  beer - (12 oz)
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  ground allspice
     1/2           cup  Creole Seasoning -- see * Note
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1              pinch  ground cloves
                        === FOR THE SEASONING MIX ===
  1                cup  salt
  1         tablespoon  cayenne
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === TO FRY ===
  2                     turkeys - (8 to 10 lbs each)
  10           gallons  peanut oil - (about)

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

**  You will need a turkey rig to fry the turkeys and syringes to inject them

To make the marinade:  Combine all of the ingredients in a food processor or blender and process for about 5 minutes.  Fill a syringe and inject each turkey in the breast and thigh area, as well as the back, wings, and legs.  You will have to fill the syringe several times.

Next, combine the seasoning ingredients and rub the mixture evenly all over each turkey.

Place the turkeys in large plastic bags and secure before icing them down or refrigerating them for 24 hours.

To fry each turkey:  Fill a large pot three quarters of the way full with the peanut oil and heat the oil to between 350 and 360 degrees.  Place 1 turkey in the basket insert and carefully and slowly lower it into the hot oil.  Turn the turkey every 10 minutes, using long-handled forks.  A whole turkey will take 3 to 5 minutes per pound to cook.  It is done when the internal temperature reaches 170 to 180 degrees on an instant read meat thermometer.

Carefully lift the basket out of the hot oil.  This can be done by inserting a broomstick through the handles and having two strong people lift the basket out of the pot.  Using the long-handled forks, transfer the turkey to a large brown paper bag and let stand for about 15 minutes before removing to carve.  Repeat the procedure for the second turkey.  Carve the turkey and serve with the other traditional side items.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped pimentos
  5                     garlic cloves -- chopped

Remove from the oven and place the clams on a large platter.  Pour any pan drippings over the clams.  Garnish with parsley.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Sauterne -- plus
  1         tablespoon  Sauterne -- (or other sweet
                        late harvest dessert wine)
  1           envelope  unflavored gelatin
  6             ounces  prepared chopped duck confit
  6             ounces  chopped goose or duck foie gras
  1                     egg white
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  15            slices  brioche or homemade-style white bread -- crusts removed
                        Vegetable oil or clarified butter -- for frying

In a small saucepan heat 1 cup of wine over medium-low heat.  Remove from the heat and sprinkle the gelatin over the wine and stir to dissolve completely.  Pour into a glass loaf pan or medium, shallow bowl and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.  Cut into small dice and refrigerate until ready to use.

In a food processor blend the duck confit, 4 ounces foie gras, egg white, bread crumbs, salt, pepper and remaining 1 tablespoon of wine.  Pulse until the mixture forms a spreadable mousse, but is not completely smooth.

Divide the foie gras mixture among the sliced bread, spreading it evenly to the edges, then slice in half.

In a small heavy skillet, render the remaining foie gras over medium-high heat.  Fry the foie gras toasts in batches, being careful not to overcrowd, coated-sides down first, until golden brown, about 1 minute on each side.  Add vegetable oil as needed to keep 1/4-inch fat in the skillet for frying the toasts.

Remove the toasts, drain on paper towels and allow to cool slightly, about 30 seconds, before garnishing each toast with 1 teaspoon diced Sauterne GelÈe.

This recipe yields 30 hors díoeuvre, or 6 servings.

  25                    fresh mint leaves
     1/2           cup  simple syrup - (equal amounts sugar and
                        water simmered until sugar dissolves)
  3               cups  ice
     1/2           cup  bourbon
                        Mint sprigs -- for garnish

In the bottom of a tall glass, combine mint leaves and simple syrup and crush leaves with the handle of a wooden spoon -- the more you mash the leaves, the more mint flavor you will extract.

In a blender combine the simple syrup, ice, and bourbon and blend on the "ice crush" setting until ice is finely chopped and smooth.

Rub the rims of tall glasses with orange segments or a little simple syrup and dip glass rims in sugar, then fill with the frozen mint juleps and garnish with fresh mint sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 cocktails.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     garlic head -- top 1/3 removed to
                        expose the tops of the cloves
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  russet or Idaho potatoes, peeled and cut i
  1 1/2         pounds  parsnips -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  1              stick  butter -- softened
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     3/4           cup  heavy cream

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the garlic on a square of aluminum foil and drizzle with the olive oil.  Wrap the garlic tightly in the foil and bake until soft, about 30 to 40 minutes.  Unwrap the garlic and cool.  Gently press the cloves between your thumb and forefinger to release the softened garlic into a small bowl.  Set aside.

Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil.  Add the potatoes and parsnips and simmer until they are tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain the vegetables and force through the medium disk of a food mill or ricer into a bowl, or alternately mash with a potato masher in a large mixing bowl.

Add the garlic cloves, butter, salt and pepper and mix well, and stir in the cream a bit at a time to achieve the desired consistency.  Serve immediately, or chill, covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, reheating before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

       Gnocchi With A Garlic Cream Sauce And Balsamic Glazed Pearl 

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  Idaho potatoes - (abt 3 large) -- scrubbed, and
                        boiled in skins until tender
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  finely-grated Parmesan cheese
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  flour - (to 1 cup)
                        Salted water -- for cooking gnocchi
                        === GARLIC CREAM SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  roasted garlic -- pureed, minced
  4               cups  heavy cream
                        Salt - to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
                        === BALSAMIC-GLAZED PEARL ONIONS ===
  1               pint  pearl onions -- peeled, ends trimmed
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  chicken or beef stock
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme

Allow the cooked potatoes to cool slightly, then carefully peel while holding potato with a kitchen mitt.  While still hot, puree potatoes through a ricer or food mill into a large mixing bowl and allow to cool completely before proceeding.

Add the cheese, egg, salt and pepper and mix well.  Gradually add in enough flour to form a smooth, slightly sticky dough.  Briefly knead the dough to incorporate the flour, being careful not to overwork.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.

Cut the dough into 6 equal pieces and place 1 piece on a lightly floured work surface.  Roll piece into a long rope, about 1/2-inch in diameter, flouring lightly if needed.  Slice the rope into pieces 1/2-inch wide.  Roll each piece briefly to form small balls.  Holding one piece at a time, roll the tines of a fork against the dough until slight indentations are formed.  Repeat with each piece of dough, setting formed gnocchi on a floured kitchen towel or baking sheet.

Immediately add the gnocchi to the boiling water and continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes once they have risen to the top.  Remove the cooked gnocchi with a slotted spoon or skimmer and serve immediately with Garlic Cream Sauce and Balsamic Glazed Pearl Onions.

Garlic Cream Sauce:  In a saucepan combine roasted garlic and heavy cream and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until liquid has reduced by half, about 20 minutes.

In a blender, puree sauce (Use caution if hot!), and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Toss gnocchi with sauce and garnish with Balsamic Glazed Pearl Onions.

Balsamic Glazed Pearl Onions:  In a skillet over medium-high heat sautÈ onions in butter until golden brown on all sides, turning onions frequently for even coloring.  Season with salt and pepper and add balsamic vinegar, stock, sugar and thyme sprigs and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until liquid has evaporated to a syrupy consistency and onions are cooked through, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Note: If liquid has reduced and onions are not cooked through, add a little bit of water and continue to cook until done, scraping sides and bottom of pan to prevent burning.

This recipe yields 4 main course servings or 6 first course servings.

            Grilled Turkey With Pomegranate-Black Pepper Glaze

Recipe By     :Courtesy of Bobby Flay
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fresh turkey - (abt 15 lbs)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === POMEGRANATE-BLACK PEPPER GLAZE ===
  1 1/2           cups  pomegranate molasses
  3        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  prepared horseradish -- drained
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste

Pomegranate-Black Pepper Glaze:  Whisk together all ingredients in a medium bowl and season with salt to taste.

Truss the turkey.  Place turkey on a work surface, breast side up.  Rub it with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.

Heat the grill to medium heat.  Have the rotisserie shaft fitted with 1 spit fork.  Making certain that the turkey is centered, push the rotisserie shaft through the turkey between the legs, exiting at the neck.  Slide the spit fork onto the shaft.  Insert the tines of the spit forks into the turkey, screw-side up, and tighten the screws to secure firmly.

Set the rotisserie shaft in place in the rotisserie ring.  Loosen the retaining loop at the handle, and let the counterweight assembly hang down to counterbalance the weight of the breast.  The rotisserie should rotate so that the heavy side of the turkey rotates down to the bottom.  Swing the counterweight assembly so that the counterweight is directly opposite the heavy side of the turkey.  Tighten the retaining loop.  The counterweight travel should stick out a little bit above the shaft handle and retaining loop.  You may need to adjust the travel of the counterweight as the food cooks, or if the motor sounds like it is straining.

Insert the pointed end of the rotisserie shaft into the motor.  Set the rotisserie shaft into the ring.  Cover the grill, and turn the motor on.  Grill the turkey 11 minutes per pound if unstuffed.  During the last 30 minutes, baste the entire turkey with 1 cup of the marinade.

Remove the turkey from the grill and immediately brush with the remaining glaze.  Let rest for 20 minutes before slicing.  To determine if the turkey is thoroughly cooked, insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the inner muscle of the thigh, making certain not to touch the bone, and check that the temperature is 175 to 180 degrees.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  fresh turkey - (abt 10 lbs)
  10              cups  water
  2             medium  yellow onions -- quartered
  2                     celery ribs -- each cut 6 pieces
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cayenne
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  bleached all-purpose flour
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions
  1                cup  chopped green bell peppers
  1                cup  chopped celery
     1/2         pound  andouille or other smoked sausage -- finely chopped, plus
  1              pound  smoked sausage -- cut 1/4" crosswise
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions or scallions -- green part only
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves

Put the turkey, water, quartered onions, celery pieces, bay leaves 1 tablespoon of the salt, and 1 teaspoon of the cayenne in a large, heavy pot.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook, partially covered, until the turkey is tender, about 2 hours.  Remove the turkey, strain and reserve the broth.

In a large, heavy pot or a Dutch oven, over medium heat, combine the oil and flour.  Stirring slowly and constantly, make a dark brown roux, the color of chocolate, 20 to 25 minutes.

Add the chopped onions, bell peppers, chopped celery, and chopped sausage.  Cook, stirring, until the vegetables are very soft, 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the reserved broth and stir until the roux mixture and broth are well combined.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/2 hours.

Meanwhile, remove the skin from the turkey and pick the meat off the bones, discarding the skin and bones.  Coarsely chop the turkey meat.  Add the turkey and the sliced sausage to the gumbo.  Cook for 15 minutes.

Remove from the heat and let sit for 5 minutes before skimming off the fat that has risen to the surface.  Stir in the green onions and parsley and serve the gumbo in individual soup or gumbo bowls.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sugar
  1                cup  butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  5                     eggs -- separated
  2               cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1                cup  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  ground pecans
  2               cups  freshly-grated frozen coconut
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
  2             pounds  powdered sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  milk
  1                cup  crushed fresh pineapple
  1                cup  pecan pieces

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease and flour 3 (8-inch) cake pans.

Using an electric mixer, cream the sugar with 1/2 cup of the butter.  With the mixer running, add the oil and incorporate thoroughly.  Add the egg yolks, 1 at a time, beating well after each yolk.

Sift the flour and baking soda together.  Add the ground pecans to the flour mixture.  Alternately add the flour mixture and buttermilk to the egg mixture.  Mix thoroughly.  Fold in 1 cup of the coconut.

Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until stiff.  Fold the egg whites into the cake batter.  Pour the batter into the prepared pans.

Bake the cakes for about 25 to 30 minutes or until the center of each cake is set.  Remove the cakes from the oven and cool on a wire cake.  After the cakes have cooled, invert each cake onto a piece of parchment paper.  Set the cakes aside.

Using an electric mixer, cream the remaining butter with the cream cheese.  Add the powdered sugar, vanilla, milk and pineapple.  Mix well.  Fold in the pecans.

Slice each cake in half, horizontally.  Spread a thin layer of the frosting on top of each cake.  Place the layers of cake on top of each other.  Place the cake on a serving platter.  Ice the sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.  Sprinkle the top of the cake with the remaining coconut.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  2             pounds  white beans
  2 1/2         quarts  chicken stock
  4                     ham hocks

  4                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
                        === FOR THE GARNISH ===
  2                     rabbits -- portioned into
                        legs and loins
  10                    quail -- rib bones removed
                        Creole seasoning -- see * Note
  1                cup  flour -- seasoned with
  1         tablespoon  Creole seasoning
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1                cup  diced yellow onion
     1/2           cup  diced bell pepper
     1/2           cup  diced celery
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  10            pieces  andouille link sausage - (2 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        Reserved cooking liquid from beans -- still warm
  1                cup  tomato concasse
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === BREAD CRUMB CRUST ===
  2               cups  unseasoned bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     egg yolks

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

For the beans:  In a 6-quart stock pot, combine all of the ingredients.  Simmer until the beans are tender, approximately 1 1/2 hours (this will vary).  Drain the beans and reserve liquid.  Pick out the bay leaves.  When the ham hocks are cool to the touch, pick the meat off the bones, roughly chop it and set aside.

For the garnish:   Heat a 6-quart Dutch oven to medium-high heat.  Season the rabbit and the quail generously with Creole seasoning and dredge in the seasoned flour.  Add the olive oil to the pan and begin to lightly brown the rabbit and the quail.  Reserve them on absorbent cloth.

Add the onion, bell pepper and celery to the pan.  Cook for 5 minutes, scraping the pan periodically.  Add the garlic and the andouille and cook an additional 3 minutes.  Add 1/4 cup of the seasoned flour and stir to form a roux.  Add additional flour as needed to form a stiff roux.  Cook the roux for 5 minutes, constantly stirring, until roux is the color of peanut butter.

Add the Worcestershire sauce.  Slowly add the stock from the beans, stirring to dissolve the roux.  Cook for 10 minutes.  Add the tomato concasse, the rabbit, quail, and reserved ham hock meat.  Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Add the beans to the pot and mix well.  Top with breadcrumb mixture and bake in a 375 degree oven for 45 minutes, or until bubbly and crust is golden brown and crispy.

Bread crumb crust:   Combine all ingredients in the bowl of a food processor and pulse for 30 seconds until combined.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  1                cup  chopped bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  3                     bay leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped thyme leaves
  1                cup  chopped tomatoes
  6               cups  water

In a large Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Season shrimp with Creole seasoning and sautÈ until almost cooked through, about 4 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove shrimp and set aside until later.

Season chicken pieces with Creole seasoning.  Add remaining olive oil to Dutch oven and when hot, add chicken pieces and sautÈ until browned on both sides, about 8 minutes.  Remove and set aside.

Add sausage and cook until browned.  Add onion, celery, bell pepper, garlic, bay leaves, cayenne and thyme and cook until vegetables are wilted, about 6 minutes.  Add tomatoes and water and return chicken pieces to pot.  Season with salt and pepper and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.

Add rice to pot, stir well and return to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and cook for 15 minutes.  Add shrimp, green onions and parsley to Dutch oven, mixing carefully, and continue to cook, covered, for another 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and let sit 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE KOULIBIACA ===
  32             large  sea scallops -- cut into thirds
                        to form flat disc shapes
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
  1           teaspoon  white truffle oil
  16                    sheets Phyllo dough -- defrosted, and
                        covered with damp towel for working
     1/2         pound  melted butter
     1/4           cup  dry bread crumbs
     1/2         pound  sliced smoked salmon
  64                    very-thin slices black truffle
  1              pound  spinach -- blanched, and
                        excess liquid removed
  3                     hard-boiled eggs -- chopped
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  3             medium  shallots -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
  6             ounces  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  2             ounces  truffle butter -- cut small pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Marinate scallops in lemon juice and truffle oil and season with salt and white pepper while you are preparing the other ingredients.

On a clean, dry countertop place 1 sheet of phyllo with short side closest to you and brush with melted butter.  Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of dry bread crumbs and cover with another sheet of phyllo.  Place smoked salmon slices on phyllo, covering an area about 2 inches by 4 inches about 1/4 way up the pieces of phyllo.

Place 4 pieces of scallops on top of this, top scallops with slices of truffle, then top with 4 more pieces of scallop, drizzling with melted butter between layers.  Now put a thin layer of blanched spinach, top with 4 more pieces of scallops, then a layer of chopped egg, finally topping with another layer of smoked salmon, drizzling with butter between layers.

Fold edge of phyllo closest to you over on top of salmon, fold in left and right edges, then roll koulibiaca up completely.  Continue with remaining phyllo and filling to make a total of 8 packets.  Brush tops with melted butter, and refrigerate 10 minutes before baking.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown on top.  Serve immediately with sauce.

For the sauce:  In a small saucepan, combine the shallots, vinegar and wine and reduce to 1/4 cup.  Add the heavy cream and reduce by half.  Slowly whisk in the cold butter, adding the truffle butter last.  Season the sauce with salt and white pepper.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 (1-ounce) servings.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             pounds  Roma tomatoes -- peeled, cored,
                        and coarsely chopped
     2/3           cup  black olives, such as kalamata -- pitted, halved
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FRIED CALAMARI ===
  1              pound  calamari -- thawed, and
                        cut into 1/4" slices
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
                        Creole Seasoning -- see * Note
  1                cup  masa harina
  1                cup  flour
     1/2         pound  feta cheese -- crumbled
                        === LINGUICA CRUSTED REDFISH ===
  10            ounces  linguica -- finely chopped
     2/3           cup  bread crumbs -- to bind
  8                     redfish fillets
                        Creole Seasoning -- see * Note
  4        tablespoons  olive oil

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

For the Portuguese olive-tomato sauce:  In a saucepan sautÈ onion and garlic in olive oil over medium heat until translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes and olives and continue to cook until sauce is thick and most excess liquid has evaporated, about 25 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste and serve warm with linguica crusted redfish and fried calamari.

For the fried calamari:  In a mixing bowl, marinate the calamari in the buttermilk with 2 tablespoons Creole Seasoning and allow to sit for 20 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine masa harina and flour along with 2 tablespoons Creole seasoning.  Dredge the calamari in the flour mixture and sift to remove any excess.  Deep fry calamari until golden, 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent from sticking together.  Drain on paper towels, season with creole seasoning, and serve on top of redfish along with Portuguese olive-tomato sauce.  Garnish with feta cheese.

For the linguica crusted redfish:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  In a skillet, cook linguica over medium heat until most fat has rendered.  Add bread crumbs and mix well.  Set aside.

Season redfish on both sides with Creole Seasoning.

In 1 large or 2 small skillets heat olive oil until very hot and sear redfish for about 3 minutes, or until you have a nice golden color.  Turn fillets over and carefully remove any excess fat from the skillet.

Divide linguica mixture between fillets and bake for 5 minutes.  Remove and serve immediately with Portuguese olive-tomato sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  lobster meat -- raw
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  cognac
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  cooked medium-grain rice
                        Sausage casings, 1 1/2" dia, and
                        about 4 feet in length
  3        tablespoons  butter - (to 4 tbspns)
  8                     round French-bread croutons, abt 3" dia
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
                        === FRESH LEMON-TARRAGON BUTTER SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  2                     fresh lemons -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  1 1/2         sticks  cold butter -- cut into pieces
     1/4      teaspoon  hot sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh tarragon leaves

In a food processor, combine the lobster meat, shallots, cream and cognac.  Season with salt, cayenne and pepper.  Turn the mixture into a mixing bowl.  Stir in the rice and parsley.  Season with salt, cayenne and black pepper.  To test the seasoning of the sausage, pan-fry a small piece of the filling for a couple of minutes on each side.  Re-adjust the seasoning if needed.

Either using a feeding tube or a funnel, stuff the sausage into the casings and make 3-inch links.  Bring a large saucepan of salted water up to a boil.  Poach the sausage for about 5 minutes, or until the sausage is firm to the touch and plump.  Remove from the water and allow to cool.

In a large sautÈ pan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Pan-fry the sausage for 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Remove from the pan and keep warm.  To serve, spoon the sauce in the center of each plate.  Lay a crouton in the center of the sauce.  Place a couple of links of sausage over each crouton.  Garnish with parsley and butter sauce.

For the Fresh Lemon And Tarragon Butter Sauce:  In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the shallots and lemon juice.  Season with salt and cayenne.  Bring the mixture to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the mixture reduces by half.  Add the cream and continue to cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, a couple of pieces at a time.  Season with the salt and cayenne.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve.  Add the hot sauce, Worcestershire and chopped tarragon.  Keep hot.  (Makes about 2 cups)

In a food processor, combine the lobster meat, shallots, cream and cognac.  Season with salt, cayenne and pepper.  Turn the mixture into a mixing bowl.  Stir in the rice and parsley.  Season with salt, cayenne and black pepper.  To test the seasoning of the sausage, pan-fry a small piece of the filling for a couple of minutes on each side.  Re-adjust the seasoning if needed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Either using a feeding tube or a funnel, stuff the sausage into the casings and make 3-inch links.  Bring a large saucepan of salted water up to a boil.  Poach the sausage for about 5 minutes, or until the sausage is firm to the touch and plump.  Remove from the water and allow to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large sautÈ pan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Pan-fry the sausage for 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Remove from the pan and keep warm.  To serve, spoon the sauce in the center of each plate.  Lay a crouton in the center of the sauce.  Place a couple of links of sausage over each crouton.  Garnish with parsley and butter sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Fresh Lemon And Tarragon Butter Sauce:  In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the shallots and lemon juice.  Season with salt and cayenne.  Bring the mixture to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the mixture reduces by half.  Add the cream and continue to cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, a couple of pieces at a time.  Season with the salt and cayenne.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve.  Add the hot sauce, Worcestershire and chopped tarragon.  Keep hot.  (Makes about 2 cups)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     celery ribs -- roughly chopped
  2                     onions -- roughly chopped
  2                     carrots -- roughly chopped

  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
  2                     thyme sprigs
  2                     parsley sprigs
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, smashed
  2                     bay leaves
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2                     live lobsters - (1 1/2 to 2 lbs ea)
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh fennel bulb -- fronds and
                        upper stems reserved
  3        tablespoons  minced chervil or parsley
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  6        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest
  1                     lemon -- juiced
     1/2           cup  minced shallots or onion
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  36                    wonton or egg roll wrappers

In a large pot place 1 gallon of water and the celery, onion, carrot, lemon and orange juices, peppercorns, thyme, parsley, garlic, bay leaves, white wine and salt.  Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, then add the lobsters and poach for 9 minutes.  Remove the lobsters from the water with tongs and drain.  When cool enough to handle, remove the lobster meat and claw meat from the shells, finely chop and set aside, reserving the shells.

Into a clean pot strain the cooking liquid through a fine mesh strainer.  Add the lobster shells and bring to a boil over high heat and reduce by half.  Add the fronds and upper stems from the fennel bulb and reduce again by half (should be between 2 and 3 cups).  Strain the liquid again into a clean saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Add the chervil, cream, 2 tablespoons butter and 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest to the pan and season to taste.  Remove sauce from the heat and cover.

In a large sautÈ pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat and sautÈ the fennel, shallots and garlic until soft.  Add the chopped lobster meat and sautÈ for 2 minutes.  Add the lemon juice and remaining lemon zest and butter to the pan and stir to incorporate, then pour onto a plate to cool.

On a flat surface spread out 18 won ton wrappers and spoon 1 tablespoon of lobster filling into the center of each.  Brush a little water on the outer rim of the filled wrapper and top a wrapper.  Press gently around the filling and the edges of the wrappers to seal.  (Ravioli may be refrigerated at this point, covered tightly, until ready to use, up to 2 hours.)

Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, drop in the ravioli in batches and cook for 30 seconds.  Drain thoroughly and place 3 ravioli in the center of each serving plate, and coat with the sauce.

This recipe yields 18 ravioli, serving 6 as an appetizer.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pumpkin
     1/4           cup  melted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

  2                     celery ribs -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  celery seed
  1           teaspoon  fennel seed
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley -- divided
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh sage -- divided
  2                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled and cubed
  2             pounds  ground turkey sausage
     3/4           cup  Sauvignon Blanc wine
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1            package  cornbread stuffing - (16 oz)
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth

Cut off the lid of the pumpkin and set it aside.  Pull out the seeds and strings from inside the pumpkin.  Brush the inside flesh with melted butter, season with salt and pepper.  Place pumpkin on a roasting pan and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.

In a large skillet, heat oil over moderate heat.  Add onion, celery, garlic, celery seed, fennel seed and 2 tablespoons each parsley and sage.  Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the apples and cook 2 minutes.  Add the ground sausage, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, and brown until no longer pink, about 10 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with wine, cook down 2 minutes to evaporate the alcohol.  Stir in the cream, check seasoning.

Scrape the sausage mixture into a large bowl and fold in the cornbread.  Gradually blend in the eggs and chicken broth, until the stuffing is evenly moistened.  Add remaining parsley and sage.  Fill the pumpkin with stuffing, return to the oven and bake 20 minutes until the eggs are cooked and the stuffing has a little lift.  Serve stuffing in the pumpkin bowl topped with lid.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Cut off the lid of the pumpkin and set it aside.  Pull out the seeds and strings from inside the pumpkin.  Brush the inside flesh with melted butter, season with salt and pepper.  Place pumpkin on a roasting pan and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.

<DirT>
In a large skillet, heat oil over moderate heat.  Add onion, celery, garlic, celery seed, fennel seed and 2 tablespoons each parsley and sage.  Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the apples and cook 2 minutes.  Add the ground sausage, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, and brown until no longer pink, about 10 minutes.  Deglaze the pan with wine, cook down 2 minutes to evaporate the alcohol.  Stir in the cream, check seasoning.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Scrape the sausage mixture into a large bowl and fold in the cornbread.  Gradually blend in the eggs and chicken broth, until the stuffing is evenly moistened.  Add remaining parsley and sage.  Fill the pumpkin with stuffing, return to the oven and bake 20 minutes until the eggs are cooked and the stuffing has a little lift.  Serve stuffing in the pumpkin bowl topped with lid.

     1/4         pound  unsalted butter -- cold, and
                        cut into pieces
  4            bunches  watercress -- fleshy stems removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === ROASTED SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS ===
  1              pound  shiitake mushrooms -- cleaned
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped thyme
  1         tablespoon  chopped rosemary
                        Olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms:  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  In a large bowl, toss together the mushrooms, garlic, herbs, olive oil and salt and pepper.  Place the mushrooms on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes.

Heat a 14-inch saute pan to medium-high.  Dry the skin side of the filets with a cloth.  Generously season both sides of the fish with salt and white pepper.  Add the clarified butter to the pan and place 3 of the fillets in the pan skin-side down.  Cook for 3 minutes and gently turn using a fish spatula.  Cook an additional 2 minutes and reserve on absorbent cloth.  Cook the other fillets in the same fashion.

Wipe the hot pan out with a dry clean cloth.  Add the cold butter to the pan and swirl around.  Allow the butter to brown.  Carefully add the crabmeat to the pan and use a wooden spoon to gently stir the pan.  Add the lemon juice and parsley.  Remove from the heat.

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the warm mushrooms and their oil with the watercress.  Place some of the mixture on a plate.  Place fillet of fish skin-side up on top of the salad and top with a generous amount of the crab meat mixture.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  coriander seeds
  2        tablespoons  mustard seeds
  2        tablespoons  white peppercorns
  2        tablespoons  allspice berries
  6                     dried red chiles - (to 8)
  1              piece  dried gingerroot - (2" long)
  1              piece  cinnamon stick - (2" long)
  6                     dried bay leaves
  4        tablespoons  Kosher salt
  1                cup  juniper berries
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  4             pounds  venison loin -- trimmed of excess

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter -- at room temperature
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar
  3               cups  chopped peeled Fuyu persimmons
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  water
  1                cup  light brown sugar
  3              large  eggs
  4               cups  bleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar
  2        tablespoons  dark Karo syrup
  2        tablespoons  milk

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 13- by 9- by 2-inch rectangle pan with 1 teaspoon of the butter.

In a medium-size nonreactive saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter.  Add the brown sugar, persimmons, and the lemon juice.  SautÈ the mixture for 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened.

In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the water.  Add to the persimmon mixture and cook, stirring, until it thickens, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool completely.

In a large mixing bowl, cream 1/4 pound (1 stick) of the butter and the light brown sugar with an electric mixer.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.

Into a medium-size mixing bowl, sift 3 1/2 cups of the flour, the baking powder, baking soda, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, and the salt.  Add the flour mixture, buttermilk, and vanilla to the butter mixture and beat with the electric mixer until everything is incorporated.

In another medium-size mixing bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, the remaining 1/2 cup flour, the remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon.  Using your hands, combine the mixture until it resembles fine crumbs.

Spread half of the batter in the prepared pan.  Spread the persimmon mixture over the batter.  Drop heaping spoonfuls of the remaining batter over the persimmon mixture, about 1-inch apart.  Sprinkle the crumb mixture evenly over the surface.

Put the cake pan on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 30 to 35 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.

In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together the confectioners' sugar, dark Karo, and milk until smooth.  Drizzle the frosting over the top of the coffee cake.  Cut into slices and serve warm.

This recipe yields one 10-inch cake: 12 servings.

       Pumpkin Gnocchi With Brown Butter Sauce And Shaved Parmigian

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  Idaho potatoes - (abt 3 large) -- scrubbed, and
                        boiled in skins until tender
     1/2           cup  pumpkin puree
     1/4           cup  finely-grated Parmesan cheese
  1                     egg
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1              pinch  allspice
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  flour - (to 2 cups)
                        Salted water -- for cooking gnocchi
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh sage leaves
     1/2           cup  shaved Parmesan cheese

Allow the cooked potatoes to cool slightly, then carefully peel while holding potato with a kitchen mitt.  While still hot, puree potatoes through a ricer or food mill into a large mixing bowl and allow to cool completely before proceeding.

Add the pumpkin puree, cheese, egg, cinnamon, allspice, salt and pepper and mix well.  Gradually add in enough flour to form a smooth, slightly sticky dough.  Briefly knead the dough to incorporate the flour, being careful not to overwork.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.

Cut the dough into 6 equal pieces and place 1 piece on a lightly floured work surface.  Roll piece into a long rope, about 1/2-inch in diameter, flouring lightly if needed.  Slice the rope into pieces 1/2-inch wide.  Holding one piece at a time, roll the tines of a fork against the dough until slight indentations are formed.  Repeat with each piece of dough, setting formed gnocchi on a floured kitchen towel or baking sheet.

Immediately add the gnocchi to the boiling water and continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes once they have risen to the top.  Remove the cooked gnocchi with a slotted spoon or skimmer and set aside briefly while making the sauce.

In a skillet over high heat add the butter when pan is very hot.  Let butter sit undisturbed until almost all melted and outside edges have begun to caramelize.  Quickly swirl the skillet and add minced sage.  Let cook for 30 seconds longer, season with salt and pepper to taste and add gnocchi to skillet to toss with sauce and rewarm if necessary.  Serve immediately with shaved Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 4 main course servings or 6 first course servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  almond macaroons
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
  1              pound  fresh ricotta
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground cinnamon
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  flour
  1         tablespoon  water
  2               cups  fine dried bread crumbs
                        Oil -- for frying
                 whole  ipped cream
  1                cup  honey
                        Shaker of confectionersí sugar

Preheat the fryer.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the macaroons and process until finely ground.  Add the sugar, cheese, cinnamon, and 2 of the eggs.  Continue to process until incorporated.

Form the cheese mixture into small balls, about a tablespoon each.   Roll the balls in the flour, coating completely.  In a shallow bowl, beat the remaining 1 egg and the water.  Dip each ball in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off.  Finally, dredge each ball in the bread crumbs, coating completely.

Fry the balls in batches until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.

Place a dollop of the whipped cream in the center of each serving plate.  Lay the fritters around the whipped cream.  Drizzle the fritters with the honey.  Garnish with confectionersí sugar.

This recipe yields about 2 dozen fritters.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh chestnuts -- roasted, peeled
                        (or two 10-oz cans chestnuts, drained)
  1                cup  chopped onions
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2                     bay leaves
  1              large  Idaho potato -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  2             quarts  light chicken stock
  1                     thyme sprig
     1/4      teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh basil
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1               dash  Worcestershire sauce
  1                cup  heavy cream -- warmed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE DUMPLINGS ===
     1/4         pound  ground pork
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped green onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1                     egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  quatre díepices
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  16                    wonton wrappers

In a saucepan combine chestnuts, onions, celery, garlic, bay leaves, potato and chicken stock and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes.  In a blender, puree the soup in batches along with fresh herbs, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce.  Stir in heavy cream and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

For the Dumplings:  In the bowl of a food processor combine pork, garlic, green onions and parsley and process until smooth.  Add the Worcestershire, egg yolk, heavy cream, crushed red pepper, quatre díepices and salt and pepper and pulse until thoroughly combined.

To assemble dumplings, use a spoon to place a tablespoon-sized dollop of filling in the center of a wonton wrapper.  Use your fingers to wet the edges of the wrapper, then fold in half, easing edges so that they meet to form a triangle.  Press firmly to seal dumplings.

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook dumplings in small batches so as not to crowd.  Dumplings are done when they float and wrappers are tender and translucent, 5 to 6 minutes.  Serve dumplings floating in hot chestnut soup.

This recipe yields 16 dumplings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  chicken gizzards
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1              pound  ground pork
  1                cup  chopped onions
     1/2           cup  chopped bell peppers
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
  4               cups  cooked medium-grain white rice
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2     teaspoons  cayenne
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
  6              whole  squabs -- cleaned and trimmed
                        (head, feet, and first wing joint removed)
                        Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     1/2           cup  melted butter
  4             ounces  raw bacon -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots
     1/2         pound  haricots verts -- trimmed and blanched
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  dark duck or veal reduction sauce
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Boil the gizzards in water to cover in a saucepan over medium heat for about 1 hour, or until tender.  Drain, reserving the broth.  Finely chop the gizzards in a food processor.

Combine the oil and flour in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Stir constantly for 8 to 10 minutes, making a dark brown roux.  Add the ground pork to the roux and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the onions, bell peppers, and celery and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the vegetables are wilted.  Add the chopped gizzards.

Pour the reserved broth into a 1 cup measure.  Add enough water to make a full cup.  Add to vegetables.  Mix in the cooked rice, stirring to coat evenly and break up any clumps.  Add the salt, cayenne, green onions, and parsley.  Mix well.  Cook until the rice is warmed through, stirring occasionally.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Season the squab with Essence.  Stuff the rice dressing into the cavity of each squab.  Using butchers twine, tie the legs together tightly, to close the cavity of each squab.

Place the squab on a baking sheet and brush each with the melted butter.  Roast for 25 minutes or until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees.  Remove the squab from the oven and allow to cool for a couple of minutes before serving.

In a sautÈ pan, over medium heat, cook the bacon until crispy.  Add the shallots and haricots verts.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Place a squab in the center of each serving plate.  Spoon some of the reduction sauce over each squab.  Lay some of the haricots verts around each squab.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  peeled rock shrimp tails - (abt 1 lb)
  1         tablespoon  Creole seasoning -- see * Note
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped peeled onion
     1/4           cup  chopped celery
     1/2    tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire Sauce
  1           teaspoon  Crystal hot sauce
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs - (to 1/2 cup) -- plus 1/4 cup
  1                cup  cubed Mozzarella cheese pieces
  1         tablespoon  grated Parmesan cheese
  8                     phyllo dough sheets -- defrosted
  1              stick  butter -- melted
                        === SMOKEY TOMATO-BUTTER SAUCE ===
  1              pound  Roma tomatoes -- cored, halved
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  1                     celery rib -- finely chopped
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
     1/2         pound  cold unsalted butter
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Few drops balsamic vinegar -- or to taste
                        Hot sauce, your choice -- to taste

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Place the shrimp tails in a bowl and season with the Creole seasoning.  In a large heavy skillet heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, celery and garlic and sautÈ until translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add seasoned shrimp to the skillet and cook until pink, about 4 minutes.  Add cream, Worcestershire and Crystal hot sauces to pan and reduce over medium heat for 2 minutes.  Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup bread crumbs to the mixture to tighten, stirring to combine well, and cook for 1 minute.  Remove mixture from the heat and allow to cool.  Gently fold in the cheese and combine thoroughly.

Divide cooled shrimp mixture into 8 equal portions, then fashion each into individual logs about 1-inch in diameter and 4-inches in length (approximately 3 1/2 ounces each).

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Spread phyllo sheets on a clean work surface with long side closest to you, like a book.  With a pastry brush, spread melted butter on right half of top sheet, then sprinkle with 1 teaspoon bread crumbs and fold left side over right side as though closing a book.  Butter top of folded phyllo sheet.

Place one formed shrimp log at bottom of phyllo sheet and carefully fold 1-inch edge of left side over the filling, then 1-inch edge of right side over the filling.  Starting at the bottom, fold the phyllo over the shrimp filling and roll up to form a cylinder, like an eggroll, buttering the bottom 1/2-inch of phyllo with butter to seal.  Butter the top of the phyllo roll and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets and rock shrimp filling.  Place phyllo bundles in refrigerator for 10 minutes prior to cooking.

Bake phyllo strudels in oven until golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.  Serve warm.

For the Smokey Tomato-Butter Sauce:  In a mixing bowl, toss the tomatoes with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Place tomatoes on a smoker rack and smoke with hickory chips for 15 minutes.

In a saucepan over medium-high heat melt butter, add chopped onion and celery and cook until softened, about 4 minutes.  Add smoked tomatoes and any accumulated juices, chicken stock, and tomato paste and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.  Using a hand-held blender, puree until smooth.  Strain through a coarse strainer and continue to cook until thickened, about 5 more minutes.  Whisk in cold butter, season to taste with salt, white pepper, a few drops of balsamic vinegar and your hot sauce of choice.  Serve immediately or keep warm in a bain marie until needed.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1                cup  shortening
  4                     eggs
  3          teaspoons  vanilla
  1 1/2           cups  flour
     1/3           cup  cocoa
     1/3      teaspoon  salt
  1                     bag mini marshmallows - (6 1/2 oz)
                        === FOR THE FROSTING ===
  2             sticks  butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  cocoa
  1                     box powdered sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2           cup  evaporated milk

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  In the bowl of an electric mixer, add sugar and shortening and cream together.  Add eggs and vanilla and beat 30 seconds.  In a separate bowl, sift the flour, cocoa and salt together.  Add to the mixture and beat until well combined.  Pour the mixture into a greased and floured 9- by 13-inch pan.  Place in the oven and bake for 35 minutes.

Remove pan from the oven and let cool for a few minutes.  Spread the marshmallows on top of the cake and return the pan to the oven for 5 more minutes.  Remove the pan from the oven and cool for a few minutes.  Evenly apply the frosting.  Allow this to stand about 2 hours before cutting into squares.

Note:  If the marshmallows are too hot, the frosting will sink right through.  The frosting should be the top layer.  It will darken once it hits the heat of the cake.

To make the frosting:  In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat together the butter, cocoa, powdered sugar and vanilla.  Slowly add the milk.

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Soak the salt cod in a bowl of cold water and refrigerate, for 12 hours, changing the water every 2 hours.  Flake the cod into small pieces.

In a sautÈ pan, over medium heat, add the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the onions and peppers.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ until soft, about 1 minute.  Add the salt cod and continue to sautÈ for 6 to 8 minutes.  Or until the cod is fully cooked.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.

In a mixing bowl, combine the salt cod mixture, lobster meat, potatoes, 1 egg, and green onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mix well.  Form the mixture into 12 equal cakes.

Beat the remaining 2 eggs with the milk.  In separate shallow bowls, combine the flour, egg wash, and bread crumbs.  Season with Creole seasoning.  Dredge each cake in the flour, coating completely.  Dip each cake in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off.  Finally dredge each cake in the bread crumbs, coating completely.

In 2 large sautÈ pans, over medium heat, add 1/4 cup of the oil to each pan.  When the oil is hot, pan-fry the cakes until golden brown, and heated through, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.  Remove the cakes and set aside.

For the Relish:  In a mixing bowl, combine the corn, tomatoes, and onions.  Season with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Set aside.

For the Tartare Sauce:  In another mixing bowl, combine all of the ingredients together.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mix well.

Make a small pool of the Tartare Sauce in the center of each serving plate.  Lay 2 cakes over the sauce.  Spoon the relish over the top of the cakes.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 6 main course or 12 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     frozen puff pastry sheet
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  1              pound  frozen rock shrimp - (70 to 90 count)
  1         tablespoon  Emerilís Creole Seasoning -- see * Note
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     2/3           cup  chopped green onions
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  Crystal Hot Sauce
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper.  Thaw the pastry at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before gently unfolding.

With a sharp knife, divide the pastry in half.  Cut each pastry half into 4 equal triangles.  With the tip of a sharp knife, make a 1/4-inch score on all edges of the triangles, being careful not to cut all the way through.  Put them on the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops lightly with the beaten egg.  Bake until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.  Set aside to cool while preparing the shrimp.

Season rock shrimp with Creole seasoning.  In a large skillet over high heat, sautÈ rock shrimp in olive oil for 2 to 3 minutes, until most of the liquid released by the shrimp has evaporated.  Add green onions, Worcestershire and hot pepper sauce and cook for 1 minute.  Add the cream, bring to a boil and reduce heat to a simmer.  Cook until reduced by half and sauce covers the back of a spoon, about 4 to 6 minutes.  Add butter and whisk thoroughly to combine, about 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper.

With the tip of a knife, carefully remove the top of each pastry.  Divide shrimp and sauce between pastries, cover with reserved tops and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves

Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley and butter.  Set aside, keeping warm.

Season both sides of the salmon with Creole seasoning.  In a large sautÈ pan, over medium heat, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the salmon and sear for 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare.

Spoon some of the mushroom/bean mixture in the center of each plate.  Lay the salmon fillets on top of the beans.  Drizzle some of the wine syrup over each salmon fillet.  Garnish with green onions.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  vegetable oil
  1              pound  ditalini or small elbow macaroni
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  bleached all-purpose flour
  2 1/2           cups  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4         pound  smoked Gouda cheese -- grated
                        Parsley -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Put the water, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and the oil in a large, heavy saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil.  Add the macaroni and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 8 minutes.

In a small, heavy saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat.  Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.  Slowly add the milk, whisking constantly.  Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the white pepper and continue whisking until the sauce is smooth and thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, about 8 minutes.  Remove the white sauce from the heat and stir in the cheese.  Continue stirring until the cheese melts.

Lightly grease a 6 1/2- by 10-inch casserole dish with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon butter.  Combine the cheese sauce and macaroni in a large mixing bowl and mix well.  Pour into the prepared casserole and bake until lightly golden on top, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve hot.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     small box vanilla wafers
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped pecans
  1              stick  butter -- melted
  1 1/2           cups  egg nog
  2               cups  mashed sweet potatoes
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar
  3                     egg yolks
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  ginger
  1           envelope  unflavored gelatin
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  3                     egg whites
  2               cups  sweetened whipped cream
                        Confectionersí sugar
  8                     fresh mint sprigs

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a food processor, combine the vanilla wafers, 1/4 cup sugar, and pecan pieces.  Mix until the crust is smooth and resembles a coarse texture.  With the machine running, add the butter and process until all of the butter is incorporated.  Remove the crust from the processor and press into a deep-dish 10-inch pie pan.  Place the pan in the oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the crust is set.

In a saucepan, combine the eggnog, sweet potatoes, brown sugar, egg yolks, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and ginger together.  Mix well.  Place the pan over medium heat and cook the mixture for 10 minutes, stirring constantly.

Remove the pan from the heat and sprinkle the gelatin over the filling.  Whisk the gelatin into the filling until the gelatin dissolves.  Stir in the vanilla.  Cover the filling and refrigerate until cool.

Using an electric mixer, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar and continue to beat until the peaks are stiff.  Fold the egg whites into the sweet potato filling.  Spread the filling evenly over the crust and refrigerate the pie for about 1 hour.

Spread the whipped cream, evenly over the top of the pie.

Slice the pie into 8 pieces.  Place a piece of the pie on each serving plate.  Garnish with confectionersí sugar and a sprig of fresh mint.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

              Sweet Potato Chocolate Bars With Spiced Cream

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 24    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  medium-size sweet potatoes
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1              pinch  salt
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  3              large  eggs
  3               cups  milk
  2 1/2           cups  graham cracker crumbs
  2               cups  pecan pieces
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- melted
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate morsels
                        Powdered sugar

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Rub the sweet potatoes with the vegetable oil and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Bake until fork-tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Remove from the oven and let cool, then peel and mash in a large bowl.  Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, vanilla, eggs, and 2 1/2 cups of the milk and mix well.  Set aside.

Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Combine the graham cracker crumbs and pecan pieces in a food processor and process for about 1 minute, to make a fine meal.  With the motor running, gradually pour the melted butter through the feed tube and process for 1 minute.

Transfer the crumb mixture to a 13- by 18-inch baking pan and, using your fingers, firmly press the crumbs evenly onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan.  Pour the sweet potato mixture into the crust and spread evenly with a rubber spatula.

Put the chocolate morsels and the remaining 1/2 cup milk in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat and stir constantly until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth.  Spoon the melted chocolate in three rows, about 2 inches apart, lengthwise over the sweet potato mixture.  Then, with a knife, make a zigzag pattern to marbleize the chocolate and the sweet potato mixture.

Bake until the edges are browned and the filling is set, 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool completely.  Slice into individual servings and garnish with powdered sugar.

This recipe yields 2 dozen bars.

                        === GARNISH ===
  1             medium  cucumber -- peeled, sliced thin
                        Toast points

Brine:  In a medium bowl, combine the water, sake, sugar, salt, ginger, and peppercorns.  Stir until the salt and sugar have dissolved; the liquid should taste like sweet seawater.  Place the fish in a salmon poacher.  Pour the liquid over the salmon, cover, and allow to brine, refrigerated, about 1 hour.

Remoulade:  In a food processor, combine the mustard, wasabi paste, garlic, and vinegar.  While the processor is running, slowly drizzle in the canola oil until an emulsion is formed.  Remove the mayonnaise-like mixture from the processor and place in a non-reactive stainless steel bowl.  Fold in the cucumbers, scallions, and cilantro, season with salt and pepper and refrigerate until ready to use.

Smoking Mix:  Remove the salmon from the poacher and thoroughly clean the poacher.  Place 2 over-turned ramekins on either side of the inside of the poacher.  Line the interior of the poacher, up to the rim, with foil.  Make sure that the foil is placed over the ramekins.  Repeat with another piece of foil.  Add the sugar, rice and jasmine tea to the foil lined poacher.  Cover and heat over medium heat until the rice mixture begins to smoke.  Place the salmon on top of poaching rack, lower into the poacher, turn the heat to low, and smoke the salmon, covered, for 10 minutes.  Turn off the heat and smoke the salmon for and additional 10 minutes.  The salmon will be cooked medium-rare to medium.  Keep the salmon warm in the poacher.

Plating:  Line a large Chinese-style platter with the thinly sliced cucumbers.  Place the side of smoked salmon on top of the cucumbers.  Arrange the toast points around the salmon.  Present the remoulade in a small bowl accompanying the platter.  If desired, drizzle a small amount of the remoulade on the salmon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  water
     2/3           cup  white wine
  1                     bouquet garni
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1              pound  fresh salmon - (scant) -- skinned, boned
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped shallots
     3/4         pound  chopped mushrooms
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1            package  frozen puff pastry -- thawed
  1 1/2           cups  cooked rice
  3                     hard-boiled eggs -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
     1/2           cup  melted unsalted butter
  1                     egg yolk -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  water

In a saucepan, combine water, white wine, bouquet garni, salt and cayenne pepper to a boil.  Add salmon and poach until cooked through, about 12 minutes.  Remove saucepan from heat and set aside until salmon is completely cooled in the cooking liquid.

In a skillet or sautÈ pan over medium-high heat, melt butter and add shallots and mushrooms.  Season with salt and pepper and sautÈ until mushrooms are softened and shallots are translucent, about 4 minutes.  Set aside to cool.

On a lightly floured flat surface, roll out 2 puff pastry sheets to rectangles 1/4-inch thick.  Refrigerate, covered, until ready to assemble koulibiaca.

When all elements are cool, assemble koulibiaca:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Place one of the rectangles of puff pastry on a flat surface.  Leaving a narrow border all the way around, layer rice, then flaked salmon, then mushrooms, then eggs, then parsley making sure every layer is well-seasoned.  Drizzle with a few tablespoons of the melted butter, then place second sheet of puff pastry on top of layered ingredients.

Roll bottom edges up over top edge and pinch together decoratively.  Brush top of koulibiaca with egg wash and bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.  Serve hot with remaining melted butter.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  raw bacon -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard - (to 1/4 cup)
     1/4           cup  sherry vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey - (to 2 tbspns)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  roasted turkey meat -- diced
  4             ounces  Maytag blue cheese or other domestic chees -- crumbled
  4              large  hard-boiled eggs -- thinly sliced
  4                     Roma tomatoes -- cored, seeded,
                        and diced
  1             medium  avocado -- peeled, diced
  1               head  iceberg lettuce -- cleaned, cored,
                        and chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
  1                cup  flour
  1              large  red onion -- cut thin rings
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves

Preheat the fryer.

In a sautÈ pan, over medium heat, cook the bacon until crispy, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove the bacon and drain on paper towels.  Whisk the mustard, vinegar, and honey, all to taste, into the bacon fat.  Season with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the turkey, cheese, eggs, crispy bacon, tomatoes, avocados, lettuce, and green onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mix well.

Season the flour with salt and pepper.  Dredge the red onion rings in the seasoned flour, coating completely and shaking off the excess.  Fry the onion rings until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt.

Toss the lettuce with the dressing.  Season with salt and pepper.  To serve, mound a quarter of the salad in the center of each serving plate.  Pile the onions on top of each salad.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE TURKEY ===
  1 1/2        gallons  very cold water
     3/4           cup  kosher salt
     3/4           cup  brown sugar
  1                     turkey - (abt 10 lbs)
     1/2           cup  corn syrup
     1/2           cup  Steenís Cane syrup
     1/2           cup  melted butter
  1         tablespoon  Creole seasoning -- see * Note
  1                cup  chopped trinity - (equal amounts of onion,
                        celery, green bell pepper to yield 1 cup)
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
                        Reserved turkey neck and giblets
     1/4           cup  flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  flour
  4               cups  chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  hot sauce
                        === FOR THE OYSTER DRESSING ===
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
     1/2           cup  chopped green bell pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  3               cups  cubed day-old bread
  1 1/2           cups  shucked oysters in their liquor
  1                cup  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  Creole seasoning -- see * Note
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a large bowl or ice chest large enough to hold turkey and liquid, combine water, salt and sugar and stir until salt and sugar are dissolved.  Place turkey inside of brining liquid (liquid should cover turkey completely) and marinate turkey overnight (refrigerated).

Preheat oven to 475 degrees.  When ready to cook the turkey, in a small bowl whisk together corn syrup, cane syrup, butter and Creole seasoning.  Remove turkey from brining liquid and pat dry with paper towels.  Place turkey on a rack, breast-side down, and baste with syrup-butter mixture.

Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce temperature to 300 degrees and continue baking for another 45 minutes, breast-side down, basting every 30 minutes.  Turn turkey over and continue cooking, about 1 1/2 hours, or until the internal temperature in the deepest part of the thigh reads 155 degrees.  Let turkey rest while you make the gravy.

In a saucepan, place 1 1/2 cups of pan drippings and add trinity and garlic.  Add turkey neck and giblets and simmer over medium high heat for 10 minutes.  Whisk in flour and combine well, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add chicken stock and stir well to combine.  Cook 5 minutes, or until thickened, and season with salt, Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce.  Let simmer 10 minutes to allow flavors to meld.  Strain and serve immediately with roast turkey.

For the Oyster Dressing:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously oil a baking dish.

In a large skillet, heat oil until it begins to smoke.  Add onion, bell pepper, and celery and sautÈ, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes or until softened.  Add garlic and cook 2 minutes longer.

Lower heat and fold in bread, oysters and their liquor, and broth.  Stir until moistened and add green onions, parsley, Creole seasoning, and hot pepper sauce.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Pour dressing into baking dish, cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes.  Remove foil and bake 20 minutes, until golden brown on top.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     vanilla beans -- split, scraped
  1           teaspoon  orange zest
  1           teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
  1                cup  brown sugar
  1                cup  cider vinegar
  2                     bay leaves
  2               cups  bourbon
  1                     pork loin - (abt 6 lbs) -- trimmed, cleaned
                        === FOR THE PECAN GARVY ===
  1                cup  chopped pecans
     1/4           cup  butter
  1                cup  chopped trinity - (equal amounts onion,
                        celery, green pepper, finely diced
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped garlic
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1                cup  pork marinating liquid -  from the above
  1              quart  chicken stock
                        === FOR THE SWEET POTATOES ===
  8              large  sweet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  1                cup  sour cream
     1/4           cup  bourbon
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  Steenís cane syrup
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

In a small saucepan, combine vanilla beans, orange zest, black pepper, brown sugar, cider vinegar and bay leaves and cook over medium heat until sugar is melted and flavors have begun to meld, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and add bourbon.  Cool marinade completely before pouring over pork loin in a glass casserole or bowl.  Refrigerate for 48 hours, turning every 12 hours.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Remove pork from marinade and pat dry.  Transfer marinade to a saucepan and reduce volume by 1/3.  Reserve to use in the pecan gravy.  Place pork on a rack on a baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes, or until a thermometer reads 155 degrees.  Let rest 5 minutes before slicing.  Serve with Pecan Gravy and Sour Cream Mashed Sweet Potatoes.

For the Pecan Gravy:  In a saucepan cook pecans in butter until you get a pleasant pecan aroma.  Add trinity and cook for 2 minutes.  Add garlic, cayenne pepper and cook for 2 minutes.  Add flour, cook for 2 minutes, then add marinating liquid and chicken stock.  Continue to cook until sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

For the Sweet Potatoes:  In a large saucepan, boil sweet potatoes until fork tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Pour off all of the water and put potatoes through a food mill or ricer.  Using a large plastic spatula, fold in sour cream, bourbon, brown sugar, and cane syrup.  Taste and add salt and white pepper to taste.  Serve immediately or put in a casserole dish and reheat when ready to serve.

In a small saucepan, combine vanilla beans, orange zest, black pepper, brown sugar, cider vinegar and bay leaves and cook over medium heat until sugar is melted and flavors have begun to meld, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and add bourbon.  Cool marinade completely before pouring over pork loin in a glass casserole or bowl.  Refrigerate for 48 hours, turning every 12 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Remove pork from marinade and pat dry.  Transfer marinade to a saucepan and reduce volume by 1/3.  Reserve to use in the pecan gravy.  Place pork on a rack on a baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes, or until a thermometer reads 155 degrees.  Let rest 5 minutes before slicing.  Serve with Pecan Gravy and Sour Cream Mashed Sweet Potatoes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Pecan Gravy:  In a saucepan cook pecans in butter until you get a pleasant pecan aroma.  Add trinity and cook for 2 minutes.  Add garlic, cayenne pepper and cook for 2 minutes.  Add flour, cook for 2 minutes, then add marinating liquid and chicken stock.  Continue to cook until sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Sweet Potatoes:  In a large saucepan, boil sweet potatoes until fork tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Pour off all of the water and put potatoes through a food mill or ricer.  Using a large plastic spatula, fold in sour cream, bourbon, brown sugar, and cane syrup.  Taste and add salt and white pepper to taste.  Serve immediately or put in a casserole dish and reheat when ready to serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VEAL ROULADE AND STUFFING ===
  1              pound  fresh spinach -- washed, stemmed
  2        tablespoons  butter
  8             ounces  chanterelle or morel mushrooms -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
     1/4           cup  white wine or Vermouth
  1              pound  lump crabmeat -- carefully picked ove
                        and cartilage removed
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                     boned veal loin - (3 to 4 lbs) -- trimmed, butterflied
                        and pounded to 1/2" thickness
                        === PERIGOURDINE SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                     fresh truffle - (abt 1 1/2" dia) -- washed, peeled,
                        very thinly sliced
  6             ounces  duck or goose foie gras -- cut small cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  madeira or porto wine
  2               cups  demi-glace

For the Veal Roulade with Crabmeat, Mushroom and Spinach Stuffing:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bring a small pot of water to the boil over high heat and blanch the spinach leaves until wilted, yet still bright green, about 15 seconds.  Refresh in ice water and drain.

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter.  Add the mushrooms and shallots to the pan and sautÈ until the vegetables are soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the wine to the pan and cook until mostly evaporated, then add the crabmeat, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.  Remove from the heat.

Grease a large roasting pan.  Lay the veal loin flat on a work surface and season with salt and white pepper.  Squeeze the excess water from the spinach and lay it across the loin, leaving a 1/2-inch border.  Spread the crabmeat and mushroom mixture down the center of the loin, then roll up jelly-roll fashion into a log and tie loosely at 1-inch intervals with kitchen twine.  Sprinkle the outside of the roulade with salt and white pepper and place, seam-side down, in the roasting pan.  Roast until the meat is brown and the meat (not the filling) reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Transfer the roulade to a cutting board, loosely cover and allow to rest for 15 minutes before cutting.  Cut the roulade into 3/4-inch slices, and top with the Perigourdine Sauce.

For the Perigourdine sauce:  To make the sauce, in a medium sautÈ pan heat the butter over medium heat.  Add the truffle slices to the pan and gently cook for 1 minute.  Add the foie gras and cook about 45 seconds.  Season with salt and white pepper, and add the Madeira to the pan, and stir well to deglaze, and cook for 1 minute to slightly reduce.  Add the demi-glace, stirring well to incorporate, and continue cooking over a low flame to just heat through.  Serve immediately with the Veal Roulade.  (Makes about 2 cups)

  1                cup  dry red wine
  1              large  onion -- diced
  1              large  carrot -- peeled, diced
  2                     celery ribs -- diced
  1              large  parsnip -- peeled, diced
  1                     leek, white only -- diced
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1              pound  mixed wild mushrooms such as wood ear,
                        chanterelle, morel, or shiitake -- sliced
  1             bottle  amber beer - (12 oz)
  2 1/2         quarts  veal or beef stock
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  6                     fresh thyme sprigs
  1           teaspoon  allspice
  3                     bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2                     baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, cubed

In a large stockpot cook the bacon over high heat until crispy.  Remove the bacon from the pan and drain on paper towels.  Season the venison with salt and pepper, and then lightly dust with flour.  Add the oil to the pot and sear the venison on all sides over medium-high heat.  Remove the meat from the pot and add any remaining flour, stirring constantly.  Deglaze the pot with the red wine, scraping with a wooden spoon.

Add the beer and scrape to remove any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, then add the veal stock, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, allspice, bay leaves and tomato paste.  Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.  Cook until the meat is tender and the stock is reduced, about 1 1/2 hours.

Add the potatoes to the pot and continue cooking until they are cooked through, about 20 to 30 minutes.  Season to taste and serve with egg noodles tossed with butter.

  1                cup  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  flour
  1              quart  veal or chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  cold butter
  2             pounds  fresh pasta ribbons
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a large sautÈ pan set over medium-high heat, render the bacon until crispy, about 4 minutes.  Remove the bacon from the pan and drain on paper towels.  Add the onions to the pan and cook until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook until aromatic, about 2 minutes.  In the bowl of a food processor, process the onions and garlic into a smooth paste, then set aside to cool.

In a large mixing bowl combine the venison and veal.  With an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, blend the meats together on low speed.  (Alternately, blend together the ingredients with a large wooden spoon.)  Slowly add the bacon and onion mixture, and once incorporated, gradually add the buttermilk, breadcrumbs and cheese in stages.  Add the salt, pepper, Essence, rosemary and sage, and blend thoroughly.

Form the meat into 20 even-sized balls.  Heat a large sautÈ pan over medium-high heat and heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil.  Add the meatballs to the pot in batches and sear on all sides.  Remove the meatballs and add the red wine to deglaze the pan, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Pour the pan juices into a cup and reserve.

Add the remaining vegetable oil and flour to the pan and cook over medium heat to make a light brown roux, stirring constantly, about 5 to 10 minutes.  Add the veal stock to the pan and stir until the roux is completely dissolved.  Bring the stock to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer.  Let the sauce reduce for 15 minutes, then stir in the Dijon mustard and cream.  Return the meatballs and reserved pan juices to the pot and cook for 20 minutes.

Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil.  Add the pasta ribbons to the boiling water and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain the pasta, toss lightly with olive oil and keep warm.

Swirl the cold butter into the sauce and adjust the seasoning to taste.  Serve the noodles topped by meatballs and sauce, garnishing each serving with chopped green onions and grated Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIE CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  butter flavored shortening -- chilled
     1/3           cup  ice water
                        === PEACH COBBLER ===
  3             pounds  medium peaches -- peeled, pitted,
                        and cut into 1/4" slices
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1                cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon, plus more for top crust
  4        tablespoons  butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces

For the Pie crust:  Sift the flour and salt into a bowl.  Add the shortening and cut it in with a fork or pastry cutter until it resembles coarse crumbs with a few pea-sized bits.  Stirring with a fork, gradually add enough of the water until the mixture clumps together.  Gather up the dough and press into a flat disc, wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate for 1 hour.

For the Peach Cobbler:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Roll out the dough to a large square that is 1/8-inch thick.  Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 6 circles.  Using a 2-inch cookie cutter, cut out 6 circles and keep cold.

Butter 6 (4-ounce) ramekins.  Place the smaller rounds of dough into the ramekins and press down into the bottom and sides.  Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and place in the oven.  Bake for 10 minutes or until light golden brown.  Remove from the oven and cool completely.

In a medium bowl, toss the peaches, cornstarch, sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon.  Fold in the butter.  Divide the peach mixture between the 6 ramekins.  Cover the peach mixture with the larger rounds of dough, letting the dough come down the sides of the ramekins.  Pinch the dough firmly onto the top edge of the dish.  Cut a few slits in the top of the dough.

Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and place back in the oven and bake until golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove the cobbler from the oven and sprinkle with cinnamon.

This recipe yields 6 servings.
