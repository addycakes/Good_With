  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  cubed 1/2" cooked ham
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (15 oz) -- drained
  1                can  pork and beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  1                can  black beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  1                can  butter beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  1                can  pinto beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1              large  red bell pepper -- chopped
  1              large  green bell pepper -- chopped
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  cola-flavored soda
     1/2           cup  lemon-lime soda
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  dried savory
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper

Place all ingredients in heavy large pot.  Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer uncovered until juices are thick, stirring gently and frequently to prevent burning, about 20 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Comments:  Why "soda jerk"?  Because two kinds of pop lend the right dose of sweetness.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray
     1/2           cup  whole almonds - (abt 2 1/2 oz)
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  4          teaspoons  sugar
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  1 1/4         pounds  plums - (abt 8 medium) -- halved, pitted,
                        and cut into 1/2"-thk slices
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Spray 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides with nonstick spray.  Line bottom of pan with parchment paper round.

Finely grind almonds in processor.  Transfer to medium bowl; whisk in flour, baking powder, and salt.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Add 1 cup sugar; beat until well blended.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in vanilla and almond extract, then flour mixture just until incorporated.

Transfer batter to prepared pan; spread evenly and smooth top with spatula.  Gently press plum slices, flesh-side down, into batter in spoke pattern around outer rim and center of cake, placing close together.  Mix cinnamon and 4 teaspoons sugar in small bowl.  Sprinkle over plums.

Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.  Cool cake in pan on rack 20 minutes.  Run small knife between cake and pan sides to loosen.  Invert cake onto platter; remove parchment paper.  Place another platter atop cake.  Using both hands, hold both platters firmly together and invert cake, plum-side up.  Cool cake completely.  Cut into wedges.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Buckles are aptly named: Fruit is baked along with a layer of cake batter that rises to the top, buckling as it cooks.

Don't skimp on the garnish: Vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream is great with this.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STOCK AND SCHMALTZ MANI… ===
  3 1/4         pounds  chicken wings or turkey wings - (to 3 1/2)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  11              cups  water -- divided
  1              large  onion -- coarsely chopped
  1              large  celery stalk -- coarsely chopped
  1              large  carrot -- coarsely chopped
  2                     fresh parsley sprigs
  2                     fresh thyme sprigs
  1              small  bay leaf
  5        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        === GRAVY ===
                        Roasting pan with pan juices reserved
                        from turkey
  2               cups  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh sage

For Stock And Schmaltz ManiÈ:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Toss wings and oil in large bowl to coat; transfer to large roasting pan.  Roast 45 minutes.  Turn wings over; roast until deep golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Add 1 cup water to pan and continue roasting wings 10 minutes longer.

Transfer wings with liquid to large pot, scraping in any browned bits from roasting pan.  Add remaining 10 cups water, onion, celery, carrot, and herbs to pot.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered until reduced to 5 cups stock, about 3 1/2 hours.  Strain through sieve set over large glass bowl.  Press on solids in sieve to release as much stock as possible.  Cool 30 minutes, then refrigerate overnight.  (Stock can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and keep refrigerated.)

Transfer fat "cap" from surface of chilled stock to small bowl.  Dry fat with paper towels.  Using hands, break fat into pieces.  Measure 5 tablespoons fat and transfer to another bowl; add flour and stir to form smooth paste.  Refrigerate schmaltz maniÈ until cold.  Roll into 1/2-inch balls.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover schmaltz maniÈ and stock separately and refrigerate.)

For Gravy:  Pour pan juices from turkey roasting pan into fat separator or large measuring cup; spoon off fat if using measuring cup.  Place roasting pan over 2 burners.  Add wine and boil 1 minute, scraping up browned bits.  Pour wine with bits into heavy large saucepan.  Pour in pan juices from fat separator, leaving fat behind, or add degreased pan juices from measuring cup.  Add herbs and stock to same saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Whisk in schmaltz maniÈ balls 1 at a time (or paste by teaspoonfuls), cooking gravy briefly after each few additions to judge consistency and boiling gravy until reduced to 4 cups and thick enough to coat spoon, whisking often, about 6 minutes.  Season gravy to taste with salt and pepper.

Serve gravy with turkey.

This recipe yields 4 cups.

Comments:  If you aren't making the schmaltz maniÈ ahead of time, there's no need to form the paste into balls.  Simply add the paste by teaspoonfuls to the simmering stock until the gravy has reached the desired consistency.

For Stock And Schmaltz ManiÈ:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Toss wings and oil in large bowl to coat; transfer to large roasting pan.  Roast 45 minutes.  Turn wings over; roast until deep golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Add 1 cup water to pan and continue roasting wings 10 minutes longer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer wings with liquid to large pot, scraping in any browned bits from roasting pan.  Add remaining 10 cups water, onion, celery, carrot, and herbs to pot.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered until reduced to 5 cups stock, about 3 1/2 hours.  Strain through sieve set over large glass bowl.  Press on solids in sieve to release as much stock as possible.  Cool 30 minutes, then refrigerate overnight.  (Stock can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and keep refrigerated.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer fat &quot;cap&quot; from surface of chilled stock to small bowl.  Dry fat with paper towels.  Using hands, break fat into pieces.  Measure 5 tablespoons fat and transfer to another bowl; add flour and stir to form smooth paste.  Refrigerate schmaltz maniÈ until cold.  Roll into 1/2-inch balls.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover schmaltz maniÈ and stock separately and refrigerate.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Gravy:  Pour pan juices from turkey roasting pan into fat separator or large measuring cup; spoon off fat if using measuring cup.  Place roasting pan over 2 burners.  Add wine and boil 1 minute, scraping up browned bits.  Pour wine with bits into heavy large saucepan.  Pour in pan juices from fat separator, leaving fat behind, or add degreased pan juices from measuring cup.  Add herbs and stock to same saucepan.  Bring to boil.  Whisk in schmaltz maniÈ balls 1 at a time (or paste by teaspoonfuls), cooking gravy briefly after each few additions to judge consistency and boiling gravy until reduced to 4 cups and thick enough to coat spoon, whisking often, about 6 minutes.  Season gravy to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve gravy with turkey.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 cups.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  If you aren&apos;t making the schmaltz maniÈ ahead of time, there&apos;s no need to form the paste into balls.  Simply add the paste by teaspoonfuls to the simmering stock until the gravy has reached the desired consistency.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- diced
  3        tablespoons  ice water - (or more)
                        === CRUMB TOPPING ===
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  yellow cornmeal
  1 1/4      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- diced
     2/3           cup  blanched slivered almonds
                        === FILLING ===
  7        tablespoons  sugar -- divided
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  4              large  Pippin or Sierra Beauty apples -- peeled, halved,
                        and sliced 1/4" thick - -- (2 to 2 1/4 lbs tota
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, divided

For Crust:  Mix flour, sugar, and salt in medium bowl.  Add butter.  Cut in with back of fork until butter is reduced to oatmeal-size flakes.  Add 3 tablespoons ice water.  Toss until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

For Topping:  Mix flour, brown sugar, cornmeal, cinnamon, and salt in bowl.  Add butter.  Blend with back of fork until moist clumps form.  Mix in almonds.

For Filling:  Set rack at lowest position in oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Place 6 tablespoons sugar in large bowl.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; stir to blend well.  Mix in apples.  Add 2 tablespoons melted butter and toss to coat.

Roll out dough on floured sheet of parchment paper to 13 1/2-inch round.  Arrange apple filling in center, mounding slightly and leaving 2-inch plain border.  Gently fold dough border over edge of filling, pleating loosely and pinching any cracks to seal.  Brush dough border with remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter and sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.  Sprinkle topping over exposed apple filling.

Slide rimless baking sheet under parchment and crostata and place in oven.  Bake until crust is crisp and apples are tender, turning baking sheet after 20 minutes, about 40 minutes total.

Run knife under crostata to loosen from paper.  Cool crostata completely on paper on baking sheet.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A scoop of ice cream, a spoonful of whipped cream, or a dollop of crËme fraÓche would be great with this.

For Crust:  Mix flour, sugar, and salt in medium bowl.  Add butter.  Cut in with back of fork until butter is reduced to oatmeal-size flakes.  Add 3 tablespoons ice water.  Toss until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Topping:  Mix flour, brown sugar, cornmeal, cinnamon, and salt in bowl.  Add butter.  Blend with back of fork until moist clumps form.  Mix in almonds.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Filling:  Set rack at lowest position in oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Place 6 tablespoons sugar in large bowl.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; stir to blend well.  Mix in apples.  Add 2 tablespoons melted butter and toss to coat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out dough on floured sheet of parchment paper to 13 1/2-inch round.  Arrange apple filling in center, mounding slightly and leaving 2-inch plain border.  Gently fold dough border over edge of filling, pleating loosely and pinching any cracks to seal.  Brush dough border with remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter and sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.  Sprinkle topping over exposed apple filling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Slide rimless baking sheet under parchment and crostata and place in oven.  Bake until crust is crisp and apples are tender, turning baking sheet after 20 minutes, about 40 minutes total.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Run knife under crostata to loosen from paper.  Cool crostata completely on paper on baking sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  A scoop of ice cream, a spoonful of whipped cream, or a dollop of crËme fraÓche would be great with this.

                    Baked Garden Tomatoes With Cheese

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1 3/4         pounds  fresh vine-ripened or heirloom tomatoes -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - (packed)
  1                cup  freshly-grated Romano cheese - (packed)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Oil 11- by 7-inch baking dish.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add garlic and sautÈ until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add onion and sautÈ until soft, about 6 minutes.  Add tomatoes, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes.

Mix in chives; season with salt and pepper.  Transfer tomato mixture to prepared baking dish; sprinkle grated cheeses over.  Bake until cheese melts and begins to turn golden, about 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Susan writes:  "I love to create new recipes to share with my husband, nine-year-old son, and friends.  For me, that's the fun and adventure of cooking.  I believe that eating well means using fresh, high-quality ingredients, so I'm choosy about what I buy and I grow many of my own herbs."

Here's just what to do with all those tomatoes you have now.  This versatile dish is great as a side, on toasted baguette slices, as a zesty omelet filling, or atop grilled fish.

Two more ways to go:  Add chopped fresh basil leaves and/or small cubes of mozzarella cheese.  Or use yellow and green tomatoes with the red ones to add summer color.

Comments:  Susan writes:  &quot;I love to create new recipes to share with my husband, nine-year-old son, and friends.  For me, that&apos;s the fun and adventure of cooking.  I believe that eating well means using fresh, high-quality ingredients, so I&apos;m choosy about what I buy and I grow many of my own herbs.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
Here&apos;s just what to do with all those tomatoes you have now.  This versatile dish is great as a side, on toasted baguette slices, as a zesty omelet filling, or atop grilled fish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Two more ways to go:  Add chopped fresh basil leaves and/or small cubes of mozzarella cheese.  Or use yellow and green tomatoes with the red ones to add summer color.

Prepare barbecue (high heat).  Pat beef dry with paper towels; brush with oil.  Sprinkle all over with spice rub, using all of mixture (coating will be thick).  Place beef on grill; sear 2 minutes on each side.  Reduce heat to medium-high.  Grill uncovered until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of beef registers 130 degrees for medium-rare, moving beef to cooler part of grill as needed to prevent burning, and turning occasionally, about 40 minutes.  Transfer to platter; cover loosely with foil and let rest 15 minutes.  Thinly slice beef crosswise.  Serve with chimichurri sauce.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Gerald Colapinto writes: "My grandparents were born in Italy and were wonderful cooks, so I'm partial to Italian food.  I especially love the cooking of Southern Italy.  Fortunately, I often travel to Rome on business.  Back home, I like to re-create the dishes I discovered."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Cut in half horizontally:
  6                     soft rolls (such as kaiser)
                        Divide evenly among roll halves:
  6             ounces  creamy blue cheese
                        Combine in large bowl:
  2               cups  chopped cooked chicken
     2/3           cup  chopped celery
     1/3           cup  light mayonnaise
     1/3           cup  thinly sliced green onion
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Spoon chicken mixture atop roll bottoms.  Cover with top halves of rolls.  Wrap sandwiches tightly in foil and chill before packing.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Using roast chicken from the grocery store makes this recipe super-easy.

Improv:  Add sweet and crunchy accents by mixing a few chopped toasted pecans and some dried cranberries into the chicken salad.  Instead of rolls, use crusty French bread or thick slices of sourdough bread.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BRINE ===
  4             quarts  apple cider -- divided
  1 1/2           cups  kosher salt
     1/4           cup  whole allspice
  8                     bay leaves
  4             quarts  cold water

                        = (neck and gizzard reserved)
                        === SAGE BROTH ===
  2               cups  low-salt chicken broth
     1/2                onion -- quartered
  1                     celery stalk -- cut 4 pieces
  8                     fresh sage leaves
                        === GLAZE ===
  2               cups  apple cider
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
                        === STUFFING ===
  8               cups  Apple, Sausage, And Parsnip Stuffing With
                        Fresh Sage -- (see recipe)
                        === GRAVY ===
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  fresh sage leaves
     1/4           cup  applejack brandy or Calvados
     1/4           cup  whipping cream

For Brine:  Simmer 1 quart apple cider, salt, allspice, and bay leaves in 20-quart pot 5 minutes, stirring often.  Cool completely.  Add remaining 3 quarts cider and 4 quarts water.  Place turkey in brine.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Drain turkey and rinse.  Arrange on several layers of paper towels in roasting pan.  Refrigerate uncovered overnight.

For Broth:  Simmer all ingredients in large saucepan 30 minutes.  Strain sage broth into bowl.

For Glaze:  Boil cider in saucepan until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 15 minutes.  Whisk in butter.  Cool completely.

Set rack at lowest position in oven; preheat to 350 degrees.  Remove paper towels from roasting pan.  Pat main and neck cavities of turkey dry; stuff loosely with stuffing.  Place turkey in pan, tuck wings under, and tie legs together loosely.

Roast turkey 1 hour.  Brush with some of glaze.  Roast until beginning to brown, about 1 hour.  Cover with foil.  Roast until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, brushing with glaze every 30 minutes and adding up to 1 cup water to pan if drippings begin to burn, about 3 hours longer.  Transfer turkey to platter; tent with foil.  Let stand 30 minutes.

For Gravy:  Pour pan juices into large measuring cup.  Spoon off fat.  Reserve 3 tablespoons fat and degreased juices.  Pour sage broth into roasting pan.  Bring to boil, scraping up browned bits.  Combine flour, sage leaves, and reserved 3 tablespoons fat in heavy large saucepan; stir over medium heat 1 minute.  Whisk in broth from roasting pan and reserved pan juices.  Add applejack and cream and boil until gravy thickens slightly, whisking often, about 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Strain into sauceboat.  Serve turkey with gravy.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Unlike most brined turkeys, this one can be stuffed because the apple-cider brine contains less salt than the typical recipe.  Begin brining two days ahead.

  4          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  3              large  garlic cloves -- chopped

  2               cups  drained rinsed black beans
                        = (from two 15-oz cans)
  2               cups  diced tomatoes in juice
                        = (from two 14 1/2-oz cans)
     1/2           cup  water
                        === CORNBREAD ===
  4               cups  Masa Harina (corn tortilla mix)
     2/3           cup  yellow cornmeal
  2 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  4 1/4           cups  water -- or more if needed
  10       tablespoons  butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- melted, divided
  2              large  eggs
  1              large  egg yolk
  2               cups  coarsely-grated extra-sharp
                        white cheddar cheese - (packed) -- abt 8 oz
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
                        === FOR SERVING ===
                        Ancho Mole -- (see recipe)

For Filling:  Heat oil in large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onions; sautÈ until golden, about 10 minutes.  Add mushrooms; sautÈ until tender, about 10 minutes.  Add sage, thyme, garlic, and cumin; stir 1 minute.  Add squash, beans, tomatoes with juice, and 1/2 cup water; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer 8 minutes.  Uncover and simmer until vegetables are tender and most of liquid has evaporated but mixture is still very moist, about 12 minutes.  Season filling generously with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Cover; chill.)

For Cornbread:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 15- by 10- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Mix Masa Harina, cornmeal, salt, and baking powder in large bowl.  Whisk 4 1/4 cups water, 6 tablespoons melted butter, eggs, and egg yolk in another large bowl to blend.  Stir egg mixture into Masa Harina mixture.  Stir in cheese and parsley, adding more water by tablespoonfuls as needed to form thick moist dough.

Transfer 4 cups dough to prepared baking dish.  Place large piece of plastic wrap atop dough.  Using plastic as aid, press dough evenly over bottom and 3/4 of the way up sides of dish; peel off plastic.  Spoon filling into dough in dish, spreading evenly.  Spoon remaining dough in small dollops atop filling.  Using offset spatula, gently spread dollops evenly over filling to cover.  Press top and bottom dough together at edges to seal, enclosing filling.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; chill.)

Brush top of casserole with 4 tablespoons melted butter.  Bake until dough is light golden and casserole is heated through, about 1 hour (or about 1 hour 15 minutes if chilled).  Cool 10 minutes.  Cut into squares; serve with Ancho Mole.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Make or buy a favorite pumpkin pie for dessert.

What to drink:  A fruit-forward Zinfandel or Malbec.

Comments:  There isn't a drop of alcohol in this dish ó the name refers to how much you'll want to drink to combat the heat.  We suggest a nice cold beer or sparkling wine.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PEANUT BUTTER MOUSSE ===
  1 1/4           cups  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1                cup  chilled whipping cream -- divided
  3              large  egg yolks
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- room temperature
  1 1/4           cups  creamy peanut butter
                        === GLAZE AND SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  4          teaspoons  dark corn syrup
  12            ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (do not use unsweetened)
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped roasted salted peanuts

For Peanut Butter Mousse:  Whisk sugar, 1/2 cup cream, and yolks in medium saucepan to blend.  Place over medium heat and stir until sugar dissolves and sauce thickens and reaches temperature of 180 degrees, scraping down sides of pan occasionally, about 6 minutes (do not boil).  Transfer to medium bowl.  Refrigerate brown sugar mixture until cold and very thick, stirring occasionally, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

Line 7 1/2- by 3 1/2- by 2 1/4-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving overhang.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until fluffy.  Add peanut butter; beat until smooth.  Beat in brown sugar mixture in 3 additions.  Beat remaining 1/2 cup cream in medium bowl until peaks form.  Fold whipped cream into peanut butter mixture in 2 additions.  Transfer mousse to prepared pan.  Refrigerate while preparing glaze.

For Glaze And Sauce:  Bring cream, butter, and corn syrup to simmer in heavy medium saucepan, stirring often.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate; whisk until melted and smooth.  Transfer 1/3 cup glaze to small bowl and cool to room temperature; spread over mousse in pan.  Cover loaf pan and freeze mousse overnight.  Cover and chill remaining glaze.

Place rack on rimmed baking sheet.  Turn mousse out onto rack, chocolate-side down.  Peel off plastic wrap.  Transfer 1 1/3 cups glaze to small saucepan.  Stir over low heat just until warm and pourable but not hot.  Gradually pour glaze over mousse, spreading to cover evenly and using any glaze that drips onto baking sheet if needed.  Press chopped peanuts onto top of mousse.  Transfer to platter and freeze until glaze is frozen, about 30 minutes.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover loosely when frozen solid and return to freezer.)

Rewarm remaining glaze to use as sauce.  Dip large knife into hot water to warm blade.  Cut mousse crosswise into thin slices, rewarming and wiping blade dry before cutting each slice.  Place mousse on plates.  Spoon some sauce alongside and serve.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Basil Tsiokos of Newburgh, New York, writes: "My best friend and I recently spent a week at Sanctuary on Camelback Mountain, a spa resort near Scottsdale, Arizona.  Our goal was major exercise and minor calories, but on the last night we splurged at Elements with the richest dessert we could find ó slices of chocolate-glazed frozen peanut butter mousse."

Don't use natural-style peanut butter for this recipe; do start making it the day before serving.

If desired, drizzle remaining broth by tablespoonfuls over bread mixture to moisten.  Sprinkle remaining chopped parsley over.  Let stand at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Toasted homemade croutons are tossed with a warm dressing for a stuffing that's lighter than the traditional Thanksgiving version.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Duck
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  apricot jam
  1                     bay leaf
  2                     cinnamon sticks -- broken in half
  1 1/3           cups  kumquats -- stemmed, quartered,
                        and seeded
  2          teaspoons  Grand Marnier
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  arugula
  2                     smoked duck breasts - (6 oz ea) -- each cut 15 thin
                        slices

Combine first 4 ingredients in saucepan over medium-high heat.  Bring to boil; add kumquats.  Simmer until kumquats are tender and liquid is syrupy, about 15 minutes.  Remove from heat; stir in Grand Marnier.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Cool, cover, and chill.  Rewarm over low heat before continuing.)  Strain glaze into small bowl.  Discard cinnamon and bay leaf; reserve candied kumquats and glaze separately.

Divide arugula among plates.  Top each with 5 duck slices; brush with glaze.  Place 1 kumquat quarter on each duck slice.

This recipe yields 6 first-course servings.

Market tip:  Look for smoked duck breasts in the deli section of some supermarkets, or order them from D'Artagnan (800-327-8246; dartagnan.com) or Joie de Vivre (800-648-8854; frenchselections.com).

Marinating the vegetables gives them a lively pickled flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  14            ounces  fresh pork or beef chorizo sausages -- casings removed
  4               cups  watercress tops - (packed) -- divided
  8             ounces  soft fresh goat cheese -- crumbled
  8                     pita breads - (5" to 6" dia)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  3                     mini sweet peppers -- cut thin rings
                        = (1 yellow, 1 orange, and 1 red)

Prepare barbecue (medium heat).  SautÈ chorizo in large skillet over medium-high heat until cooked through, breaking up with spoon, about 8 minutes.  Transfer chorizo to sieve set over bowl and drain.  Mix 2 1/2 cups watercress and goat cheese in medium bowl.

Lightly brush 1 side of each pita bread with oil.  Grill, oiled-side down, until bottom is just crisp, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to work surface, grilled-side up.  Cover each pita bread with cheese mixture, chorizo, and several sweet pepper rings, dividing equally.

Return pita pizzas to barbecue.  Grill, covered, until goat cheese softens, about 2 minutes.  Transfer pita pizzas to serving platter.  Top each with more watercress and serve.

This recipe yields 8 pizzas.

Comments:  For a vegetarian version, substitute Soyrizo for the chorizo.  Follow the same cooking directions, but do not drain.

<DirT>
Lightly brush 1 side of each pita bread with oil.  Grill, oiled-side down, until bottom is just crisp, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to work surface, grilled-side up.  Cover each pita bread with cheese mixture, chorizo, and several sweet pepper rings, dividing equally.

Comments:  For a vegetarian version, substitute Soyrizo for the chorizo.  Follow the same cooking directions, but do not drain.

                Grilled Corn With Sweet-Savory Asian Glaze

Recipe By     :Rick Browne
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce*
                        = (such as nam pla or nuoc nam)
  2        tablespoons  water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
                        additional for brushing corn
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced green onions, white part
                        only (from about 3)
  6               ears  corn -- husked

* Fish sauce is a versatile ingredient.  Try it (1) mixed with garlic and cilantro as a marinade for grilled chicken; (2) in barbecue sauce for ribs; (3) in a salad of slivered green apples and chopped cilantro; and (4) in a compound butter with cayenne and shallots for grilled fish.  It is available in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets and at Asian markets.

Stir first 4 ingredients in small bowl until sugar dissolves.  Melt butter with 2 tablespoons oil in small saucepan over medium heat.  Add fish sauce mixture and green onions and simmer until sauce begins to thicken, about 2 minutes.  Do ahead:  Butter sauce can be made 2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.

Preheat barbecue (medium-high heat).  Brush corn with oil.  Grill corn until tender and charred in spots, about 13 minutes.  Brush corn generously with butter sauce and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Fish sauce lends a tantalizing Asian twist to the butter sauce here, and makes simple grilled corn into something altogether new.

  2             medium  garlic heads -- separated
                        into cloves, peeled - (abt 24 cloves)
     3/4           cup  olive oil -- divided
  1 1/2         pounds  uncooked large shrimp -- deveined, but
                        with shells intact
  8                     firm plum tomatoes -- halved lengthwise
  2            bunches  green onions -- root ends trimmed,
                        and onions left whole
  1                     sweet onion - (abt 1 lb) -- cut 1/2"-thk slices
                        = (such as Vidalia or Maui)
  1                     red bell pepper -- quartered, cored
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- quartered, cored
  1 1/2          large  English hothouse cucumbers -- peeled, and
                        halved lengthwise
  2             slices  country-style bread - (6" x 3" x 1")
  2               cups  grape tomatoes -- halved (abt 1 pt)
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil
                        Lime wedges

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Set aside 2 garlic cloves for bread slices.  Place remaining garlic on double layer of heavy-duty foil; drizzle 3 tablespoons olive oil over.  Fold up and seal packet.  Place directly on grill rack and cook until garlic is very tender and golden, about 30 minutes.  Open packet; cool garlic.

Toss shrimp (in shells) and 1 tablespoon oil in medium bowl to coat; sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Combine plum tomatoes, green onions, sweet onion, both bell peppers, and 2 tablespoons oil in large bowl; toss to coat.  Arrange cucumber halves and bread slices on baking sheet; brush with 2 tablespoons oil.  Sprinkle all vegetables with salt and pepper.

Grill shrimp until just opaque, about 2 1/2 minutes per side; transfer to another bowl and cool.  Grill vegetables until crisp-tender, turning frequently, about 3 minutes for plum tomatoes and green onions, 5 minutes for cucumbers, and 15 minutes for sweet onion and bell peppers.  Transfer to large rimmed baking sheet.  Grill bread slices until just beginning to crisp and grill marks appear, about 2 1/2 minutes per side.  Rub bread with reserved garlic cloves, then discard garlic cloves.

Peel shrimp; transfer to large bowl.  Cut all vegetables and bread into 1/2- to 3/4-inch pieces; add to shrimp along with any accumulated juices.  Stir in grilled garlic cloves and grape tomatoes.  Whisk vinegar, hot pepper sauce, and remaining 4 tablespoons oil in small bowl; pour over salad and toss to coat.

Do ahead:  Can be made 1 1/2 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.

Stir thinly sliced basil into salad.  Season salad to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve with lime wedges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  All of the ingredients that make gazpacho so yummy ó tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, and bell peppers ó turn up in this main-course salad.

Test-kitchen tip:  Look for devined shrimp ó fresh or frozen ó with the shells still intact.  They're easier to peel after grilling.

           Grilled Zucchini With Garlic And Lemon Butter Baste

Recipe By     :Rick Browne
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             medium  zucchini - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- trimmed, and
                        halved lengthwise
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick)
  1         tablespoon  frozen unsweetened lemon juice
                        concentrate
                        = (or 2 tbspns fresh lemon juice)
  1           teaspoon  lemon-pepper seasoning
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  curry powder
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese -- (optional)

Preheat barbecue (medium heat).  Score cut side of zucchini halves diagonally about 1/4 inch deep at 1-inch intervals.  Melt butter with lemon juice concentrate, lemon-pepper seasoning, garlic powder, oregano, and curry powder in heavy small saucepan.  Season with salt and pepper.

Brush seasoned butter on cut side of zucchini.  Place zucchini on grill and cook until charred on all sides and just beginning to soften, about 12 minutes.  If desired, arrange zucchini on grill, cut-side up, and sprinkle with cheese; close lid of barbecue and cook until cheese just softens, about 1 minute.  Transfer zucchini to platter.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A butter baste makes the zucchini so amazingly full-flavored that you can even omit the cheese ó although it's a delicious accent to the lemony zing.

                  Guacamole With Fresh Corn And Chipotle

Recipe By     :Barbara Pool Fenzl
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  ripe avocados - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- halved, pitted,
                        and peeled
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  1                ear  fresh corn
  1                     plum tomato -- seeded, diced
  2                     green onions -- chopped
  1                     canned chipotle chile* -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  sour cream

* Chipotle chiles are dried, smoked jalapeÒos canned in adobo sauce.  They are available at some supermarkets, at specialty foods stores, and at Latin markets.

Mash avocados with lime juice in medium bowl.  Using sharp knife, remove corn kernels from cob and add to avocado mixture.  Stir in tomato and green onions.  Combine chipotle and sour cream in small bowl; whisk to blend.  Stir cream mixture into avocado mixture.  Season with salt.

Do ahead:  Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Place plastic wrap directly onto surface of guacamole and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields about 2 cups.

Comments:  Forget placing the avocado pit in your guacamole ó unless you like how it looks.  It doesn't stop the dip from turning brown.

  4        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2 1/2           cups  cubed 1/3" peeled red-skin sweet potato -- (yam)
  2               cups  cubed 1/2" ham

  4                     watercress sprigs -- for garnish
  4              large  eggs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKES ===
  1            package  almond paste* - (7 oz) -- coarsely crumbled
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  Tuaca**
                        = (or Frangelico [hazelnut-flavored
                        liqueur])
  3              large  eggs
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        === ZABAGLIONE ===
  6        tablespoons  frozen pineapple juice concentrate -- thawed
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  3              large  egg yolks
                        Sliced almonds -- toasted

* Available in the baking-products section of most supermarkets and at specialty foods stores.

** A citrusy, vanilla-flavored Italian liqueur; available at specialty liquor stores.

For Cakes:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter six 3/4-cup custard cups or ramekins.  Blend almond paste and sugar in processor until well blended.  Using electric mixer, beat butter in medium bowl until smooth.  Beat in almond paste mixture, then honey and Tuaca.  Add eggs 1 at a time, blending well between additions.  Whisk flour and salt in small bowl; mix into almond paste mixture.

Divide batter among prepared cups.  Bake until golden brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.  Cool slightly in cups.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm in 325 degrees oven for 10 minutes, if desired.)

For Zabaglione:  Whisk first 3 ingredients in medium bowl set over pan of barely simmering water until very thick, whisking constantly, about 7 minutes.

Pour warm zabaglione over warm or room-temperature cakes, sprinkle with toasted almonds, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  John Carey of Anchorage, Alaska, writes: "Whenever I see zabaglione on a dessert menu, I order it.  The tangy pineapple version at Vetri in Philadelphia comes with a moist almond cake ó divine."

Add sliced green onions, chopped cilantro, and sliced chile; blend mixture to coarse puree.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Overlap 6 tortillas in 13- by 9- by 2-inch oval or rectangular baking dish.  Top tortillas with half of chicken strips and half of mozzarella strips.  Pour 2 cups tomatillo sauce evenly over.  Top with remaining tortillas, chicken strips, and mozzarella.  Pour 1 1/2 cups tomatillo sauce over, then whipping cream.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Bake until bubbling, about 25 minutes.  Cool enchiladas 10 minutes.  Serve with remaining tomatillo sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The tortillas and filling are layered (instead of rolled) to reduce prep time.

Prep Tip:  Related to both the tomato and the gooseberry, tomatillos look like small green tomatoes with papery husks.  They are tart and acidic with flavors of apple and lemon, and can be eated raw or cooked.  Choose ones that are firm; make sure to remove the husk and rinse the fruit before using.  You'll find tomatillos at some supermarkets and at Latin markets.

                       Leg Of Lamb 'Black And Tan'

Recipe By     :Paul Kirk
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1        6 1/4 pound  leg of lamb -- boned, butterflied,
                        trimmed of excess fat and sinew
                        = (reserve bone and trimmings for sauce)
  1              small  onion -- chopped
     3/4           cup  chopped peeled carrots
  1 1/2           cups  beef broth
     1/2           cup  Guinness Extra Stout
     1/2           cup  Harp lager beer
  2        tablespoons  honey mustard
                        Disposable 11 3/4" x 8 1/2" x 1 1/4"
                        aluminum baking pan
     1/3           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  granulated garlic
  3        tablespoons  lemon-pepper seasoning
  2        tablespoons  chilled butter - (1/4 stick) -- cut into 4 cubes
  1           teaspoon  honey -- or more

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Arrange lamb bone, trimmings, onion, and carrots in roasting pan.  Roast until browned, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.

Pour off fat and discard lamb bone from roasting pan.  Place roasting pan over 2 burners; add broth and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits.  Strain into medium saucepan; discard solids in strainer.  Add stout, lager, and mustard; boil until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 5 minutes.

Do ahead: Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm before finishing sauce.

Remove top rack from grill.  Place disposable aluminum baking pan in center of barbecue (if using 2-burner gas grill, place pan on 1 side of grill).  Add enough water to pan to reach depth of 1 inch.

Preheat barbecue (medium heat).  If using charcoal grill, light briquettes in chimney and place half on each side of aluminum baking pan (you may need to light additional briquettes in chimney to replenish halfway through grilling time).  If using 3-burner gas grill, light gas burners on left and right, leaving center burner off.  If using 2-burner gas grill, light burners on side opposite disposable pan.

Place lamb on rimmed baking sheet.  Brush lamb all over with balsamic vinegar; sprinkle all over with granulated garlic, then lemon pepper.  Place lamb, rounded-side up, on grill rack over aluminum pan.  Cover grill and cook lamb until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of lamb registers 125 degrees for medium-rare (temperature of thinner parts of lamb will register between 135 and 145 degrees and will vary from medium to well-done), maintaining temperature of barbecue between 350 and 375 degrees, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Transfer lamb to cutting board; let rest 10 minutes.

Whisk butter into sauce 1 piece at a time, then whisk in 1 teaspoon honey.  Season sauce with salt and pepper, and more honey, if desired.  Thinly slice lamb; arrange on platter.  Serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Inspired by Britain's classic drink ó lager topped with stout ó the sauce is a natural for lamb.  Taste it and add more honey to offset any bitterness and get just the balance you want.

Test-kitchen tip:  Have the butcher bone and butterfly the leg of lamb, reserving the bone and trimmings to use in the sauce.

                 Lemon Chiffon Pie With Gingersnap Crust

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/4           cups  finely-ground gingersnap cookie crumbs
                        = (abt 25 cookies ground in processor)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  minced crystallized ginger
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  ice cubes
     1/4           cup  water
  1           envelope  unflavored gelatin
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4           cup  strained fresh lemon juice
  4              large  egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated lemon peel
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1 1/4           cups  chilled whipping cream
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar
                        Lemon peel strips from 1 lemon -- removed with
                        citrus zester

For Crust:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Mix gingersnap cookie crumbs, sugar, and ginger in medium bowl.  Add melted butter and stir until mixture is evenly moistened.  Transfer crumb mixture to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish; press crumbs firmly and evenly onto bottom and up sides to top of dish.  Bake until crust is firm and slightly darker in color, about 8 minutes.  Cool crust completely.

For Filling:  Pour enough cold water into medium bowl to come halfway up sides; add 2 cups ice cubes and set aside.

Pour 1/4 cup water into small bowl; sprinkle gelatin over.  Let stand until gelatin softens, about 15 minutes.

Whisk 3/4 cup sugar, lemon juice, egg yolks, grated lemon peel, and salt in heavy medium saucepan to blend.  Whisk constantly over medium heat until mixture thickens very slightly (mixture will coat spoon but will not be thick like curd) and thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160 degrees, about 6 minutes (do not boil).  Add gelatin mixture; whisk until gelatin dissolves and mixture is smooth, about 1 minute.  Place saucepan in bowl with ice water until lemon filling is cool to touch, whisking occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Transfer lemon filling to large bowl.

Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream with powdered sugar in another medium bowl until peaks form.  Fold 1/4 of whipped cream into lemon filling until incorporated.  Fold in remaining whipped cream in 3 additions.  Transfer filling to cool crust, mounding slightly in center.  Refrigerate pie until filling is set, about 4 hours.

Do ahead:  Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Let stand at room temperature 20 minutes before serving.

Toss lemon peel strips with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in small bowl; let stand 10 minutes.  Twist peel to form curls (see tip below).  Garnish center of pie with lemon peel curls.

To make lemon peel curls:  Remove peel in long strips using a citrus zester or channel knife.  Twist strips around chopstick to form curls, then slide curls off.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Chiffon Pie, with its light, billowy filling, can't help but bring to mind the sheer, silky fabric it's named for.

Soft, mousse-like lemon filling; crunchy, gingery crust ó a super combo.

Comments:  Gerald Colapinto of Corona, California, writes: "My grandparents were born in Italy and were wonderful cooks, so I'm partial to Italian food.  I especially love the cooking of Southern Italy.  Fortunately, I often travel to Rome on business.  Back home, I like to re-create the dishes I discovered."

                       Maple-Glazed Sweet Potatoes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- divided
  4             pounds  red-skinned sweet potatoes (yams) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" chunks
     1/2           cup  pure maple syrup (preferably Grade B)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" cubes

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Oil 2 large rimmed baking sheets with 1 tablespoon oil each.  Combine sweet potatoes and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in large bowl; toss.  Divide sweet potatoes between baking sheets, spreading evenly.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast until almost tender, turning occasionally with metal spatula, about 35 minutes.  (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead.  Let stand uncovered at room temperature.)

Drizzle maple syrup over sweet potatoes and toss to coat.  Roast until sweet potatoes are tender and syrup is reduced to glaze and coats sweet potatoes, about 20 minutes.  Remove from oven; scatter butter cubes over sweet potatoes and let stand until melted.  Season to taste with salt and generous amount of cracked pepper.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Try using Grade B maple syrup, which has a deeper flavor than Grade A, in this recipe.  Look for it at natural foods stores.

  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1 3/4         pounds  ground lamb
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray -- as needed
  4              large  cracked-wheat hamburger buns -- split horizontally
  1 1/3           cups  thinly-sliced Bibb lettuce
                        Mayonnaise -- as needed

For Salsa:  Whisk first 3 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.  Mix in next 4 ingredients.  Season salsa to taste with salt and pepper.  Do ahead: Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cover and chill.

For Burgers:  Stir shallot, cilantro, jalapeÒo, garlic, salt, black pepper, paprika, and cumin in large bowl to blend.  Add lamb and mix gently to combine.  Shape mixture into four 1/2-inch-thick patties.  Arrange on small baking sheet.  Do ahead: Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cover and chill.

Spray grill rack with nonstick spray and prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill buns, cut-side down, until golden, about 2 minutes; transfer to work surface.  Place lettuce and large spoonful of salsa on each bun bottom.  Grill burgers until slightly charred and cooked to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Place 1 burger on each bun.  Top each with mayonnaise and bun top.  Serve with remaining salsa.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  He may be executive chef at London's luxe Conservatory at The Lanesborough, but Paul Gayler knows a thing or two about American cuisine, too.  In The Gourmet Burger, he rethinks the barbecue classic using premium and international ingredients.  Here, he adds mildly spicy North African flavors.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Mushrooms

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced, divided
  6              large  portobello mushrooms -- stemmed
  1 1/2           cups  panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)*
  1                cup  shredded mozzarella cheese - (abt 5 oz)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese - (abt 2 oz)
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh oregano
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted

* Panko can be used in any recipe calling for dry (not fresh) breadcrumbs ó such as eggplant parmigiana, chicken tenders, or meatloaf.  It is available in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets and at Asian markets.

Whisk oil, 2 tablespoons vinegar, and 1 garlic clove in small bowl for marinade.  Using spoon, scrape out gills from mushrooms and place mushrooms on rimmed baking sheet.  Brush marinade over both sides of mushrooms, arrange hollow-side up, and let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.

Divide panko mixture among mushrooms, leaving 1/2-inch border around edges and packing down slightly.  Place mushrooms on grill, stuffing-side up; cover grill and cook until cheese melts and juices bubble at edges of mushrooms, rearranging mushrooms occasionally for even cooking (do not turn over), about 6 minutes.

     1/4           cup  dried currants
     3/4         pound  perciatelli (thick hollow spaghetti)
                        = (or linguine)
     1/4      teaspoon  saffron threads
  1                cup  fresh breadcrumbs -- toasted

Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Add anchovies; mash with back of fork.  Add onion, fennel, and red pepper.  SautÈ vegetables until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes, pine nuts, and currants.  Reduce heat to low and cook 5 minutes to blend flavors; season with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite.

Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.  Add saffron to reserved liquid and stir to dissolve.  Return pasta and saffron water to pot.  Add tomato mixture; toss over low heat until sauce coats pasta.  Mix in breadcrumbs and transfer to bowl.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Chef Sal Passalacqua of Dimaio Cucina in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, writes: "My father's family is from Sicily and I spent my teenage years there, so that's where a lot of my culinary influences come from.  At first glance, Sicilian cooking seems very simple, but that simplicity depends on using the freshest ingredients and often the combination of sweet and tart flavors.  The anchovy pasta is a perfect example."

This dish is a variation on the traditional Sicilian pasta made with sardines.  Anchovies have replaced the sardines, but the flavors are still very authentic.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  For fresh breadcrumbs, grind pieces of crustles French bread in processor to coarse crumbs.  Then toast on rimmed baking sheet in 350 degrees oven until golden, about 10 minutes.

          Peach And Blackberry Shortcakes With Blackberry Cream

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHORTCAKES ===
  2 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
  8        tablespoons  sugar -- divided
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  10        tablespoon  chilled unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- cut 1/2" cubes
     3/4           cup  buttermilk -- plus
  2        tablespoons  buttermilk
  1         tablespoon  whipping cream
                        === FILLING ===
  2             pounds  ripe peaches -- peeled, pitted,
                        and sliced
  2                     containers blackberries - (6 oz ea)
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1              pinch  fine sea salt
                        === BLACKBERRY CREAM ===
  2                     containers blackberries - (6 oz ea)
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1 3/4           cups  chilled whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

For Shortcakes:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.

Whisk flour, 7 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg in large bowl to blend.  Add butter and rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Gradually add buttermilk, tossing with fork until moist clumps form.  Gather dough together; flatten dough on floured work surface to 3/4- to 1-inch-thick round.  Using floured 3-inch round biscuit cutter or cookie cutter, cut out rounds.  Gather dough scraps and flatten on work surface to 3/4- to 1-inch thickness; cut out additional rounds for a total of 6.  Transfer shortcakes to prepared baking sheet.  Whisk cream and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in small bowl to blend.  Brush cream mixture over tops of shortcakes.

Bake shortcakes until tops begin to brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Transfer shortcakes to rack.  Do ahead: Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Let stand at room temperature.  Rewarm in 350 degree oven 5 minutes before assembling.

For Filling:  Toss sliced peaches, blackberries, sugar, and salt in medium bowl; let stand while preparing blackberry cream.

For Blackberry Cream:  Rinse blackberries; moisture will enhance puree.  Place in processor.  Add sugar; puree until smooth.  Strain mixture through fine strainer set over bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible.  Discard solids.

Using electric mixer, beat cream and vanilla in large bowl until peaks form.  Fold 3/4 cup blackberry puree into whipped cream until incorporated.  Reserve remaining blackberry puree for sauce.

Cut shortcakes horizontally in half.  Place 1 bottom half of each shortcake on each of 6 plates.  Spoon filling over each, then generous amount of blackberry cream.  Drizzle each with reserved blackberry puree.  Cover with top halves of shortcakes and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Shortcakes are biscuit-like cakes that have more butter (or shortening) than many other types of cake.  In fact, pastry chefs often describe especially buttery doughs as "short."

Test-kitchen tip:  For the most tender shortcakes, don't overwork the dough.  Once you add the liquid, stir until just blended.

                       Porcini And Stuffing Strata

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
  2               cups  whole milk
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4 1/2           cups  leftover bread stuffing
  1                cup  grated GruyËre cheese
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 11- by 7- by 2-inch glass baking dish.

Working in batches, finely grind porcini in spice grinder.  Whisk milk and next 3 ingredients in large bowl.  Stir in stuffing and ground porcini, breaking up any clumps.  Transfer mixture to prepared baking dish.  Sprinkle cheese over stuffing mixture.

Bake until puffed in center and cheese is brown in spots, about 45 minutes.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Think of a strata as a savory bread pudding; here, leftover stuffing serves as the bread.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  Use any leftover white-bread stuffing (even one with sausage), but not a cornbread stuffing.

Comments:  Lynn Brown writes: "For me, it's fun to see how much I can simplify or revise a recipe to make it my own.  That's what I've done with the soup here (it's one of my favorite things to make).  And the cioppino came from an old magazine, but I've changed a few things, plus I save time with canned tomatoes and peeled shrimp."

  1              pound  quinces - (abt 3 medium) -- peeled, quartered,
                        cored -- cut into 1/3" cubes
                        = (abt scant 4 cups)
  1 1/2           cups  apple cider
  1 1/2           cups  chopped red onion
     1/2           cup  apple cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  dried currants
     1/4           cup  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  grated orange peel
  1              whole  star anise*
  1           teaspoon  black mustard seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

* A brown star-shaped seedpod; available in the spice section of some supermarkets and at specialty foods stores and Asian markets.

Mix all ingredients in heavy large saucepan; bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until almost all liquid is absorbed, stirring often, about 45 minutes.  Discard star anise.  (Can be made 4 days ahead.  Cover; chill.)

This recipe yields 2 1/2 cups.

Comments:  This fresh side is a delicious alternative to cranberry sauce.

Test-Kitchen Tip:  The hard core of the quince must be removed with a knife after each fruit is quartered.  If the core is too hard to remove safely with a knife, trim pieces of fruit from around it, then cut the pieces into smaller cubes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  kumquats -- stemmed, quartered,
                        and seeded
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- divided
  4              small  shallots -- chopped (1/2 cup)
  1             medium  Granny Smith apple -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped - (abt 1 cup)
  3        tablespoons  minced seeded jalapeÒo chiles -- divided
     1/2           cup  dried apricots -- chopped
     3/4           cup  water
     3/4           cup  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
  2                     pork tenderloins - (16 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Using on/off turns, finely chop kumquats in processor (do not puree).  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add shallots, apple, and 1 tablespoon jalapeÒo.  Cook until shallots are soft, stirring frequently, about 4 minutes.

Add chopped kumquats, apricots, 3/4 cup water, sugar, and 3/4 teaspoon salt.  Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Boil until mixture thickens, about 6 minutes.

Transfer marmalade to small bowl.  Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons jalapeÒo.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool, cover, and chill.  Rewarm before serving.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper.  Add pork to skillet; brown on all sides, about 10 minutes total.

Transfer skillet to oven; roast pork until thermometer inserted into center registers 145 degrees, about 15 minutes.  Remove pork from oven; let stand 10 minutes.

Cut pork into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Serve with warm marmalade.

  1            package  firm tofu - (14 to 16 oz)
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped peeled fresh ginger

  1                     red bell pepper -- cut 1/4"-wide strips
  1           teaspoon  salt

Halve tofu lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices and pat dry well.  Put 1 tablespoon soy sauce in a wide shallow dish, then add tofu, turning to coat, and let stand 10 minutes.  Pat tofu dry.

Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking, then add tofu in 1 layer and cook, turning over once, until tofu is browned, about 6 minutes total.  Transfer with a slotted spoon to a large plate, reserving oil in skillet.

Add garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes to skillet and sautÈ, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add beans, bell pepper, and salt and sautÈ, stirring, 1 minute.

Stir in coconut milk and remaining tablespoon soy sauce and bring to a boil, then boil, uncovered, until beans are tender, about 6 minutes.  Transfer vegetables using a slotted spoon to plate with tofu.

Simmer sauce until thickened slightly and reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 2 minutes.  Stir in lime juice and pour sauce over vegetables and tofu.  Sprinkle with cashews.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MAGIC DUST ===
     1/4           cup  paprika
  3        tablespoons  chili powder
  2 1/2    tablespoons  dry mustard
  2        tablespoons  coarse kosher salt

  2        tablespoons  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  granulated garlic
  1         tablespoon  cayenne pepper
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === BARBECUE SAUCE ===
  2                     thick bacon slices -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  grated onion
     1/3           cup  grated tart green apple
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                cup  ketchup
     2/3           cup  seasoned rice vinegar
     1/2           cup  apple juice
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  yellow mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        === PORK ===
  4                     pork steaks abt 1" thk - (14 to 16 oz ea)
  1                     disposable 11 3/4" x 8 1/2" x 1 3/4"
                        aluminum pan for charcoal grill; 2 pans
                        if using 2-burner gas grill; 3 pans if
                        using 3-burner gas grill
  4               cups  applewood chips -- soaked in water at
                        least 30 minutes, divided

For Magic Dust:  Mix ingredients in jar; seal.  Do ahead: Can be made 2 months ahead.  Store at room temperature.

For Barbecue Sauce:  Heat large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add bacon and sautÈ until golden, about 4 minutes.  Add onion, apple, and garlic.  SautÈ 4 minutes.  Add all remaining ingredients.  Simmer until sauce begins to thicken, stirring often, about 10 minutes.  Cool.  Transfer to bowl, cover, and chill.  Do ahead: Can be made 1 week ahead.  Keep chilled.

For Pork:  Sprinkle magic dust over both sides of steaks, about 1 1/2 tablespoons for each steak.  Transfer to platter; cover and chill overnight.

For final grilling:  Transfer pork to clean platter.  Thickly coat 1 side with sauce; sprinkle lightly with magic dust.  Do ahead: Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cool completely.  Cover and refrigerate.

Remove pans from barbecue and prepare charcoal grills with fresh coals (medium heat), or heat gas grills to medium heat.  Place pork on grill, sauce-side up.  Grill until heated through and sauce begins to caramelize, occasionally turning and brushing with more sauce, about 8 minutes.  Slice pork and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Start this recipe one day ahead.

Market tip:  Pork steak (also called blade steak) is an ideal cut for a long, slow smoking: It's a tougher piece of meat than a loin chop, so it will be tender after lengthy cooking.  Plus, it has enough fat to prevent it from drying out.  The pre-cut pork steaks available at some supermarkets will likely be too thin for this recipe.  Instead, order a blade roast and have it sliced 3/4 to 1 inch thick.

Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  uncooked large shrimp -- deveined but with
                        tails and shells intact
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
     1/3           cup  Worcestershire sauce
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  Old Bay seasoning
                        = (or other seafood seasoning)
                        Lemon wedges
                        Crusty baguette slices

Preheat broiler.  Cover rimmed baking sheet with foil and spread shrimp on sheet.  Mix melted butter, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, brown sugar, and Old Bay seasoning in medium bowl for sauce.  Pour half of sauce over shrimp and stir to coat.  Broil until shrimp are just opaque in center, about 2 1/2 minutes per side.  Transfer to platter; serve with lemon wedges, baguette slices, and remaining sauce.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Comments:  Charlotte writes:  "I'm a junior in college, and I'm planning to go to cooking school after graduation.  I've already had some experience decorating cakes and working for a caterer, but it was my mom who taught me how to cook.  I've also learned a lot from reading magazines and cookbooks."

Charlotte's mother learned this recipe years ago, when she was working on a shrimp boat.

Test-kitchen tip:  To devein the shrimp for this recipe, use scissors to cut shells down center of backs and pull out veins.  Even easier: Many supermarkets sell uncooked deveined shrimp with the shells and tails intact.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  4               cups  fresh blueberries
                        = (from four 1/2-pint containers)
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  mild-flavored (light) molasses
     1/4           cup  water
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated lemon peel
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
                        === DUMPLINGS ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  3        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut 1/4" cubes
     3/4           cup  whole milk
                        === TOPPING ===
                        Whipped cream, chilled whipping
                        cream, or vanilla ice cream

For Filling:  Mix all ingredients in 12-inch-diameter skillet.  Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Reduce heat to medium; simmer until berries soften and mixture thickens slightly, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare Dumplings:  Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl to blend.  Add butter and rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles fine meal.  Add milk; stir just until blended and sticky dough forms.

Drop batter by tablespoonfuls onto simmering berry mixture, placing close together.  Reduce heat to medium-low; cover skillet and simmer until dumplings are firm and tester inserted into dumplings comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Scoop warm dessert into bowls.

Top with whipped cream, whipping cream, or ice cream.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Grunts get their quirky name from the fact that the fruit, which is topped with dumplings and cooked on the stove in a covered skillet, can make a grunting sound as the dessert steams.

Molasses adds sweetness and a lovely depth of flavor.

  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon peel
  4              large  eggs
  1                can  pure pumpkin - (15 oz)
     1/2           cup  plain whole-milk yogurt
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
                        A large pinch of salt
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick)
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  bourbon - (to 4)
  1 1/2           cups  pecans -- toasted, cooled

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 9-inch springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Grind first 4 ingredients in processor until nut mixture sticks together.  Press evenly onto bottom of pan.  Bake crust until golden, about 15 minutes.  Cool completely.  Wrap outside of pan in triple layer of heavy-duty foil.

For Filling:  Using mixer, beat cream cheese, sugar, and lemon peel in large bowl until smooth.  Beat in eggs 1 at a time, then pumpkin, yogurt, flour, vanilla, spices, and salt.  Pour into pan.

Set springform pan in roasting pan.  Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of cheesecake.  Place in oven.  Bake until outer 3 inches puff slightly and center is softly set, about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Cool in water bath 30 minutes.  Remove from water.  Cut around sides of cake to loosen.  Refrigerate in pan until cold, about 4 hours.  Cover and chill overnight.

For Sauce:  Bring sugar, cream, butter, corn syrup, and salt to boil in deep medium saucepan, whisking until sugar dissolves.  Reduce heat to medium; boil 1 minute without stirring.  Remove from heat.  Stir in bourbon, then pecans.  Cool, stirring occasionally.

Remove foil.  Cut around pan sides; remove sides.  Cut cheesecake into wedges; spoon sauce over.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Make this luscious dessert a day ahead.

Cheesecake Basics:
   ï To avoid overbeating the filling, make sure that all of the ingredients are at room temperature.
   ï For best results, use Philadelphia-brand cream cheese.
   ï To get the neatest slices, dip the blade of the knife into a glass of very hot water and wipe the warm blade dry before cutting each wedge of cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PRALINE ===
     1/3           cup  water
     1/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1 1/4           cups  hazelnuts - (abt 5 1/2 oz) -- toasted, husked,
                        and coarsely chopped
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  solid vegetable shortening -- cut 1/2" cubes,
                        frozen
  3        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
  1           teaspoon  apple cider vinegar
                        === FILLING ===
  1                can  pure pumpkin - (15 oz)
     3/4           cup  heavy whipping cream
     1/2           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2              large  eggs
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === TOPPING ===
     2/3           cup  chilled whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar

For Praline:  Line rimmed baking sheet with foil.  Mix 1/3 cup water and cream of tartar in small saucepan.  Add sugar; stir over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat; boil without stirring until golden, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 11 minutes.  Add nuts; swirl to combine.  Pour praline onto baking sheet, spreading with metal spatula.  Cool.

Break praline into chunks; grind half finely in processor.  Reserve powder for filling and remaining chunks for garnish.  (Can be made 5 days ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

For Crust:  Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor.  Add shortening and butter; cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Transfer to medium bowl.  Mix 2 tablespoons ice water and vinegar in small bowl and add to flour mixture.  Stir until moist clumps form, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry.  Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic; chill 45 minutes.

Roll out dough on floured surface to 14-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch glass pie dish.  Trim overhang to 3/4 inch.  Turn edges under; crimp.  Freeze 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake crust until edges begin to brown, pressing with back of fork if crust bubbles, about 12 minutes.  Remove crust from oven.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Meanwhile, prepare Filling:  Whisk praline powder, pumpkin, and next 10 ingredients in medium bowl to blend.

Pour filling into warm crust.  Bake until filling is puffed around edges and just set in center, about 45 minutes.  Transfer pie to rack; cool.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover loosely and chill.)

For Topping:  Beat cream and sugar in bowl until peaks form.  Transfer cream to pastry bag fitted with large star tip.  Pipe rosettes around top edge of pie.  Garnish with praline chunks.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  canned chipotle chiles in adobo*
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- pressed
     1/2                onion -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     chicken - (abt 3 1/2 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces
                        Nonstick vegetable oil spray

* Canned chipotle chiles in adobo are available at some supermarkets, at Latin markets, and from mexgrocer.com.

Combine chipotles in adobo, olive oil, and garlic cloves in processor; puree until paste forms.  Add chopped onion, chopped cilantro, paprika, ground cumin, chili powder, and salt; process until onion is finely chopped.  Transfer 1/4 cup chipotle mixture to small bowl; cover and refrigerate.  Arrange chicken pieces in 11- by 7- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Spread remaining chipotle mixture all over chicken pieces.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Spray grill rack with nonstick spray.  Prepare barbecue (medium heat).  Grill chicken until cooked through, moving to cooler part of grill as needed to prevent burning and brushing with reserved marinade during last 5 minutes of grilling, about 30 minutes.  Transfer chicken to platter and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  There's depth, subtlety, and just the right amount of heat here.  Start preparing this dish one day ahead since the chicken needs to marinate overnight.

Comments:  Chef Michael Presnal of The Federal Restaurant in Agawam, Massachusetts, writes: "The recipe here was featured on one of my first menus as a chef, before I got into the kind of complex cooking I do now at The Federal.  That was over ten years ago, but I still love making this dish at home.  It calls for just a few fresh ingredients and takes only a couple of steps."

A French country dessert that's like pudding and tender cake all in one.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GLAZE ===
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
     1/2           cup  tamarind concentrate*
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
                        === BURGERS ===
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1                     red jalapeÒo chile with seeds -- minced
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
  2 1/2         pounds  ground natural turkey
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  8                     rolls - (4" dia) -- split horizontally
                        = (such as potato or kaiser)
  8              large  red onion slices - (thin)
  8              large  tomato slices 1/3"-thick
  8                     lettuce leaves

* Sometimes labeled tamarind paste, tamarind concentrate is a dark, seedless paste with a tart-sweet flavor.  It's available at Middle Eastern and Indian markets, and at some Asian markets.

For Glaze:  Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add ginger and sautÈ 2 minutes.  Add tamarind concentrate, honey, and water and bring to boil.  Reduce heat; simmer until thick enough to coat spoon and reduced to 1 1/4 cups, stirring often, about 8 minutes.  Cool completely (volume will reduce as glaze cools); mix in lime juice.  Do ahead: Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cover and chill.

For Burgers:  Stir mayonnaise, ginger, salt, jalapeÒo, black pepper, and 4 teaspoons glaze in large bowl to blend; mix in green onions.  Add ground turkey; blend gently (do not pack tightly).  Shape mixture into eight 1/2-inch-thick patties.  Arrange patties on small baking sheet.  Do ahead: Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cover and chill.

Prepare barbecue (medium heat).  Grill rolls, cut-side down, until golden, about 2 minutes; transfer to work surface.  Grill burgers until cooked through and thermometer inserted into center registers 160 degrees, about 8 minutes per side.  Brush each burger with glaze.  Place 1 burger, glazed-side down, on each roll bottom; brush each burger with more glaze.  Top each with onion, tomato, lettuce, and roll top.  Serve, passing remaining glaze separately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  As culinary director for Balducci's, Katy Sparks brought take-out food to a whole new level.  Instead of the typical fried chicken and heavy potato salad, the market offers horseradish-crusted salmon and grilled fingerling potatoes with lemon.  In this recipe she's taken the often-bland turkey burger to a higher plane, with the addition of tamarind.

Test-kitchen tip:  Combine and shape the turkey mixture gently to ensure turkey burgers.  Meat that is overworked becomes too compact and results in dry burgers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRAVY BASE ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick)
  2             pounds  turkey necks and/or wings
  2               cups  diced onions
  1                cup  diced peeled carrots
  1                cup  diced celery
  6               cups  low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
                        === TURKEY ===
  1                cup  butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature,
                        divided
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh thyme -- plus
  15                    fresh thyme sprigs
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh tarragon -- plus
  5              large  fresh tarragon sprigs
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh rosemary -- plus
  5                     fresh rosemary sprigs
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh sage -- plus
  5                     fresh sage sprigs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     turkey - (14 to 16 lbs)
  4               cups  low-salt chicken broth -- divided
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour

For Gravy Base:  Melt butter in heavy large deep skillet over high heat.  Add turkey necks and/or wings and sautÈ until deep brown, about 15 minutes.  Add onions, carrots, and celery and sautÈ until vegetables are deep brown, about 15 minutes.  Add 6 cups chicken broth and bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Pour gravy base through strainer set over 4-cup measuring cup, pressing on solids to extract liquid.  If necessary, add enough chicken broth to gravy base to measure 4 cups.  (Gravy base can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cool slightly.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled.  Rewarm before using.)

For Turkey:  Mix 1/2 cup butter and all minced herbs in small bowl; season herb butter with salt and pepper.  Transfer 2 generous tablespoons to another small bowl and reserve for gravy; let stand at room temperature.

Set rack at lowest position in oven and preheat to 425 degrees.  Rinse turkey inside and out; pat dry.  Starting at neck end, slide hand between skin and breast meat to loosen skin.  Rub 4 tablespoons herb butter over breast meat under skin.  Place turkey on rack set in large roasting pan.  Sprinkle main cavity generously with salt and pepper.  Place 4 tablespoons plain butter and all fresh herb sprigs in main cavity.  Tuck wing tips under.  Tie legs together loosely.  Rub remaining herb butter over outside of turkey.  Sprinkle turkey generously with salt and pepper.

Place turkey in oven and roast 20 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Roast turkey 30 minutes; pour 1 cup broth over and add 1 tablespoon plain butter to roasting pan.  Roast turkey 30 minutes; baste with pan juices, then pour 1 cup broth over and add 1 tablespoon butter to pan.  Cover turkey loosely with foil.  Roast turkey until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175 degrees, basting with pan juices and adding 1 cup broth and 1 tablespoon butter to pan every 45 minutes, about 1 hour 45 minutes longer.  Transfer turkey to platter; let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees).

Strain pan juices into bowl; whisk in gravy base.  Melt reserved 2 tablespoons herb butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat; add flour and whisk constantly until roux is golden brown, about 6 minutes.  Gradually add pan juice-gravy base mixture; increase heat and whisk constantly until gravy thickens, boils, and is smooth.  Reduce heat to medium; boil gently until gravy is reduced to 4 1/2 cups, whisking often, about 10 minutes.  Season gravy with salt and pepper.

  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     red onions -- sliced
  2                     bell peppers -- seeded, sliced
                        = (preferably 1 red and 1 yellow)

  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  8             ounces  packaged grated Mexican 4-cheese blend - -- (abt 2 cups)

Working with 1 tortilla at a time, heat tortilla directly over medium-high gas flame (or in dry skillet over medium-high heat) until warm, softened, and browned in spots, about 30 seconds per side.  Place tortilla on work surface.  Spoon 1 cup warm turkey mixture along center of tortilla; fold sides in over filling, then roll up tortilla to enclose filling.  Place burrito seam-side down on baking sheet, and place in oven to keep warm.  Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.

Comments:  The bold flavor of turkey is a natural with Mexican food.

Fire-roasted salsa can be found in the refrigerated deli case at most supermarkets.
