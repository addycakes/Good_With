  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  dried California apricots
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  almond liqueur
  1              pinch  salt
  20                    wonton wrappers -- thawed if frozen,
                        and covered loosely with a damp paper
                        towel to prevent drying
     1/4           cup  melted butter
     1/4           cup  water
                        === SUGARED ALMONDS ===
  2          teaspoons  butter
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds
  2          teaspoons  sugar
                        === MAPLE CREAM SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  maple syrup
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup

To a medium saucepan, add apricots, water and lemon zest.  Cover and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until the apricots are very tender and the liquid has reduced to about 2 tablespoons, about 10 minutes.  Transfer the mixture to a food processor, and coarsely puree with the butter, sugar, lemon juice, liqueur, and salt.

Brush edges of wonton wrappers with water.  Spoon 1 heaping teaspoon apricot filling into wonton wrapper.  Fold and close, sealing edges by pinching them together.  Place on a sheet pan lightly sprinkled with cornstarch.

Using a dry pastry brush, dust the dumplings free of cornstarch.  Brush the bottoms of the dumplings with the melted butter and place in a non-stick pan.  Add water and cover the pan, steaming the dumplings until they are translucent, about 5 minutes.  Remove the wontons from the pan and sprinkle with Sugared Almonds.  Serve with Maple Cream Sauce.

Sugared Almonds:  Melt butter in a skillet, add the almonds, and saute, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.  Add the sugar and cook, stirring, until golden, about 1 minute.

Maple Cream Sauce:  In a small heavy saucepan, combine the heavy cream with the maple syrup and the light corn syrup.  Cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, until it is thickened and reduced by 1/3, about 5 minutes.  Transfer the sauce to a bowl and serve at room temperature or chilled.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

             Asparagus, Gruyere And Tarragon Souffleed Omelet

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Omelets


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  medium asparagus -- trimmed
  1             medium  red onion -- sliced thin
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     2/3           cup  coarsely-grated Gruyere
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh tarragon leaves -- or to taste
  4              large  eggs -- separated
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a 10-inch non-stick skillet simmer the asparagus in salted water to cover for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it is just tender.  Drain the asparagus, shock in ice water, and pat dry with paper towels.

In the skillet, cook the onion with salt and pepper, to taste, in 1 tablespoon of the butter over moderate heat, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until the onion is golden, and transfer the mixture to the bowl.  In the same skillet, heat asparagus until warmed through.  Add the asparagus to the onions.

Wipe out the same skillet and heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter over moderate heat until it is melted, tilting the skillet to coat it with the butter, and remove it from the heat.

In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the flour and salt and pepper, to taste, until the mixture is thick and lemon-colored.  Add the onions and asparagus to the egg yolks.

In another bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they just hold stiff peaks, fold them into the yolk mixture gently but thoroughly, and pour the egg mixture into the skillet, spreading it evenly.  (If the skillet handle is plastic, wrap it in a double thickness of foil.)

Bake the omelet in the middle of the oven for 7 minutes, or until it is puffed and almost cooked through.  Spoon the Gruyere and tarragon, and a dash of salt and pepper down the middle of the omelet, and with a spatula fold the omelet in half to enclose the filling.

Bake the omelet in the middle of the oven for 1 minute more, or until the cheese is melted and the omelet is cooked through.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Add greens to dressing and toss gently to coat.  Serve salad topped with warm cheese.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Cooks' Note:  The easiest way to cut goat cheese is with a piece of unflavored dental floss.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- sliced thinly
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  chopped peeled seeded tomato
                        = (or a 28-oz can of tomatoes,
                        drained and chopped)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh basil leaves
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried basil, crumbled)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh thyme leaves
  4                     halibut fillets, 1" thick - (6 oz ea)
                        = (or similar firm-fleshed fish such as
                        cod or haddock)
     1/2           cup  chicken broth -- combined with
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch or arrowroot
  2          teaspoons  tomato paste
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley leaves -- for serving

In a skillet heat the oil over moderate heat until it is hot, add the onion and salt and pepper to taste, and cook the onion, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 7 minutes, or until it is golden.  Add the tomato, garlic, basil, and thyme and cook the mixture until thick, stirring occasionally, about 3 to 5 minutes more.

Spoon half the tomato mixture into an oiled shallow flameproof baking dish just large enough to hold the fish in one layer, arrange the fish fillets on top of the tomato mixture, and sprinkle them with salt and pepper, to taste.  Spoon the remaining tomato mixture over the fish and bake it in a preheated 375 degree oven, covered with foil, until the fish just flakes about 15 minutes.

With a spatula, carefully transfer the fish to a large plate.  Bring the tomato mixture in the baking dish to a simmer over moderate heat, add the broth and cornstarch mixture and the tomato paste, and simmer the sauce, stirring, until it is thickened.  Let it cool.  Carefully transfer the fish and its sauce to a flat freezer container with a tight-fitting lid, arranging the fish in a single layer.  Freeze the fish for up to one month.

To reheat:  Defrost the fish, covered, in the refrigerator.  Transfer the fish to a baking dish and bake the fish, covered with foil, in a preheated 375 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it is heated through.  Correct the seasoning, adding salt and pepper, to taste, and sprinkle the baked halibut with the minced parsley before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  finely-chopped onion
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  dried hot red pepper flakes -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  dried basil -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  fresh shiitakes -- stems discarded,
                        and the caps sliced
  8             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  milk
  2               cans  Italian whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz ea) -- drained well,
                        and chopped
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced prosciutto -- cut into strips
     1/4         pound  Italian Fontina -- grated (abt 1 cup)
     1/4         pound  Gorgonzola -- crumbled (abt 1 cup)
  1 1/2           cups  freshly-grated Parmesan
     2/3           cup  minced fresh parsley leaves
  1              pound  penne (quill-shaped pasta) or
                        farfalle (large bow-tie-shaped pasta)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large skillet, cook the onion, the garlic, the red pepper flakes, the basil, and the oregano in the oil over moderately-low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened.  Add the mushrooms, cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender.

In a saucepan, melt 6 tablespoons of the butter over moderately-low heat, whisk in the flour, and cook the roux, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the milk in a stream, whisking, and simmer the mixture, whisking, for 2 minutes, or until it is thickened.

Pour the sauce over the mushroom mixture and add the tomatoes, prosciutto, Fontina, Gorgonzola, 1 1/4 cups of the Parmesan, and parsley.

In a kettle of boiling salted water, cook the pasta for 5 minutes (the pasta will not be tender) and drain it well.  Add the pasta and salt and pepper, to taste, to the mushroom mixture, toss the mixture until it is combined well, and transfer it to a buttered 3- to 4-quart baking dish.  The pasta may be prepared up to this point and kept covered and chilled overnight.  Bring the pasta to room temperature before continuing with the recipe.

Sprinkle the pasta with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan, dot it with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, cut into bits, and bake it in the middle of a preheated 450 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top is golden and the pasta is tender.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                        = (1 large egg beaten with 1 tspn water
                        and a pinch of salt)
                        === SERVING SUGGESTION ===
                        Mixed baby greens salad with red and
                        yellow pear tomatoes

* Note:  You can substitute 1/2 cup cream and 2 cups stock, if desired.

Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet, set over moderate heat until hot.  Add the onion, carrot, garlic, salt, and pepper and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, or until softened.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Add the wine and reduce 1 minute.  Add the broth, thyme, and rosemary, and simmer, covered, 10 minutes.

Meanwhile combine cornstarch/arrowroot with the liquid.  Add to simmering mixture and stir until thickened.  Off the heat, fold in the meat/chicken, peas, corn, and parsley.  Correct seasoning, adding more salt and pepper, to taste.  Let cool.  Filling can be made one day ahead, covered and chilled.  Divide the mixture between 5 (1 1/2-cup) individual baking dishes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface roll out the puff pastry 1/4-inch thick and cut it into 6-inch rounds.  Lightly brush the tops of the rounds with some of the egg wash, being careful to not brush the edges or the pastry will not puff.  Invert the rounds onto the baking dishes, pressing edges onto rims to secure.  Brush tops of pastry with additional egg wash.  Cut 3 small steam vents in the tops of the pastries.

Arrange baking dishes on a baking sheet and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until pastry is puffed and golden and filling is bubbling.

Serve with mixed baby greens salad with red and yellow pear tomatoes.

This recipe yields 4 to 5 servings.

                        into 1/8"-thick slices
  2              large  shallots -- thinly sliced

  2             medium  escarole heads - (or 1 1/2 large heads) -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/2" pieces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     garlic clove
  1              piece  peeled fresh gingerroot - (1 1/2")
  6        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3             pounds  boneless lamb shoulder -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" pieces
  1                     cinnamon stick - (3" long)
  7                     whole cloves
  1                     bay leaf
  3                     onions -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  ground coriander seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1                cup  chopped drained canned tomatoes
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/4         pounds  fresh spinach -- washed well,
                        drained, coarse stems discarded
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  pine nuts -- toasted lightly

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a blender, puree the garlic and the gingerroot with 1/3 cup water.

In a heavy kettle heat 3 tablespoons of the oil over moderately-high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it brown the lamb, patted dry, in batches, transferring it as it is browned with tongs to a bowl.

To the skillet add the remaining 3 tablespoons oil, heat it until it is hot but not smoking, and in it fry the cinnamon stick, the cloves, and the bay leaf, stirring, for 30 seconds, or until the cloves are puffed slightly.

Add the onions and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden.  Add the garlic puree and cook the mixture, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until the liquid is evaporated.

Add the cumin, the coriander, and the cayenne and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes and the yogurt, simmer the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute, and add the lamb, the salt, and enough water to come half-way up the meat.  Bring the mixture to a boil and braise it, covered, until the lamb is tender, about 1 to 1 1/4 hours.

Remove cinnamon stick, cloves, and bay leaf.  The lamb mixture may be prepared up to this point 2 days in advance.  Let the lamb cool, uncovered, and then chill it, covered.  Reheat the lamb mixture.

In a large saucepan bring 1-inch water to a boil, add the spinach, and steam it, covered, for 2 minutes, or until it is wilted.  Drain the spinach in a colander.

Spoon off any excess fat from the lamb mixture and season with lemon juice, salt, and pepper, to taste.  Distribute the spinach over the stew and stir it in gently.  Transfer the stew to a heated serving dish and sprinkle it with the pine nuts.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

To the skillet add the remaining 3 tablespoons oil, heat it until it is hot but not smoking, and in it fry the cinnamon stick, the cloves, and the bay leaf, stirring, for 30 seconds, or until the cloves are puffed slightly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the onions and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden.  Add the garlic puree and cook the mixture, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until the liquid is evaporated.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the cumin, the coriander, and the cayenne and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes and the yogurt, simmer the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute, and add the lamb, the salt, and enough water to come half-way up the meat.  Bring the mixture to a boil and braise it, covered, until the lamb is tender, about 1 to 1 1/4 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove cinnamon stick, cloves, and bay leaf.  The lamb mixture may be prepared up to this point 2 days in advance.  Let the lamb cool, uncovered, and then chill it, covered.  Reheat the lamb mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large saucepan bring 1-inch water to a boil, add the spinach, and steam it, covered, for 2 minutes, or until it is wilted.  Drain the spinach in a colander.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon off any excess fat from the lamb mixture and season with lemon juice, salt, and pepper, to taste.  Distribute the spinach over the stew and stir it in gently.  Transfer the stew to a heated serving dish and sprinkle it with the pine nuts.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  thin-skinned potatoes, such as yellow
                        finns and yukon golds -- peeled, and
                        cut into 2" chunks if large
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt -- divided
     3/4           cup  buttermilk -- warmed (not hot)
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the potatoes and 1 teaspoon of the salt in a medium saucepan, add enough water to cover, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to moderate and simmer until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes.  Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.

Return the potatoes to the pan and set over low heat, uncovered, for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, to let the potatoes dry out a little (too much moisture will dilute their flavor).  For the smoothest potatoes, pass them through a food mill.  For a slightly coarser puree, mash with a potato masher or fork or use a hand mixer.

Beat the buttermilk into the potatoes with a wooden spoon until thoroughly incorporated.  If you prefer even creamier potatoes, add a little of the reserved cooking liquid.  Beat in the butter, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and plenty of pepper.

Serve at once, or keep the potatoes warm, covered, in a double boiler over hot water for up to 1 hour.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 18    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Hors d'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9             slices  homemade-style white bread
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  half-and-half
     1/2           cup  grated sharp Cheddar -- plus more
                        for garnish
     1/2           cup  finely-diced smoked ham
  2          teaspoons  Dijon-style mustard
                        Cayenne -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped drained mango chutney - (to 1/3)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

With a rolling pin flatten each slice of bread and with a 2 1/4-inch round cookie cutter stamp out 2 rounds from each slice.  With the rolling pin flatten the rounds, brush them with butter, and fit them into 36 buttered 1/8-cup gem tins.  Brush the bread with the melted butter and bake the shells in the oven for 6 minutes, or until they are pale golden.  Cool the shells in the tins on cooling racks for 5 minutes, then remove the shells from the tins, and let them cool completely on the racks.

Make the Filling:  In a saucepan melt the butter over moderate heat, add the flour, and cook the mixture over moderately-low heat, whisking, for 2 minutes.  Add the half-and-half in a stream, bring the mixture to a boil, whisking, and simmer the mixture over moderately-low heat, whisking for 3 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat, add the Cheddar, ham, and mustard, and season with cayenne and salt, to taste, and stir the mixture until it is combined well.

Spoon 1/4 teaspoon of the chutney into each shell and top the chutney with a rounded teaspoon of the cheese mixture.  Arrange the filled shells on a jellyroll pan and freeze them for about 30 minutes or until the filling is just firms to the touch.  Transfer the shells to reseal-able freezer bags, arranging them in 1 layer.  Seal the bags, pressing out the air, and freeze the bites for up to 1 month.

To reheat:  Arrange the shells on a baking sheet and sprinkle them with the additional Cheddar.  Bake the bites in a preheated 375 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the filling is heated through.  Run the bites under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the tops are golden.

This recipe yields 18 hors d'oeuvres.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     chicken - (3 to 4 lbs) -- cut 8 pieces, and
                        backbone removed
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/2           cup  heavy cream or half-and-half
                        Fresh lemon juice
                        === BUTTERMILK DUMPLINGS ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  minced parsley or dill
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into bits

Melt the butter in a large, heavy casserole, add the onion, chopped celery, and chopped carrot, and cook the vegetables, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Add the wine and reduce 1 minute.  Add the chicken stock, rosemary, bay leaf, salt, and pepper, to taste.  Add the chicken to the pot and bring liquid to a boil.

Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer, skimming and stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes.

Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a cutting board.  When cool enough to handle, remove meat from bones.  Cut chicken into bite-size pieces.  Skim surface of cooking liquid and strain it through a sieve into a large saucepan.  Add the diced vegetables, bring to a boil and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes, or until vegetables are tender.

In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and the cream.  Add the cream mixture to the boiling stock, stirring, and simmer until lightly thickened.

Cover, reduce heat to moderate and simmer until dumplings are firm to the touch and cooked through, about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle with chives or parsley.

Buttermilk Dumplings:  Into a bowl, sift the flour, baking soda, and salt.  Add parsley, the pepper, and the butter and blend until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir in just enough buttermilk to form a soft dough.

Gently pat the dough into a 1/2-inch thickness and stamp or cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16                    chicken wings
     1/2           cup  seasoned flour
  2              large  eggs -- beaten lightly with
  4        tablespoons  milk
  2               cups  fine fresh bread crumbs
  6        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter

Cut off the tips of the chicken wings, reserving them for making stock if desired, and halve the wings at the joints.  With a small knife, scrape the meat down the bones as far as possible to make plump "drumstick" and remove the thinner bone from the pieces with 2 bones.  Arrange the drumsticks on a large plate and chill them for 1 hour.

Dredge the drumsticks in flour, shaking off the excess, dip them in the egg mixture, letting the excess drip off, and roll them lightly in the crumbs, and shaking off the excess.  Arrange the drumsticks 3 inches apart on buttered jellyroll pans and chill them for an hour.  Drizzle the drumsticks with the butter and bake them in a preheated moderately-hot oven (375 degrees) for 35 to 40 minutes, or until they are golden brown.

The drumsticks may be made up to 1 day ahead, cooled, and chilled, covered.  Reheat the drumsticks in a preheated moderate oven (350 degrees) for 20 minutes or until they are hot.

Transfer the drumsticks to a napkin-lined basket.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- softened
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2              large  eggs -- whites only
  5        tablespoons  cake flour -- sifted
  2             ounces  semisweet chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a bowl with a whisk, cream together the butter and sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy.  Add the egg whites and beat for 5 to 10 seconds, or until it is smooth but not frothy.  Add the flour and fold it in gently.  Drop level teaspoons of the batter 4 inches apart onto a baking sheet lined with a silpat or parchment paper.  With a small offset metal spatula spread them carefully into 4- by 2-inch ovals.

Bake the cookies on the middle rack of the preheated oven until golden brown on the edges, about 7 to 8 minutes.  Loosen the cookies from the sheet with a metal spatula, and, working quickly roll each cookie lengthwise around the handle of a chopstick to form a thin cylinder, transferring them as they are rolled onto a rack to cool.  If the cookies become too hard to roll, return them to a 200 degree oven for a few minutes to soften.

In a small bowl melt 2 ounces of semisweet chocolate over a double boiler or in a microwave, stirring often.  Dip 1 end of each cookie into the chocolate and transfer the cookies to a rack to cool.

This recipe yields 30 cookies.

                  Easy Zucchini, Tomato, And Cheese Tart

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Jeanne Lemlin
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry
                        = (half of a 17-oz package)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2             medium  zucchini -- quartered
                        lengthwise, and thinly sliced
  1                can  ready-cut diced tomatoes - (14 oz) -- well drained
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  grated smoked Gouda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper, as needed

Remove the puff pastry from the package and let thaw at room temperature for about 30 minutes, or until no longer frozen but still cool.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion and garlic, and cook 5 minutes, or until the onion is slightly tender.  Stir in the zucchini and saute just until it begins to soften, about 5 minutes.  Mix in the drained tomatoes and raise the heat to medium-high.  Cook, stirring often, until the zucchini is tender but not mushy and the juices have evaporated.  Let cool.

Lightly butter a dark-colored 9-inch tart pan with a removable rim or a glass pie plate.  On a lightly floured surface, roll the puff pastry into an 11-inch square.  Fit it into the tart pan or pie plate.  Trim off the overhanging pieces of pastry with scissors.  Refrigerate the crust, uncovered, for 15 minutes, or up to 8 hours, covered.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Beat the eggs in a large bowl.  Stir in the cheese, salt, a generous seasoning of pepper, and cooled vegetables.  Spoon the mixture into the tart pan.  Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until the pastry is brown and a knife inserted in the center of the tart comes out clean.

Remove the outer rim of the tart pan.  Let the tart cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes before slicing.  It is best to serve this tart very warm rather than piping hot.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 main-course servings.

     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  reduced-sodium soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil - (to 2)
  20                    wonton wrappers -- covered loosely
                        with a damp paper towel to prevent drying
  10                    shrimps -- cooked, minced
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  lite soy sauce
     1/3           cup  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil - (to 2)
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes

In a wok or skillet, stir-fry the ginger and garlic in 2 tablespoons of oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add scallions, carrots, and red pepper and stir-fry over high heat for 2 minutes.

In a bowl, combine the chicken broth, soy sauce, and sugar.  Add the Napa cabbage and broth mixture.  Bring to a boil and simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft.  Add sesame oil, cool for at least 15 minutes, and strain.  Fold in the minced shrimp.

Fill and roll the egg roll wrappers, using 1 tablespoon of filling for each roll.  Working with 1 wonton wrapper at a time, place the wrapper with one corner of the diamond closest to you.  Place 1 teaspoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper.  Roll the corner closest to you over the filling.  Brush the top corner with water.  Fold in the sides of the wonton and continue rolling the egg roll up until it is closed.  Press to seal, set aside, and continue with the remaining ingredients.

In a skillet set over moderately-high heat, heat the remaining oil and saute the egg rolls until golden brown on all sides, using tongs to turn them.  Serve when cool enough to eat, with Dipping Sauce.

Dipping Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in a bowl.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

              Fried Eggs Over Warm Lentil Salad With Lardons

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Salads/Dressings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  lentils
                        = (preferably French green lentils)
  6             ounces  thick-cut bacon -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/4"-thick strips
  2                     leeks/ white and pale green parts only -- finely chopped
  2                     celery ribs -- finely chopped
  1              large  carrot -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh tarragon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  8              large  eggs
  1                cup  baby spinach leaves

Cover lentils with cold water by 2 inches in a saucepan, then simmer, uncovered, until just tender, about 20 minutes.

While lentils are simmering, cook bacon in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp, then transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, leaving fat in skillet.  Add leeks, celery, and carrot to skillet and cook, stirring, until just tender.  Add vinegar and boil until most of liquid is evaporated.  Remove skillet from heat and stir in tarragon, half of bacon, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Transfer to a bowl and keep warm, covered, reserving skillet.

Drain lentils well in a large sieve.  Stir into vegetable mixture and season with salt and pepper.  Keep warm, covered.

Wipe skillet with paper towels, then add oil and heat over moderate heat until hot but not smoking.  Fry eggs in batches until whites are just set but yolks are still runny and season with salt and pepper.

Divide lentil salad among 4 plates.  Top with spinach, eggs, and remaining bacon.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Caution:  Serving eggs with runny, not fully-cooked, yolks may be of concern if salmonella is a problem in your area.

</DirT>
<DirT>
While lentils are simmering, cook bacon in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp, then transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, leaving fat in skillet.  Add leeks, celery, and carrot to skillet and cook, stirring, until just tender.  Add vinegar and boil until most of liquid is evaporated.  Remove skillet from heat and stir in tarragon, half of bacon, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Transfer to a bowl and keep warm, covered, reserving skillet.

<DirT>
Drain lentils well in a large sieve.  Stir into vegetable mixture and season with salt and pepper.  Keep warm, covered.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wipe skillet with paper towels, then add oil and heat over moderate heat until hot but not smoking.  Fry eggs in batches until whites are just set but yolks are still runny and season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide lentil salad among 4 plates.  Top with spinach, eggs, and remaining bacon.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Caution:  Serving eggs with runny, not fully-cooked, yolks may be of concern if salmonella is a problem in your area.

          Grilled Sweet Potato Salad With Chile-Lime Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  medium-size sweet potatoes -- peeled
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               ears  corn -- husked
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  2                     scallions -- chopped
     1/2           cup  fresh cilantro leaves -- chopped
                        === CHILE-LIME VINAIGRETTE ===
  6        tablespoons  canola oil
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
  1           teaspoon  chipotle in adobo sauce
  1           teaspoon  chile flakes
  1           teaspoon  toasted ground cumin seeds
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  sugar

In a large pot cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inch and simmer, covered, until just tender, about 15 to 30 minutes, depending on size of potatoes.  In a colander drain potatoes and cool to warm.  Cut the potatoes crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices.

Prepare grill.  In a small bowl whisk together the oil, cumin, salt and pepper.  Brush both sides of the potato slices with the oil mixture.  Brush the ears of corn with the remaining oil mixture.  Grill the potato slices for 1 minute per side and transfer to a large bowl.  If necessary, the grilled potato slices can be halved or quartered into bite-size pieces at this point.

Grill the corn for 3 to 4 minutes rotating once a minute and transfer to a plate.  When the corn is cool enough to handle, remove the kernels with a sharp knife.  Add the corn to the potato slices.  Add the red bell pepper, scallions and 1/4 cup cilantro leaves.

Pour half of the dressing over the vegetables and gently toss to combine.  Add the remaining dressing and carefully stir again.  Cover and let stand for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to combine.  Sprinkle with remaining chopped cilantro.

Chile-Lime Vinaigrette:  Whisk together vinaigrette ingredients.  (Makes approximately 2/3 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === YOGURT SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt
  1                     lemon -- zested
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro
  1              pinch  cayenne
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GREEN PAPAYA SALAD ===
  2              large  garlic cloves -- forced through
                        a garlic press
     1/3           cup  fresh lime juice
  3        tablespoons  Asian fish sauce
                        = (preferably nuoc mam)
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2              small  fresh thin red or green Asian chile -- 1" or 2" long
                        or Serrano chile to taste, seeded, chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  green papaya -- peeled, seeded, and
                        and coarsely shredded in processor - -- (abt 4 cups)
  2                     carrots -- finely shredded
     2/3           cup  cilantro leaves -- washed well,
                        and spun dry
  4        tablespoons  roasted peanuts -- crushed

With a sharp paring knife, make 2 to 3 (1/2-inch deep) diagonal cuts in each piece of chicken, being careful not to cut all the way through.

In a small saute pan set over moderate heat, combine the ginger, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, cardamom pods, and cayenne.  Cook, gently shaking the pan, until you can smell the spices, approximately 1 minute.

Transfer the spices to a spice/coffee grinder and grind the spices finely.

Transfer the chicken pieces to a large resealable plastic bag and add the spice mixture, garlic, and lemon juice and toss to coat thoroughly, making sure the rub penetrates the cuts.  Marinate the chicken in the refrigerator, for at least 5 hours or overnight.

Preheat grill.

Remove chicken pieces from the plastic bag and pat them dry.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Rub the chicken pieces thoroughly with half the shortening.

Grill chicken on an oiled rack 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals or on a gas grill for 7 to 10 minutes per side.  While grilling, brush on the remaining shortening.  When the chicken pieces are cooked through, transfer to a platter.  Let chicken stand while preparing salad.

Yogurt Sauce:  In a sieve, drain the yogurt for 15 minutes.  In a bowl, combine yogurt, lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic, cilantro, cayenne, salt, and pepper, to taste.  (Makes approximately 1/2 cup)

Green Papaya Salad:  In a large bowl, whisk together the pressed garlic, lime juice, fish sauce, and sugar, and blend until the sugar is dissolved.

Add chile, papaya, carrot, and cilantro to the dressing, tossing well.  Salad may be made 2 hours ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring salad to room temperature before serving.  Serve salad sprinkled with peanuts.  (Makes 4 servings)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

With a sharp paring knife, make 2 to 3 (1/2-inch deep) diagonal cuts in each piece of chicken, being careful not to cut all the way through.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small saute pan set over moderate heat, combine the ginger, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, cardamom pods, and cayenne.  Cook, gently shaking the pan, until you can smell the spices, approximately 1 minute.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the spices to a spice/coffee grinder and grind the spices finely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the chicken pieces to a large resealable plastic bag and add the spice mixture, garlic, and lemon juice and toss to coat thoroughly, making sure the rub penetrates the cuts.  Marinate the chicken in the refrigerator, for at least 5 hours or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat grill.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove chicken pieces from the plastic bag and pat them dry.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Rub the chicken pieces thoroughly with half the shortening.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grill chicken on an oiled rack 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals or on a gas grill for 7 to 10 minutes per side.  While grilling, brush on the remaining shortening.  When the chicken pieces are cooked through, transfer to a platter.  Let chicken stand while preparing salad.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Yogurt Sauce:  In a sieve, drain the yogurt for 15 minutes.  In a bowl, combine yogurt, lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic, cilantro, cayenne, salt, and pepper, to taste.  (Makes approximately 1/2 cup)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Green Papaya Salad:  In a large bowl, whisk together the pressed garlic, lime juice, fish sauce, and sugar, and blend until the sugar is dissolved.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add chile, papaya, carrot, and cilantro to the dressing, tossing well.  Salad may be made 2 hours ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring salad to room temperature before serving.  Serve salad sprinkled with peanuts.  (Makes 4 servings)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  ground chuck
  1              piece  Monterey Jack - (abt  oz) -- cut 4 pieces
  4          teaspoons  finely-chopped seeded pickled jalapeÒo
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE GUACAMOLE ===
  1                     avocado, preferably Haas
  2 1/2      teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/3           cup  finely-diced seeded tomato
  3        tablespoons  minced scallion
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro -- or to taste
                        Salt -- to taste

Season the hamburgers with salt and black pepper and grill them on oiled hot grill pan for 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat.

Make the guacamole while the hamburgers are grilling:  Halve, pit, and peel the avocado, in a bowl mash the flesh coarse with a fork, and stir in the lemon juice, tomato, scallion, cumin, cilantro, and salt and pepper, to taste.

Transfer the hamburgers to the buns and top them with the guacamole.

     1/4         pound  white mushrooms -- thinly sliced
  4        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  whole milk -- heated
  1                cup  chicken broth -- heated
     1/4           cup  grated sharp cheddar
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh sage
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme

  6             slices  crumbled cooked bacon slices
                        Chopped fresh chives -- for garnish

  2              small  onions -- halved lengthwise,
                        and thinly sliced

  1 1/2           cups  shredded whole-milk mozzarella
  8                     drained bottled pepperoncini -- chopped

     1/2      teaspoon  oregano -- crumbled
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  red wine vinegar

Cut each piece of bread horizontally with a serrated knife without slicing all the way through, remove some of the soft inner white bread, and arrange the bread pieces cut-sides up in a jelly-roll pan.  Spread the bread with the olive paste.  Spread the antipasto mixture on both sides of each piece of bread and bake the heros in preheated oven for 5 minutes.  Season the heros with salt and pepper and re-form them, pressing the 2 sides together.

     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2                     garlic cloves -- pressed or minced

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  blanched almonds -- coarsely chopped
  3              large  egg whites -- room temperature
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4          teaspoons  vanilla
  3               cups  confectioners' sugar - (to 4)
                        === MARZIPAN FRUITS ===
  1              pound  marzipan paste -- room temperature
                        Food coloring -- for decorating
                        Cloves -- for decorating

In an electric coffee grinder, grind the blanched almonds in small batches into a fine powder.  Sift the powder through a fine sieve into a large bowl.  Regrind any almond particles remaining in the sifter.

In a bowl whisk the egg whites with the salt until they are frothy, whisk the vanilla, and stir the mixture into the almond powder.  Sift in 3 cups of confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, kneading the mixture together in the bowl, and sift enough of the remaining 1 cup sugar to form a smooth, pliable dough (add more sugar if the dough is too sticky).  Quarter the dough and wrap each piece tightly in foil.  The marzipan paste keeps, chilled, in an airtight container for up to 8 weeks.

Marzipan Fruits:  Work with 1 piece of marzipan at a time, keeping the remaining marzipan covered tightly.  Pull off a piece of marzipan paste, form it into a smooth ball by rolling it between the palms, and shape it gently into the desired shape.  (Wipe hands occasionally with a damp cloth.)

To achieve the texture of citrus fruit roll the marzipan shape over a fine grater or sieve.  A small wire loop may be pressed into the back of the thickest part of the marzipan if the marzipan is for hanging.

Let the marzipan dry on sheets of foil overnight and with a large soft watercolor brush dipped in the food coloring, tint it as desired.  If a shading effect is desired add the second coat of coloring before the first coat dries.

Let the marzipan dry on foil for 2 days and with a fine soft water color brush dipped in the food coloring add any fine details desired.  Wooden picks, broken into small pieces and colored with food coloring, may be used to form the stems of fruits.  Cloves may be used to form the blossom end of fruits such as apples and pears.  White paper may be cut and colored with food coloring to form the leaves for fruits, or any small leaves may be used.

After the marzipan has had its final coat of food coloring let it dry on sheets of foil for1 day.  The marzipan keeps, chilled, in an airtight container for up to 8 weeks.  (Makes 25 small marzipan shapes)

This recipe yields 1 1/4 pounds.

In a bowl whisk the egg whites with the salt until they are frothy, whisk the vanilla, and stir the mixture into the almond powder.  Sift in 3 cups of confectioners&apos; sugar, 1 cup at a time, kneading the mixture together in the bowl, and sift enough of the remaining 1 cup sugar to form a smooth, pliable dough (add more sugar if the dough is too sticky).  Quarter the dough and wrap each piece tightly in foil.  The marzipan paste keeps, chilled, in an airtight container for up to 8 weeks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  4                     egg whites
     1/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        === CREME GANACHE ===
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate
     2/3           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  orange liqueur

In a heavy saucepan combine sugar and water.  Bring the liquid to a boil over low heat, swirling the syrup and washing down any sugar crystals clinging to the sides of the pan with a brush dipped in cold water.  Boil the syrup until it reaches the softball stage, or until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees.

While the syrup is cooking, in the bowl of an electric mixer, beat egg whites until they are foamy.  Add cream of tartar and a pinch of salt and beat the whites for 30 seconds.  Sprinkle in sugar and beat the whites until they hold stiff peaks.  Add the syrup in a stream, beating, and beat the meringue for 10 minutes, or until it is cool.

Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 1/3-inch plain tip with the meringue and pipe out 66 mounds, each about 1-inch in diameter, onto a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper to make mushroom caps.  Hold the pastry bag straight up and pipe out 66 cones on to the baking sheet to make mushroom stems.

Bake the meringues in a preheated very slow oven (200 degrees) for 1 hour.  Remove the baking sheet from the oven and push in the undersides of the mushroom caps.  Return the meringues to the oven and bake them for 30 minutes more.  After the 30 minutes, turn off the heat and let the meringues stand in the oven for 2 hours more.

Fill a pastry bag fitted with a small star tip with a creme ganache and pipe the cream into the undersides of the caps to simulate gills.  Push a stem into each cap, stand the mushrooms upright on their stems in a shallow dish, and set them aside until the Creme Ganache is firm.  Store the mushrooms covered.

Creme Ganache:  In the top of a double boiler set over hot water, melt the chocolate with the heavy cream and orange flavored liqueur, stirring until the mixture is smooth.  Transfer the mixture into a metal bowl and refrigerate, let it cool stirring occasionally for about 30 minutes.  When ready to use, whip the chocolate just until it holds soft peaks.  (Makes 2 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 66 confections.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small red boiling potatoes
  4        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2             pounds  mussels, preferably cultivated -- cleaned, and
                        beards removed
     1/2         pound  baby spinach -- trimmed

Simmer potatoes in enough salted water to cover by 1-inch until just tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain and rinse under cold water until cool enough to handle.  Pat dry and halve (quarter larger potatoes).

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large heavy skillet over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking, then saute potatoes with salt, to taste, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 10 minutes.

While potatoes are sauteing, cook garlic in remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a 5 to 6-quart pot over moderately-high heat, stirring, until fragrant.

Stir in mussels and 1/4 cup water and cook, covered, until mussels are opened, 3 to 5 minutes.  (Discard any unopened ones.)

Add spinach to potatoes, tossing until just wilted.  Serve potatoes and spinach with mussels.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  stone-ground cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/3           cup  lard or vegetable shortening
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk - (to 2) -- see * Note

* Note:  You will need enough to make a batter about the thickness of pancake batter; the amount of buttermilk needed will vary according to the fineness of the cornmeal used, the thickness of the buttermilk and the size of the eggs.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Combine the cornmeal, sugar, salt, and baking soda in a large mixing bowl.  Place the lard in an 8-inch heavy iron skillet, set in oven, and let melt.

Meanwhile, mix the eggs lightly into the combined dry ingredients, then stir in just enough buttermilk to make a batter about the consistency of pancake batter.

Remove skillet from the oven, tilt so that lard greases both the sides and the bottom, and then pour the hot lard into the batter.  Stir briskly just to mix.

Pour batter into the hot skillet and bake in hot oven until firm and lightly browned, about 25 minutes.  Serve oven-hot, directly from skillet.

The way to eat batter bread is to cut it into wedges as you would a cake, then to split each wedge horizontally and tuck in a lump or two of sweet butter while the bread is still hot enough to melt it.

This recipe yields 1 (8-inch) round loaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- divided
     1/4           cup  whole almonds with skins
  4                     boneless chicken breast halves with skin - -- (2 1/4 lbs total)
  1                cup  brine-cured green olives -- pitted, chopped
                        = (such as picholine)
  3        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then toast almonds, stirring often, until a few shades darker, 5 to 8 minutes.  Transfer with a slotted spoon to a cutting board to cool (do not clean skillet).

While almonds are cooking, pat chicken breasts dry, then cut a 2-inch-long horizontal slit in thickest part of each.  Stuff each chicken breast with 1 1/2 teaspoons olives, then season with salt and pepper.

Saute chicken breasts until skins are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.  Turn chicken breasts over and cook, covered, over moderate heat until just cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes more, then transfer with tongs to plates.

While chicken is cooking, chop almonds.

Add remaining tablespoon butter and 3 tablespoons water to skillet and heat, stirring, until butter is melted.  Stir in almonds, parsley, and pepper, to taste.  Spoon sauce over chicken.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              small  green bell pepper -- sliced thin rings

  10                    thin slices pepperoni
                        Fresh basil sprigs -- for garnish

In a non-stick skillet, measuring 10-inches across the bottom heat the oil over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it cook the bell pepper rings for 30 seconds on each side, or until they are crisp-tender, and transfer them with tongs to a plate.

To the skillet add the capellini, distributing it evenly and pressing it lightly with a lid that fits into the pan, touching the pasta directly, and cook it, over moderate heat for 25 minutes, or until the bottom is golden.  Invert an oiled baking sheet over the skillet, invert the capellini crust onto the sheet, and slide it back into the skillet.  Cook the capellini crust, covered, for 10 minutes more.

Spread tomato sauce over the crusty pasta, leaving a 1/2-inch border, and arrange the mozzarella on top.  Arrange the bell pepper rings and the pepperoni on the mozzarella and cook the pizza, covered, over moderate heat for 3 minutes, or until the mozzarella is melted.  Slide the pizza onto a pizza pan or flat platter, garnish it with the basil, and with a pizza wheel or sharp knife cut it into wedges.

  1              pound  milk chocolate -- broken into pieces
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup
  1                cup  strawberry jam
                        Assorted candy and nuts for decoration
                        = (such as thick and thin licorice for
                        the track, nonpareils for the wheels;
                        candy covered chocolate, chocolate
                        cigarettes, candy-coated licorice,
                        jujubes, and slivered almonds for the
                        cargo)
                        Vanilla ice cream -- as a accompaniment

Butter a 13- by 9- by 2-inch cake pan.  Line the bottom with wax or parchment paper, butter the paper, and dust the pans with flour, shaking out the excess.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Into a small bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.  In an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a hand held mixer beat together the sugar, butter, and the peanut butter until the mixture is light, creamy and combined well, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in the sour cream, vanilla, and the water.  Add the flour mixture and mix until just combined.

Transfer batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top.  Rap the pan three times on a hard surface to expel any air bubbles.  Place the cake in the middle rack of oven, bake for 20 minutes, rotate the pan, and continue to bake another 20 minutes or until a tester comes out clean.

Let the cake cool in the pan on a rack for 10 to 15 minutes.  Run a thin knife around the edges of the pans, invert the cake onto the rack, discard the paper, and let it cool completely.  The cake may be made one day in advance and wrapped well.

Make the Frosting:  In a heavy bottom pan slowly heat the heavy cream.  When the cream just comes to a boil pour it onto the chopped chocolate.  Add the corn syrup and mix well with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula.  Let mixture cool for about an hour or until it is firm enough to spread.

Assemble the "train":  Trim the edges off of the cooled cake to make a perfect rectangle about 12 inches long.  Slice the cake in half horizontally into 2 layers.  Spread the jam on the bottom layer and place the remaining layer back on top of the jam.

Cut the cake directly down the middle into halves and cut again into quarters.  At this point, there should be 4 equal pieces of cake.  Continue to take each quarter of the cake and cut into 3 equal rectangles.  You should end up with 12 (2-inch-wide) pieces of cake.  Take 1 piece of the cake and set aside.

Frost each piece of the remaining pieces with the frosting.  Take the reserved piece and cut it in half.  Arrange it on top of one of the other pieces to form an engine car.  Once the cake is frosted, arrange them like a train on a licorice "track" and decorate them with the candy and nuts.  Serve the cake with ice cream.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  1                cup  polenta
                        = (or fine-grained cornmeal)
  1              quart  water

                        === SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  chopped onions
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3               jars  artichoke hearts - (8 to 12 oz ea) -- drained, chopped
  1                cup  chopped pitted Mediterranean olives

  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 oz)
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan -- for sprinkling

Combine polenta, water, and salt in a saucepan.  Place over moderately-high heat and bring to a boil, whisking every so often.  Turn down to a simmer and simmer gently, (partially covered with a lid) for 15 minutes.  Stir in the butter and cheese, and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Meanwhile, make the sauce:  Heat the oil over moderately-low heat, add the onion and cook until softened.  Add the garlic and cook 2 minutes more.  Add all the remaining ingredients and simmer for 10 minutes or until thickened slightly.  Serve over warm soft polenta and sprinkle each portion with some of the cheese.

                        === FOR THE PORK MIXTURE ===
  1                cup  medium diced onion
  1                cup  medium diced green bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2         pounds  lean ground pork
  1                can  tomato sauce - (12 oz)
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1            package  frozen corn - (10 oz) -- thawed
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  yellow cornmeal
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        == FOR THE TOPPING ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  double-acting baking powder
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, cooled
     3/4           cup  milk
  1              large  egg -- beaten lightly
     1/2           cup  grated monterey jack
  1                can  green chile peppers - (4 oz) -- drained, chopped
                        === SERVING SUGGESTION ===
                        Composed salad of red onions, orange
                        segments, and avocado slices

Make the Pork Mixture:  In a large skillet cook the onion and the bell pepper in the oil over moderately-low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened.  Add the pork, and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring and breaking up any lumps, until the pork is no longer pink.

Stir in the tomato sauce and paste, corn, cumin, chili powder, and cornmeal, season with salt and black pepper, to taste, and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.  Spoon the mixture into a shallow 2 1/2-quart casserole.  The mixture may be made 1 day in advance and kept, covered and chilled.

Make the Topping:  Into a bowl sift together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, and baking powder, add the butter, milk, and egg, and stir the batter until it is just combined.  Stir in the monterey jack and the chile peppers and drop the batter by the large spoonfuls around the edge of the casserole.

Bake the potpie in the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven for 10 minutes, reduce the heat to 350 degrees, and bake the potpie for 30 minutes more.  Serve hot, with a composed salad.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Lay chiles on their sides on rack of a gas burner and turn flame on high.  (Or put chiles on rack of broiler pan about 2 inches from heat.)  Roast chiles, turning with tongs, until skins are blackened, 5 to 8 minutes.  Transfer chiles to a bowl and let stand, covered, 15 minutes.

Rub skins off chiles with paper towels and discard stems and seeds (if desired, devein to further reduce heat).  Cut the chiles into 1/4-inch-thick strips.

Bring cream with garlic just to a simmer and remove from heat.  Peel potatoes and cut crosswise into 1/16-inch-thick slices using mandoline.

Arrange one-third of potatoes evenly in bottom of a well-buttered 1 1/2-quart shallow baking dish, overlapping them slightly, and sprinkle with salt, to taste, and 1/2 of chiles.  Repeat, ending with a layer of potatoes.

Remove garlic from cream and pour cream over potatoes.  Cover dish with foil and bake in lower third of oven 45 minutes.  Remove foil and bake, basting the top occasionally, until gratin is golden brown on top and bubbling, about 30 minutes more.  Cool slightly before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cooks' Note:  Gratin can be baked 1 day ahead, then cooled completely before being chilled, covered.  Bring to room temperature before reheating, covered, in a preheated 350 degree oven.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     baking potatoes, like russets - -- (abt 1/2 lb ea)
  1              pound  spinach -- coarse stems
                        discarded and the leaves washed well
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/4           cups  coarsely-grated smoked cheese
                        = (such as smoked Gouda or
                        smoked mozzarella)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Scrub the potatoes, pat them dry.  Prick the potatoes a few times with a fork and bake them in the middle of oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour.

While the potatoes are baking, in a heavy saucepan cook the spinach in the water clinging to the leaves, covered, over moderately-high heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, or until it is wilted.  Drain the spinach in a colander set over a bowl, reserving the cooking liquid, and chop it coarse.

In a bowl, combine the spinach and the butter.  While the potatoes are warm, halve them lengthwise, scoop them out, leaving the shells as thin as possible, and chop the scooped-out potato coarsely.

Add the chopped potato to the bowl with the spinach, combining the mixture well.  Add the lemon juice and stir in 1 cup of the cheese and 1 tablespoon of the reserved cooking liquid, or enough to reach a smooth consistency.

Season the mixture with salt and pepper, divide it among the potato shells, and top it with the remaining 1/4 cup cheese.

Bake the potatoes in a baking dish in the middle of a preheated 425 degree oven for 10 minutes, or until they are heated through.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground chili
  1                can  pinto beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
     1/2           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro -- frozen with

  2               cups  cooked chicken

  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     lamb chops, 1 1/4" thk - (12 to 14 oz ea) -- frenched, if desired
  8              large  shallots
  8                     plum tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  drained Nicoise olives
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley - (to 3)

Mince garlic and mash with salt.  In a small bowl stir together garlic paste, rosemary, pepper, and 2 tablespoons oil.  Pat lamb chops dry.  Reserve 1 tablespoon rosemary for sauce and rub remainder evenly onto chops.  Lamb chops can be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Chill reserved rosemary, covered.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

While vegetables are roasting, in a 12-inch oven-proof skillet, heat remaining tablespoon oil over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking, and sear chops until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side.

Reduce temperature to 375 degrees.  Put chops in upper third of oven.  Roast vegetables until tender and caramelized, about 20 minutes.  Roast chops 10 to 15 minutes for medium-rare.

When chops are cooked, pour any meat juices from serving dish into skillet and bring jus to a boil.  Cut butter into pieces and add it and the olives to jus.  Swirl skillet to incorporate butter and boil until jus is slightly thickened.  Season jus with salt and pepper and stir in parsley.  Arrange chops on serving dish with tomatoes and shallots.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     small head garlic
  1                     red bell pepper
  4             medium  fennel bulbs - (abt 3 lbs total)
                        = (sometimes called anise)
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  caraway seeds
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Separate garlic cloves, leaving skins intact, and wrap together in foil.  Bake in upper third of oven for 1 hour.

Quarter bell pepper lengthwise and discard stems, seeds, and ribs.  In a shallow baking pan arrange quarters skin-side up.  Roast for 20 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, peel pepper, and transfer to a blender.  Remove garlic from foil and squeeze pulp into blender.

Trim fennel stalks flush with bulbs and discard any tough outer layers.  Cut bulbs lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick slices and, if desired, halve slices lengthwise.  Transfer fennel to a bowl of ice and cold water.  Chill fennel at least 30 minutes, or until crisp, and up to 3 hours.

In a small heavy skillet dry-roast cumin and caraway seeds over moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant and a few shades darker, about 1 minute, being careful not to burn them.  In a cleaned electric coffee grinder grind seeds to a powder and add to pepper mixture with remaining dip ingredients.  Puree mixture until smooth.  Dip may be made 5 days ahead and chilled, covered.

Drain fennel in a colander and pat dry.  Serve dip with fennel.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Categories    : Desserts                        Puddings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
     1/4           cup  dark rum
  2 3/4           cups  whole milk
  1                cup  long-grain white rice
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1 1/2           cups  half-and-half -- divided
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  3              large  egg yolks -- lightly beaten
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract

In small non-stick saucepan, combine the raisins and rum and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Remove the pan from the heat and let steep while you make the pudding.

In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the milk, rice, brown sugar, granulated sugar, butter, salt, cinnamon, 1 cup of the half-and-half.  Cook over medium heat until the milk mixture comes to a gentle boil.  Stir the mixture, cover the pan, and reduce the heat to low.  Cook for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and much of the liquid is absorbed.

In a small bowl, place the cornstarch.  Gradually whisk in the remaining 1/2 cup half-and-half until smooth.  Whisk in the egg yolks.  Whisk about 1/2 cup of the hot rice mixture into the yolk mixture.  Return this mixture to the pudding in the saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture just starts to bubble.  Continue to cook, stirring, for 1 minute, or until the mixture thickens slightly.  Remove the pan from the heat.

Add the vanilla to the rum-raisin mixture, and stir the mixture into the rice pudding.  Divide the pudding among 6 sundae glasses, cover with plastic wrap (unless you want a skin to form), pressing it directly onto the surface of the pudding, and refrigerate for about 2 hours, or until well chilled.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  coarse sea salt
  1         tablespoon  Szechwan peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  pink peppercorns
  1                     bag frozen edamame - (1 lb)
                        = (soybeans in the pod)

Toast salt in a dry, small, heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until the salt turns light tan, about 7 minutes.  Transfer salt to a bowl.

Toast Szechwan peppercorns in skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.  Transfer toasted peppercorns to a sheet of waxed paper to cool.  Using paper as a funnel, pour toasted peppercorns into an electric coffee/spice grinder or a mortar.  Add pink peppercorns and pulse or pound with a pestle until finely ground.  Pour through a coarse sieve into bowl of salt and stir together.

Cook edamame in salted boiling water until tender, about 4 minutes, and immediately transfer with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking.  Drain in a colander and pat dry.

Toss edamame with some peppered salt, to taste, and serve with remainder on the side.

This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings.

Cooks' Notes:  Peppered salt may be made 1 week ahead and kept in an airtight container at cool room temperature.  Edamame may be cooked 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring to room temperature before tossing with peppered salt.

                         Simple Mushroom Risotto

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  chicken stock - (to 8)
  5             ounces  dried mushrooms
                        = (porcini or other wild dried mushrooms)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     shallots -- minced
  2               cups  arborio rice
     1/2           cup  white vermouth
     2/3           cup  grated Parmesan -- plus extra
                        for serving
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the stock and ladle 2 cups into a medium bowl.  Add dried mushrooms and let soak for 20 minutes, then drain, reserving the liquid.  Pour liquid through a fine sieve lined with cheesecloth or paper towels to catch any grit.  Add mushroom liquid back to warm stock.  Keep stock heated over medium heat.  Pat soaked mushrooms dry and saute in a large skillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil.

Heat remaining olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Add shallots and cook until softened.  Add rice and cook, stirring, until the rice becomes translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Add vermouth and stir until absorbed by rice.

Add warm mushroom stock to rice, 1 cup at a time, stirring constantly.  All stock must be fully absorbed before the next cup of stock is added.  After about 20 minutes, the rice should be tender but not mushy, it should have a creamy texture.  Add more stock if needed.

Fold in sauteed mushrooms, Parmesan, and season with salt and pepper.  Let stand for a minute before serving.  Sprinkle with Parmesan, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Heat the stock and ladle 2 cups into a medium bowl.  Add dried mushrooms and let soak for 20 minutes, then drain, reserving the liquid.  Pour liquid through a fine sieve lined with cheesecloth or paper towels to catch any grit.  Add mushroom liquid back to warm stock.  Keep stock heated over medium heat.  Pat soaked mushrooms dry and saute in a large skillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat remaining olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Add shallots and cook until softened.  Add rice and cook, stirring, until the rice becomes translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Add vermouth and stir until absorbed by rice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add warm mushroom stock to rice, 1 cup at a time, stirring constantly.  All stock must be fully absorbed before the next cup of stock is added.  After about 20 minutes, the rice should be tender but not mushy, it should have a creamy texture.  Add more stock if needed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fold in sauteed mushrooms, Parmesan, and season with salt and pepper.  Let stand for a minute before serving.  Sprinkle with Parmesan, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                    Skirt Steak With Cipollini Onions

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Lora Brody
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  3             pounds  skirt steak -- each piece cut
                        into thirds
  3        tablespoons  olive oil - (to 4)
  2               cups  low-sodium beef broth
  1                cup  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1 1/3         pounds  cipollinis -- trimmed, peeled,
                        and left whole
  2        tablespoons  green peppercorns -- rinse well if
                        packed in brine
     3/4           cup  firm spicy green olives -- pitted, and
                        coarsely chopped
                        === SERVING SUGGESTIONS ===
                        Fusilli tossed with butter and parsley
                        Steamed broccoli

Place the flour in a shallow bowl and coat the meat on all sides, knocking off any excess flour.  Set aside.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large saute pan set over high heat.  Brown the meat a few pieces at a time.  Be careful not to crowd the pan or the meat will steam, not brown.  Add more oil to the pan as necessary.

Transfer the browned meat to the insert of the slow cooker.  Add the broth and red wine to the saute pan and bring to a boil over high heat, using a wooden spoon to scrape any browned bits of meat clinging to the pan.  Cook until the liquids have reduced by half.  Pour the broth and wine mixture over the meat into the insert, and then add the vinegar, soy sauce, tomato paste, onions, and peppercorns.

Cover and cook on Low for 7 hours or on High for 3 1/2 hours, until the meat is extremely tender when pierced with a fork.  Add the olives, and cook for another 20 minutes.  Serve with fusilli tossed with butter and parsley and steamed broccoli.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cook's Note:  To peel small onions easily, plunge them into boiling water for 10 to 15 seconds.  Transfer them with a slotted spoon to a bowl of cold water.  The skins will slip right off when loosened with a small, sharp knife.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10                    plum shaped tomatoes - (to 12) -- halved, seeded
  6        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
                        === ANCHO CHILE ESSENCE ===
  3                     dried ancho chiles - (1 1/2 to 2 oz)
                        === SMOKY TEA ESSENCE ===
     1/2           cup  loose Lapsang Souchong tea - (1 1/2 oz)
                        = (or 20 tea bags)
                        === WILD MUSHROOM ESSENCE ===
  1              ounce  dried wild mushrooms - (abt 1/3 cup)
                        = (such as porcinis or morels)

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.

Cut the tomatoes in 1/2 and place them, cut-side down, on a baker's rack set in a roasting pan Drizzle the tomato halves with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and roast for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the tomatoes are roasted to a dark red.  The excess moisture will have evaporated, and the remaining tomatoes will have a delicious concentrated flavor and aroma.

Cut the roasted tomato halves into quarters.  Serve hot; toss with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of vinegar, or the attached essences, and serve.

For the Ancho Chile Essence:  Break the chiles apart.  Remove the stems and seeds.  If the chiles are still pliable, dry them in a warm oven (200 degrees) for about 1 hour, until they are very brittle.

Transfer the chiles to a blender or spice grinder.  Blend at high speed for at least 1 minute, until you have the finest-possible powder.  Let the mixture settle for about 30 seconds before removing the cover, so the powder does not fly into the air.  Use a dry pastry brush to push the powder through a strainer into a clean, dry container.  Blend and strain the larger bits again.

Store in a tightly sealed jar away from light for up to 3 months.  (Makes 1/3 cup; recipe courtesy Sally Schneider)

For the Smoky Tea Essence:  If you are using tea bags, cut them open.  Empty the tea into a blender or spice grinder.  Blend the tea for at least 1 minute at high speed, until you have the finest-possible powder.  Let the mixture settle for about 30 seconds before removing the cover, so the powder does not fly into the air.  Use a dry pastry brush to push the powder through a strainer into a clean, dry container.  Blend and strain the larger bits again.

Store in a tightly sealed jar away from light for up to 3 months.  (Makes 1/3 cup; recipe courtesy Sally Schneider)

For the Wild Mushroom Essence:  Break the mushrooms into 1/2-inch pieces and place in a blender or spice grinder.  Blend for at least 1 minute at high speed, until you have the finest-possible powder.  Let the mixture settle for about 30 seconds before removing the cover, so the powder does not fly into the air.  Use a dry pastry brush to push the powder through a strainer into a clean, dry container.  Blend and strain the larger bits again.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  long-grain rice
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     cinnamon stick - (3" long)
  7                     whole cloves
  5                     cardamom pods -- if desired
  2 1/2           cups  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  crumbled saffron threads
  2        tablespoons  milk

In a large bowl wash rice in several changes of cold water until the water runs clear and drain it in a fine sieve.

In a large heavy saucepan heat the oil over moderately-high heat until it is hot but not smoking, add the cinnamon stick, the cloves, and the cardamom pods, if using, and fry the spices, stirring, for 30 seconds, or until the cloves are puffed slightly.  Add rice and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute, or until the rice is opaque.  Add 2 1/4 cups water and the salt, bring the mixture to a boil, and cook the rice, covered, over low heat for 15 minutes.

Add milk, heat the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it is hot, and remove the pan from the heat.  Drizzle the saffron mixture over the rice and continue to cook the rice, covered, for 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and let the rice stand, covered, for 5 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced scallion
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice-wine vinegar
                        = (available at Asian markets)
  1              piece  peeled fresh gingerroot - (1 1/2") -- cut into very
                        fine julienne strips
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  Asian sesame oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil -- for drizzling fish
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced, and mashed
                        to a paste with a pinch of salt

In a bowl, whisk together the scallions, soy sauce, vinegar, gingerroot, vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil, sugar, garlic paste, and red pepper flakes.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  In a shallow dish, arrange the halibut fillets in 1 layer, pour the soy sauce mixture over them, and let the fish marinate, covered and chilled, for 30 minutes.

Arrange a steamer or baking rack in a wide deep kettle and add water to the kettle to reach just below the steamer rack.  Put a plate, such as a glass pie plate, at least 1-inch smaller in diameter than the steamer on the rack and place the fish on top.  Bring the water to a boil.  Pour the marinade over the fish.

Steam the fish, covered, over the boiling water until it just flakes, about 12 minutes, and with oven mitts, remove the steamer from the wok.  Transfer the fillets carefully to a heated platter and drizzle them with the remaining 1 teaspoon sesame oil and the sauce remaining on the plate.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

           Szechwan Pepper-Crusted Steak Smothered With Onions

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Sally Schneider
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === "FRIED" ONIONS ===
  1 1/2         pounds  Vidalia or Bermuda onions -- peeled
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
     3/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar - (to 2)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SZECHWAN PEPPER RUB ===
  1           teaspoon  Szechwan peppercorns
     1/2      teaspoon  white peppercorns
     1/2      teaspoon  black peppercorns
     1/4      teaspoon  allspice berries
                        === FOR THE STEAK ===
  1 1/4         pounds  beef skirt, hanger, or strip steak -- trimmed of all fat
                        = (or buffalo sirloin or shell steak)
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated ginger - (scant)

To make the onions, slice the onions in half through the stem.  With a mandoline or vegetable slicer or a thin sharp knife, cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch slices.  (You should have about 6 cups.)

In a large nonstick skillet, melt the butter over moderately-low heat.  Add the onions, sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and toss to coat.  Cover and cook until the onions have released their liquid, about 13 minutes.

Uncover the pan, increase the heat to moderate, and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.  Sprinkle the onions with the sugar and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until they are golden brown and caramelized, about 10 minutes longer.  Sprinkle with the balsamic vinegar and toss until the vinegar has evaporated.  Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and season generously with pepper.  Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.

Meanwhile, prepare the Szechwan Pepper Rub:  In a small heavy skillet, toast the peppercorns and allspice over moderate heat, shaking the pan occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to a blender or spice grinder and grind to a fine powder.  Strain the spices into a small bowl and return the coarse bits to the blender.  Blend again and strain.

Pat the steaks dry with paper towels; rub lightly with a little of the oil.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and massage the ginger into the steak; then rub the pepper rub over them.

Heat a grill pan or heavy nonstick skillet over high heat.  Lightly oil the grill pan, if using, or swirl the remaining oil in a nonstick skillet.  Add the steaks to the pan and cook until little droplets of blood form on the surface, about 4 minutes.  Turn the steaks over and continue cooking until a droplet or so of blood forms on the top again, another 3 to 4 minutes, for rare.  Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.

With a thin sharp knife, slice the steaks on a slight angle against the grain.  Sprinkle the meat with a little salt and arrange the slices warm diner plates.  Nestle a mound of onions next to the steak.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Transfer to a blender or spice grinder and grind to a fine powder.  Strain the spices into a small bowl and return the coarse bits to the blender.  Blend again and strain.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pat the steaks dry with paper towels; rub lightly with a little of the oil.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and massage the ginger into the steak; then rub the pepper rub over them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a grill pan or heavy nonstick skillet over high heat.  Lightly oil the grill pan, if using, or swirl the remaining oil in a nonstick skillet.  Add the steaks to the pan and cook until little droplets of blood form on the surface, about 4 minutes.  Turn the steaks over and continue cooking until a droplet or so of blood forms on the top again, another 3 to 4 minutes, for rare.  Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With a thin sharp knife, slice the steaks on a slight angle against the grain.  Sprinkle the meat with a little salt and arrange the slices warm diner plates.  Nestle a mound of onions next to the steak.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     onion minced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              pound  ground beef
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
     1/4           cup  bottled chili sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  16                    corn tortillas
                        Vegetable shortening -- for deep frying
  1                     romaine lettuce head -- finely shredded
  1                cup  finely-grated mild cheddar
  1                     tomato -- chopped

In a stainless steel or enameled skillet cook the onion and the garlic in the oil over moderate heat stirring for 5 minutes, or until they are soft.  Stir in the ground round, salt, and chili powder, and saute the mixture over moderately-high heat, stirring until the beef is brown.  Stir in the chili sauce and the cumin and drain the mixture in a fine sieve.  (The beef mixture may be made up to 1 day ahead, cooled, and chilled, covered.  Reheat the mixture in a saucepan over low heat, stirring.)

Halve the tortillas and steam them in batches in a steamer set over boiling water for 1 minute, or until they are pliable.  Bend the tortilla halves into cone shapes and secure them with a toothpick.

Fill a deep fryer with 4 inches of oil and heat to 375 degrees.

Using tongs, hold cone at the tip and gently place into the oil with the opening of the cone facing down.  Fry the cones in small batches for 1 minute or until crisp and golden.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.  Let the cones cool slightly then remove the toothpick carefully.  The tortilla cones may be made up to 3 days ahead and stored in an airtight container.  Reheat the cones, if desired.

Put some of the shredded romaine in each cone, top it with some of the beef mixture, and garnish the tacos with the cheddar and tomato.  Arrange the remaining romaine in a serving dish and nestle the taco cones in it carefully so that they stand upright.

This recipe yields 32 mini tacos.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Jeanne Lemlin
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === THE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  salsa - (preferably medium hot)
  2               cups  tomato sauce
     1/2           cup  water
  1                can  chopped green chiles - (4 oz) -- undrained
  1                can  pinto or kidney beans - (14 oz) -- rinsed well
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
                        === THE FIXINGS ===
  1                     bag corn chips - (11 oz) -- abt 8 cups
  1                cup  sour cream
  2               cups  grated Monterey Jack
  2        tablespoons  minced cilantro -- (optional)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Combine all the sauce ingredients in a large bowl.  Pour half the sauce into a shallow 2 1/2-quart (12- by 7- by 2-inch) baking dish, and top with half the corn chips.  You can crumble the chips slightly to make an even layer.  Drop little spoonfuls of half the sour cream all over the chips, then sprinkle on half the cheese.  Top with the remaining chips, sauce, sour cream, and cheese.

Bake 35 minutes, or until hot and bubbly around the edges.  Sprinkle the top of the casserole with the cilantro and serve.  You can cut it into squares and serve using a spatula, or use a large spoon to scoop out the chilaquiles.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cook's Note:  Some packaged corn chips are very salty.  Look on the back of the bag for the sodium content and choose a brand that has no more than 110 milligrams of sodium per serving.  These will be the most flavorful corn chips and won't be overly salty to eat or use in the casserole.

For advance preparation:  Make the sauce up to a few hours ahead and lay out all the other ingredients.  Don't assemble chilaquiles, however, until the last minute so the corn chips retain a tiny bit of texture when baked.

  1                cup  sliced unpeeled English or Kirby cucumbers
  2        tablespoons  snipped dill or chives
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/4           cup  red or white wine vinegar

Slice on a diagonal before adding to salad.  Serve warm or room temperature.

Sprinkle sliced tomatoes with salt.  Lay slices on paper towels to drain.  Set aside.

Place greens on a platter.  Arrange egg quarters, sliced chicken breast, tomatoes, and cucumber in a decorative manner.  Sprinkle mixed herbs and croutons on top.

In a bowl, whisk together vinegar, mustard, salt, pepper.  Add oil in a slow stream and whisk to emulsify.  Add the shallots and garlic and adjust seasoning.  Serve vinaigrette on the side.

              Thyme-Roasted Eye Round With Gorgonzola Butter

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  Gorgonzola -- softened
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     beef eye round - (2 1/4 lbs) -- cut crosswise
                        into four 1 1/4"-thick steaks
     1/8           cup  Dijon mustard
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Discard Gorgonzola rind and in a small bowl stir together cheese and butter until smooth.  On a sheet of plastic wrap form Gorgonzola butter into a log about 4 inches long.  Chill log, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 1 hour.  Butter may be made 1 week ahead and leftovers can be used for other dishes.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

In a 12-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking and sear steaks until browned, about 2 minutes on each side, transferring to a shallow baking pan.

When steaks are just cool enough to handle, spread tops and sides with mustard and sprinkle with thyme, pepper and salt to taste.  Roast steaks in middle of oven 8 minutes for medium-rare (coating should just begin to brown).  Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let stand about 3 minutes.  Cut butter into thin slices.

Cut each steak in half horizontally.  Tuck a butter slice between steak halves and top steaks with another butter slice.

This recipe yields 4 generous servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              small  carrot -- finely diced
  1                     celery stalk -- finely diced
  1              small  onion -- finely diced

  1              pound  ground veal
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds
     1/2           cup  canned tomato sauce
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  3        tablespoons  toasted pine nuts
  40                    round wonton wrappers -- thawed if frozen,
                        and covered loosely with a damp paper
                        towel to prevent drying
                        === SLOW ROASTED TOMATO SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  plum tomatoes -- cored, halved
  5              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/8           cup  white wine
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme
     1/2           cup  chicken or vegetable stock
                        = (or canned broth)
     1/4           cup  chiffonade fresh basil leaves,
                        thyme leaves, or purple sage -- for garnish

In a large saute pan set over moderately-high heat, heat olive oil.  Add chopped carrot, celery, onion, and garlic and saute until vegetables are tender.  Add ground veal and cook, stirring, until meat is cooked through.

In a clean spice/coffee grinder, pulverize bay leaf, red pepper flakes, and fennel seeds.  Add spice mixture to saute pan.  Add tomato sauce to saute pan.  Cook, stirring, until almost all the liquid is evaporated, for about 2 minutes.  Add chopped parsley and pine nuts.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Put 1 wonton wrapper on a lightly floured surface, mound 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper, and brush the edges with water.  Put a second wrapper over the first, pressing down around the filling to force out the air, seal the edges well, and trim the excess dough around the filling with a 2 1/2-inch cutter or sharp knife.  Make wonton ravioli with the remaining wrappers and filling in the same manner, transferring them as they are formed to a sheet pan lightly sprinkled with cornstarch

Bring a kettle of boiling salted water to a gentle boil and in it cook the ravioli in batches for 2 minutes, or until they rise to the surface and are tender.  (Do not let the water boil vigorously once the ravioli have been added.)  Transfer the ravioli as they are cooked with a slotted spoon to a dry kitchen towel or paper towels to drain and keep them warm.

Slow Roasted Tomato Sauce:  Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Lightly brush a baking sheet with olive oil and arrange the tomato slices and garlic cloves in one layer.  Sprinkle tomatoes and garlic with olive oil and season with thyme, salt and pepper.  Drizzle with white wine.  Roast the tomatoes and garlic for 1 1/2 hours.

Transfer tomatoes and garlic to a blender and puree until smooth.  Add stock to achieve desired consistency.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Add chiffonade of basil.  Reserve sauce and keep warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  plum tomatoes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Sugar -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  zucchini
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3                     shallots -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh parsley
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh thyme
     1/2         pound  grated Gruyere

Preheat the broiler.  Cut the tomatoes in 1/2 crosswise.  Scoop out the centers leaving the outer thick flesh intact.  Sprinkle the interior shells of the tomatoes with a couple pinches of salt and sugar, and invert them on a paper towel lined plate to drain until ready to stuff.

With the grating attachment of a food processor or on the large-holed side of a box grater, grate the zucchini, and place it in a strainer.  Toss the zucchini with 1 teaspoon salt and place the strainer over a bowl to catch the juices.  Allow to drain for 5 to 10 minutes.

In a large heavy skillet, saute the shallots in 2 tablespoons olive oil, until they begin to caramelize.  Meanwhile squeeze the zucchini to release as much water as possible.

Turn the heat up on the shallots, add the dry zucchini to the pan, and saute the zucchini with the shallots for 5 minutes.

Add chopped parsley and thyme, and then toss the zucchini with the cheese, reserving 1/4 cup of the cheese for topping.

Stuff the tomatoes with the filling, mounding it slightly, and sprinkle with remaining cheese.  Place in tomato halves in ovenproof baking dish and broil them until the tops are golden.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
