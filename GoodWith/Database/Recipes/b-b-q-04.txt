                         Blue Cheese Stuffed Figs

Recipe By     :Chef Chis Koetke
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Grilling


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  port wine
  30                    fresh figs
     1/4         pound  high-quality blue cheese -- not crumbled

In a small saucepan, over high heat, reduce the port to 1/4 its original volume.

Slice the figs nearly in half by starting at the rounded end and cutting toward the stem.  Stop cutting just before the beginning of the stem.  Gently open the fig, still keeping it connected at the stem end.

With your finger, make an indentation in the center of the fig.  Pour in a few drops of the reduced port.  Insert a small piece of blue cheese and replace the other half of the fig so that the fig looks as it originally did.

Grill the fig on a moderate grill until it is soft and the cheese has begun to melt.

Serve as appetizer, brunch dish or a dessert that is a little less sweet than the usual.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     boneless chicken breasts - (to 4)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BBQ SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced onion
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  Chipolte in adobo sauce -- pureed in
                        food processor
     1/8      teaspoon  ground oregano
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

For the BBQ Sauce:  Mix all ingredients together well.

Place chicken breasts in 2/3 of the BBQ sauce, reserving 1/3 for basting.  Roll the breasts in sauce, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Remove chicken from sauce, season with salt and black pepper.  Brush with 1/3 reserved BBQ sauce while it is grilling.  Grill until done then remove from heat.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Comments:  Chipolte, or smoked jalepeÒo chiles (often sold canned in an adobo sauce), is a pungent and flavorful ingredient.  If you want more character and more "heat," simply add more Chipolte to the BBQ sauce.

Comments:  Chipolte, or smoked jalepeÒo chiles (often sold canned in an adobo sauce), is a pungent and flavorful ingredient.  If you want more character and more &quot;heat,&quot; simply add more Chipolte to the BBQ sauce.

     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic

     3/4      teaspoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger

     1/4           cup  hoisin sauce

Combine all ingredients except the cilantro, scallops and hoisin sauce in a blender.  Blend until smooth.  Add cilantro and scallops, and stir until scallops are coated in marinade.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 day.

In a small saucepan, mix remaining zest, orange juice, orange juice concentrate, vinegar, honey, and coriander.  Bring to a boil and add dissolved cornstarch.  Bring back to a boil (it will thicken at the same time).  Remove from heat and let cool.  The glaze can be made 1 to 2 days in advance.

Season duck breasts liberally with salt and black pepper.  Grill over high heat.  As soon as the duck breast is turned the first time, brush a thick layer of orange coriander glaze on top of the duck breasts.  Finish grilling until the duck breast is medium.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2                yellow onion
  3                     plum tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper to taste
  3                     sun-dried tomatoes (not oil-packed)
     1/2           cup  boiling water
     1/4           cup  heavy (whipping) cream
  1         tablespoon  sherry vinegar
                        = (or white wine vinegar)
  1         tablespoon  roughly-chopped fresh tarragon
                        === FOR THE HALIBUT ===
  4                     halibut fillets - (7 to 8 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper to taste

Preheat a grill on medium.

For the Sauce:  Cut the onion crosswise into 1/2-inch slices.  Core the plum tomatoes, remove seeds and cut them crosswise into 1/2-inch slices.  Brush both sides of the onion and tomato slices with the oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill the onion and tomato slices in a grill basket directly over the heat, turning once, until soft.  The onions need 12 to 14 minutes, the tomatoes 9 to 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, place the sun-dried tomatoes in a bowl and add the boiling water.  Set aside for 15 minutes.  Transfer the tomatoes to a food processor or blender; reserve the soaking water.  Add the grilled onions to the tomatoes in the food processor and blend.  With the processor running, add the cream, vinegar and tarragon.  Add enough of the reserved water to make a smooth sauce.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Transfer the sauce to a small saucepan over low heat and keep warm.

For the Halibut:  Brush the halibut with the oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill the halibut fillets directly over the heat, turning once, until the fish just begins to flake when tested with a fork, about 8 minutes total.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The concentrated flavors of grilled tomatoes and onions plus the punch of sun-dried tomatoes impart a robust character to this simple sauce.  A little goes a long way to perk up a mild-tasting fish like halibut.  Be careful not to overcook the fish; it is rather lean and dries out easily.

  4             ounces  garlic-herb Boursin cheese
  1 1/4         pounds  hamburger meat
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Mix meat with salt and pepper.  Divide into 5 equal portions.  Spread each portion of the meat out on a board or the palm of your hand to make a large "pancake."

Place 1/5 of the Boursin in the center of the hamburger meat.  Fold the hamburger over and seal the edges well so that the Boursin is completely enclosed in the meat.  Gently re-form the hamburger.

Grill until cooked through, being sure to turn the hamburgers gently as not to "puncture" the meat and release the trapped Boursin.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  thinly-sliced beef -- see * Note
  1             medium  onion -- halved, and
                        sliced very thinly
                        Juice of 2 lemons
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  chopped parley
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Pita bread
                        Plain yogurt -- (optional)
                        === GREEK SALAD ===
  1                     cucumber -- peeled, diced, or
                        cut into thin slices
  3                     ripe tomatoes -- seeded, diced
     1/2           cup  minced red onion
  3        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh mint -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice -- plus
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

* Note:  Ask your butcher to slice beef from the sirloin tip on the meat slicer.  The slices should be about 1/8-inch thick.

Mix all ingredients except salt.  Let marinate in the refrigerator for 3 to 24 hours.  It will be better if allowed to marinate for 1 day.

Add salt.  Stir well.  Grill individual slices over high heat.  Each piece should take about 2 to 3 minutes.

Warm pita on the grill.  When the slices are cooked, place them on a cutting board and cut into 1/2-inch strips.

Fill the pita pockets with meat, then Greek Salad, and if desired, a drizzle of plain yogurt.

For the Greek Salad:  Mix all ingredients together.  Taste for seasoning and serve.

Comments:  These take just minutes to cook and are addictive so beware!

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1                cup  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  hot pepper sauce

Combine all ingredients in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil and simmer about 30 minutes, or until slightly thickened.

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 cups.

Comments:  Slather this sauce on during the last five minutes of cooking -- just long enough for the sugar to caramelize and brown.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     pita breads
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  grated mozzarella cheese

Sprinkle the insides of all 12 pieces with olive oil.

On 6 pita pieces, sprinkle half the mozzarella.  Then sprinkle feta, red pepper, olives, basil, and remaining mozzarella cheese in order given.  Freshly grind a little black pepper on the mozzarella and cover each pita piece with one of the remaining pieces, to make a sandwich.  Compact lightly with hand.

On a medium hot grill, cook each side for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until lightly crisped.  Place pita sandwiches on low heat or on a warming rack.  Cover grill and cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is completely melted.

Cut each pita sandwich into 4 wedges.  Serve while still hot.

This recipe yields 24 wedges.

Comments:  A tajin (or tagine) is a traditional Moroccan slow-cooked stew that is flavored with a multitude of precisely measured spices.  What makes a tajin an intensely rich and satisfying dish is how the spices interact with each other and the meat.  After 1 to 2 days of marinating, the lamb will take on a most intriguing flavor that will produce exquisite aromas as it grills.

Recipe By     :Chef Chis Koetke
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4         pounds  lamb meat -- trimmed of most fat
     1/2         pound  lamb fat
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground anise
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
  2          teaspoons  ground sumac -- (optional)
                        = (available from specialty spice shops)
  2 3/4    tablespoons  Hungarian sweet paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/2                garlic clove -- finely minced
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano
     1/8      teaspoon  cinnamon
  6                     feet sheep casing -- well rinsed
                        = (if making sausage links)
                        === ORANGE OLIVE SALAD ===
  4                     oranges -- segmented, and
                        cut into large dice
  6             ounces  oil-cured black olives -- roughly chopped
                        Several pinches cumin
                        Several pinches cayenne
                        Sprinkle rose water

Grind cold lamb meat and fat finely using a meat grinder or food processor.  Mix well with remaining ingredients and stuff into sheep casings using a sausage stuffer.

Link the sausages by spinning every other one until the sausages fill the casings firmly.  The size of the links should be about 8 to 10 inches.  (If you do not want to make links, you can also make small patties.)  Cover with plastic wrap and leave in the refrigerator for 1 day.

Grill over moderate heat until just cooked through.  Serve hot with Orange Olive Salad.

For the Orange Olive Salad:  Combine all the ingredients and let marinate at room temperature for several hours before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings (10 links or 12 patties).

                          Peanut Barbecue Sauce

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Sauces


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  smooth peanut butter
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  sherry
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  brown sugar
  1               dash  Tabasco sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground pepper -- to taste

In a medium saucepan, combine all ingredients to blend.  Cook over medium heat until mixture reaches a boil.  Reduce heat to low and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.

This recipe yields about 3 cups.

Comments:  Use this sauce as an accompaniment to barbecued chicken.  You might try to find all-natural or fresh-ground peanut butter instead of the hydrdogenated variety found in most supermarkets.  There is a surprising difference in taste and texture.  The less processed peanut butters have a richer flavor.

Comments:  Use this sauce as an accompaniment to barbecued chicken.  You might try to find all-natural or fresh-ground peanut butter instead of the hydrdogenated variety found in most supermarkets.  There is a surprising difference in taste and texture.  The less processed peanut butters have a richer flavor.

                Pineapple Wedges With Citrus-Butter Glaze

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit
                Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     ripe pineapple
                        === GLAZE ===
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper

To prepare the Glaze:  In a small saucepan, combine the glaze ingredients and place the pan over medium heat until the butter and sugar have melted, stirring occasionally.

Lie the pineapple on its side.  Using a large, sharp knife, trim about 1 inch from the bottom of the pineapple.  Cut the rest of the pineapple, including the crown of leaves, in half lengthwise.  Then cut each half in half, being careful to keep some the crown attached to each wedge.  Using a brush, spread some of the glaze over the flesh.

Grill the pineapple wedges over Direct Medium heat on all three sides until they are warm, about 9 minutes, turning every 3 minutes.  Remove from the grill.

Starting at the bottom end of each pineapple wedge and holding the blade of the knife parallel to the work surface, make a cut between the flesh of the pineapple and the outer shell, and continue the cut along the full length of the shell.

With the flesh still resting in the shell, cut the flesh in bite-sized pieces.  Brush the remaining glaze over the pineapple and allow it to drip down between the pieces.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The trickiest part of this recipe is cutting the pineapple, and that's a cinch, so keep the grill lit and delight your guests with this tropical finale.

                      Plum Cake - {Zwetschgenkuchen}

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts
                Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  warm milk -- (105 to 115 degrees)
  1              ounce  fresh yeast cake
                        = (or two 1/4-oz pkgs active dry yeast)
  1              pinch  sugar
     1/2           cup  butter -- melted
  3                     egg yolks
  1              pinch  salt
  5             pounds  prune plums
                        Cinnamon-sugar -- to taste
     3/4           cup  chopped almonds
     3/4           cup  plain bread crumbs
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  plum brandy (Zwetschgenwasser) or
                        cherry brandy (kirsch or Kirschwasser)

In a large mixing bowl place flour; make a well in the center.  In a small bowl combine warm milk, crumbled yeast (or active dry yeast) and pinch of sugar; stir to dissolve.  Pour yeast mixture into well and let set 5 minutes.

In a small bowl combine butter, egg yolks, and salt; add to well.  Knead liquid into dry ingredients until dough is smooth, elastic, and easy to shape into a ball.  Work in more flour (about 1/2 cup) if needed.  Dust with flour.  Cover with a damp towel and proof in a warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough; turn onto lightly floured surface and roll out 1/2-inch thick.  Place on a greased 15- by 10- by 1-inch baking sheet; cover with a damp towel and proof for 20 minutes.

Cut plums into quarters lengthwise, removing pits.  Arrange plum quarters on dough vertically, poking ends into the dough (pack tightly); dough should be soft enough to support plum quarters on end.  Sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar.  Cover and proof for 10 minutes.

Place baking sheet inside another 15- by 10- by 1-inch baking sheet to create an air cushion between heat source and bottom of cake.  Place cake in center of cooking grate.  Cook for 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a dry sautÈ pan combine almonds and bread crumbs; toast over medium heat until golden.  Remove from heat and place in a medium mixing bowl; cool slightly.  Add sugar and plum or cherry brandy; stir.

Remove cake from grill; sprinkle almond mixture on top of cake.

This recipe yields about 25 (2- by 3-inch) pieces.

Wine Recommendation:  A late harvest Riesling from Washington State or an Auslese from the Mosel, take your pick.

Comments:  Don't hesitate to pack in all the plums -- they cook down when you bake them, sweetening the dough.

Categories    : Grilling                        Rubs
                Spice Blends

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  paprika
     1/4           cup  ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  celery salt
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  onion powder
  2        tablespoons  dry mustard
  2          teaspoons  cayenne
                        Zest of 3 to 4 lemons -- dried, minced

Mix the spices thoroughly in a bowl.  Store covered in a cool, dark pantry.

This recipe yields about 2 cups.

Comments:  Chicken and other poultry can take a variety of rubs well, depending on the flavor you want, but this is often our top choice.

BBQ tips:  Lemon zest can be air-dried overnight.  If you're in a hurry to get your poultry in the pit, dry the zest in a 225 degree oven or smoker for 8 to 10 minutes.

Comments:  Chicken and other poultry can take a variety of rubs well, depending on the flavor you want, but this is often our top choice.
</DirT>

BBQ tips:  Lemon zest can be air-dried overnight.  If you&apos;re in a hurry to get your poultry in the pit, dry the zest in a 225 degree oven or smoker for 8 to 10 minutes.

Categories    : Desserts                        Grilling


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  dark rum
  4                     fresh pears -- cored, quartered
                        Powdered sugar -- as needed
  4             slices  plain pound cake, 2" thick
                        Whipped cream -- (optional)
                        Fresh mint -- (optional)

Place the sugar in a non-reactive pan and caramelize over medium heat.  When it liquifies and is dark brown in color, add the cream and reduce heat.  Add the butter and rum.  Stir until butter is melted; set mixture aside.

Dust pears with powdered sugar and place in center of cooking grate.  Grill pears 10 to 15 minutes, until tender, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Sprinkle each slice of pound cake with powdered sugar; tap off any excess.  Place cake slices in center of cooking grate.  Grill 2 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Transfer to warming rack and continue grilling for about 2 minutes to warm through.

Cut cake slices in half on an angle.  To serve, cross each half piece with the other half on a serving plate.  Arrange pears around cake and drizzle with caramel sauce.  Garnish with whipped cream and mint, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Mosel Auslese Riesling for this buttery fruit dessert.  Or at the very least, a late-harvest Riesling from Washington state.

Beer Recommendation:  A Belgian wheat beer will make a lovely lace doily on which to showcase the rich flavors of this exquisite dessert.

Comments:  The sumptuous flavor of grilled pears is made all the more irresistible with this to-die-for caramel rum sauce.

        ProvenÁal Marinated Flank Steak With Portabello Mushrooms

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  flank steak, 3/4" thick
  2              large  portabello mushrooms -- stem bases trimmed
                        === THE RUB ===
  2        tablespoons  herbes de Provence
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped shallots
  1 1/2           cups  hearty red wine
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-chopped orange zest
  1                     bay leaf

To make the Rub:  In a small bowl combine the rub ingredients and mash together with a fork.

Trim the flank steak of any surface fat and rub the spices into both sides of the steak.  Place the flank steak in a shallow rectangular baking dish, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour.

To make the Marinade:  In a medium saucepan over low heat, warm the olive oil.  Add the shallots and cook until softened but not browned, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.  Add the rest of the marinade ingredients, stir to blend and then heat to boiling.  Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Set aside to cool.

Remove the baking dish from the refrigerator and place the mushrooms in the dish with the steak.  Pour in the cooled marinade, and turn the steak and mushrooms several times to distribute the marinade.  Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours, turning the steak and mushrooms occasionally.

Allow the steak and mushrooms to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.  Remove the steak and mushrooms from the dish and reserve the marinade.  Pour the marinade through a sieve into a medium saucepan.  Heat to boiling.  Boil, over medium-high heat, until reduced by half.  Keep warm over very low heat.

Grill the steak and mushrooms over Direct Medium heat until the internal temperature of the steak reaches 140 degrees for medium-rare and the mushrooms are tender, turning once halfway through grilling time.  The mushrooms will take 12 to 14 minutes and the steak will take 10 to 12 minutes.

Transfer to a cutting board and let the steak and mushrooms rest for a few minutes before cutting into 1/4-inch diagonal slices.  Serve with the hot marinade drizzled over the top along with sliced grilled tomatoes and grilled French bread, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  For a terrific regional match, look for one of Provence's famous red wine blends made with Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and MourvËdre.

Beer Recommendation:  For something equally robust, pour a dark porter with a creamy foam.

Comments:  Herbes de Provence is an aromatic blend of dried herbs -- usually rosemary, thyme, lavender, marjoram and fennel seed -- and it works beautifully to give grilled meats, poultry, and vegetables the irresistible character of southern French cooking.  You will find it sold in jars or small clay crocks in many grocery stores.

                    Rib-Eye Steaks With Tomato Harissa

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  2              large  dried pasilla chiles - (abt 1/2 oz total) -- stemmed, seeded
  1           teaspoon  coriander seeds
  1           teaspoon  mustard seeds
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  fresh mint leaves - (tightly packed)
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1             medium  garlic clove -- crushed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        === FOR THE STEAKS ===
  4                     beef rib-eye steaks, 1" thk - (8 oz ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the Sauce:  Cut the chiles into 2-inch pieces and place them into a small bowl.  Cover the chiles with about 1 cup of hot water and soak them until very soft, 20 to 30 minutes.  Strain the softened chiles and place them in a food processor or blender (discard the water).

In a small skillet over medium heat toast the coriander and mustard seeds until the mustard seeds crackle.  Add the seeds to the chiles along with the remaining sauce ingredients including salt to taste.  Process until completely smooth.  Set the sauce aside at room temperature.

Allow the steaks to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.  Lightly brush or spray both sides of the steaks with the olive oil, and season them with salt and pepper to taste.

Grill the steaks over Direct Medium heat until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees for medium-rare, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Remove from the grill and allow to rest for about 5 minutes.  Serve warm with the sauce on the side along with a green salad and grilled Italian bread, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Look for a bold red wine such as a Ch‚teauneuf-du-Pape from France's southern RhÙne region.

Beer Recommendation:  A wheat beer from Belgium or Germany tastes at its best next to steak like this.

Comments:  Harissa is a spicy North African condiment made from chile, garlic, coriander, and oil, typically served with couscous.  Here we've blended it with complementary flavors to make it milder and particularly suitable for well-marbled steaks.

                Roasted Tomatoes Stuffed With Ratatouille

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  ripe tomatoes
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
                        === STUFFING ===
  1             medium  red onion -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/3" slices
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and cut into flat pieces
  1             medium  zucchini -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/3" slices
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     2/3           cup  grated mozzarella cheese
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh basil
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar

Cut a 1/2-inch slice off the top of each tomato.  Discard the tops.  With a small knife cut around the inside of the fleshy part of the tomato (do not cut through the bottom of the tomato) to within 1/2 inch of the skin.

With a teaspoon, scoop out the tomato flesh, leaving about 1/2 inch of flesh attached to the skin.  Discard the juice and seeds to make room for the stuffing.

Lightly salt the inside of the tomatoes and turn them, cut-side down, on a plate lined with paper towels while you prepare the stuffing.

To make the Stuffing:  Lightly brush or spray the onion, pepper, and zucchini with olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill over Direct Medium heat until tender, turning once halfway through grilling time.  The onions will take 8 to 10 minutes.  The peppers and zucchini will take 6 to 8 minutes.

Transfer to a cutting board and cut into 1/3-inch pieces.  Combine the grilled vegetables in a medium bowl with the cheese, basil, and vinegar.

Spoon the vegetable stuffing into the tomatoes.  Grill the tomatoes over Indirect Medium heat until the cheese is melted and the vegetables are warm, 8 to 12 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A dark red Sangiovese highlights the glory of a ripe tomato.

Beer Recommendation:  Track down a creamy, malty beer like Moretti from northern Italy.

Comments:  When tomatoes are ripe and ready, fill them with a confetti of grilled vegetables and let them roast on the grate.  Sweet as can be.

Note:  The onion, bell pepper, and zucchini are grilled over Direct Medium heat and the stuffed tomatoes over Indirect Medium heat.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts -- (5 to 6 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  salsa, hot or mild
                        = (preferably a less chunky variety)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3             ounces  grated mozzarella cheese
  4                     high-quality hamburger buns or
                        Kaiser rolls
                        Additional salsa -- as needed
                        === ASSORTED TOPPINGS ===
                        Sliced avocado or guacamole
                        Chopped cilantro
                        Pickled jalapeno slices
                        Tomato slices
                        Lettuce
                        Thinly-sliced red onion

Place one chicken breast at a time inside a plastic zipper-type freezer bag (the 1 quart size).  Using the flat side of a meat tenderizer, pound the chicken breast until it is 1/4-inch thick.  Try not to tear the breast.

Place the breasts in a bowl and coat with the 1/2 cup salsa and olive oil.  Let marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 24 hours.

Over high heat, grill the breasts on one side until they have beautiful marks (2 to 3 minutes).  Turn the breasts over and sprinkle each with mozzarella cheese.  Continue to cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.

Warm the buns briefly on the grill while the chicken is cooking.

Cut the chicken breasts to fit nicely on the buns.  Top with additional salsa and any or all of the toppings.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BARBECUE SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-diced red onion
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  steak sauce
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1 1/2       teaspoon  ground coffee
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === DRY RUB ===
  1         tablespoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
  2          teaspoons  garlic salt
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        === FOR THE TRI-TIP ===
  2 1/2         pounds  tri-tip beef, abt 1 1/2" thick
  12            slices  French bread
                        Oak, mesquite, or hickory chips -- soaked in water
                        for at least 30 minutes

To make the Barbecue Sauce:  In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil.  Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes.

Add the chicken broth, ketchup, steak sauce, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, ground coffee, and black pepper.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 10 minutes.

PurÈe the sauce in a food processor or blender.  Allow to cool, cover and refrigerate until ready to use.  Bring to room temperature before serving.

To make the Dry Rub:  In a small bowl, mix together the black pepper, garlic salt, mustard, paprika, and cayenne.  Press the mixture into the surface of the tri-tip, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 3 hours or as long as 24 hours.

Follow the grill's instructions for using wood chips.  Sear the tri-tip directly over medium heat, turning once, until both sides are seared, about 5 minutes total.  Then grill the tri-tip indirectly over medium heat, turning once, until the internal temperature is about 140 degrees for medium-rare, 20 to 30 minutes more.  Allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing thinly on the diagonal against the grain.

Build each sandwich with slices of meat and a dollop of sauce.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Look for a wine with lots of fruit and a bit of acid for balance; a RhÙne-style blend from the home of the tri-tip, California's Central Coast.

Comments:  Santa Maria, California, is home to the Barbecue Hall of Fame and a passionate band of grillers who have perfected the art of cooking a relatively unknown but unbelievably delicious cut of meat.  Also known as "bottom sirloin butt," tri-tip should be grilled no more than medium-rare, then cut into thin slices and served on French bread.

                        Sausage Salad With Arugula

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Salads/Dressings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               ears  fresh sweet corn -- in their husks
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/3         pound  andouille sausage -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/8" slices
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onion
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped red or yellow bell pepper
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped seeded ripe tomato
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  chicken broth -- hot
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  fresh basil leaves - (loosely packed) -- cut into ribbons
  1 1/2           cups  arugula leaves - (tightly packed)

Soak the corn in cold water for 30 minutes or more.  If necessary, use a weight to keep the ears submerged.  Drain.

In a medium sautÈ pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil.  Add the sausage and cook for 5 minutes, turning occasionally.  Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pepper is tender, 7 to 8 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside.

Grill the corn over Direct Medium heat for 20 to 25 minutes, turning three or four times during grilling time.  Remove from the grill and allow to cool slightly.  When cool enough to handle, carefully pull back the husks and remove the silk.  With a sharp knife, cut the kernels from the cobs.  Add the kernels to the sausage mixture.

Just before serving, add the tomatoes, vinegar, chicken broth, salt, pepper, and basil to the andouille mixture.  Stir gently to mix.

Arrange the arugula on a platter, spoon the warm salad on top, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Our sneaky chef married andouille sausage with garden veggies, so we suggest you make a date with Fleurie, a light, floral French Beaujolais.  You won't regret it.

Beer Recommendation:  Soft and creamy on the palate, a true Summer Ale will let this garden-variety dish sing while its lemony finish provides contrasting grace notes.

Comments:  Grilled corn, fresh tomatoes, sweet peppers, and warm, spicy andouille sausage spooned over crisp arugula.  Serve with crusty French bread and call it dinner.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     wooden skewers - (6" long) -- soaked in water
                        for several hours
  18            pieces  scallop - (abt 1 lb)
  1                     jalapeÒo -- seeds, and most
                        the white vein removed
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
  6        tablespoons  vegetable or extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     green onions -- minced
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped cilantro - (abt 1/2 bunch)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                     mango -- peeled, and
                        cut large dice - (abt 3/4" x 3/4" x 3/4")

Mix jalapeÒo, lime juice, orange juice, oil, green onion, cilantro and salt in a food processor or blender until well ground.  (If a food processor or blender in unavailable, the salsa can be mixed briefly by hand using a wire whisk.)

On each skewer, thread 3 scallops with a piece of mango in between each one.  (This can be done hours in advance and kept covered in the refrigerator.)  Place in a baking dish and pour a small amount of salsa (about 1/3 of the salsa) over the skewers.  Roll the skewers in the salsa.  Let marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 1 1/2 hours.

Remove scallops from marinade and discard marinade.  Grill over high heat.  After about 5 minutes, the scallops should be cooked through. (Scallops are cooked through when they firm up and the inside changes from translucent to an opaque, bright white color.

Remove from grill and coat with some of the reserved salsa.  Additional salsa can be served on the side.

This recipe yields 6 skewers.

Comments:  If a hotter salsa is desired, leave some or all of the veins and seeds in the jalapeÒo.  Be sure to clean jalapeÒos wearing gloves, or if using bare hands, wash them immediately after cleaning chiles.

Mix jalapeÒo, lime juice, orange juice, oil, green onion, cilantro and salt in a food processor or blender until well ground.  (If a food processor or blender in unavailable, the salsa can be mixed briefly by hand using a wire whisk.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
On each skewer, thread 3 scallops with a piece of mango in between each one.  (This can be done hours in advance and kept covered in the refrigerator.)  Place in a baking dish and pour a small amount of salsa (about 1/3 of the salsa) over the skewers.  Roll the skewers in the salsa.  Let marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 1 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove scallops from marinade and discard marinade.  Grill over high heat.  After about 5 minutes, the scallops should be cooked through. (Scallops are cooked through when they firm up and the inside changes from translucent to an opaque, bright white color.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from grill and coat with some of the reserved salsa.  Additional salsa can be served on the side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 skewers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  If a hotter salsa is desired, leave some or all of the veins and seeds in the jalapeÒo.  Be sure to clean jalapeÒos wearing gloves, or if using bare hands, wash them immediately after cleaning chiles.

                  Scallops On Skewers With Carrot Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  chopped red onion
  4             medium  carrots -- thinly sliced
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  6              drops  hot sauce
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped broccoli
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice -- or to taste
                        = (juice of 1/2 lemon)
                        === FOR THE SKEWERS ===
  24                    sea scallops
  24             small  fresh basil leaves
  24                    carrot curls
                        Nonstick cooking spray -- for spraying skewers
     1/2    tablespoon  lemon zest
                        = (zest of 1/2 lemon)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To make the Sauce:  In saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.  Add onion and cook 2 minutes.  Stir in carrots.  Add chicken broth, wine, salt, sugar, and hot sauce; simmer 30 minutes or until carrots are tender and liquid is reduced in half.

Process sauce in blender or food processor until smooth.  Return sauce to pan.  Add broccoli; return to boil.  Remove from heat.  Stir in lemon juice to taste.

While sauce is cooking, thread six 12-inch skewers with sea scallops, basil leaves, and carrot curls.  (To keep the basil leaf from burning, press it against the scallop and wrap carrot curl around scallop.)  Keep covered in refrigerator until ready to grill.

Spray skewers with nonstick cooking spray.  Combine lemon zest, salt, and pepper; sprinkle on skewers.  Place skewers in center of cooking grate.  Grill 8 to 10 minutes or until scallops are opaque, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Place some sauce on individual plates, place skewers on sauce.  Pass remaining sauce for dipping.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A light and herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc will skip the light fantastic with this saucy dish.  Try one from California or, better yet, a Pouilly-FumÈ from the Loire Valley.

Beer Recommendation:  For the white scallops and the orange sauce, a black and tan.  The stout will handle the sauce and the lager will tip its hat to the shellfish.

Comments:  Scallops take to the grill like a fish to water, and this exquisite sauce makes them irresistibly delicious!

Notes:  Fresh scallops offer peak flavor, but fresh frozen are the next best thing.  If you buy them in advance, store them in a deep freezer to preserve their delicate flavor.

To make carrot curls, peel and trim medium carrots.  Use a vegetable peeler to make thin lengthwise slices.  Roll slices and place in ice cube trays.  Cover with water and chill several hours or up to 2 days.

If using wooden skewers, soak in water thirty minutes before using so ends won't burn during grilling time.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  3                     bell peppers
                        = (preferably red, yellow, and orange)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh orange juice
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
                        === FOR THE SEA BASS ===
  4                     skinless sea bass fillets, 1" thk -- (abt 6 oz ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the Vinaigrette:  Grill the bell peppers over Direct High heat until the skins are evenly charred on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes, turning every 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the grill and place in a paper bag; close tightly.  Let stand 10 to 15 minutes to steam off the skins.

Remove the peppers from the bag and peel away the charred skins.  Cut off the tops and remove the seeds.  Cut the peppers into 1/4-inch strips and set aside.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining vinaigrette ingredients.  Add the peppers and set aside for as long as 1 day.

Lightly brush or spray the fish fillets with olive oil.  Season them with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill over Direct High heat until the flesh is opaque in the center, 5 to 7 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Remove from the grill and serve warm with the roasted pepper vinaigrette spooned over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A smooth Chardonnay with low acidity blends beautifully here.

Beer Recommendation:  Any delicate Pilsner or other dry golden lager makes a marvelous match.

Comments:  Make a connection to the Mediterranean with this easy dish of delicious ingredients.  Prepare the colorful vinaigrette hours ahead and then spoon it over the hot, grilled fish just before serving.

                     Shrimp Kabobs In Ginger Marinade

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  oil
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro
  2             pounds  large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1              bunch  scallions -- cut 1" lengths
  1              large  red bell pepper -- cut 1" dice,
                        and blanched

In a large bowl, whisk together ginger, garlic, rice wine vinegar, lime juice, brown sugar, oil, sesame oil, and cilantro.  Add the shrimp.  Toss to coat shrimp; cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Remove shrimp from marinade.  Pour marinade into a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil and boil for one full minute.  Remove from heat.

Alternately thread shrimp, scallions, and peppers on skewers.  Place skewers in center of cooking grate.  Grill 4 to 6 minutes until shrimp turn pink and opaque, turning once halfway through grilling time, and basting with reserved marinade.  Serve warm over rice or Chinese noodles.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  There just is no better match for the flavors of grilled shrimp and ginger than Sauvignon Blanc, a crisp, light- to medium-bodied white with green apple and herbal notes in its nose and its flavor.  There's great Sauvignon to be had from California's North Coast, particularly from the Napa Valley and Mendocino County.

Beer Recommendation:  Treat yourself to a Japanese lager, which is the ideal beer for this Asian-style dish.  The briny and savory flavors of the grilled shrimp and the sweet/sour flavors of the ginger cry out for the lightly bitter and refreshing finish of a fine Japanese brew.

Comments:  These kabobs deliver wonderful, authentic flavor with minimal effort.  A great recipe for entertaining a crowd -- just double the ingredients.

                            Shrimp Pasta Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Salads/Dressings                Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  orange juice
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  black sesame seeds
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  wasabi powder
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  12            ounces  capellini or very thin spaghetti -- cooked al dente,
                        and chilled
  24             large  raw shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1              large  red onion -- sliced 1/4" thick
  2                     zucchini -- sliced 1/2" thick
  8                     green onions -- trimmed
                        Nonstick cooking spray -- for spraying
                        vegetables
  18                    cherry tomatoes -- cut in half
                        Salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill weed

In small bowl, combine orange juice, vinegar, honey, garlic, sesame seeds, ginger, dry mustard, and wasabi powder.  Gradually whisk in olive oil and sesame oil until well blended.  Pour dressing over chilled capellini; toss to coat.

Thread shrimp on six 12-inch skewers.  Spray shrimp, red onion slices, zucchini slices, and green onions with cooking spray.  Grill vegetables 5 to 10 minutes or until crisp-tender, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Grill shrimp 4 to 5 minutes or until pink, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Remove skewers and vegetables from grill.  Separate red onion into rings; slice green onions diagonally.  Combine pasta, shrimp, red and green onions, zucchini, and tomatoes.  Toss well.  Season with salt to taste.  Sprinkle with dill weed.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  With the zippy Asian dressing, you need a drier yet fruity white; a M¸ller-Thurgau, a dry Riesling or, of course, a Gew¸rztraminer that's not too sweet.

Beer Recommendation:  A Pilsener-style lager will handle the garlic, ginger, and wasabi just perfectly while distinguishing the delicate shrimp.

Comments:  With its light Asian-inspired dressing, this salad makes a great light summer supper or a terrific picnic side dish.

Note:  If using wooden skewers, soak in water thirty minutes before using so ends won't burn during grilling time.

                              Simple Salmon

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     skin-on salmon fillets, 1" thk -- (abt 6 oz ea)
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  prepared horseradish
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  rice vinegar

To make the Marinade:  In a medium bowl, whisk together the marinade ingredients until smooth.

Place the salmon fillets in a large, resealable plastic bag and pour in all but 1/3 cup of the marinade.  Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly.  Turn the bag to distribute the marinade, place in a bowl, and refrigerate for 15 to 30 minutes.

Remove the fillets from the bag and discard the marinade.  Grill the fillets, skin-side down, over Indirect High heat until opaque throughout, 10 to 12 minutes.  During the last 2 minutes of grilling time, brush the fillets with the 1/3 cup reserved marinade.

Slide a spatula between the skin and flesh and transfer the fillets to serving plates.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings

Wine Recommendation:  A medium-bodied, fruity Pinot Noir from Oregon's Willamette Valley or California's Carneros area will highlight the contrast between the earthy sauce and the briny fish.

Beer Recommendation:  A lively Pilsener from Eastern Europe or one of America's wonderful craft breweries will cut through the complex marinade and allow the delicacy of the salmon to shine.

Comments:  In a rush?  Relax.  This flavor kick is a lifesaver on hectic weekdays -- but don't be surprised if you find yourself serving it up to friends on the weekend, too.

             Smashed Sweet Potatoes With Maple-Glazed Walnuts

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  sweet potatoes
     1/2           cup  walnut halves
  6        tablespoons  maple syrup -- divided
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

Grill the sweet potatoes over Indirect Medium heat until tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour, turning 3 or 4 times.  Remove from grill.  Let cool and peel.

In a medium skillet toast the walnuts over medium heat until golden.  Drizzle 3 tablespoons of the maple syrup over the walnuts.  Reduce heat to low and stir constantly until walnuts are glazed and there is no maple syrup left in bottom of the skillet, about 3 minutes.  Transfer the glazed walnuts to a plate to cool.

In a mixing bowl, place sweet potatoes, the remaining 3 tablespoons of maple syrup, and butter.  Mash with a potato masher or hand mixer to combine.  Season with salt to taste.  Transfer to a serving bowl and top with the glazed walnuts.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Long, narrow sweet potatoes will cook faster than round, thick ones, so check them for doneness the last time you turn them.  These maple-glazed walnuts are so addictive you may want to make extra to serve as a snack.

                Smoking                         Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  Yukon Gold potatoes -- parboiled, peeled
                        Olive oil spray -- for  potatoes
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4                     rosemary branches - (8" to 12" long)

Prepare charcoal or gas grill or traditional smoker for Indirect smoking on Low Heat (follow instructions in owner's manual).  Use one layer charcoal on smoker and place food on top grate.  For best results for this recipe, use hickory or mesquite wood chips or chunks.

Parboil potatoes just until they are tender enough to be easily pierced with rosemary branches for skewering but not so tender that they fall off skewers.

Place potatoes in center of cooking grate of fully smoking grill or smoker.  Smoke 2 hours over charcoal or 20 minutes over gas; remove and allow to cool.

Cut potatoes into quarters.  Thread potato pieces on rosemary branches.  Spray with olive oil and sprinkle with pepper and salt.

Meanwhile, add additional presoaked wood chips or chunks to grill or smoker.  When grill is fully smoking again, place skewered potatoes on cooking grate.  Smoke over Direct Heat 10 minutes or until heated through.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Make the common potato side dish an extraordinary flavor experience.  It's so easy with rosemary branches and smoking woods!

                        === FOR THE SALMON ===
  4                     salmon steaks, 1" thk - (abt 8 oz ea) -- rinsed, patted dry
                        Olive oil spray -- for spraying salmon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To make the Rub:  In a small bowl, combine all rub ingredients.  Cover and store in refrigerator until ready to use.

Prepare charcoal grill for Direct smoking; prepare gas grill for Indirect smoking on High Heat (follow instructions in owner's manual).  Use one layer charcoal for traditional smoker and place food on middle grate.  For best results for this recipe, use alder, pecan, or mesquite wood chips or chunks.

Spray salmon steaks with olive oil spray.  Sprinkle salmon steaks with equal amounts of rub, pressing rub into surface of both sides.  Season with salt and pepper.  Let rest 10 minutes to marinate.

Place salmon steaks in center of cooking grate of fully smoking grill or smoker.  Smoke 8 to 10 minutes, or until fish flakes easily with a fork, turning once halfway through grilling time.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A German Riesling from the Mosel Valley will show off the smoke flavor without competing with it.

Beer Recommendation:  A Brown Ale with plenty of malt and a dry hop finish would make a perfect companion for the noble smoked salmon.

Comments:  Just when you thought grilled salmon couldn't get any better, we added authentic smoke flavor!

                Soups/Stews                     Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               ears  sweet corn -- husks, silk removed
  3             slices  bacon -- minced
  1                cup  chopped onions
     1/3           cup  chopped green bell pepper
     1/3           cup  chopped red bell pepper
     1/2           cup  flour
  5               cups  chicken stock
  2              large  potatoes - (abt 1 lb) -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce

Prepare charcoal or gas grill or traditional smoker for Indirect smoking on Low Heat (follow instructions in owner's manual).  Use one layer charcoal for smoker and place food on top grate.  For best results for this recipe, use hickory or mesquite wood chips or chunks.

Place corn on cooking grate of fully smoking grill or smoker.  Smoke 1 to 1 1/2 hours over charcoal or 20 minutes over gas.  Remove corn; allow to cool.  Cut corn kernels from the cob with a sharp knife.

In a Dutch oven, cook bacon over low heat until crisp.  Add onions and cook 2 minutes or until transparent.  Add green and red peppers and continue to cook for 6 minutes, until peppers are tender.

Add flour.  Stir and cook for 3 minutes.  Add chicken stock gradually, stirring to combine.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.  Add smoked corn kernels, potatoes, and bay leaf; simmer 20 minutes.

Add heavy cream, salt, Worcestershire sauce, white pepper, and hot pepper sauce.  Return to a simmer for 1 minute.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Believe or not, a Brut RosÈ sparkling wine will highlight each of the many luscious flavors of this very special soup.  You might hope to be snowed in!

Beer Recommendation:  A honey beer with a crisp dry finish will help you settle in for a long winter's snack.

Comments:  The ultimate comfort food on a crisp fall day or a snowy winter weekend.

              Smoked Delicata Squash With Apple Sage Butter

Recipe By     :Chef Chis Koetke
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Smoking                         Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Delicata squash - (to 3)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === APPLE-SAGE BUTTER ===
  4        tablespoons  butter -- very soft
  2        tablespoons  apple butter
  5                     sage leaves -- minced

Using a sturdy knife, cut the squash in half lengthwise.  Scoop out the seeds.  Season the squash with salt and pepper.  Put 1 tablespoons of water in each squash half.  Place the squash on a plate, cut-side up, cover with plastic wrap, and cook in the microwave until the squash is very soft (about 5 minutes).

Place the squash in a Char-Broil preheated smoker.  Smoke over any fruit or nut wood for 30 to 45 minutes.  The squash is sufficiently smoked when it attains a delicate smoke aroma.  These squash can be refrigerated and reheated in the microwave when needed.

For Apple-Sage Butter:  Mix butter, apple butter, and sage.  If the mixture does not mix together easily, warm several seconds in the microwave and then mix thoroughly.  Butter each squash half with apple sage butter.  Serve additional butter on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Delicata squash is a delicious and very sweet squash.  Too much smoke can overpower the flavor of the squash.  The Delicata squash is first cooked in the microwave (or oven) and then placed in the smoker just until the squash takes on a light smoky flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce -- plus
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  hoisin sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced ginger
  2                     minced scallions
                        Several dashes Tabasco
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sake
  8                     six-inch skewers
  2                     room temperature Asian pears -- cut 1/2" cubes
                        = (cut just moments before using)

Mix together soy sauce, hoisin sauce, ginger, scallions, Tabasco, and sake.  Toss shrimp in this mixture.  Let marinate for 4 hours in the refrigerator.

Skewer 1 or 2 shrimp lengthwise on each skewer.  Smoke in a preheated water smoker for 45 minutes to 1 hour depending on the size of the shrimp.  Smoke preferably with any fruit wood.

The shrimp are done when they turn from translucent to opaque white in the center of the shrimp.  Smoking for longer periods of time can make the shrimp dry.

When the shrimp are done, skewer 1 cube of Asian pear on each end of the skewer and serve immediately while the shrimp are still hot.

This recipe yields 8 hors d'oeuvre servings.

Comments:  This is a perfect munchie while guests are mingling and relaxing before sitting down to dinner.  Or it makes a special meal as a main course.

Pour the clarified (drawn) butter into another small saucepan, being careful to leave behind the milk solids.  Keep warm over low heat.

Place the corn in a deep container, cover with cold water and soak at least 1 hour.  Remove the corn from the container; shake to remove excess water.  Grill the corn over Indirect Medium heat for 25 to 30 minutes, turning several times.  Use gloves to remove husks and silk.

Place each lobster tail, shell-side down, on a cutting board.  Using a sharp knife or kitchen shears, cut lengthwise through the center of the tough underside of the tail, but do not cut into the flesh.  Thread two skewers lengthwise through the flesh of each tail.  Brush the flesh lightly with some drawn butter.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Grill, shell-side down, over Direct Medium heat just until the flesh turns opaque and the shell is bright red, 10 to 12 minutes.

Using a large knife split each lobster tail lengthwise through the shell to better expose the flesh.  Serve warm with the corn and the remaining drawn butter

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Enjoy a rich, moderately oaked but only slightly chilled Chardonnay with this one.

Comments:  Ah, the unmistakable luxury of grilled lobster tails.  It's hard to believe they're so simple to make.  If you use skewers, the tails will not curl while cooking.  Grilled sweet corn and pure drawn butter make this a summertime favorite.

                     Soft-Shell Crabs With RÈmoulade

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    soft-shell crabs -- cleaned
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === REMOULADE ===
     3/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced white onion
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  capers -- drained and minced
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
                        Tabasco sauce -- to taste
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

To prepare the RÈmoulade:  In a medium bowl whisk together the rÈmoulade ingredients, including Tabasco sauce and salt to taste.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Brush each of the crabs on both sides with melted butter.  Season them with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill the crabs over Direct High heat until the shells are bright red, 4 to 6 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Serve immediately with the rÈmoulade.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A dry rosÈ from the South of France can't be beat here.

Beer Recommendation:  Treat yourself to an elegant Pilsner made in Germany.

Comments:  The grill gives a crispy texture to the outside of soft-shell crabs, while the interior melts in your mouth with a flood of flavor from the sea.  Eat every last bit of the crab with a dollop of creamy rÈmoulade, a cold dipping sauce from France.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  ancho chili powder
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
                        = (or 2 tspns table salt)

Mix all the ingredients in a bowl.  If you have time, let the marinade sit for a while so the flavors can meld.

To use:   Rub the marinade onto meat or chicken. Cover, and let it sit for one hour before you grill, broil or roast it.  (If you plan to marinate for longer than an hour, do it in the refrigerator.)

Use paper towels to pat the steak dry before you put it on the fire.  Remember to turn the steak only once during grilling, so a nice char will develop.

This recipe yields about 5/8 cup, enough for 4 pounds chicken or meat.

                 Spaghetti Squash With Roma Tomato Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24                    firm ripe plum tomatoes -- cored
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus more
                        for the tomatoes
  1                     spaghetti squash - (abt 3 lbs)
  4        tablespoons  minced fresh basil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Grated Parmesan cheese -- for serving

Lightly spray or brush the cored tomatoes with oil.  Grill over Direct Medium heat until blistered and blackened, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove to a platter.

Pierce the squash 6 times with the tines of a large fork.  Place squash on a double thickness of aluminum foil and grill over Direct Medium heat until squash feels soft when pierced with a fork or pressed with a finger tip, 1 to 1 1/4 hours, turning 3 or 4 times.

While the squash is grilling, slip the skins from the tomatoes and cut into 1/4-inch pieces.  Place tomatoes and juices in a large saucepan.  Add the oil, basil, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside.

When squash is cooked, wrap in a towel and let stand 10 minutes.  Protecting hands with a kitchen towel cut squash in half lengthwise.  Spoon out and discard the large seeds in center.  Then pull hot squash from the tough outer skin with the tines of a table fork into a large serving bowl.

Briefly reheat the tomato sauce in the saucepan.  Pour over the spaghetti squash and toss.  Serve topped with Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 4 main dish servings or 6 side dish servings.

Wine Recommendation:  For this play on a classic dish of spaghetti and red sauce play with the wine a bit too.  A light-to-medium bodied red will work nicely here.  Our suggestion; a Dolcetto from Italy's Piemonte region.

Beer Recommendation:  This time of year, Halloween brings out the mischief-maker in many brewmeisters.  Look for a robust pumpkin ale that will amplify the squash flavors in this dish and meld beautifully with the intensity of the tomatoes.

Comments:  Spaghetti squash separates into strands, like spaghetti, when it is cooked.  The texture is slightly crunchy and the flavor a little bland, which is why it goes so well with this roasted tomato sauce seasoned with extra virgin olive oil, basil, and garlic.  Top with a spoonful of grated Parmesan.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPICE CAKE ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
     2/3           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  chopped almonds
     1/2           cup  chopped mixed candied fruits
  2        tablespoons  cherry brandy
                        = (kirsch or Kirschwasser)
                        === LEMON ICING ===
  1 1/2           cups  powdered sugar
  1                     egg white
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-grated lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice

To make the Spice Cake:  In a small saucepan melt butter.  Add honey and brown sugar; heat through until sugar is dissolved.  Cool completely.

In large mixing bowl combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and nutmeg.  Add cooled butter mixture and egg; mix completely.  Fold in almonds, candied fruits, and cherry brandy.

Spread batter on lightly greased 15- by 10- by 1-inch baking sheet.  Place baking sheet in center of cooking grate.  Cook 15 to 20 minutes.

To make the Lemon Icing:  In a small bowl combine all icing ingredients; beat until smooth.

Remove cake from grill and immediately cut into desired shapes -- such as circles, squares, or hearts -- with cookie cutters or the tip of a knife.  Brush with lemon icing while shapes are still hot.

This recipe yields about 36 two-inch square shapes.

Comments:  Lebkuchen is similar to gingerbread, but made with nutmeg instead of ginger.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  eggplant -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" by 1" by 2" strips
  1                     green bell pepper -- cut 1" by 2" strips
  1                     red bell pepper -- cut 1" by 2" strips
     2/3           cup  olive oil -- divided in half
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2    tablespoon  hoisin sauce
                        = (or hot bean sauce)
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  light soy sauce
     1/4           cup  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  water

Place eggplant and pepper strips in large bowl; pour 1/3 cup oil over strips and toss to coat.  Place vegetables in center of cooking grate.  Grill 6 to 8 minutes.

Meanwhile in small saucepan heat 1/3 cup oil over medium heat.  Add ginger and garlic and cook 1 minute until brown.  Add hoisin sauce and stir.  Quickly add sugar, vinegar, chicken broth, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and sesame oil.  Bring to a boil.  Stir cornstarch into water until dissolved.  Add to sauce and stir until thickened.  Pour sauce over vegetables; toss to coat.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A drier Gew¸rztraminer from California's Alexander Valley will buoy up the spices in this velvety sauce.

Beer Recommendation:  Just about any Asian Pilsener -- the drier, the better -- will work well with the spicy sauce and the delicate eggplant.

Comments:  Why is this earthy dish so heavenly?  The secret's in the sauce!

               Spicy Smoked Turkey Breast With Cajun Gravy

Recipe By     :Chef Chis Koetke

                Poultry                         Smoking
                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     boneless turkey breasts - (abt 3 lbs ea) -- see * Note
                        === SPICE MIX ===
  3          teaspoons  paprika
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  1 1/4      teaspoons  cayenne
  3          teaspoons  poultry seasoning
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  5                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        === BASTING LIQUID ===
  3        tablespoons  Dijon or Creole Mustard
  4        tablespoons  beer
                        = (preferably a well-flavored
                        lager or ale)
                        === CAJUN GRAVY ===
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  minced onion
     1/3           cup  minced celery
     1/3           cup  minced green pepper
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  flour
  2               cans  low sodium chicken broth - (15 oz ea)
                        = (or 1 qt homemade poultry stock)
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  chile flakes -- (optional, as this
                        gives this gravy a kick!)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste

* Note:  If boneless turkey breasts are not available from the butcher, you can buy a bone-in turkey breast and remove the breasts yourself.  Simply cut down the side of the breast bone and then separate the meat from the carcass by cutting between the meat and the bone.  Leave the skin attached to the breast.

Dry both turkey breasts thoroughly.

Mix all the ingredients for the Spice Mix.  Sprinkle the spice mix on all surfaces of the breasts.  (Be sure to sprinkle some of the spice mix on the flap of meat on the side opposite the skin side.)  Let rest for 10 to 30 minutes in the refrigerator.

Mix ingredients for the Basting Liquid.  Lightly brush a small amount of basting liquid on all surfaces of the turkey breasts.  Be careful not to brush away the spice mixture -- it may be easier to dab on basting liquid.

Place the turkey breasts skin-side up in a preheated Char-Broil smoker.  Use any nut or fruit wood, with the exception of mesquite which would overpower the turkey.  Smoke over hot water with 5 bay leaves, or beer with 5 bay leaves.

Approximately every 30 minutes, baste lightly with the basting liquid.  Be careful not to wash off the spice mix.  The turkey breast is done when an instant read thermometer, inserted into the thickest part of the breast, reads 165 degrees.  The breast will take about 2 to 2 1/2 hours to cook.  Slice and serve.

For the Cajun Gravy:  In a medium saucepan, sautÈ onion, celery, and garlic in butter over moderate heat until the onions are translucent.  Add garlic and flour and mix until well incorporated.  Continue to cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture is a light brown color (it will take about 5 minutes).

Add 1 cup of the stock or broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly with a whisk.  Add remaining stock or broth and bring to a boil stirring constantly.  Add bay leaf, chile flakes, and black pepper.  Let simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.  If a thicker gravy is desired, simply let boil and reduce slightly.  Add salt where necessary

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This spicy and smoky turkey recipe is perfect for smaller get-togethers.  The individual breasts have the added bonus of cooking quickly.  Also, slicing the turkey is a breeze as there are no bones to contend with.  If a whole turkey is desired, double the recipe (for a 16 pound whole turkey) and spread the spice mix on the skin and inside cavity.

The gravy is an added plus.  It is perfect spooned over turkey slices or poured over mashed potatoes.  While the gravy adds to the overall dish, the turkey breast can also successfully stand on its own.

The gravy is an added plus.  It is perfect spooned over turkey slices or poured over mashed potatoes.  While the gravy adds to the overall dish, the turkey breast can also successfully stand on its own.

                        Spinach-Stuffed Veal Chops

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STUFFING ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onion
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2                     plum tomatoes -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed, and
                        squeezed very dry
  3             slices  prosciutto - (abt 2 oz) -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  coarsely-grated fontina cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === THE RUB ===
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR THE CHOPS ===
  4                     veal loin chops, 1 1/4" to 1 1/2" thk -- (abt 3/4 lb ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed

To make the Stuffing:  In a large sautÈ pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil and cook the onion until soft, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.  Add the tomatoes and cook for 3 minutes, then add the spinach and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool for 3 or 4 minutes, then add the remaining stuffing ingredients.  Divide the stuffing into four portions.

To make the Rub:  In a small bowl combine the rub ingredients.

Trim the chops of any excess fat and cut a pocket in the side of each chop.  Push the stuffing into the pockets and close with toothpicks.  Lightly brush or spray the chops with olive oil and season with the rub.  Allow to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling.

Grill over Direct Medium heat until medium-rare, 15 to 20 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill and allow to rest for 3 to 5 minutes.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Pair this Florentine-style grill with a red "Super Tuscan" (Sangiovese blended with Cabernet and/or Merlot).  It will marry beautifully with the lean veal and the acidic tomato and spinach.

Beer Recommendation:  Try something special, a moderately full-bodied, but ultimately refreshing Hefe Weizen.  The strong yeast profile of this beer will impart a clove-like spiciness, a most exciting flavor-finish for the veal, pork, and vegetable combination.

Comments:  The luscious stuffing keeps these chops juicy.  To save time, ask the butcher to cut the pockets for you.

                          Stuffed Grilled Onions

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  Spanish onions - (abt 8 oz ea)
  2               cups  two-day-old bread cubes -- (abt 4 slices)
     2/3           cup  chicken broth
     1/4         pound  fresh Italian sausage

To prepare onions for stuffing, leave outer skin on onions and rinse.  Trim root end off onions to make a flat bottom.  Cut tops off; reserve.  Hollow centers of onions, leaving two or three outer layers intact; save centers for another use.

In a medium mixing bowl, soak bread cubes in chicken broth, turning to coat.  When broth is completely absorbed, add sausage.  Toss gently to mix well.

Fill onions with equal amounts of sausage mixture.  Place tops on onions.  Place each onion upright in center of a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil; bring up edges and seal, leaving a little space for expansion of steam.

Place foil onion packets upright in center of cooking grate; cook 2 hours or until very tender.  Remove onions from foil and remove outer-most skin.  Reserve cooking juices and serve stuffed onions with juices.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Serve with plenty of fresh crusty bread to sop up the savory juices.

              Stuffed Trout With Lemon And Pink Peppercorns

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STUFFING ===
  1                     lemon
  3             slices  bacon -- cooked, drained,
                        and crumbled
  3        tablespoons  chopped parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  pink peppercorns
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR THE TROUT ===
  4              whole  trout -- cleaned, and
                        boned from belly side
                        Olive oil spray -- as needed
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper

Peel lemon; discard rind.  Dice pulp into small pieces.  In a small bowl, combine lemon pieces, bacon, parsley, peppercorns, salt, and pepper. Mix well.

Spoon one fourth of the bacon mixture into each boned trout.  Close belly cavity over stuffing; tie each trout closed with 3 to 4 lengths of kitchen string.  Spray trout on both sides with oil; season with salt and pepper.

Place trout on center of cooking grate and grill 12 to 14 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time, until fish flesh is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  There is no finer match for this light grilled fish dish than a light white wine from a cool climate -- try a Gr¸ner Veltliner from Austria.

Beer Recommendation:  Did someone call for a pint of bitter?  The clean, bitter flavor of a true English Ale is a perfect foil for the sweetness of the trout and the refreshing spiciness of the lemon and peppercorns.

Comments:  Lemon bits add refreshing acidity to complement the rich trout flesh, while tiny pink peppercorns add an intriguing burst of flavor.

                  Stuffed Veal Pockets With Cider Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/2        medium  onion -- sliced
  2                     Granny Smith apples
  2          teaspoons  apple cider vinegar
  1              pinch  salt
  3               cups  sparkling cider
  1 1/2           cups  brown gravy
  1 1/3         pounds  veal scaloppini
                        = (abt twelve pieces, 1 1/2 oz ea)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Olive oil -- as needed

In a sautÈ pan, melt the butter and sautÈ the onions until soft.  Peel, core, and thinly slice the apples.  Add to the onions, and sautÈ until the apples are soft, about 3 to 5 minutes more.  Remove from the heat and add the vinegar and salt.  Refrigerate until cold.

In a medium saucepan, simmer the sparkling cider until only 1/2 cup remains, 30 to 45 minutes.  Whisk in the brown gravy; simmer gently for 10 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Lay a few scaloppini on a long sheet of waxed paper.  Cover with another sheet of waxed paper.  With the flat side of a meat mallet, pound the scaloppini until very thin, then lay them on a clean work surface.  Repeat with the rest of the scaloppini, working in batches.

Season the flattened scaloppini with salt and pepper.  Top each with an equal amount of the chilled apple mixture.  Fold each scaloppini in half to make a pocket and close with a toothpick.

Brush pockets with oil.  Grill over Direct High heat for 4 to 6 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Reheat the sauce and serve with the veal pockets.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Hard sparkling cider is a natural choice for this apple-glazed dish.  If you're new to hard ciders, look in your local liquor or grocery store.  If you're lucky, you'll find a local version (usually made from single-varietal apples) or even an exciting example from France's Normandy region.  Crisp and invigorating, hard cider is a refreshing change of taste.

Beer Recommendation:  If beer's your thing, a lightly bitter India Pale Ale will play off the sweetness of the veal and its cider sauce.  Serve IPA close to room temperature to enhance its flavors, which will blossom along side this dish.

Comments:  This exceptional dish gets its flavor from the grill.  The easy-to-make sauce adds a rich, velvety texture.

                           Super Wooster Sauce

Recipe By     :Cheryl and Bill Jamison
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Sauces


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             bottle  commercial Worcestershire sauce - (15 oz)
     3/4           cup  water
     1/2        medium  onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  unsulphured molasses
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  chopped anchovies
  2          teaspoons  grated fresh horseradish root
                        = (or 4 tspns prepared horseradish)
  2                     plump garlic cloves -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  dried red chile flakes

In a heavy, nonreactive saucepan,bring the ingredients to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 50 to 60 minutes.  The sauce will be thin with some texture to it.

Cool the sauce to room temperature, then spoon it into a blender and puree.  Refrigerate for at least 1 day for the flavor to develop.  The sauce keeps for months covered and refrigerated.

This recipe yields about 2 cups.

Comments:  Sir Marcus Sandys, from Worcester, England, discovered an intriguing sauce in nineteenth-century India and wanted to replicate it at home.  He took the recipe to a local company named Lea & Perrins and asked the proprietors to brew a batch.  The result tasted so horrible that it was abandoned in its vat in the basement.  After a couple of years, someone had a second thought, took another sip, and shouted for joy.  Aging is the key to Worcestershire Sauce, and ample reason not to try making your own at home.  Instead, we doctor the commercial product, notching up the potency with a little horseradish and extra quantities of some of the major ingredients.

          Sweet Chili-Mustard Chicken Salad With Toasted Almonds

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Poultry                         Salads/Dressings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
     3/4           cup  pineapple juice
  2        tablespoons  mild chili sauce
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
                        === SALAD ===
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (abt 6 oz ea)
                        Canola oil -- as needed
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh marjoram
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  mixed baby greens
  1                     four-inch section cucumber -- halved lengthwise,
                        and thinly sliced

To make the Dressing:  In a tall-sided saucepan whisk together the pineapple juice, chili sauce, vinegar, and soy sauce.  Bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer until 1/2 cup remains, 15 to 20 minutes.  Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl.  Whisk in the mustard and sesame oil, and allow to cool to room temperature.

Place the almonds in medium skillet over medium heat.  Cook until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Lightly brush or spray both sides of the chicken with oil.  Season with the marjoram and salt and pepper to taste.  Grill the chicken over Direct Medium heat until the meat is firm and the juices run clear, 8 to 12 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and cut into bite-size pieces.

Place the mixed greens in a large bowl.  Add the chicken, almonds, and cucumbers.  Drizzle the dressing over the top (you may not need all of it) and toss to coat the leaves evenly.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Pour a glass of a fruity Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.

Beer Recommendation:  An Irish ale with a kiss of sweetness is super here.

Comments:  Not your grandmother's chicken salad, but try it.  The healthy dressing has a sweet and tangy balance that adds pizzazz to the chicken and greens.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRILLED VEGETABLES ===
  1                     garlic head
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1              whole  red pepper
                        === SALAD ===
  2 1/2         pounds  sweet potatoes -- peel on
     1/4           cup  catsup
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  vinegar
  3        tablespoons  spicy brown mustard
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
                        = (juice of 1 lime)
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1              small  red onion -- finely diced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  snipped chives

For the Grilled Vegetables:  Cut off top of garlic to expose cloves.  Drizzle with oil.  Place garlic and whole red pepper in center of cooking grate.  Grill pepper, turning every 5 minutes or so, until blackened on all sides, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, grill garlic 40 to 45 minutes or until soft; allow to cool.

When pepper is done, remove from grill and place in a paper bag; close tightly.  Let stand 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove pepper from bag; peel away charred skin.  Cut off top and remove seeds.  Dice pepper and set aside.

Gently squeeze cooked garlic cloves to separate from skins.  Mash 2 to 3 cloves to make 1 teaspoon of garlic.  Set aside.  (Reserve remaining garlic for another use.)

For the Salad:  Wash sweet potatoes and boil in water until cooked 3/4 through, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Do not overcook.  Cool, peel, and slice 1/4 inch thick.

Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine catsup, oil, vinegar, mustard, lime juice, balsamic vinegar, teaspoon of grilled garlic, sugar, salt, and pepper to make marinade.  Mix well to combine.

In large bowl, combine sweet potatoes, marinade mixture, diced red pepper, and red onion.  Sprinkle with parsley and chives; toss to coat.  Cover and marinate in refrigerator 1 hour or overnight.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This fantastic summer salad makes a bright and zesty complement to grilled seafood.

       Tandoori Spiced Halibut Fillets With Cucumber, Yogurt Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     halibut fillets, 1" thk - (6 oz ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        === THE RUB ===
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  turmeric
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === SALAD ===
  1                cup  whole or lowfat plain yogurt
  1                     seedless cucumber -- trimmed, peeled,
                        and thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  finely-shredded carrot
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh mint
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        === GARLIC BUTTER ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic

To make the Rub:  In a small bowl combine the rub ingredients.  Rub the halibut fillets on all sides with the seasoning.  Lightly brush or spray both sides of the halibut fillets with olive oil.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.

To prepare the Salad:  In a medium bowl combine the salad ingredients and stir to blend.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

To make the Garlic Butter:  Just before serving, heat the butter and garlic in a small skillet over low heat just until the garlic sizzles.  Remove from the heat.

Grill the halibut over Direct Medium heat until the fish is just opaque and slightly firm to the touch, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Remove from the grill, brush fish lightly with the garlic butter, and serve with the cucumber salad on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Spicy food calls for fruity wine.  Try a Riesling with a bit of sweetness.

Beer Recommendation:  A bronze, malty lager adds something extra here without being overpowering.

Comments:  All alone, a generous rub of Indian spices on delicate fish might feel a little too hot, but in the company of the cool flavors of a traditional cucumber salad, this combination balances with finesse.

                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  2            cartons  plain yogurt - (8 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  grated gingerroot
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  paprika
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
                        === FOR THE CHICKEN ===
  2 1/2         pounds  bone-in chicken pieces
                        = (breasts, thighs, or drumsticks)
     1/2           cup  chopped chutney
  1             medium  cucumber -- sliced

To make the Marinade:  In a medium bowl, whisk together all marinade ingredients.  Rinse chicken and pat dry.  Place chicken pieces in a resealable plastic bag set into a deep bowl.  Pour over chicken and close bag.  Marinate in the refrigerator overnight, turning bag occasionally to distribute marinade.

Remove chicken from bag, reserving marinade.  Place chicken pieces, bone-side down, in center of cooking grate.  Grill 45 to 60 minutes or until chicken is tender and juices run clear, brushing with reserved marinade during the last 15 minutes of grilling time.

Serve with chutney and sliced cucumber.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This convenient version of a classic Indian dish uses yogurt to tenderize the chicken and just the right combination of spices to make it mouth-watering!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  butter
                        Juice of 2 tangerines
  4                     coldwater lobster tails - (abt 6 oz ea)

In a small saucepan over very low heat melt the butter.  After the butter has melted, skim off all the foam.  Add the tangerine juice, whisk and set aside.

Using poultry shears, split the lobster tails in half by cutting the shell down the middle on both sides, and then, with a sharp knife slice the lobster meat in half.

Place the lobster tails in a large, resealable plastic bag and pour in 1/2 cup of the tangerine butter.  Reserve the remaining tangerine butter.  Press the air out of the bag and seal the bag tightly.  Turn the bag several times to distribute the tangerine butter, place the bag on a plate, and refrigerate for 10 to 20 minutes, turning the bag once or twice.

Remove the lobster tails from the bag and discard the butter in the bag.  Grill over Direct Medium heat, meat-side down, for 8 to 10 minutes, turning and basting with some of the remaining tangerine butter once halfway through grilling time.

Remove from the grill and serve hot with the remaining tangerine butter on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Bright citrus and succulent shellfish make a special occasion dinner that sparkles.

                    Taste Of Provence Veggie Sandwich

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Sandwiches
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  garlic head
  2          teaspoons  olive oil -- divided
  1             medium  eggplant
  1                     zucchini
                        Salt -- as needed
  6             medium  pitted black olives
  1              large  plum tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Herbes de Provence
                        Olive oil -- to brush vegetables
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, cored,
                        and quartered
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- seeded, cored,
                        and quartered
  4                     red-leaf lettuce leaves
  2             ounces  goat cheese -- (optional)
  4              large  French rolls
                        = (or 1 baguette cut into quarters)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cut off top of garlic to expose cloves.  Drizzle with one teaspoon olive oil.  Place on a large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil.  Fold up sides to create a foil packet, allowing room for expansion of steam.  Place foil packet in center of cooking grate.  Grill 1 hour or until garlic is soft and cooked through.

Meanwhile, slice eggplant and zucchini lengthwise into 1/2-inch thick strips and lightly sprinkle with salt.  Let stand in a colander for about 1/2 hour to draw out bitter juices.  Rinse well and dry with a paper towel.

When garlic is done cooking, squeeze the pulp out of the garlic head and combine pulp with olives, tomato, red pepper flakes, balsamic vinegar, and Herbes de Provence in a blender or food processor.  Process with remaining teaspoon of olive oil until mixture combines and forms a paste.

Lightly brush or spray eggplant, zucchini, and bell pepper quarters with olive oil.  Place in center of cooking grate.  Grill for 6 to 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Vegetables should be cooked through, but not limp.

Just before serving, split rolls or baguette quarters lengthwise and place cut-side down on cooking grate to toast for one minute.

Assemble the sandwiches by layering lettuce, grilled vegetables, and goat cheese, if desired.  Spread garlic-olive paste on top bun and season vegetables with salt and pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  For a ProvenÁal sandwich, a wine from the south of France; add a chilled Beaujolais Nouveau and you're on vacation!

Beer Recommendation:  Try a brown ale for a smooth and nutty counterpoint to the crisp and earthy veggies.

Comments:  This sandwich is light on calories but not on flavor!  It gets its intense taste from fresh vegetables, great herbs and, of course, the grill.

                             Tea-Smoked Duck

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry
                Smoking

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE DUCK ===
  1                     duck - (4 to 5 lbs) -- all fat removed
     1/4           cup  dry sherry wine
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh ginger
  2                     green onions -- coarsely chopped
  2              whole  star anise -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper - (to 2)
                        === SMOKING PACKET ===
     1/3           cup  black tea leaves
  5        tablespoons  raw rice
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar - (packed)
  1                     green onion -- slivered
     1/3      teaspoon  ground coriander seeds
                        === FOR SERVING ===
                        Chinese rice or egg noodles

Thaw duck, if frozen.  Remove neck and giblets from body cavity; rinse and pat dry.  Pierce duck all over with a fork.  Truss duck tightly.

In a small bowl combine sherry, salt, ginger, green onions, star anise, and pepper.  Place duck in a large plastic resealable bag.  Add marinade; rub inside duck cavity and on skin.  Close bag and marinate in refrigerator 6 to 8 hours or overnight.

Meanwhile, prepare Smoking Packet:  Mix tea, rice, and brown sugar on heavy-duty aluminum foil.  Fold up ends to create a foil packet; poke small holes in it so smoke can escape.

Remove marinated duck from bag; pat dry.  Grill/smoke as follows.

For charcoal grills:  Place smoking packet directly on prepared coals.  Insert cooking grate and place duck, breast-side up, in center of cooking grate.

For gas grills:  Remove one cooking grate and center the remaining cooking grate on grill.  Place smoking packet in front left corner of grill on Flavorizer Bars, directly over heat source.  (Note: If you have a smoker attachment in your Weber Grill, do NOT use it for this recipe as the sugar will melt and stick to the inside of the box.  Use the smoking packet described above.)  Place duck, breast-side up, in center of cooking grate.

Grill duck 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until meat thermometer inserted into thigh registers 180 degrees and the juices run clear.  Smoke may not last the entire cooking time, but will be sufficient to flavor the bird.

Remove cooked duck from grill and let stand 10 minutes.  Carve into serving portions and sprinkle with green onion and coriander.  Serve with Chinese rice or egg noodles.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Cabernet Sauvignon with hints of cedar and plenty of ripe currants would go nicely with the duck, accommodating the anise and tea flavors with panache.

Beer Recommendation:  The anise in the marinade and the rich texture of the duck invite you to quaff a dense stout.  Go for it!

Comments:  A unique dish that's worth the effort.  Be sure to use the smoking packet as recommended to minimize cleanup.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  finely-sliced green onions
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  hot bean paste
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR THE CHICKEN ===
  6              whole  chicken legs
                        = (drumsticks with thighs attached)
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing chicken

Combine all marinade ingredients.  Place chicken legs in a resealable plastic bag set in a shallow dish.  Pour marinade mixture over chicken legs; close bag.  Marinate in refrigerator 2 to 4 hours, turning occasionally to distribute marinade.

Lightly brush chicken legs with oil.  Place chicken in center of cooking grate.  Grill 30 minutes or until juices run clear, turning once halfway through grilling time.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Tickle the cilantro with the bubbles of a Spanish Cava rosÈ.  Even the rich dark meat in this dish will jump to attention.

Beer Recommendation:  Best bet; a light lager that's content to serve as a backdrop to the rich flavors of this dish.

Comments:  The dark meat and dark green herbs and fruit in this dish will conspire to capture your heart... or at least your taste buds.

                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  garlic head
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === FOR THE PASTE ===
                        Lemon zest from 2 lemons
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice -- divided
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR THE CHICKEN ===
  1              whole  chicken - (4 to 5 lbs)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             sprigs  fresh rosemary
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1              whole  lemon - (optional) -- thinly sliced

Remove the loose, papery outer skin from the head of garlic.  Cut about 1/2-inch off the top to expose the cloves.  Place on a large square of aluminum foil.  Drizzle the olive oil over the cloves.  Fold up the foil sides and seal to make a packet, leaving a little room for the expansion of steam.

Grill over Indirect Medium heat until the cloves are soft, 30 to 45 minutes.  Remove the garlic from the grill and allow to cool.  Squeeze the garlic from the individual cloves into a small bowl.

To make the Paste:  In the bowl with the garlic, combine the lemon zest, 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, rosemary, salt and pepper.  Mix well.

Remove and discard the neck, giblets, and any excess fat from the chicken.  Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.

Loosen the chicken skin gently with your fingers and spread half of the paste under the skin on the breast.  Season the inside of the chicken cavity with salt and pepper and add the rosemary sprigs.  Truss the chicken with cotton string.

Pour the remaining 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and the wine into the cavity.  Coat the outside surface of the chicken with the other half of the paste, pressing it into the skin.

Grill the chicken, breast-side up, over Indirect Medium heat until the juices run clear and the internal temperature reaches 170 degrees in the breast and 180 degrees in the thickest part of the thigh, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.  Halfway through grilling, slide three lemon slices under the string on top of the breasts.

Transfer the chicken to a platter, loosely cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for about 10 minutes before removing the string and carving.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Bright lemon and roasted garlic make this chicken a wonderful start to a summer picnic or the perfect ending to a relaxing weekend.

                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/3           cup  bourbon
  2        tablespoons  maple syrup
  1         tablespoon  Dijon country-style mustard
                        === FOR THE CHICKEN ===
  1                     roaster chicken - (6 to 7 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  Kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper

To make the Glaze:  In a small bowl, combine all glaze ingredients.  Set aside.

Rinse chicken and pat dry.  With poultry shears or knife, split chicken lengthwise along one side of backbone.  With breast side up, pull up on two sides of back and press down firmly on breast until bones begin to crack and chicken is reasonably flat.  Thread two sturdy metal skewers crosswise through flattened chicken; skewers should run perpendicular to thigh bones, through the breasts, and through the middle of the large wing joints.

Combine oil, garlic, salt, and pepper; brush evenly on both sides of chicken.  Place chicken, skin-side up, in center of cooking grate.  Grill 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours or until meat thermometer inserted into center of thigh meat (but not touching bone) reaches 180 degrees (170 degrees for breast) or until juices run clear and skin is well-browned, brushing occasionally with glaze during last 20 minutes.  Let stand 10 minutes before carving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A SÈmillon from Washington State or Australia will float the bourbon glaze and highlight the juiciness of the chicken.

Beer Recommendation:  To highlight the glaze and caress the chicken, what else but a maple lager?

Comments:  An easy recipe that will impress dinner guests because the chicken grills up so juicy and delicious.

                Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === KETCHUP ===
  1                     tablespoon olive oil
  3        tablespoons  chopped shallots
  2               cups  diced skinned peaches
  3        tablespoons  cranberry sauce
  3        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  dark brown sugar
     1/2    tablespoon  tomato paste
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  ground Mediterranean oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === FOR THE ONION ===
  1              large  sweet onion
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1              pinch  paprika
                        === FOR THE BURGERS ===
  1 1/4         pounds  ground turkey
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Bell's poultry seasoning
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     burger buns

To make the Ketchup:  In a sautÈ pan, warm the oil and sautÈ the shallots for 3 minutes.  Add the peaches and sautÈ for about 2 minutes or until juices release from the fruit.  Add the rest of the ketchup ingredients and blend well.  Simmer for 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove from heat and chill thoroughly.

Cut the onion into 4 thick slices.  Brush onion slices with oil and season with salt and paprika.  Grill over Indirect High heat until tender, about 10 to 15 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from grill and keep warm.

To make the Burgers:  In a medium bowl, combine all the burger ingredients and mix well.  Form into four patties, each about 3/4-inch thick.  Grill over Direct High heat until juices run clear, about 6 to 8 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.

Place burgers on buns and top with grilled onions and chunky peach cranberry ketchup.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Need a break from the same old burgers?  Here's a turkey-based version that cooks up moist and juicy.  Topped with this special "ketchup" it's anything but ordinary.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VEGETABLES ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- divided
  1             medium  yellow onion -- cut 1/2" dice
  3             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  2                     celery stalks -- cut 1/2" dice
     1/2         pound  button mushrooms -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
                        === SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  Madras curry powder
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth
                        === FOR THE PIE ===
  3               cups  diced grilled turkey
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry - (9" by 10") -- thawed
  1              large  egg

To prepare the Vegetables:  In a medium sautÈ pan over medium-high heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter and cook the onion and carrots, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, 6 to 8 minutes.  Transfer the onion-carrot mixture to a large bowl.

Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter in the sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  Add the celery, mushrooms, thyme, and oregano.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the juices from the mushrooms have evaporated, 6 to 8 minutes.  Add the celery-mushroom mixture to the other vegetables.

To make the Sauce:  In a large saucepan over low heat, melt the butter.  Add the curry powder and cook for 1 minute to bring out the flavor.  Add the flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Whisk in the chicken broth and simmer until the sauce thickens.

Add the cooked vegetables, turkey, parsley, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to the sauce.  Stir and simmer for 1 minute.  Transfer the mixture to an ovenproof 10-inch skillet or deep 10-inch pie pan.

On a lightly floured surface roll out the puff pastry to 1/8-inch thickness.  Lay the pastry over the skillet, trimming any excess with a knife.  Cut three or four slashes in the pastry to allow steam to escape.  Beat the egg with 2 teaspoons water; lightly brush the entire surface of the pastry with the egg mixture.

Place the skillet on a small baking sheet and place on the cooking grate.  Grill over Indirect Medium heat until the filling is bubbling and the pastry is golden brown, 40 to 50 minutes.  Carefully remove the hot pan from the grill.  Allow the pie to cool for about 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  This homey comfort food demands but one wine to make a truly memorable and nostalgic match; Swanson Sangiovese, a medium-bodied Cal-Italian red from the Napa Valley.

Beer Recommendation:  The story goes that people asked the brewer "Is it wine or beer?" to which he replied, "It's SOMETHING ELSE!"  Did we mention that the brewer was a French-speaking Quebecois?  You must try "Quelque Chose" Quebec Spiced Cherry Beer to understand the true meaning of this story.  The beer is strong but light, fruity but tart, with a lambic base blended with whiskey malt.  The pot pie will be a happily pie-eyed foil for these complex flavors.  Quelque Chose really is Something Else.

Comments:  Best thing ever to happen to turkey leftovers.  And this homemade version is simply over the top.

The beer is strong but light, fruity but tart, with a lambic base blended with whiskey malt.  The pot pie will be a happily pie-eyed foil for these complex flavors.  Quelque Chose really is Something Else.

Comments:  Best thing ever to happen to turkey leftovers.  And this homemade version is simply over the top.

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     turkey - (12 to 14 lbs) -- fresh or defrosted
  8             medium  garlic cloves - (to 10)
  2               cups  Italian parsley leaves - (lightly packed)
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
  2                     oranges
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- softened
  2               cups  reduced-sodium chicken stock - (to 4)
  1              large  onion -- roughly chopped
  1              large  carrot -- roughly chopped
                        === GRAVY ===
  6        tablespoons  collected fat
                        = (use melted butter if necessary)
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  reduced-sodium chicken stock and
                        pan juices
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley

Remove the neck and giblets from the turkey cavity and reserve for another use.  If your turkey has a metal or plastic trussing clamp, leave it in place.  Rinse the turkey inside and out under cold water, and pat dry with paper towels.

Finely chop the garlic and parsley and place in a small bowl.  Add the salt, pepper, and chili powder.  With a grater, remove the zest from the oranges and add it to the bowl (reserve the oranges).  Add the butter.  With your fingers squeeze the butter and other ingredients in the bowl together until evenly distributed.

Starting from the neck end of the turkey, carefully separate the skin from the breast meat with your fingers.  Push about half of the butter mixture onto the breast meat under the skin and spread it out evenly.  Use the other half of the butter mixture to evenly cover the top and sides of the turkey.  Generously season the turkey with salt and pepper.

Quarter the oranges and place the sections in the cavity of the turkey.  Turn the wings back to hold the neck skin in place.  Return legs to tucked position inside the trussing clamp or tie them together with cotton string.

Put 2 cups of the chicken stock, the onion, and carrot inside a heavy-duty roasting pan.  Place the turkey, breast-side up, on a roasting rack, and set the rack inside the pan.  Cook the turkey over Indirect Medium heat, maintaining the grill's temperature about 350 degrees.

Check the turkey after the first hour.  If any parts are getting too dark, wrap them tightly with aluminum foil.  If the pan looks dry, moisten it with the remaining 2 cups of chicken stock so the pan drippings don't burn.

Check the turkey again after another hour.  Cover any dark areas with foil.  The turkey is done when the internal temperature of the thickest part of the thighs is 180 degrees and the internal temperature of the breast is 170 degrees.  Figure 11 to 13 minutes per pound for total grilling time, or 2 1/4 to 3 hours.  (Note: The internal temperatures will rise 5 to 10 degrees during resting.)

Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and allow to rest for 20 to 30 minutes before carving.  It will remain warm for 45 minutes.  Meanwhile make the gravy.

To make the Gravy:  Pour the juices from the roasting pan into a heatproof glass bowl or measuring cup, leaving any browned bits in the bottom of the roasting pan.  Let stand for 3 to 5 minutes while the clear yellow fat rises to the top of the juices.  Skim off the fat and put it in a small bowl.  If necessary, add enough melted butter to total 6 tablespoons of fat.

Place the roasting pan on a side burner or two stovetop burners set to medium heat.  Add the fat to the pan.  Sprinkle the flour into the pan.  Cook the mixture, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until it turns dark brown, 1 to 2 minutes.

Whisk in the stock and reserved juices (4 cups total) plus the wine, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Simmer for about 5 minutes, whisking occasionally.  If the gravy seems to thin, simmer it longer until it is as thick as you like.  If it seems too thick, add more stock.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Strain the gravy.  Add the parsley.  (Makes about 3 cups)

Carve the turkey and serve warm with the gravy.

This recipe yields 12 to 14 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Toast this dish with an American Pinot Noir.  Beer Recommendation:  Or raise a glass of a malty, domestic microbrew.

Comments:  You'll love your grill even more than before when you taste what it can do for a whole turkey.

The three most important points to remember are:  Use some flavored butter under the skin to keep the breast meat moist, maintain a reasonably even grilling temperature, and take the turkey off the heat while it's still juicy.  Oh, and good gravy helps a lot, too.

                             Vegetable Gratin

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     firm ripe plum tomatoes - (to 8) -- cored
  2              small  zucchini -- trimmed, and
                        halved lengthwise
  1                     red bell pepper -- quartered, stemmed,
                        and seeded
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
  1                cup  shredded Gruyere cheese
  1                cup  soft breadcrumbs
  1         tablespoon  grated Parmesan cheese

Lightly brush or spray the tomatoes, zucchini, and bell pepper with the olive oil.  Grill vegetables over Direct Medium heat, turning once halfway through grilling time.  The bell pepper quarters will take 10 minutes, the tomatoes will take 8 minutes, and the zucchini will take 6 minutes.

Set aside until cool enough to handle, then remove skins from the tomatoes and peppers.  Cut all the vegetables into 1/2-inch pieces.  Place cut tomatoes in a strainer set over a bowl to remove excess juices.

Place strained tomatoes, zucchini, and bell pepper pieces in a large bowl.  Add basil, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste.  Stir to blend.

In another large bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk, then mix in the Gruyere cheese.  Add to the vegetables and stir to combine.  Pour entire mixture into a 9-inch square heavy-gauge metal baking pan or a 10-inch heavy-gauge metal pie pan.  Sprinkle the top evenly with the breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese.

Grill over Direct Low heat until edges are browned and center is set, 23 to 25 minutes.  Cool slightly before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A celebration of veggies with a cheese and egg sauce calls for a medium-bodied red wine with forward fruit.  Try a young Malbec from Argentina, a trendy New World wine that will match the earthy grilled flavors and the rich sauce.

Beer Recommendation:  If it's in season, reach for an Oktoberfest lager.  The creamy bitterness and complex spiciness of Germany's celebrated celebration beer will complement the veggies and herbs.  A nice way to make the most of a bountiful garden -- including the beer garden!

Comments:  A chunky medley of tomatoes, zucchini, and red bell pepper gets a flavor boost from the grill and a velvety coat from the cheese sauce.  Serve as a side dish or hearty entrÈe.

                Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     radicchio head -- rinsed, discolored
                        leaves removed, cut into 6 or 8 segments
  3                     Belgian endives -- rinsed, and
  1                     halved lengthwise
  2                     zucchini -- rinsed, ends
                        trimmed, cut 1/4" lengthwise slices
  2                     yellow squash (or summer squash) -- cut like zucchini
  3                     portabello caps -- rinsed, dried
  5                     green onions -- rinsed, and
                        roots removed
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  salad dressing - (to 1/2)
                        = (Italian herb, balsamic, Caesar, or
                        roasted garlic)
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley

Toss all vegetables with olive oil, salt, and pepper.

Cook all the vegetables on a hot grill until they are just barely soft.  Approximate times for the vegetables are: radicchio - abut 4 minutes endives - about 3 to 4 minutes zucchini - about 4 to 5 minutes yellow squash - about 4 to 5 minutes portabello - about 5 to 8 minutes, although it really depends on the size of the caps green onion - about 2 minutes

On a large cutting board, slice each vegetable into pieces about two inches long.  Place all the grilled vegetables in a bowl.  Mix gently with salad dressing and parsley.  Taste if additional salt or pepper is needed.

This salad can be served hot or cold.  If it is not eaten for several hours (or even the next day) keep refrigerated and taste before serving as additional dressing may be necessary.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This recipe calls for specific vegetables, but you could vary it by using whatever vegetables you desire.  Just remember that certain vegetables like carrots and asparagus do better on the grill if they are first cooked in a steamer or in boiling water.

Cook all the vegetables on a hot grill until they are just barely soft.  Approximate times for the vegetables are: radicchio - abut 4 minutes endives - about 3 to 4 minutes zucchini - about 4 to 5 minutes yellow squash - about 4 to 5 minutes portabello - about 5 to 8 minutes, although it really depends on the size of the caps green onion - about 2 minutes
</DirT>
<DirT>
On a large cutting board, slice each vegetable into pieces about two inches long.  Place all the grilled vegetables in a bowl.  Mix gently with salad dressing and parsley.  Taste if additional salt or pepper is needed.

<DirT>
This salad can be served hot or cold.  If it is not eaten for several hours (or even the next day) keep refrigerated and taste before serving as additional dressing may be necessary.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This recipe calls for specific vegetables, but you could vary it by using whatever vegetables you desire.  Just remember that certain vegetables like carrots and asparagus do better on the grill if they are first cooked in a steamer or in boiling water.

                        Warm Beet And Onion Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Salads/Dressings
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  golden beets with leafy tops -- (2 1/2" dia ea)
  2             medium  red beets with leafy tops -- (2 1/2" dia ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        === DRESSING ===
  1             medium  orange
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  finely-sliced fresh basil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SALAD ===
  1              large  red onion -- cut four 1/2" slices
  2                     romaine lettuce hearts

Trim the leafy tops from the beets, leaving about 1/2 inch attached; reserve the tops.  Leave the root ends intact.  Scrub the beets under cold water.  Lightly spray or brush with olive oil.

Grill over Indirect Medium heat until tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 1 to 1 1/2 hours depending on size, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill and allow to stand until cool enough to handle.

Trim the ends from the beets and discard.  Rub off the skins.  Cut the beets into 1/4- to 1/2-inch slices and place the red beets and the golden beets in separate bowls (to keep the red beets from dying the golden beets red).

To make the Dressing:  Wash the dry the orange.  With a zester, scrape off 1 tablespoon of zest.  Alternatively, use a vegetable peeler to remove enough strips of zest to total 1 tablespoon when finely chopped.  Reserve the zest.

Cut the remaining skin and white pith from the orange and, working over a separate medium bowl, separate the orange into sections, letting the sections and any juice fall into the bowl.  Add the reserved zest and the remaining dressing ingredients to the orange sections, including pepper to taste.  Gently stir to combine.

Lightly brush the onion slices with some of the dressing and grill over Direct Medium heat until tender, 10 to 12 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove from the grill and allow to cool slightly, then separate into rings.

Rinse the reserved leafy tops of the beets under cold water.  Select the smallest, most tender leaves and place with the romaine lettuce in a large bowl.  Add half of the dressing and toss.

Divide the lettuce mixture among four salad plates.  Top with the beets and the onion rings and drizzle on the remaining dressing.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Try a Cava, the dry, mÈthode champenoise sparkler from Spain.  Light- to medium-bodied, it will pick up all the attractive flavors and textures of the salad and add a refreshing acidity.

Beer Recommendation:  BiËre de garde from Flanders (France/Belgium) creates a tasty backgrounder for the sweetness of the warm beets and a palate cleanser for the char of the onions.

Comments:  The grill intensifies the sweetness and flavor of beets for a result you just can't get from a can.  If the beet tops are tender and unblemished, use them as part of the greens in the salad.  Otherwise, use three romaine hearts.  If you can't find golden beets, all red beets will do.  Great served as a light lunch or a first course to a special dinner.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PUDDING BATTER ===
  4                     eggs
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  1                     vanilla bean -- black seeds only
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1 3/4           cups  milk
  1 1/2           cups  flour
                        === SAUCE ===
  2               cans  bing cherries in juice - (16 1/2 oz ea)
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  cold water
                        === TO FINISH AND SERVE ===
                        Nonstick cooking spray -- as needed
                        Whipped cream
                        = (or vanilla or cherry ice cream)

To make the Pudding Batter:  In large mixing bowl beat eggs and sugar until frothy.  Add rum, vanilla, and salt; beat well.  Add milk and flour; mix to combine.  Set aside.

Strain cherries, reserving juice.  Set cherries aside.

Make the Sauce:  In a small saucepan, combine cherry juice, sugar, and rum.  Bring to a boil.  Meanwhile, dissolve cornstarch in water, stirring until smooth.  Whisk cornstarch liquid into hot cherry juice mixture.  Return to a boil; boil one minute, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.

Spray a flameproof 10-inch round baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.  Pour 1/3 of batter in bottom of pan; cover with the cherries.  Pour remaining batter over cherries.

Place baking dish in center of cooking grate.  Cook 40 to 45 minutes.  Serve warm with cherry juice sauce.  Top with whipped cream or ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A special dessert wine for this special dessert; a five-year old Malmsey from Madeira (off the coast of Portugal) will make a darkly sweet backdrop for the vanilla and cherry.

Beer Recommendation:  A cherry-flavored beer makes a great playmate for this darling dessert.  Pick one that's sweet, not tart.

Comments:  This traditional-style English pudding is so thick, it's almost like a soft cake.  It tastes wonderful served warm right from the grill and even gently reheated the next day.

Note:  To remove vanilla seeds, slit vanilla bean pod in half lengthwise.  Carefully scrape out the tiny black seeds with the tip of a sharp knife.  Save the empty pod and store it for up to six months in granulated sugar.  Use the vanilla-flavored sugar for coffee, whipped cream, or baking.  Use the emptied pod to flavor a custard or dessert sauce.

To make the Pudding Batter:  In large mixing bowl beat eggs and sugar until frothy.  Add rum, vanilla, and salt; beat well.  Add milk and flour; mix to combine.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain cherries, reserving juice.  Set cherries aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the Sauce:  In a small saucepan, combine cherry juice, sugar, and rum.  Bring to a boil.  Meanwhile, dissolve cornstarch in water, stirring until smooth.  Whisk cornstarch liquid into hot cherry juice mixture.  Return to a boil; boil one minute, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spray a flameproof 10-inch round baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.  Pour 1/3 of batter in bottom of pan; cover with the cherries.  Pour remaining batter over cherries.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place baking dish in center of cooking grate.  Cook 40 to 45 minutes.  Serve warm with cherry juice sauce.  Top with whipped cream or ice cream.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  A special dessert wine for this special dessert; a five-year old Malmsey from Madeira (off the coast of Portugal) will make a darkly sweet backdrop for the vanilla and cherry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beer Recommendation:  A cherry-flavored beer makes a great playmate for this darling dessert.  Pick one that&apos;s sweet, not tart.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This traditional-style English pudding is so thick, it&apos;s almost like a soft cake.  It tastes wonderful served warm right from the grill and even gently reheated the next day.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  To remove vanilla seeds, slit vanilla bean pod in half lengthwise.  Carefully scrape out the tiny black seeds with the tip of a sharp knife.  Save the empty pod and store it for up to six months in granulated sugar.  Use the vanilla-flavored sugar for coffee, whipped cream, or baking.  Use the emptied pod to flavor a custard or dessert sauce.

                       Whole Stuffed Grilled Salmon

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STUFFING ===
  3             slices  bacon
  1              large  onion -- diced
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  10                    fresh sage leaves -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  ground dried Mediterranean oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  fennel seed
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR THE SALMON ===
  1              whole  salmon - (abt 4 lbs) -- boned for stuffing,
                        and scaled
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6                     thin slices lemon
                        Olive oil -- for brushing salmon

To make the Stuffing:  Freeze bacon; dice small.  In skillet cook bacon over low heat until lightly browned, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Add onion and garlic; sautÈ 4 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in remaining stuffing ingredients.  Chill completely.

Lay salmon, skin-side down, on work surface; season flesh with sea salt and pepper.  Lay 3 lemon slices on each side of salmon.  Spread chilled stuffing on one side and fold other side of salmon over the mixture.  Tie salmon with butcher's twine or use metal skewers to hold salmon closed.  Cover tail with foil.  Brush salmon with olive oil.

Place salmon in center of cooking grate.  Grill 30 to 45 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling time.  Remove salmon from grill and let stand 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A Sauvignon Blanc (California) or a Pouilly-FumÈ (Loire Valley)... whatever you call it, it's the right wine for this dinner.

Beer Recommendation:  Rich bacon and velvety salmon?  Reach for a honey ale with some acidity to cut through the richness and accent the sweet notes.

Comments:  This whole salmon offers dramatic visual presentation that's upstaged only by its flavor.
