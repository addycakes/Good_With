  6             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar
     1/2           cup  slivered almonds -- chopped fine
  2               cans  refrigerated crescent dinner rolls - -- (8 oz ea)
  1                     egg white
  1           teaspoon  water
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar
  4          teaspoons  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract

In a small bowl, beat the cream cheese, almond extract, and sugar until fluffy.  Fold half of the chopped almonds into the cream cheese mixture.  Separate 1 can of dough and assemble into 4 rectangles.  Firmly press the perforations to seal.  Press or roll each piece of dough to form a 7 by 4-inch rectangle, and spread each with about 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese filling to within 1/4-inch of the edges.  Starting at the short end, roll each rectangle tightly into a cylinder.  Repeat with the other can of dough and remaining filling.

Place on a plate, cover with plastic wrap, and chill until firm, about 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees while the rolls are chilling.

Remove from the refrigerator and cut each roll into 4 slices.  Place 1/2-inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.  In a small bowl, combine the egg white with 1 teaspoon water.  Brush over the swirls.  Sprinkle with the remaining chopped almonds.  Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until light brown.

While the swirls are baking, combine the glaze ingredients in a small bowl.  Cool the swirls for 3 minutes on wire racks placed over a sheet of waxed paper.  Drizzle the icing over the warm swirls.

This recipe yields 32 swirls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  chicken flavor instant rice and pasta
                        mixture - (6.9 oz)
  1                jar  marinated artichoke hearts - (6 oz) -- quartered
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
     1/2                green bell pepper -- chopped
  4                     green onions, white and green parts -- chopped
  12                    pimiento-stuffed green olives - (to 14) -- sliced
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  small or medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined

In a skillet sprayed with vegetable oil cooking spray, brown the instant rice and pasta mixture.  Do not add the butter or oil that the package directions suggest.  Add the water the package requires and the seasoning packet and prepare according to package directions.

Drain the artichoke hearts and reserve the marinade.  In a small bowl, whisk the marinade and the mayonnaise to combine.  Add the archichoke hearts, green pepper, green onions, olives, curry powder, salt and pepper, to taste, and mix together.

If serving this recipe cold, cook the shrimp in a small amount of salted water for about 3 to 4 minutes, until firm and cooked through.  Test a shrimp to see if it is the texture you like.  If you are going to serve this as a hot casserole, just plunge the shrimp into boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes and drain.  Do not overcook.

Add the artichoke mixture to the rice and pasta mixture.  Gently stir in the cooked shrimp.  If serving as a salad, chill until ready to serve.  If serving as a casserole, preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place in a 2 1/2-quart casserole dish and bake for 20 minutes, until heated through.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                      Bert's Southern Fried Chicken

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (abt 3 lbs) -- washed, and
                        cut into 8 serving pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  all-purpose or self-rising flour
  3                     eggs
     1/3           cup  milk
                        Peanut oil -- for frying

Liberally sprinkle each piece of chicken with salt and pepper several hours before cooking.  Place it in a dish, covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator.

Place the flour in a plastic kitchen storage bag.  When ready to cook, beat the eggs with the milk.  Dip the chicken pieces into the egg mixture, then place each piece in the bag.  Shake until chicken is coated.  Set the floured chicken on a plate while you heat the oil.  Pour enough oil into a cast-iron skillet to come only about halfway up the sides of the pan.  This is important, as the oil rises when each piece of chicken is added.

Turn the heat to medium-high; test by adding a drop of water to the oil.  If it sizzles, the oil is ready; this takes about 4 to 5 minutes.  Place about 4 pieces of chicken into the hot oil.  Allow to cook on the first side about 8 minutes, and on the second about 6 minutes, until brown and crispy.  Pieces with large bones, the legs and thighs, may need an additional minute per side to get completely done.  Remove the chicken from the oil and drain well on brown paper bags.  Cook the second batch of chicken.

Wrap tightly in aluminum foil to keep warm or place in aluminum pans with parchment paper between layers of chicken.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Cook's Note:  Be careful not to let the oil spill out while the chicken is frying; it can cause serious burns or cause a grease fire if the grease lands on a gas flame or electric cooktop.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  eggplants
  1           teaspoon  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  5        tablespoons  butter
  1                can  minced clams - (10 oz) -- drained, and
                        juice reserved

     1/2           cup  half-and-half

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Peel the eggplant and cut it into thin rounds.  Bring a pot of water to a boil.  Add the House Seasoning, then the eggplant, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender.  Drain the eggplant well and mash it with 3 tablespoons of the butter.

In a greased casserole, layer the mashed eggplant, the clams, and the cracker crumbs.  Dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.

Blend the half-and-half with the reserved clam juice.  Taste and add salt, if needed.  Pour mixture over the casserole, but be sure to use only enough liquid to fully saturate the dish, otherwise, the dish will become too soupy.  Bake for 30 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             packet  unflavored gelatin
  1         tablespoon  cold water -- for softening
                        gelatin
     1/4           cup  milk -- room temperature
  3               cups  heavy cream
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1         tablespoon  homemade vanilla extract
                        = (or 1 tspn pure vanilla extract)
                        Homemade angel food cake or ladyfingers
  2        tablespoons  sweet sherry
                        = (don't use cooking sherry)
     1/2           cup  fruit preserves -- (optional)
  7              large  egg whites
                        Fresh berries or cut fruit -- for garnish

Soften the gelatin in a bowl with the water.  Pour in the milk and completely dissolve the gelatin.  Let it sit while you prepare rest of filling, stirring it every now and again to keep gelatin from separating and settling to bottom.

Sweeten 2 cups of the cream with 1 cup of the sugar and beat it with a handheld electric mixer until it is fairly stiff.  Add vanilla and fold it in.  Stir in dissolved gelatin and gently but thoroughly fold it into whipped cream and set it aside.

Cut cake into ladyfinger-sized pieces, about 1/2-inch thick by 1-inch wide and as long as your mold is deep.  Line bottom and sides of a 3-quart mold or bowl with cake, being sure that there are no gaps in it.  Hold back enough cake to cover top of mold or bowl.  Sprinkle cake with sherry and spread it with a thin layer of jam or fruit preserves, if using.

Beat egg whites to stiff but not dry peaks with a handheld electric mixer, then fold thoroughly into whipped cream and gelatin filling.  Spoon filling into cake-lined mold, making sure there are no gaps or air pockets between filling and cake.  Press reserved cake on top of filling.

Chill until cream is set, 4 to 6 hours.  When you are ready to serve, gently run a knife around edges of mold to make sure that the Charlotte has not stuck to it, then invert onto plate.  Carefully lift off mold.

Lightly sweeten remaining 1 cup cream with remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until it is stiff.  If you like, you can put it into a pastry bag and pipe it onto the Charlotte, or simply spoon it on, using it to cover any gaps or splits in outer layer of cake.  Garnish with fresh fruit.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

The American Egg Board states:  "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell..."

                        Shredded sharp Cheddar
                        Sour cream

Remove the biscuit bowls and reserve.

Brown the ground chuck over medium heat in a Dutch oven.  Add the onion and green pepper and continue to cook until the meat is completely browned and the vegetables are tender.  Drain off any fat and discard.  Stir in the tomatoes, beans, chili powder, and salt.  Bring the mixture to a boil, cover, and reduce the heat to low.  Simmer for 35 minutes.

When ready to serve, spoon the hot chili into the biscuit bowls.  Garnish with shredded cheese, sour cream, sliced green onions, and corn chips.

  2           packages  raspberry gelatin - (3 oz ea)
     1/2      envelope  unflavored gelatin
  1                cup  boiling water
     1/2           cup  cold water
  8             ounces  canned crushed pineapple packed in its
                        own juice
  1                can  whole cranberry sauce - (15 oz)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped walnuts
                        === TOPPING ===
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz)
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar
  2        tablespoons  whipped cream
     1/4           cup  walnuts

Spray a 4-cup gelatin mold or a 9-inch square pan with vegetable oil cooking spray.  In a medium glass mixing bowl, combine the raspberry gelatin and unflavored gelatin.  Add 1 cup boiling water and stir with a metal spoon continuously for 2 minutes, until the gelatin is completely dissolved.  Stir in 1/2 cup cold water.  Add the pineapple and juice, cranberry sauce, and walnuts.  Stir with a metal spoon until all ingredients are completely incorporated.  Pour the mixture into the prepared mold, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm.

About 1 hour before serving, invert the mold onto a serving platter and allow to sit at room temperature; the salad will release itself and come clean from the mold.

Combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, whipped cream and walnuts in bowl.  Spoon into the center of the mold.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Spray a 4-cup gelatin mold or a 9-inch square pan with vegetable oil cooking spray.  In a medium glass mixing bowl, combine the raspberry gelatin and unflavored gelatin.

Add the pineapple and juice, cranberry sauce, and walnuts.  Stir with a metal spoon until all ingredients are completely incorporated.  Pour the mixture into the prepared mold, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2         sticks  unsalted butter -- softened and sliced
                        === FILLING ===
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- softened
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === TOPPING ===
                        Fresh strawberries
                        Kiwi slices
                        Blueberries
                        Raspberries
                        === GLAZE ===
  1                can  frozen limeade concentrate - (6 oz) -- thawed
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
                        Whipped cream -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

For the Crust:  In a food processor, combine the confectioners' sugar, flour, and butter, and process until the mixture forms a ball.  With your fingers, press the dough into a 12-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, taking care to push the crust into the indentations in the sides.  Pat until the crust is even.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until very lightly browned.  Set aside to cool.

For the Filling and Topping:  Beat the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla together until smooth.  Spread over the cooled crust.  Cut the strawberries into 1/4-inch slices and arrange around the edge of the crust.  For the next circle, use kiwi slices.  Add another circle of strawberries, filling in any spaces with blueberries.  Cluster the raspberries in the center of the tart.

For the Glaze:  Combine the limeade, cornstarch, lime juice, and sugar in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until clear and thick, about 2 minutes.  Let cool.  With a pastry brush, glaze the entire tart.  You will not use all of the glaze.

Keep the tart in the refrigerator.  Remove about 15 minutes before serving.  Slice into 8 wedges and serve with a dollop of whipped cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sugar
  2               cups  water
  4              pints  strawberries -- hulled and sliced
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup

Bring the sugar and 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat and allow the mixture to simmer, without stirring, until the sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes.  Set aside to cool completely.

Put the strawberries and lime juice into a food processor and puree.  Press the strawberry puree through a strainer to remove the seeds.

When the sugar syrup has cooled completely add it to the strawberry puree.  Add the corn syrup and stir well.  Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Sorbet is particularly soft after churning but firms up after freezing.

This recipe yields 10 1/2 cups (about 2 quarts).

  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  water
  2               cups  desired fruit (fresh/ frozen or dried)

In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the sugar and water to a boil to make simple syrup.  Add your favorite fruit and cook over medium-low heat until the desired thickness, 30 minutes to 1 hour.  Use immediately or follow USDA guidelines for proper canning.

Tips on Sterilizing Jars

Properly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years. Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods.

Sterilizing Tips:

Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks. Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal. Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed.

To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water. Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray. Leave in a preheated 175 degree F oven for 25 minutes. Or, boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.

Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from either boiling water or the oven. Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.

As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars. All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean. This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.

After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food. It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1              stick  butter or margarine -- softened
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  molasses
  3 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting work surface
  2          teaspoons  ground ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === ICING ===
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar -- sifted
  1         tablespoon  milk - (to 2)
                        Food coloring -- as desired

Using an electric mixer at low speed, cream the sugar and butter until thoroughly combined.  Add the eggs and molasses and mix until combined.  Sift together the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.  Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and combine with a spoon or spatula.

Remove the dough from the bowl and wrap in plastic wrap; place in the refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.  Allow the dough to sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes, until pliable.  Take about 1/2 cup of dough at a time and roll onto a floured board until about 1/8-inch thick.  Cut out with gingerbread boy and girl cookie cutters.  You can re-roll the scraps.  Using a spatula, transfer the cookies from the board to the prepared cookie sheets.

Bake for 10 minutes, until just beginning to brown at the edges.  Transfer to wire racks to cool.

To make the icing, combine the confectioners' sugar and milk.  Divide the mixture into thirds; leave 1/3 white, and color 1/3 green and the final third red.  Decorate piping eyes, mouths, buttons, and bow ties.

This recipe yields 18 to 24 cookies.

                         Gooey Toffee Butter Cake

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 24    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1                     box yellow cake mix - (18.25 oz)
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- softened
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                     box confectioners' sugar - (16 oz)
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted
  1                cup  almond toffee bits or chocolate toffee
                        bits

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a 13- by 9- by-2-inch baking pan.

For the cake:  In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the cake mix, egg, and butter and mix well.  Pat into the bottom of prepared pan and set aside.

For the filling:  Still using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until smooth.  Beat in the eggs and vanilla.  Dump in confectioners' sugar and beat well.  Reduce the speed and slowly pour in butter.  Mix well.  Fold in toffee bits.

Pour filling onto cake mixture and spread evenly.  Bake for 40 to 50 minutes.  Don't be afraid to make a judgment call on the cooking time, because oven temperatures can vary.  You want the center to be a little gooey, so don't bake it past that point!

Remove from oven and allow to cool completely.  Cut into squares.  Just remember that these wonderful cakes are very, very rich, and a little will go a long way.

This recipe yields 20 to 24 squares.

                      Green Beans With New Potatoes

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  fresh green beans
     1/4         pound  salt pork -- sliced
     1/4           cup  bacon grease
  2               cups  chicken broth -- plus
                        more if needed
  2          teaspoons  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  12             small  red potatoes
  1                     onion -- cut into slivers
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter -- sliced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Remove the ends from the beans.  Snap the beans in 2 pieces, place into a colander, wash, and set aside to drain.

Meanwhile, in a large cast-iron Dutch oven, lightly brown the salt pork in the bacon grease over medium heat, turning often, for approximately 10 minutes.  Toss the green beans into the pot, stirring them with a wooden spoon to coat well with the pork fat.  Add the broth and House Seasoning.  Cook over medium-low heat, covered tightly, for approximately 30 minutes, or until the beans are half done.

While the beans are cooking, peel a center strip from each new potato with a potato peeler.  At the end of 30 minutes, add the potatoes and onion to the beans; add 1/4 cup more broth, if needed.  Cook, covered tightly, until the potatoes are tender, approximately 25 to 30 minutes, periodically checking the pot to make sure a small amount of liquid remains.  When the potatoes are tender, tilt the lid slightly, off to the side of the pot, and continue to cook until the green beans are wilted, approximately 15 minutes.  While cooking, add the butter and season with pepper.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     frying chicken - (3 1/2 lbs) -- cut up
                        = (or your favorite chicken parts)
  2              large  eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Garlic powder -- to taste
                        Vegetable shortening or vegetable oil
  2               cups  self-rising flour
  1                cup  butter - (2 sticks)
     1/2           cup  honey
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped pecans
                        Brown paper bag

Rinse the chicken and pat it dry.  Beat the eggs in a 9- by 13-inch dish.  Lay the chicken pieces in the dish, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Turn the chicken and season the other side, then slosh the chicken parts around in the egg until well coated.

Put enough shortening or oil in a cast-iron pan or electric skillet to come just halfway up the sides of the chicken parts.  Heat the shortening or oil just until smoking, about 375 degrees.  Put the flour in a paper bag, add the chicken pieces, a few at a time, and shake to coat well.  Remove the chicken with tongs and place it in the hot fat.  Cover the pan, leaving a crack for steam to escape, lower the heat to 325 degrees for electric skillet, and cook for 10 minutes.  Turn the chicken with tongs, cover again (leaving the lid open just a crack), and cook for 10 minutes longer.  Very large pieces may need to be cooked a little longer.  Drain the chicken on paper towels and transfer to a platter.

To make the glaze, melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat.  Whisk in the honey until well blended.  Bring to a simmer and add the pecans.  Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Ladle the glaze over the hot fried chicken and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  They have deep-fat fryers at the Pirates' House.  If you have one at home, by all means use it.

  1            package  yellow cake mix - (18 1/2 oz)
  1            package  instant lemon pudding mix - (3 1/2 oz)
  4              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
                        === GLAZE ===
  4               cups  confectioners' sugar
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1                     lemon -- zested
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  water

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spray miniature muffin tins with vegetable oil cooking spray.  Combine the cake mix, pudding mix, eggs and oil and blend well with an electric mixer until smooth, about 2 minutes.  Pour a small amount of batter, filling each muffin tin half way.  Bake for 12 minutes.  Turn out onto a tea towel.

To make the Glaze, sift the sugar into a mixing bowl.  Add the lemon juice, zest, oil, and 3 tablespoons water.  Mix with a spoon until smooth.

With fingers, dip the cupcakes into the glaze while they're still warm, covering as much of the cake as possible, or spoon the glaze over the warm cupcakes, turning them to completely coat.  Place on wire racks with waxed paper underneath to catch any drips.  Let the glaze set thoroughly,  about 1 hour, before storing in containers with tight-fitting lids.

This recipe yields 5 dozen.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  sliced fresh mushrooms
     3/4           cup  chopped green bell pepper
  2                     pizza crusts - (12" dia) -- (12-inch)
                        = (or frozen cheese pizzas)
  2               jars  chunky salsa - (16 oz ea)
  2           packages  shredded Mexican cheese - (8 oz ea)
                        = (Monterey Jack, Cheddar, and other mild
                        cheeses combined)
  1                can  sliced black olives - (2 1/4 oz)
  1                cup  chopped cooked ham
                        Shredded lettuce
                        Sour cream

Position the oven rack at the lowest level.  If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven on the rack.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Heat the oil in a small saucepan and cook the mushrooms and green pepper over medium heat until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Cut the crusts into biscuit sized pieces using a biscuit cutter.  Distribute the vegetables evenly over the crusts.  Reserve 1 cup of the salsa and spoon the remaining salsa evenly over the pizzas.  If you don't have a pizza stone, place the pizzas on a baking sheet.  They won't be as crisp as they would be if you placed them directly on the rack, but this is a lot less messy.

Bake the pizzas for 10 to 12 minutes, then sprinkle with the cheese.  Bake for 7 minutes more.  Serve the pizza slices topped with the reserved salsa, olives, cooked ham, shredded lettuce, and sour cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cook's Tip:  For a Greek style pizza, use olives, tapenade, spinach, and feta cheese.  For an Italian style pizza, use tomato sauce and provolone cheese.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar -- plus
                        more for coating baked cookies
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Pies

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  peeled cooked sweet potatoes
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
     1/2         stick  melted butter
  2                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        = (or 1 to 2 tbspns bourbon)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
  1                cup  milk
  1                     unbaked 9" pie crust
  3                     egg whites

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

For the filling, using an electric hand mixer, combine the potatoes, 1 cup of the sugar, the butter, eggs, vanilla, salt, and spices.  Mix thoroughly.  Add the milk and continue to mix.  Pour the filling into the pie crust and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Place the pie on a rack and cool to room temperature before covering with meringue.

For the meringue, using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form; beat in the remaining 1/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon at a time.  Continue beating until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is glossy and stiff, but not dry.  With a rubber spatula, spoon the meringue onto the pie, forming peaks.  Make sure the meringue touches the crust all around.  Sprinkle with a pinch of granulated sugar.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until delicately browned.  Cool and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1                cup  butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2               cups  sugar
  4                     eggs
  3               cups  sifted self-rising flour
  1                cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        Lemon wedge -- for garnish
                        Mint sprig -- for garnish
                        === FROSTING ===
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
                        = (or 1 tbspn white corn syrup)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  water
  2                     egg whites
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
  8                     egg yolks
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
  3                     lemons -- zest grated and
                        juiced

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour 3 (9-inch) cake pans.

To make the Cake:  Using an electric mixer, cream butter until fluffy.  Add sugar and continue to cream well for 6 to 8 minutes.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add flour and milk alternately to creamed mixture, beginning and ending with flour.  Add vanilla and continue to beat until just mixed.  Divide batter equally among prepared pans.  Level batter in each pan by holding pan 3 or 4 inches above counter, then dropping flat onto counter.  Do this several times to release air bubbles and assure you of a more level cake.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool in pans 5 to 10 minutes.  Invert cakes onto cooling racks.  Cool completely.

To make the Frosting:  Place sugar, cream of tartar or corn syrup, salt, water, and egg whites in the top of a double boiler.  Beat with a handheld electric mixer for 1 minute.  Place pan over boiling water, being sure that boiling water does not touch the bottom of the top pan.  Beat constantly on high speed with electric mixer for 7 minutes.  Beat in vanilla.

To make the Filling:  Place the ingredients in the double boiler over boiling water.  Don't let top pan touch the water.  Cook and stir until mixture begins to gel or thicken.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

To assemble, add 1 tablespoon of filling to the cake pedestal.  Run hands along the side of the cake to remove excess crumbs.  Place the cake layers on the pedestal, spreading filling between the layers and on top.  Spread the sides and top of the cake with the remaining filling.  Frost top and sides of cake with frosting.  Garnish with a lemon wedge and a sprig of mint.

This recipe yields 16 to 20 servings.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour 3 (9-inch) cake pans.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Cake:  Using an electric mixer, cream butter until fluffy.  Add sugar and continue to cream well for 6 to 8 minutes.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add flour and milk alternately to creamed mixture, beginning and ending with flour.  Add vanilla and continue to beat until just mixed.  Divide batter equally among prepared pans.  Level batter in each pan by holding pan 3 or 4 inches above counter, then dropping flat onto counter.  Do this several times to release air bubbles and assure you of a more level cake.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool in pans 5 to 10 minutes.  Invert cakes onto cooling racks.  Cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Frosting:  Place sugar, cream of tartar or corn syrup, salt, water, and egg whites in the top of a double boiler.  Beat with a handheld electric mixer for 1 minute.  Place pan over boiling water, being sure that boiling water does not touch the bottom of the top pan.  Beat constantly on high speed with electric mixer for 7 minutes.  Beat in vanilla.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Filling:  Place the ingredients in the double boiler over boiling water.  Don&apos;t let top pan touch the water.  Cook and stir until mixture begins to gel or thicken.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble, add 1 tablespoon of filling to the cake pedestal.  Run hands along the side of the cake to remove excess crumbs.  Place the cake layers on the pedestal, spreading filling between the layers and on top.  Spread the sides and top of the cake with the remaining filling.  Frost top and sides of cake with frosting.  Garnish with a lemon wedge and a sprig of mint.

                             Peach Cream Tart

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
                        === FILLING ===
  6             medium  peaches -- peeled, sliced
                        = (or 1 [28-oz] can and 1 [16-oz] can
                        sliced peaches in light syrup, well
                        drained)
  3              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  sour cream
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  peach preserves or jelly -- warmed
  1         tablespoon  frozen lemonade concentrate

Preheat the oven the 375 degrees.

To make the Crust, place the flour, butter, and sour cream in food processor and pulse to combine.  When the dough has formed a ball, pat with lightly floured hands into the bottom and sides of an ungreased 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and 1/2-inch sides, or a round au gratin dish.  Bake for about 15 minutes, until the crust is set but not browned.  Let cool while preparing the filling.

Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees.

To make the Filling, if using fresh peaches, peel and thickly slice the peaches.  Arrange the fresh or canned peach slices in overlapping circles on top of the crust, until it's completely covered.  Overfill the crust, as peaches will draw up during cooking.  Combine the egg yolks, sour cream, sugar, and flour and beat until smooth.  Pour the mixture over the peaches.

Place the tart pan on a baking sheet and bake for about 1 hour, until the custard sets and is pale golden in color.  Cover with an aluminum foil tent if the crust gets too dark.

Transfer the tart pan to a wire rack to cool.  When cool, remove the side wall of the pan.  To make the glaze, combine the preserves or jelly and lemonade.  Spread with a pastry brush over the top of the warm tart.  Serve the tart warm, at room temperature, or chilled.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cook's Note:  If using fresh peaches, sprinkle with a little lemon juice after slicing.

  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
                        === FISH ===
  4                     grouper or snapper fillets abt 1" thick - -- (4 to 6 oz ea)
  1              stick  butter -- melted, plus
  1         tablespoon  whole butter
  1                cup  pecans -- ground into crumbs
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     lemon wedges -- for garnish

To prepare sauce, place the parsley, green onions, capers, and garlic in a blender or food processor and combine.  Add the mayonnaise, olive oil, lemon juice and mustard.  Blend well.  Chill until ready to serve with seafood.  This keeps in a covered container in the refrigerator for several weeks.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Rinse the fish, pat dry and season.  Dredge the fish in the melted butter.  Spread the ground pecans on a plate and press the fish into the crumbs to coat.  Turn the fillets and coat the other side.

In a cast-iron or other heavy, ovenproof skillet, heat the 1 tablespoon of whole butter with the oil.  When it begins to sizzle, sear the fish about 3 minutes per side.  Place the skillet in the oven for 6 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets and your preference for degree of doneness.  Serve immediately with Remoulade Sauce on the side and a lemon wedge.

This recipe yields 4 servings of fish, 1 1/2 cups of sauce.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  milk
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped green onion
  2                     egg yolks -- beaten
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  mashed potatoes
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Sifted dried bread crumbs
                        Peanut oil -- as needed

Add milk, salt, pepper, chopped onion, beaten egg yolks and flour to mashed potatoes.  Chill and then shape using an ice cream scoop.  Dip in the beaten egg, then roll through bread crumbs.

Fry each croquette in shallow oil (enough to fill pan 1/2 inch) until brown on all sides.

This recipe yields 15 croquettes.

Cook's Note:  Cook in small batches, giving each croquette at least 2 inches of space around it to not overcrowd the pan.  This prevents the croquettes from crumbling while frying.

                         Potato Soup With Shrimp

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         stick  butter
  1              small  onion -- diced
  2             medium  carrots -- diced about the
                        same size as the onion
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  8             medium  russet potatoes -- peeled and cubed
  4               cups  milk
                        = (whole, reduced fat (2 %) or
                        low fat (1 %))
  2                     chicken bouillon cubes -- dissolved in
     1/2           cup  hot milk
  1                cup  half-and-half
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  salted water
  1              pound  medium shrimp
                        Crumbled bacon bits -- for garnish
                        Grated sharp Cheddar -- for garnish
                        Dill sprigs -- optional garnish

In a 4-quart saucepan, melt the butter and saute the onion and carrots until both are slightly tender, about 5 minutes.  Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute.  Add the potatoes, milk, and dissolved bouillon cubes.  Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes, until the potatoes are very soft and some of them have begun to dissolve into mush.  Add the half-and-half, salt, and pepper.

In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups lightly salted water to a boil.  Add the shrimp all at once and stir well.  Watch the shrimp closely; as soon as they all turn pink, about 2 to 3 minutes, turn off the heat and drain.  The shrimp should be slightly undercooked.  When they are cool, peel them, and chop roughly into big chunks.  Add the shrimp to the soup and stir well.  Serve soup sprinkled with bacon bits and grated cheese.  Garnish with dill sprigs, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cook's Note:  If you don't have access to shrimp, use corn.

In a 4-quart saucepan, melt the butter and saute the onion and carrots until both are slightly tender, about 5 minutes.  Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute.  Add the potatoes, milk, and dissolved bouillon cubes.  Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes, until the potatoes are very soft and some of them have begun to dissolve into mush.  Add the half-and-half, salt, and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups lightly salted water to a boil.  Add the shrimp all at once and stir well.  Watch the shrimp closely; as soon as they all turn pink, about 2 to 3 minutes, turn off the heat and drain.  The shrimp should be slightly undercooked.  When they are cool, peel them, and chop roughly into big chunks.  Add the shrimp to the soup and stir well.  Serve soup sprinkled with bacon bits and grated cheese.  Garnish with dill sprigs, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cook&apos;s Note:  If you don&apos;t have access to shrimp, use corn.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  ground sausage - (16 oz)
  3               cups  baking mix
                        = (Bisquick recommended)
  4               cups  grated sharp Cheddar
     1/8    tablespoon  pepper
                        === DIP ===
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  mustard

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Spray a baking sheet with vegetable oil cooking spray.

Combine all ingredients in a large glass bowl.  Mix well with your fingers.  The mixture will be very crumbly.  Form into 1 inch balls, squeezing the mixture so it holds together, then rolling it between the palms of your hands to form balls.

Place the balls on the baking sheet.  Bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.  To prevent sticking, move the balls with a spatula halfway through cooking.

To make the dip, combine the mayonnaise and mustard.  Serve with sausage balls.

This recipe yields 5 dozen sausage balls, about 1 cup dip.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    lasagna noodles
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2           cups  half-and-half
  1                cup  grated Romano
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
     3/4         pound  sea scallops -- cut in half or
                        quartered if very large
     3/4         pound  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Spray a 13- by 10-inch aluminum foil pan with vegetable oil cooking spray.

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the lasagna noodles until they are just done, about 8 minutes.  Drain and set aside.

Melt the butter in a large, heavy skillet and cook the onion over low heat until very soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook about 1 minute more.  Over medium-low heat, stir in the flour with a whisk, then gradually add the half-and-half, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly before adding more.  When the sauce has thickened to about the consistency of whipping cream, add the cheese and stir well.  Add the salt and pepper and stir again.  Add the scallops and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes, then add the shrimp and cook for 1 to 2 minutes or just until the shrimp turn pink.  Turn off the heat.

Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the sauce from the skillet into the prepared pan.  Cover the bottom of the pan with 4 noodles, placing them side by side.  Spoon 1/3 of the sauce over the noodles, distributing half of the seafood evenly.  Layer 4 more noodles, 1/3 of the sauce, and remaining seafood.  Cover with the last 4 noodles and the remaining sauce.  (For the top layer, do not spoon any seafood on top of the noodles; just use the sauce.)  Tuck in any edges of the noodles so they're all coated with sauce.  Top with the Parmesan.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, uncovered, until bubbly.  Allow to sit for 10 minutes before slicing.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

     1/2      teaspoon  paprika

  1                cup  whipped cream
                        Lemon slices
  1              bunch  parsley -- washed and dried
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
  1                     fish mold
                        === DILL SAUCE ===
  1                     English cucumber -- peeled, grated,
                        and drained for 1 hour
  1                cup  sour cream
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice

  1           teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  finely-chopped fresh dill

Grease a 4 cup fish mold with butter or mayonnaise.  Soften the gelatin in 1/4 cup cold water.  Add 1/2 cup boiling water and stir well, until the gelatin has dissolved.  Add the mayonnaise, lemon juice, lime juice, onion, hot sauce, paprika, and salt and mix well.  Fold in the salmon and capers.  Add the whipped cream and continue folding until everything is well combined.  Pour the mixture into the prepared mold.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TASSIE CUPS ===
  1            package  cream cheese - (3 oz) -- softened
     1/2           cup  butter or margarine -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour

                              Turkey Pot Pie

Recipe By     :Paula Deen

                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Flour -- for dusting
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry
  1                     egg -- beaten
     1/2           cup  milk
  2               cans  condensed Cheddar cheese soup - (11 oz ea)
  2               cans  cream of celery soup - (10 3/4 oz ea)
  1              large  turkey -- skinned, cooked,
                        boned and cubed
  2             medium  onions -- diced
  2               cups  cooked butternut squash -- diced
  2               cups  cranberries
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

To make the crust, dust surface with flour.  Cut 1 sheet of frozen puff pastry into 1-inch strips, 8 inches long.  On a large cookie sheet, weave strips into a lattice large enough to cover each pot pie.  Mix egg and milk together and brush onto each lattice square.  Bake for 5 minutes.  Dough will rise and turn light golden brown.  Set aside until ready to assemble pies.

In a large saucepan heat the soups.  Stir in turkey, onion, squash, cranberries, salt and pepper.  Bring mixture to a boil.  In an oven-proof dish, fill with mixture and top with the pre-cooked lattice square.  Bake for 5 minutes until bubbly and puff pastry is deep golden brown.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Cook's Note: 
   ï Cutting the puff pastry with a fluted-wheel creates elegant edges. 
   ï Good substitutions for Cheddar cheese soup are cream of chicken soup and cream of mushroom soup.
