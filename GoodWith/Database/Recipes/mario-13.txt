                       A Real Pie - {Pizza Rustica}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  butter -- cubed
  2                     eggs -- plus
  1                     egg yolk -- plus
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2         pound  cooked ham -- chopped
     3/4         pound  smoked mozzarella -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Pile all the flour on a clean work surface and make a well in the center.  In the center of the well, place the butter, 2 eggs, egg yolk, and pinch of salt.  Knead all ingredients together to form a smooth, soft ball of dough.

Divide the dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other.  Roll the larger piece out until it is large enough to line the bottom of an 11-inch tart pan.  Prick it with a fork all over, then roll out the second piece of dough to approximately the same size as the first; it will be smaller but should fit over the tart pan like a lid.

Distribute the ham evenly over the bottom layer of dough.  Top with the mozzarella, then add the beaten eggs, reserving a tablespoon or two for brushing the top of the pastry.  Top with Parmigiano-Reggiano and fit the "lid" over the top, sealing the edges all the way around with finger pressure.

Brush the top with the reserved egg and bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Let rest 10 minutes before slicing into wedges and serving like pizza.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

         Almond-Crusted Fig Tart - {Crostata Di Fichi Mandorlati}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
     1/2           cup  blanched almonds -- lightly toasted
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds
  2          teaspoons  aniseeds
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- more, as needed
  6        tablespoons  very cold sweet butter -- cut small cubes
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten with
  1         tablespoon  cold water
                        Butter -- for tart tin
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  1              large  bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  aniseeds -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds -- crushed
  1              large  egg -- slightly beaten
  1         tablespoon  confectioners' sugar
  12                    black or green figs - (to 14)
  12             whole  blanched almonds - (to 14) -- lightly toasted
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar

Crust:  In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the almonds with the fennel and aniseeds, breaking into coarse crumbs.  Add 1 cup flour, 6 tablespoons butter, sugar, and salt and pulse 10 to 12 times to create the texture of coarse crumbs.  Add the egg mixture and pulse 8 to 10 times, just until the pastry begins to come together.

Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured board and form into a ball.  Flatten the ball and press the dough onto the surface of a buttered 10-inch tart pan.  Cover with plastic wrap and freeze 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Prick the surface of the pastry with a fork and bake 12 to 14 minutes, or until it is firm and pale gold.  Cool thoroughly.

Filling:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, bay leaf, aniseeds, and fennel seeds over high heat and bring to a simmer.  Lower the heat and let the cream infuse and reduce by 1/3.  Remove the pan from the flame, cover and permit to cool.  Strain the cream and add the egg and confectioners' sugar, blending carefully.

Starting at the base, slit each fig almost in half, leaving stem end intact.  Stuff each fig with an almond, press the halves together, and stand each fig up in the pastry shell.

Pour the custard around the figs.  Dust the top with brown sugar and bake for 25 minutes, or until the custard is set and crusted dark gold.  Cool for 10 minutes, then remove the tin, and cool 20 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  9        tablespoons  sweet butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  4        tablespoons  sweet wine -- Vin Santo
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  10 1/2        ounces  extra-bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  cocoa powder
  2              large  eggs -- plus
  1              large  egg yolk -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  aniseeds -- crushed
  1         tablespoon  anise liqueur -- plus
  2          teaspoons  anise liqueur
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  milk

In a food processor, pulse the flour, salt, confectioners' sugar, and cinnamon 2 or 3 times.  Add the butter and pulse until it resembles coarse crumbs.  With the machine running, pour the wine in all at once and process 4 to 5 seconds.  Turn the mixture out onto a sheet of plastic wrap, gently pressing it all into one ball.  Wrap tightly and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Roll the rested dough out between 2 sheets of plastic to 1/4-inch thickness.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Butter the bottom and sides of a 10-inch tart pan and line the pan with the dough.  Chill it well and bake in the oven 12 minutes.  Set aside to cool.  Reduce heat to 375 degrees.

In a saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream to a simmer.  Remove from the flame, add the chocolate, and stir to melt.  Let the mixture cool for 20 minutes.

Using a whisk, beat in the cocoa and eggs.  Add the aniseeds and 1 tablespoon liqueur, whisking again.  Pour the mixture into the tart shell and bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes, just until the chocolate forms a shiny skin and is slightly firm but unset at the center.  Cool for 15 minutes, then remove the tart from the pan to cool completely.

Beat the confectioners' sugar with the milk and remaining 2 teaspoons liqueur to a thin and pourable consistency.  Add a few drops of milk, if needed, to keep the glaze from getting too thick.  Drizzle the cooled tart with the glaze in a zig-zag pattern and allow the glaze to harden.  Serve with anise liqueur.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                Artichokes With Eggs - {Carciofi All'Uova}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lemon -- halved
  4                     artichokes
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 3)
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  2                     eggs
     1/4           cup  grated caciocavallo cheese
                        = (or pecorino or Parmigiano-Reggiano)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Squeeze the juice of half the lemon into a bowl of water large enough to hold the artichokes.  Trim the artichokes down to the heart, rubbing the cut surfaces with the lemon half to keep them from browning.  Remove the choke, cut the artichokes into small chunks, and then toss the chunks into the acidulated water.

Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan and add the garlic and parsley.  Saute for 2 to 3 minutes, then drain the artichoke pieces, and add to the pan.  Cook until the artichokes are very tender, about 10 minutes, adding a little water if necessary.

Beat the eggs in a medium bowl with the cheese and salt and pepper, to taste.  Remove the artichoke pan from the heat, stir in the egg mixture, and return to medium-low heat.  Stir the mixture constantly until the eggs are just set.  Remove from heat and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     thin slices pancetta -- plus
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped pancetta
  8                     thin boneless beef cutlets -- pounded thinly
                        = (from the eye-round)
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  1         tablespoon  salted capers -- rinsed, drained
  3             ounces  caciocavallo or pecorino -- cut matchsticks
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     carrot -- chopped
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  canned tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Lay a slice of pancetta across each beef cutlet, then sprinkle each with half of the garlic and some finely chopped parsley.  Add a few capers and 1 or 2 pieces of cheese to each cutlet.  Roll each up and secure with a toothpick or tie with thread.

In a deep skillet over medium-high heat, brown the beef rolls on all sides in the olive oil.  Remove as they brown and set aside.

Add the chopped pancetta to the pan, along with the onion, remaining chopped garlic, and carrot, lower the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft but not brown.  Add the wine, increase the heat slightly, and cook, scraping any brown bits.  When the wine is reduced by half, add the tomatoes and continue cooking for 5 minutes, to reduce and thicken tomatoes into a sauce.

Stir the pepper flakes into the pan and add the beef rolls, spooning sauce over to cover well.  Season with salt and pepper and reduce the heat to medium-low.  Cover the pan and cook 25 minutes.  Serve immediately

  2             pounds  beef -- top round

  2        tablespoons  pork fat -- softened

  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  Brown Chicken Stock -- hot, (see recipe)
  3              large  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" dice
  2                     red bell peppers -- seeds, stems,
                        and pith removed, coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  capers -- rinsed
  1         tablespoon  sugar

In a stew pot place beef, carrots, onion, celery, peppercorns, cloves and water.  Bring water to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Remove pot from heat, cool and strain off liquid and aromatics.

Slice the boiled meat and season with salt and pepper.  Add 1 tablespoon pork fat to a large pan, heat over medium heat and add the sliced meat and cook until browned on both sides.  Set aside.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the pancetta over medium heat until it releases its fat, then add the remaining pork fat and onion and brown it in the fat.  Sprinkle the flour over and stir well over medium-high heat with a wooden spoon for 5 minutes.

Stir in the hot chicken stock, then add the diced potatoes, cover, and cook over medium-high heat for 20 minutes.  After 20 minutes, when the potatoes are very tender and the flavors have melded, add the reserved boiled meat to the broth.

In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat, add the garlic, and cook over medium until it is browned and softened.  Stir in the peppers, vinegar, capers, and sugar, cook over high heat 1 minute, then remove from the heat.  Serve the sliced meat with some of its cooking liquid and some of the pepper sauce drizzled over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  3                     anchovy fillets -- rinsed, patted dry
  3            bunches  broccoli rabe -- trimmed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  very small black olives -- pitted, and
                        coarsely chopped

In a deep saucepan large enough to hold all of the broccoli rabe, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Chop the garlic coarsely and add it to the pan, along with the pepper flakes and anchovies.  Cook 3 to 5 minutes, until the garlic begins to soften.

While the garlic is cooking, wash the broccoli rabe thoroughly.  Add it to the saucepan with the water still clinging to its leaves.  Cover the pan tightly and cook the broccoli rabe for 20 to 30 minutes, until it is very tender and just a few spoonfuls of water remain.  When the broccoli is tender, stir it well to mix with the sauce and add a little salt and the olives.  Serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh herbs -- more for garnish
                        = (including parsley, thyme, sage,
                        basil, arugula, and rosemary)
  2                     zucchini -- coarsely chopped
     1/2         pound  fresh green beans -- cut 1" lengths
  1              pound  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  2                     ripe tomatoes -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
                        = (or 1 1/2 cups canned tomatoes)
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, crushed
  1                     white onion -- coarsely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             slices  country bread, 1" thick -- crusts removed,
                        and cut into 3/4" cubes
     1/2         small  dried hot chile pepper
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

In a stockpot, combine the herbs, zucchini, green beans, potatoes, tomatoes, garlic, and onion and cover with water.  Add salt, to taste, and bring to a simmer over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, until the potatoes are tender, about 20 to 30 minutes.

Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the bread has broken down and thickened the soup, about 10 minutes longer.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Serve immediately, topped with olive oil and fresh green herbs.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

           Butterflies With Veal Sauce - {Pavoncelle Abruzzese}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  water
  2        tablespoons  salt
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  finely-chopped pancetta
     1/2         pound  ground veal
     1/4         pound  spinach -- blanched, drained,
                        and chopped
     1/4           cup  dried porcinis -- soaked in
                        warm water and drained
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  fresh Farfalle -- (listed below)
                        = (or 1 pound dried farfalle)
                        === FARFALLE SEMOLINA PASTA DOUGH ===
  2               cups  semolina flour
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  warm water - (to 1 1/2)

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and add the veal, spinach, and mushrooms and stir over high heat until the meat is well-browned, about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, and stir in the wine.  Cook over high heat for 5 minutes, until it has almost completely evaporated, then add the chicken stock, and remove from the heat.

Cook the farfalle in the boiling water until tender yet al dente, then drain, and add to the pan with the hot ragu.  Toss over high heat for 1 minute, then divide evenly among 6 warmed pasta bowls.

Farfalle Semolina Pasta Dough:  Mound the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and water.  Using a fork, begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Cut dough into 2 by 1-inch rectangles, and pinch the centers to form farfalle.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1                cup  warm water
  1 1/2         ounces  brewer's yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  ricotta
  1                cup  cubed prosciutto cotto (ham)

Combine the water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl and stir until dissolved.  Add salt and 1 cup of the flour and mix with a wooden spoon to make a loose batter.  Add 2 more cups of the flour and stir with the spoon for 2 to 3 minutes to incorporate as much flour as possible.

Bring the dough together by hand and turn out onto a floured board or marble surface.  Knead for 6 to 8 minutes, until you have made a smooth, firm dough.  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a towel.  Set aside to rise in the warmest part of the kitchen for 45 minutes.

Cut the risen dough into 4 equal pieces and knead each portion into a round.  Cover again and let rest 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Place a clean pizza stone in oven to preheat.

Dust a clean work surface lightly with flour.  With your fingers and palms, flatten one of the dough rounds into a 10-inch oval about 1/4-inch thick.

In a separate bowl, mix together ricotta, mozzarella, and ham.  Spoon 1/4 of mixture just above the center of one oval of dough.  Fold the dough to form a half-moon and then press the edges to seal.  Fold the edge up with your fingertips and pinch closed to form a ridge all the way around.  Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.  Place calzones on pizza stone and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, until golden brown.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  plum tomatoes
  4               cups  passata (Pomi)
  6                     leaves fresh basil
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     canning jars -- sterilized

Bring 2 pots each filled with 8 quarts of water to a boil.  Fill a bowl full of ice water.  Place 1/2 of the tomatoes in one of the pots of boiling water for 1 minute.  Remove from boiling water and place in ice water.  Repeat with other half of tomatoes.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  cauliflower -- cut into florets
  4               cups  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  2                     bay leaves
  1                cup  crushed tomatoes
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  pecorino dolce -- freshly grated
  2               cups  bread crumbs
  6                     eggs
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  1              bunch  Italian parsley -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             quarts  olive oil -- for frying

In a large bowl, combine the cheese, bread crumbs, eggs, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper, and mix well.

In a tall-sided pot, heat the olive oil to 375 degrees.

While the oil heats, roll the mixture into 1-inch balls.  Fry them in the oil, working in batches to avoid crowding the pan and lowering the temperature of the oil.  Cook the balls until uniformly golden brown, about 5 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Sprinkle with salt and serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  yellow cornmeal
                        Salt -- to taste
  1                cup  hot water
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1              small  dried hot red pepper
  1              pound  broccoli rabe -- coarsely chopped
  1              pound  escarole -- coarsely chopped
  1              pound  dandelion greens -- coarsely chopped

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place the cornmeal in a large bowl and add a pinch of salt.  Add enough hot water to make the mixture, when kneaded, form into a soft dough.  Shape it into a ball, then pat into a disc 1 1/4-inches high and 14-inches across.  Place on a lightly oiled pizza pan and bake until golden and crusty but soft in the middle, about 45 minutes.

In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat and add the garlic and pepper.  Cook five minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the greens and salt, to taste, and toss to coat.  Cover the pan and reduce the heat.  Cook for 5 minutes, then remove the cover, and cook over high heat five minutes.  Add water if necessary to keep the greens from drying out.

Serve the "pizza" and greens together.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  milk
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  1         tablespoon  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1              pinch  grated nutmeg
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  6               cups  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  pork or chicken fat

In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs, milk, parsley, 1 tablespoon Parmigiano-Reggiano, and nutmeg.  Gradually beat in the flour, and, if necessary, add a little water to create a runny batter consistency.  Set aside in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

In a stockpot, bring the chicken stock to a boil, season with salt and pepper, and keep it hot.

In a non-stick crepe pan, heat a small amount of the fat until it is sizzling and add a small amount of the rested crepe batter.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes per side.  Remove from the pan and repeat the procedure with the remaining batter until it is all used up.

To serve, divide the crepes evenly among warmed soup bowls and top with a bit of the remaining cheese.  Ladle hot stock over the crepes and serve.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  mussels -- cleaned
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying
  1                cup  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
                        === SALSA ===
  4                     jalapeÒos -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste

Open the mussels, discarding the shells but reserving the liquid.  Strain the liquid through a fine sieve or cheesecloth into the eggs.  (You may steam the mussels partially to get the shells to open, which is considerably easier than prying them open raw.  Don't let them cook any longer than necessary, or they'll be tough and overcooked after frying).

Heat the oil in a deep-frying pan to 370 degrees.  Dip each mussel into the flour, then into the eggs, and then gently lower them into the hot oil and deep-fry until golden.

Drain on paper towels, sprinkle with salt, and serve immediately with Salsa.

Salsa:  Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  goat-milk ricotta -- drained
                        = (or substitute cow-milk ricotta)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated caciocavallo cheese
                        = (or Parmigiano-Reggiano)
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1                     egg separated -- plus
  1                     egg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 3)
     2/3           cup  freshly-grated bread crumbs

In a large bowl, combine ricotta, cheese, parsley, garlic, nutmeg, and 1 egg yolk, (reserving white) and mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.  Form ricotta mixture into balls about the size of small walnuts and set on a rack to dry slightly for 15 minutes.

When ready to cook, place oil in a tall-sided pan and heat to 360 degrees.  Oil should be at least 2-inches deep.

In a shallow bowl, mix the egg white with remaining whole egg, beating with a fork.  Place bread crumbs in another shallow bowl.  Dip each ricotta ball into egg to coat lightly, then roll quickly in bread crumbs.  Make sure ricotta balls are completely covered in egg wash and bread crumbs, and the coating is pressed on firmly.

Drop balls, a few at a time, into hot oil and fry until golden brown.  Remove with slotted spoon and drain briefly, then serve hot.

This recipe yields 24 to 30 balls.

Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
     1/4      teaspoon  dried yeast
  1 1/4            cup  warm water -- (100 degrees)
  4               cups  flour -- plus more for
                        rolling out dough
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus more for
                        the pan and drizzling the crust
  2             pounds  leeks -- very thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  milk
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  6                     anchovy fillets -- rinsed, drained,
                        and chopped
     1/2           cup  pitted black olives -- chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped parsley
     1/2           cup  canned tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  golden raisins -- plumped in hot water
  1           teaspoon  sugar

Sprinkle the dried yeast over 1/4 cup warm water in a small bowl.  When it "blooms", add remaining water.

In a larger bowl, mix flour with wine, olive oil, water, salt, and pepper.  Stir in the yeast water and work it into the dough with your hands.  Transfer to a lightly floured board and knead until it just loses its stickiness.  Set aside, covered with a damp cloth.

Warm 1/4 cup olive oil in a saute pan over medium-low heat.  Add the leeks and cook gently 15 minutes, or until soft but not browned.  Add the milk and cook 5 additional minutes.  Stir in sugar and cook another 5 minutes.  The leeks should be very soft.

Add the anchovies, black olives, parsley, and tomatoes.  Stir to mix well and continue cooking until the sauce is thick and liquid has evaporated.  Remove from heat and stir in raisins.

Lightly oil a 12-inch pizza pan.  Divide the dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other.  Roll the larger piece out to 1/8-inch thickness ad place on the pizza pan.  Spread the filling evenly across this piece, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges.

Roll out the other piece of dough and fit it on top of the first, and roll the edges of the two pieces of dough together.  Brush the remaining oil over the top crust, sprinkle with sugar, prick in several places with a fork, and set aside for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Bake in the oven for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down to 350 degrees and bake another 30 minutes.  Serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

In a larger bowl, mix flour with wine, olive oil, water, salt, and pepper.  Stir in the yeast water and work it into the dough with your hands.  Transfer to a lightly floured board and knead until it just loses its stickiness.  Set aside, covered with a damp cloth.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Warm 1/4 cup olive oil in a saute pan over medium-low heat.  Add the leeks and cook gently 15 minutes, or until soft but not browned.  Add the milk and cook 5 additional minutes.  Stir in sugar and cook another 5 minutes.  The leeks should be very soft.

Lightly oil a 12-inch pizza pan.  Divide the dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other.  Roll the larger piece out to 1/8-inch thickness ad place on the pizza pan.  Spread the filling evenly across this piece, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out the other piece of dough and fit it on top of the first, and roll the edges of the two pieces of dough together.  Brush the remaining oil over the top crust, sprinkle with sugar, prick in several places with a fork, and set aside for 30 minutes.

          Dried Fava Beans With Bitter Greens - {Fave E Cicoria}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  dried peeled fava beans -- soaked overnight
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  bitter greens
                        = (like black kale [cavolo nero],
                        dandelion, or chicory)
  6             slices  crusty peasant bread, 1" thick -- grilled or toasted

Drain the fava beans and place in a saucepan.  Cover with water, cover the pot, and cook over medium-high flame.  Skim the foam that rises to the top once the water boils.

Once there is no more foam, add a generous pinch of salt and cook the beans, stirring occasionally, for about 1 hour, or until they have dissolved into the water and have taken the consistency of clotted cream.  You may have to add more boiling water to keep beans from scorching.

Using a hand blender, beat in 1/4 cup olive oil and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste.

While the beans cook, rinse the greens in clean water, then place them in a saucepan over high heat and cook them in the water that clings to their leaves, adding a little more water if necessary to prevent scorching.  Once they are very tender, remove from the pot, squeeze out excess water, and dress with the remaining olive oil and salt and pepper, to taste.

Serve the greens and fava puree together with the bread.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  sugar
  3 1/2           cups  whole milk
  10            ounces  semisweet chocolate -- coarsely grated
     1/4           cup  espresso
                        = (or strong coffee)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- whipped soft peaks
  5        tablespoons  pine nuts -- baked for 8
                        minutes in a 400 degree oven

Mix the cocoa powder, flour, and sugar in a mixing bowl.  Slowly whisk in a bit of the milk to form a paste, then add the remaining milk to make a thin batter.

Transfer to a large saucepan and, stirring constantly over medium heat, slowly bring to a boil.  Remove from heat, add the grated chocolate and espresso, and stir to mix well.

When the chocolate is completely melted, fill 6 (6-ounce) ramekins four-fifths full, and allow to cool.

Cover each with a dollop of whipped cream and sprinkle with the pine nuts.  Serve immediately, or chill until needed.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2            bunches  fresh basil -- leaves only
  4               cups  cake flour
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  whole milk
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated pecorino
                        === CONDIMENT ===
  10       tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- sliced thin
  3             medium  zucchini -- halved lengthwise,
                        and cut 1/4"-thk half-moons
  8                     cherry tomatoes -- halved
  1           teaspoon  chile flakes
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring a pot of water to a boil and fill bowl with ice cubes and water.  Blanch the basil in the boiling water for 10 seconds, then refresh in the ice water.  Drain and chop finely.

Make a mound of the flour, then make a well in the center.  Crack the eggs into the well, pour the milk over, and add the basil.  Using a fork, stir the egg mixture slowly into the flour to form a wet dough.  Add the grated cheese and, working now with your hands, bring the dough together and knead 8 to 10 minutes to form a smooth dough.  Allow to rest 15 minutes covered in plastic wrap.

Set up a pasta rolling machine and cut off a piece of pasta dough the size of a tennis ball.  Roll the pasta through the rollers on the widest setting, then fold it by thirds and run it through again on the same setting.  Repeat this three times, being careful to add very little flour, as it will dry out the pasta.  Run the pasta through the next two thinner settings.  It should be quite thick.

Lay the sheet of pasta onto a floured cutting board and use a knife to cut crosswise into 1/3-inch strips.  Lay the cut noodles on a kitchen towel and cover with another.  Roll and cut the remaining pasta the same way.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt.  In a 12 to 14-inch saute pan, heat 6 tablespoons of the oil and the garlic over medium heat until the garlic is light golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the zucchini and cook until just soft, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and chili flakes and cook for 2 more minutes.  Remove from heat.

Drop the pasta into the boiling water and cook until tender yet al dente, about 3 minutes.  Drain and toss into the pan with the zucchini and place pan over high heat.  Cook to heat through, about 1 minute, and pasta and sauce have become one.

Add the parsley and toss with the remaining 4 tablespoons of oil, off the heat.  Pour into a heated serving bowl and serve with pepper.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              sprig  rosemary leaves -- finely chopped
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-diced pork fat
     3/4         pound  boneless mutton -- cut 3" to 4" cubes
                        = (or substitute boneless lamb shoulder)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  white wine
  2               cups  canned tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
                        Abruzzo Eggless Pasta Dough -- (listed below)
                        Pecorino romano -- for grating
                        === ABRUZZO EGGLESS PASTA DOUGH ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus more
                        for kneading
  4                     egg whites -- beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  water - (about)

In a small bowl, combine the rosemary, onion, and pork fat, mixing thoroughly with your hands or the back of a spoon to form a paste.  Work quickly to avoid raising the temperature of the fat and melting it.

In a heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the herb, onion and fat mixture until the onion is translucent and the rosemary is fragrant.  Season the mutton cubes with salt and pepper and brown on all sides in the fat, then add the wine and cook over high heat for 2 minutes.

Add the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and simmer, covered, for about 90 minutes, until the flavors have melded and the meat is falling apart.

Meanwhile, make the pasta according to the recipe and roll it out to the thinnest setting on a pasta-rolling machine.  Using a paring knife, cut the pasta into uneven shapes and allow to dry.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Add the pasta and cook 6 minutes, until tender yet al dente.  Drain the pasta and add it to the pan with the lamb ragu.

Toss over high heat 1 minute, then divide evenly among 4 warmed pasta bowls.  Top with grated pecorino and serve immediately.

Abruzzo Eggless Pasta Dough:  On a wooden board, place the flour in a mound.  Form a well in the center and add the egg whites and salt.  Add the water, a little at a time, while mixing in the flour and water with a fork.  Using both hands, knead the dough into a ball, adding more flour as necessary, to obtain a smooth, pliable dough.  Set the dough under an inverted bowl and let it rest 15 minutes.  (Makes 1 pound pasta)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  caul fat
  1              pound  fresh young calf liver
  1                     orange -- sliced thinly
                        into wedges, reserving 1 wedge for garnish
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Bay leaves -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2            bunches  dandelion -- cut 2" strips
                        down to the root end
                        Red wine vinegar -- as needed

Soak caul fat in tepid water for 10 minutes, to make it pliable.

Peel the thin outer membrane from the liver and cut into chunky rectangles about 1 by 2 inches, discarding veined sections.  Sprinkle each chunk of liver with a light dusting of salt and pepper.

Drain the caul fat and carefully unfold.  Cut pieces of caul fat large enough to wrap around each chunk of liver in a single layer.  Surround the liver in orange slices, tucking a little piece of bay leaf inside each packet, then warp with caul fat.  Sprinkle more salt and pepper on the outside and thread the chunks on skewers, separating each chunk with half a bay leaf.

Preheat the grill or broiler.

Grill the skewers for about 3 to 5 minutes per side, until the outside of each chunk is nicely browned and the inside is still pink.

Meanwhile, in a large saute pan, heat the extra-virgin olive oil.  Saute the garlic until fragrant and add the dandelion greens.  Toss the greens in the oil until wilted and soft.  Season with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and drizzle with some red wine vinegar.

Plate greens on a platter.  Put the liver on the greens and squeeze with the remaining orange.  Serve with crusty bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/4           cup  bread crumbs
                        === OVEN-ROASTED TOMATOES ===
  1              pound  Roma tomatoes
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil

Cook the pasta according to the package directions, until tender yet al dente, about 6 minutes.  Drain the pasta and add it to tomato mixture.  Toss over high heat one minute.  Divide among 4 heated bowls, shave bottarga over each bowl, sprinkle with bread crumbs, and serve immediately.

Oven-Roasted Tomatoes:  Preheat oven to 200 degrees.

Cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise, squeeze out the seeds, and remove the membrane.  In a small bowl, combine the sugar, oil, salt, and pepper and coat the tomatoes with mixture.

Place the tomatoes, cut-side down, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and place in the oven.  Cook for 2 hours, or until the tomatoes are very soft and have lost about half of their liquid.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Japanese eggplants -- halved lengthwise
     1/4           cup  pitted black olives -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  capers -- rinsed, drained,
                        and chopped
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped mint leaves
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh basil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated caciocavallo cheese
                        = (or pecorino Romano or Parmigiano
                        Reggiano)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat the broiler.

Using a small paring knife, make a series of crosshatches to the cut surface of each eggplant half, cutting into the flesh but not through the skin.

In a medium bowl, combine the olives, capers, mint, and basil and mash lightly with a fork to make a coarse paste.  Stir in salt and pepper, to taste, and the grated cheese and mix well.  Press the mixture into the cuts in each eggplant.

Place the eggplants, cut-side up, on a grill or broiler rack, and drizzle each with a bit of olive oil.  Broil for about 8 minutes, or until the tops are crisp and bubbling.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  semolina flour
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  tepid water - (to 1 1/4)

Place both types of flour in a large mixing bowl and stir to mix well.  Make a well in the center of the flour and add the water a little at a time, stirring with your hands until a dough is formed.  You may need more or less water, depending on the humidity in your kitchen.

Place the dough on a floured work surface and knead it like bread for 8 to 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.  Cover and let stand for 10 minutes at room temperature.

Roll the dough into long dowels, about 3/4 inch thick.  Cut into flat disks about 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick.  With the palm of one hand, roll one disk out to form a 6- to 8-inch length piece of spaghetti.  Set aside and cover with plenty of semolina while continuing with rest of dough.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  dried yeast
     1/2           cup  dry white wine -- warmed to
                        about 100 degrees
     1/2           cup  water -- warmed to
                        about 100 degrees
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  semolina flour
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  fennel seeds -- lightly crushed

Scatter the yeast over the warm wine and leave for several minutes, then stir to mix well.  Put in a large bowl with all other ingredients, adding seasoning if desired.  Mix ingredients with hands, then turn onto an unfloured board and knead until dough is smooth and elastic.  Return to a clean, dry bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let rise for 30 minutes.

Divide the dough into small pieces.  Roll a piece into a long, slim pencil about the thickness of your pinky.  Cut it into lengths of 4-inches and bring the two ends together to form a doughnut-like shape.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil and drop the taralli in, a few at a time.  Have a folded kitchen towel ready and when the taralli rise, remove and drop on the towel to dry.

Arrange the boiled taralli on a cookie sheet and bake in the oven 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown and crisp.

This recipe yields 4 to 5 dozen taralli.

  4             pounds  lamb -- cut 2" cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
  6                     Japanese eggplants -- cut 3/4" rounds
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh marjoram leaves -- finely chopped
  5                     anchovy fillets -- rinsed, drained
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar

In a large bowl, combine the wine, bay leaves, sliced garlic, 3 sprigs parsley, rosemary, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and black pepper, to taste, and stir well to combine.

Brush the eggplant rounds with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, sprinkle with the oregano leaves and bake in the oven, turning once, for 10 to 20 minutes, until soft.

In the bowl of a food processor or blender, combine the remaining garlic, anchovies, pepper flakes, remaining parsley, 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, and vinegar and puree.  Arrange the eggplant slices in a single layer and pour the sauce over.  Place, covered, in the refrigerator, for 2 hours.

Meanwhile, preheat the grill or broiler.  Remove the lamb from its marinade and pat dry.  Thread the meat onto skewers and cook 10 to 20 minutes, to desired temperature.  Serve hot, alongside the chilled eggplant.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4            cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  ground toasted almonds
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1                     egg -- plus
  4                     eggs -- separated
  1              pinch  salt
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2                     lemons -- zested, plus
  3                     lemons -- juiced

Grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch tart pan with butter and set aside.

Toss together the flour, almonds, and sugar.  Cut the butter into the dry mixture until it is the consistency of fine bread crumbs.  Add 1 egg and salt and mix well, kneading slightly.  Form the pastry into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate while you make the filling.

Beat the 4 egg yolks with the sugar until very thick, then beat in the lemon zest and juice.  Transfer the mixture to the top of a double boiler and set over barely simmering water.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes thick, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Roll the dough, if you can, between 2 sheets of waxed paper.  Place in a pan and prick the dough with a fork all over the bottom, line with waxed paper, and fill with dried beans or rice to keep the bottom from puffing.  Place in the oven and bake 10 minutes, then remove the paper and beans, and cook an additional 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, beat the 4 egg whites until very stiff and fold them into the cooled lemon mixture.

Remove the pie casing from the oven and reduce the temperature to 325 degree.  Spread the lemon filling over the pie shell and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the filling is thoroughly set.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

       Marinated Fish With Vinegar, Mint - {Pesciolini In Scapece}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     garlic cloves - (to 5) -- crushed
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh mint
  1                cup  white wine vinegar
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  freshly-grated bread crumbs
  1              pound  headless small fish - (to 1 1/2)
                        = (either sardines or smelts)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour

Place the garlic and mint in a small saucepan with the wine vinegar and set over medium-low heat.  As soon as the vinegar starts to boil, lower the heat to below a simmer and leave the aromatics to steep in the vinegar.

In about a tablespoon of the oil, toast the bread crumbs in a saucepan over medium-high heat until they are golden brown and crisp.  Remove and set aside.

Dredge the fish lightly in the flour.  Saute in half of the remaining olive oil over medium-high heat, setting aside the fish to drain as they finish cooking.

When all the fish have been fried, discard the oil and wipe out the pan.  Add the remaining clean oil to the pan and set over very low heat to warm.

Layer the fish in a glass or ceramic dish, sprinkling each layer liberally with the toasted bread crumbs and distributing the garlic and mint from the vinegar infusion.  The topmost layer of bread crumbs should completely cover the fish.

Now combine the warm vinegar and warm clean oil and pour over the bread crumbs.  Cover the dish and set aside for two to three days refrigerated before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Place the garlic and mint in a small saucepan with the wine vinegar and set over medium-low heat.  As soon as the vinegar starts to boil, lower the heat to below a simmer and leave the aromatics to steep in the vinegar.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In about a tablespoon of the oil, toast the bread crumbs in a saucepan over medium-high heat until they are golden brown and crisp.  Remove and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dredge the fish lightly in the flour.  Saute in half of the remaining olive oil over medium-high heat, setting aside the fish to drain as they finish cooking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When all the fish have been fried, discard the oil and wipe out the pan.  Add the remaining clean oil to the pan and set over very low heat to warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Layer the fish in a glass or ceramic dish, sprinkling each layer liberally with the toasted bread crumbs and distributing the garlic and mint from the vinegar infusion.  The topmost layer of bread crumbs should completely cover the fish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Now combine the warm vinegar and warm clean oil and pour over the bread crumbs.  Cover the dish and set aside for two to three days refrigerated before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  pancetta -- finely chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  dried large beans, like peeled favas -- soaked overnight,
                        and drained
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced, plus
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  2               cups  finely-chopped canned
                        peeled tomatoes and their juices
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
     1/4         pound  mushrooms
                        = (fresh porcinis, shiitakes,
                        chanterelles, dried porcinis)
     1/2         pound  ground veal
     1/2         pound  ground pork
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated caciocavallo cheese
                        = (or pecorino-Romano)
  1                     egg
  3             pounds  veal shoulder -- sliced, pounded
                        All-purpose flour -- for frying

In a dutch oven, place the pancetta and cook over medium heat until most of the fat is rendered.  Add the beans, 1 clove garlic, and half of the parsley and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.  Cook for 5 minutes, until the onion is softened, then add the tomatoes, and salt and pepper, to taste.

In a separate skillet, heat 1/4 cup oil over high heat and add the mushrooms.  Cook over very high heat until they begin to get browned and crisp, then add 1 clove garlic and a pinch of parsley.  Remove from heat and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the ground veal, pork, grated cheese, egg, salt, and pepper, to taste, and, once they have cooled, the cooked mushrooms.  Mix these ingredients well and divide evenly among the slices of veal, placing a portion in the center of each slice.  Season with salt and pepper, and roll each slice up, securing with butcher's twine.  Dust each roll with flour.

In a separate skillet, heat the remaining olive oil over high heat and add the rolls, working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.  Brown the rolls on all sides, then add to the simmering bean and tomato sauce, and simmer for 20 minutes.  Season the sauce with salt and pepper and serve the rolls with sauce drizzled on top.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  stale country-style bread -- crusts removed,
                        and cut into thick slices
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  3              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  grated pecorino or Parmigiano-Reggiano
  2        tablespoons  chopped Italian parsley
  1              bunch  basil -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste

  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)

Soak the bread slices in milk until soaked through, then squeeze dry.  Crumble and tear the soaked bread into smaller pieces and process in the food processor, using quick pulses, to yield 4 cups soaked crumbs.

Mix the crumbs in a bowl with the eggs, cheese, herbs, and garlic, adding salt and pepper, as desired.  Form into round balls about 2-inches in diameter.  Set aside on a rack or plate to dry for about 15 to 20 minutes.

In a saucepan or deep skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil to frying temperature, about 360 degrees, and fry the bread balls until brown on all sides.  Remove the balls as they brown and drain on a rack covered with paper towels.

Have the Basic Tomato Sauce ready.  Arrange the balls on a platter and spoon the sauce over.  Serve immediately.

                    Mint Omelet - {Frittata Di Menta}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Omelets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  yellow onion -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  fresh mint leaves - (loosely packed)
  8              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  freshly-grated caciocavallo or
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Gently saute the onions in 2 tablespoons olive oil in an ovenproof 10 to 12 inch skillet over medium-low heat until the onion is soft but not starting to brown, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Away from the heat, add the mint to the onion and stir well to combine.  Set aside to cool.

Mix the eggs in a bowl with a fork, then stir in the cheese, salt and pepper.  Stir the cooled onion-mint mixture into the eggs.

Turn on the broiler and adjust a rack so that the upper surface of the omelet will be about 6 inches from the heat source.

Return the skillet to medium-high heat.  Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan and swirl over the bottom and sides.  Turn the egg mixture in the pan.

Cook, continually running a palette knife, narrow spatula or cake icer around the edges of the pan to keep the eggs loose.  From time to time, lift some of the cooked egg off the bottom of the pan to let the uncooked egg run underneath.

When the bottom of the frittata is set, remove from the stove top and run it under the broiler for 30 seconds, just long enough to glaze and brown the top.  Serve in wedges, hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  Prince Edward Island mussels -- scrubbed, de-bearded
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced
  1              small  hot chile pepper -- chopped
  1              bunch  Italian parsley -- finely chopped
  1                     bay leaf
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  6             slices  crusty peasant bread
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar

Place the mussels in a skillet large enough to hold them in a single layer, add 1/4 cup water, cover and cook over high heat until the mussels are steamed open.  Strain the cooking liquid through several thicknesses of cheesecloth and set aside.  Once the mussels are cool enough to handle, remove from the shells and set aside.

In a 12 to 14-inch saute pan, heat 1/4 cup olive oil over medium heat and add the garlic, chile pepper, parsley, and bay leaf and cook over medium heat 5 minutes.  Add the steamed mussels and strained cooking liquid and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Bring to a boil and add the white wine.  Cook for 2 or 3 minutes, just long enough to meld flavors but not long enough to over-cook mussels.

In a separate saute pan, heat the remaining olive oil over high heat and fry each slice of bread, one at a time, on both sides until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels and season with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle with a few drops of the vinegar.  Remove the mussels from the pan with a slotted spoon and top each slice of bread with mussels.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2             pounds  Prince Edward Island mussels -- bearded, scrubbed
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  3             sprigs  parsley

Once it is cooled, drizzle over the chilled mussels and serve.

Season each piece of meat with salt and pepper.  Brown all sides of each rib, remove, and set aside on a plate.  Repeat browning process with chicken thighs, sausages, and Pork Braciole.

When the meat is browned, remove and deglaze with red wine.  Add Basic Tomato Sauce and bring to a boil.  Return ribs, thighs, sausage, braciole, and Neapolitan Meatballs to the pot, return to boil, and lower to high simmer.  Cover with the lid and simmer for 45 minutes.  Remove meats to a serving platter and keep warm.  Serve sauce with paccheri pasta as a separate course.

For the Pork Braciole:  Season each piece of pork on one side with salt and pepper.  In a small bowl, combine the orange zest, pecorino, and parsley.  Spoon 2 tablespoons of mixture onto center of seasoned side of one piece of pork.  Starting at one end, carefully roll the pork to form a very thick cigar.  Wind a long piece of string around the roll many times and secure with a knot.  Repeat with the remaining 4 pieces of pork.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  day-old bread -- cut 1" cubes
  1                cup  milk
     3/4        pounds  ground veal
     3/4        pounds  ground pork
  3                     eggs -- beaten
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)

In a shallow bowl, soak the bread cubes in the milk for a minute or two.  Using your hands, break apart the bread into small pieces.

In a large bowl, combine the veal, pork, eggs, bread and milk, parsley, and salt and pepper.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  eggplant -- sliced 1/2" thick
                        Sea salt -- as needed
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1              pound  penne or other short pasta
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  grated caciocavallo or pecorino
  4             sprigs  fresh basil -- roughly torn

Stack eggplant slices in a colander, each piece sprinkled with sea salt.  Weigh the slices with a large, full can of tomatoes or other weight and set aside in the kitchen sink so that juices run free.  After 1 hour, rinse and pat dry.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12 to 14-inch saute pan, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat and saute eggplant slices until golden brown on both sides, working in batches if necessary and removing cooked eggplant to a plate lined with a paper towel.

Cook the penne in the boiling water until not quite done; about 5 minutes.  Drain the pasta and toss with 3/4 cup of tomato sauce.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Grease a glass or ceramic oven dish with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Cover the bottom of the dish with a few tablespoons of tomato sauce.  Top with half the bread crumbs, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Add half the cooked pasta, then half of the eggplant slices, arranged in a layer.  Drizzle about 1/4 cup of the tomato sauce over, and top with half the grated cheese and torn basil leaves.  Repeat the process with remaining tomato sauce, bread crumbs, pasta, eggplant, cheese, and basil.

Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and bake in oven for 1 hour.  Let rest 30 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  boneless lamb shoulder -- cut 3" to 4" cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     celery rib -- halved
  2                     bay leaves
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  4             sprigs  fresh marjoram
  1              small  dried chile pepper
  1                cup  canned drained tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     3/4           cup  dry red or white wine
  1 1/2         pounds  dandelion or escarole -- cut 1/4" chiffonade
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped Italian parsley
     1/4           cup  slivered caciocavallo or pecorino

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Season meat with salt and pepper.  In a heavy skillet or casserole, over high heat, sear the meat in 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, browning on all sides.  Remove meat from the pan and set aside.

Lower heat to medium and gently sweat the sliced onion, celery, bay leaves, garlic, marjoram, and chile pepper in 2 tablespoons of the oil until soft and starting to turn golden.  Add the tomatoes and tomato sauce to the pan, season, and let reduce for 5 minutes.  Deglaze with wine, add in the lamb pieces, raise the heat to medium, and when the liquid comes to a simmer, cover and cook in the oven for 1 hour.

After 1 hour, add the greens to the pot, setting them directly on top of the meat and its juices.  Cover and return to the oven for 30 to 45 minutes.  Remove from the oven, discard the celery, bay leaves, and chile pepper, and transfer the meat and greens to a serving platter.  Top with slivered cheese and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  8        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  dried bread crumbs
  2               cups  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  8               cups  cooked arborio rice -- see * Note

                        through, and chopped
  3                     eggs -- see * Note
  2               cups  Ragu Bolognese -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  penne -- cooked
  1                cup  peas -- cooked
  1                cup  Bechamel Sauce -- (listed below)
  6                     meatballs -- cooked, halved
  2                     sweet Italian sausage links - (5" ea) -- cooked, and
                        sliced into 1/2" slices
                        === BECHAMEL SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  flour
  2               cups  milk

* Note:  Cook rice according to package instructions, cutting cooking time in half.  Drain the rice and set aside in a large bowl.  For eggs, fry all three, sunnyside-up, in a non-stick pan and slide onto a plate and set aside.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Butter the entire inside of medium metal bowl (about 6 quart capacity).  Use all the butter to coat entirely.  Pour bread crumbs into bowl and shake around to cover entire inside of bowl.

Pour 1 cup of the cheese in with the rice and mix thoroughly.  Put a handful of rice into bottom of buttered and breaded bowl and pack the rice tightly.  Keep adding and packing rice into bowl to cover entire inside of bowl about 1-inch thick.

Pour chicken livers into bottom of bowl.  Sprinkle with a little cheese.  Slide the sunny-side eggs on top of chicken livers.  Sprinkle with a little cheese.  Pour the ragu carefully over the eggs.  Pack down firmly.  Sprinkle with a little cheese.

In another separate bowl, combine the penne with the peas and Bechamel, and add this mixture on top of ragu.  Again, pack down firmly and sprinkle with a little cheese.  Place the meatball halves on top of pasta mixture.  Next, place the sausage pieces on top of meatball halves.  Sprinkle with the rest of the cheese.  Cover this entire layered bowl with the rest of the rice and pack down firmly.

Place in oven and bake for 1 hour until browned on top.  When finished, let rest for 10 minutes and carefully run a knife along the edge of the bowl.  Turn over onto a large platter and knock on the bottom of the bowl.  Sartu should easily slide out of bowl.  Slice and eat immediately.

For the Bechamel Sauce:  In a small saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat.

In a small saute pan, heat the butter over medium heat until melted and add flour all at once, stirring vigorously.  Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add the heated milk and whisk until smooth.  Lower heat and simmer for 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 large servings.

        Pasta With Mussels And Beans - {Penne Con Cozze E Fagioli}

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  cannellini beans -- soaked overnight
  1              small  carrot -- coarsely chopped
  1                     celery rib -- coarsely chopped
  4             pounds  mussels -- scrubbed
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
  1                cup  canned tomatoes -- drained, chopped
     1/2         pound  penne
     1/2         bunch  Italian parsley -- finely chopped
  2                     basil sprigs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Drain the beans and place in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat with the chopped carrot and celery.  Add 2 cups fresh water and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover the pot, and cook until beans are tender, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Check water level from time to time and add boiling water as it cooks down so that beans are always covered.

Place mussels in a large pan with the wine and set over high heat.  Cook, stirring frequently, until all mussels have opened.  Remove from heat and set aside to cool.  Strain cooking liquid through several layers of cheesecloth and set aside.

When mussels are cool enough to handle, remove flesh and discard shells.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a saucepan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat and add garlic.  When garlic is soft but not brown, add tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes, or until tomatoes are soft and disintegrating.  Stir in cooked beans and simmer gently while pasta cooks.

Cook pasta in boiling water until it is almost cooked through, about 8 minutes.  Drain the pasta and add to the bean mixture.  Add the mussels and strained mussel liquid.  Stir over low heat 5 minutes, then add parsley, basil, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  2             ounces  pancetta -- diced
  5                     artichokes -- cleaned, thinly
                        sliced, held in acidulated water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1              pound  penne
  2                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat and add the onion and pancetta, stirring until the onion is soft but not browned, about 10 minutes.  Drain the artichokes and add them to the pan, stir to mix well, cover and leave to stew for another 10 minutes.

Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt.  Season the artichokes with salt, then add the wine to the artichokes, a little at a time, adding more once the wine evaporates.  Once wine evaporates, add boiling water to just cover the vegetables, cover and cook for 30 minutes, until artichokes have fully absorbed water and vegetables are tender.  Remove from the heat and set aside.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Add the penne and cook according to package directions, until tender yet al dente.  While the pasta cooks, return the artichokes to low heat.  Beat the eggs in a small bowl and then beat in the grated cheese.  Once the artichokes are hot, remove the pan from heat and slowly stir the egg mixture into the artichokes.  Drain the pasta and toss with the artichoke mixture.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1                cup  warm water
  1 1/2         ounces  brewer's yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
                        === TOPPING ===
  1                cup  passata
  8             ounces  fresh mozzarella -- sliced 12 equal
                        pieces
  8                     leaves fresh basil

Combine the water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl and stir until dissolved.  Add salt and 1 cup of the flour and mix with a wooden spoon to make a loose batter.  Add 2 more cups of the flour and stir with the spoon for 2 to 3 minutes to incorporate as much flour as possible.

Bring the dough together by hand and turn out onto a floured board or marble surface.  Knead for 6 to 8 minutes, until you have made a smooth, firm dough.  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a towel.  Set aside to rise in the warmest part of the kitchen for 45 minutes.

Cut the risen dough into 4 equal pieces and knead each portion into a round.  Cover again and let rest 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Place a clean pizza stone in oven to preheat.

Dust a clean work surface lightly with flour.  With your fingers and palms, flatten one of the dough rounds into a 10-inch oval about 1/4-inch thick.  Spread 1/4 cup of the passata evenly on entire surface of dough, leaving 1/4-inch of dough to form edge of pizza.

Take one piece of mozzarella, slice into 4 uniform slices and put on top of passata.  Rip 2 leaves of basil into smaller pieces and sprinkle on top of mozzarella.  Slide pizza directly onto pizza stone and bake 15 to 18 minutes, until edge of pizza is golden brown and cheese is bubbling.  Repeat with remaining 3 dough balls and serve hot.

  4                     fresh garlic cloves -- sliced thinly

Combine the water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl and stir until dissolved.  Add salt and 1 cup of the flour and mix with a wooden spoon to make a loose batter.  Add 2 more cups of the flour and stir with the spoon for 2 to 3 minutes to incorporate as much flour as possible.

Bring the dough together by hand and turn out onto a floured board or marble surface.  Knead for 6 to 8 minutes, until you have made a smooth, firm dough.  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a towel.  Set aside to rise in the warmest part of the kitchen for 45 minutes.

Cut the risen dough into 4 equal pieces and knead each portion into a round.  Cover again and let rest 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Place a clean pizza stone in oven to preheat.

Dust a clean work surface lightly with flour.  With your fingers and palms, flatten one of the dough rounds into a 10-inch oval about 1/4-inch thick.  Spread 1/4 cup of the passata evenly on entire surface of dough, leaving 1/4-inch of dough to form edge of pizza.

Thinly slice one tomato and place on dough.  Drizzle 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil over entire pizza.  Sprinkle 1 teaspoon oregano and 1 clove thinly sliced garlic over tomatoes.

Bake on a pizza stone until crust is golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Repeat with remaining dough.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  3             pounds  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut small cubes, cooked through and cooled
  6                     eggs
     1/2           cup  cooked ham -- cut small cubes
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano Reggiano
     1/2           cup  milk
  1                cup  cake flour
  1                cup  breadcrumbs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a 6-inch-deep saucepan, heat 4 to 6 inches of oil to 375 degrees.

Put the cooked and cooled potatoes through a food mill into a large bowl.  Stir in 4 of the eggs, ham, and cheese and incorporate.  Season with salt and pepper.

Pour flour onto a large plate and the breadcrumbs onto another large plate.  Whisk the remaining 2 eggs with the milk and pour this mixture into another large plate.

Starting with a ball of potato mixture the size of an egg, form your croquettes using your hands (it helps to cover your hands with some of the flour to avoid a lot of sticking).  They should look like fat cylinders.  Dredge the croquette in flour, then the egg mixture, and finally, the breadcrumbs.  Continue until all potato mixture is finished.

Carefully place 5 croquettes in the hot oil and fry until a deep golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Continue until all croquettes are fried.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  quince
  14            ounces  dark brown sugar
  1                     lemon -- juiced
     1/4           cup  dark rum
  2               cups  heavy cream

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Place the quince in a cast-iron casserole and roast in the oven until they are soft and collapsing and their skins are just bursting, about 30 to 40 minutes.

Once the quince are cool enough to handle, remove the skin and cores and press the flesh through a sieve, transferring it to a saucepan with the brown sugar and lemon juice and, over high heat, bring the ingredients to a boil, stirring with a wooden spoon.  Lower the flame and cook the quince, still stirring, for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and allow to cool.

In a medium bowl, combine the rum and cream and beat to form stiff peaks.  Lighten the cooled quince with a third of the beaten cream, then gently fold the quince into the remaining cream.

Turn the mousse out into 4-ounce ramekins, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and chill for several hours.  Serve chilled.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Rabbit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     rabbit - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- cut into 6 pieces
  1                cup  red wine -- mixed with
  1                cup  water
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  onions -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  4                     bell peppers, green and red - (to 6) -- trimmed, cored,
                        and cut into eighths
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the rabbit pieces in a bowl with the wine-water mixture and marinate for 1 hour.  Then drain and dry thoroughly with paper towels.

In a pan large enough to hold all the ingredients, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the rabbit pieces and brown on both sides, about 5 to 7 minutes per side.  As they brown, remove the pieces and set aside.

When the rabbit is done, lower the heat to medium-low and stir the onion slices into the pan.  Cook until the onion is limp and golden, but don't let it brown.  Add the wine to the pan, bring to a simmer, then add the rabbit pieces, nestling them among the onions, and cook, covered, for about 30 minutes.

Put the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in a separate frying pan and over medium-low heat gently simmer the pepper slices until they are thoroughly wilted and starting to brown; about 15 minutes uncovered and 15 minutes covered.  Stir the peppers and their juices into the pan with the rabbit, add salt and pepper, to taste, and cook together for an additional 30 minutes.

Check the amount of liquid in the pan after 15 minutes, there should be a small amount of syrupy oil in the bottom of the pan, enough to keep the meat and vegetables from burning.  Add a little more white wine, water, or broth if necessary to prevent sticking.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Place the rabbit pieces in a bowl with the wine-water mixture and marinate for 1 hour.  Then drain and dry thoroughly with paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a pan large enough to hold all the ingredients, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the rabbit pieces and brown on both sides, about 5 to 7 minutes per side.  As they brown, remove the pieces and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the rabbit is done, lower the heat to medium-low and stir the onion slices into the pan.  Cook until the onion is limp and golden, but don&apos;t let it brown.  Add the wine to the pan, bring to a simmer, then add the rabbit pieces, nestling them among the onions, and cook, covered, for about 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in a separate frying pan and over medium-low heat gently simmer the pepper slices until they are thoroughly wilted and starting to brown; about 15 minutes uncovered and 15 minutes covered.  Stir the peppers and their juices into the pan with the rabbit, add salt and pepper, to taste, and cook together for an additional 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Check the amount of liquid in the pan after 15 minutes, there should be a small amount of syrupy oil in the bottom of the pan, enough to keep the meat and vegetables from burning.  Add a little more white wine, water, or broth if necessary to prevent sticking.  Serve immediately.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     bone-in leg of lamb - (abt 5 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  anchovy paste
  1                     red onion -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1                     carrot -- cut 1" long pieces
  1                     celery stalk -- cut 1" long pieces
                        === DATE SAUCE ===
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried thyme)
  5                     pitted dried dates -- roughly chopped
  1           teaspoon  anchovy paste
     1/4           cup  dry red wine
     1/4                balsamic reduction -- see * Note
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  To make balsamic reduction, pour 1 cup balsamic vinegar into a sauce pan and simmer over low heat.  Reduce down to 1/4 cup to make a syrup, or reduction, of balsamic vinegar.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

In a heavy-bottomed roasting pan, heat olive oil over medium heat.

In a small bowl, combine the thyme with the anchovy paste.  Season lamb with the salt and pepper, and smear lamb entirely with the thyme and anchovy paste mixture.  Brown the lamb on all sides in the roasting pan.

Add the onion, carrot, and celery and place lamb in oven.  Roast for 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until meat is fork tender.  Serve with the Date Sauce.

Date Sauce:  Using a mortar and pestle (or food processor) combine thyme, dates, and anchovy paste, and pulverize into a paste.  Add the red wine, balsamic reduction, and olive oil and continue to pulverize until completely combined.  Season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     roasting chicken - (4 1/2 to 5 lbs) -- with giblets
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped, plus
  1                     garlic clove -- thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  capers -- rinsed, drained,
                        and coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  finely chopped Italian parsley -- plus
  8              whole  parsley leaves
  2        tablespoons  grated pecorino or Parmigiano-Reggiano
  2             ounces  Genoa salami -- finely chopped
  1              large  egg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  dry white wine -- room temp, plus
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Remove the giblets from the chicken and set the bird on a rack in a roasting pan.  Tuck the gizzard in a corner of the pan to add flavor to the pan juices.

Chop the liver and heart as finely as possible and place in a small frying pan, along with the onion, chopped garlic, and 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Over medium-low heat, saute gently until chicken parts are browned and vegetables have softened.  Scrape mixture in a bowl, add the bread crumbs, capers, chopped parsley, cheese, and salami, and mix well.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg with a fork and mix into the stuffing mixture, combining with hands to blend quickly.  The mixture should be moist but not dripping.  Stuff the cavity of the chicken loosely with the stuffing mixture.

Use your fingers to loosen the chicken skin over both slides of the breast, and stuff a few garlic slices and parsley leaves between the skin and the meat.  Tie the legs together loosely with butcher's twine.

Rub the outside of the chicken with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, then season with salt and pepper.  Place the chicken in a roasting pan and cook for 45 minutes, or until skin is nicely browned.

Reduce heat to 350 degrees and baste the chicken with 1 cup of wine.  Return to the oven to roast for 30 to 45 minutes, basting every 10 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let rest 15 minutes before carving.  Pour pan juices into a measuring cup.  Deglaze the roasting pan with the remaining 2 tablespoons wine and add to the measuring cup.  Skim the fat that rises to the top and place the remaining juices in a small saucepan.  Reduce a few minutes over high heat to concentrate favors, and serve alongside chicken.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  medium mussels -- scrubbed, de-bearded
                        Dry white wine -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced garlic
  3        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crumbled oregano
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated pecorino or
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Prepare the scrubbed mussels for cooking by rinsing under running water.  Discard any that are gaping, keeping only those that are firmly closed; also discard any that are very heavy.

Place the mussels in a pan with 2 to 3 tablespoons of water or dry white wine over medium-high heat and cook, stirring frequently, just until the mussels begin to open.  (The mussels will continue cooking later).  With a slotted spoon, remove the mussels to a bowl as they open.

When all the mussels are removed, strain the liquid in the pot through a fine sieve or several layers of cheesecloth.  Reserve the liquid.  (You should have 1/4 cup of liquid; if not, make up the difference with a little dry white wine or water.)  Remove the mussels from their shells, reserving a half shell for each mussel.  Set the half shells on a baking sheet and place a mussel in each one.

In a small bowl, combine the garlic, parsley, oregano, grated cheese, and bread crumbs, then sprinkle the mixture over the mussels in a thin layer.  Drizzle the olive oil and reserved strained mussel liquid over the breadcrumbs.

Bake the mussels for about 10 minutes or until the tops are brown and crisp.  Serve piping hot or at room temperature.  Do not reheat.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

         Rum And Ricotta Fritters - {Fritelle Di Ricotta E Rhum}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fritters

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20            ounces  fresh whole milk ricotta
  5                     eggs -- separated
     1/4           cup  dark rum
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/3            cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
                        Peanut oil -- as needed
                        Confectioners' sugar -- as needed

In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the ricotta until it is smooth and creamy.  Turn the ricotta out into a large bowl and add the lightly beaten yolks, the rum, and the sugar, beating well.

Sift together the flour and baking powder and add to the ricotta mixture.  Beat the whites to stiff but not dry peaks and fold them gently into the ricotta mixture.

In a large, heavy-bottomed pan over a medium flame, slowly heat at least 4-inches of peanut oil and, before the oil reaches the smoking point, form the fritters by dropping scant tablespoonfuls of the batter into the bubbling oil.  Cook the fritters until golden, then turn, and cook the other side.

Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Dust with confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields 3 dozen fritters.

               Salt-Baked Snapper - {Pesce Arrosto In Sale}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  coarse sea salt
  2                     egg whites
  1              whole  fresh snapper or salmon - (at least 4 lbs) -- cleaned
                        Lemon wedges
                        High-quality extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Pour the sea salt into a large bowl, add the egg whites, and mix vigorously until all the grains of sea salt are coated with egg whites.

Spread 1/3 of the salt mixture over the bottom of a large rectangular or oval oven dish big enough to hold the whole fish.  Place the fish on top, then cover it completely with the rest of the salt.  No part of the fish should remain uncovered with salt.

Place the dish in the oven, reduce the heat to 400 degrees, and cook 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish; generally, cook for 10 minutes for every inch of thickness at the widest part of the fish.

Remove the fish from the oven.  Crack the crust at the table with the handle of a knife or a small hammer.  Serve with lemon wedges and drizzle with olive oil.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus a little
                        more to oil the pan
  2               cups  canned tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds -- lightly crushed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh sardines -- cleaned
  1         tablespoon  bread crumbs
     1/3           cup  dry white wine

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

In a saucepan over medium-low heat, gently saute the onion in 3 tablespoons of oil until soft and golden but not beginning to brown.  Add the chopped tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, or until most of the juice has evaporated and the tomatoes have reduced to a thick jam.  Stir in about half of the fennel seeds and add salt and pepper, as desired.

Use a little more oil to grease an oven dish large enough to hold the sardines in 1 layer.  Add all but 1/3 cup tomato sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish.

Arrange the fish on top of the tomato sauce in 1 layer.  Sprinkle a little salt, the bread crumbs, and the remaining fennel seeds on the fish.  Drizzle on the wine, then dot with the remaining tomato sauce.  Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                             Savory Fritters

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fritters

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  dry yeast
  2 1/2           cups  warm water -- (100 degrees)
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
  1                cup  Pepperonata -- (listed below)
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  drained capers
                        ===PEPERONATA ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     sweet red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and finely chopped
  1                     sweet yellow pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  Sherry vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water.  After 15 minutes, add another cup warm water and flour, stirring with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula just enough to mix dough without kneading.  Cover the bowl and set aside in a warm place to rise for 2 or 3 hours, or until doubled in size.

When the dough has risen, dissolve the salt in the remaining cup of warm water and add, mixing it into the dough with your hands.  The dough will look raggedy at first, but gradually will form a more creamy texture, though still lumpy.  Using hands as a paddle, beat dough until smooth and uniform in texture.  If necessary, beat in another 1/2 cup flour.  It should feel more like a dry batter than a bread dough.

Beat in the Pepperonata, then set aside under a cloth for 15 minutes.

In a tall-sided frying pan, heat the oil to 360 degrees.  Drop the capers into the oil.  After 30 seconds, remove and reserve most of the capers leaving some behind to flavor the oil.  Wet hands and squeeze a bit of dough in 1 hand, then transfer the dough to the other hand and carefully drop it in the oil.  Work in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan and lowering the temperature of the oil.

As soon as fritters are golden brown, turn and brown the second side.   Serve immediately, while crisp and hot, with the reserved capers.

Peperonata:  In a 12 to 14-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over high heat until almost smoking.

Add the peppers and saute over high heat 4 minutes, until browned at the edges and softened.  Add the sherry vinegar and salt and pepper, to taste, reduce the heat to medium, and continue to cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until peppers are tender.  Adjust seasoning and set aside to cool.

This recipe yields 50 to 60 fritters.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  ricotta salata -- grated
  3             ounces  aged pecorino -- grated
  6             ounces  whole-milk ricotta
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  toasted fennel seeds
  1              pound  bucatini
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
     2/3           cup  fresh bread crumbs
                        === RED PEPPER OIL ===
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil
  8                     jalapeÒos -- seeded, and
                        chopped into 1/8" dice
  2        tablespoons  crushed red pepper flakes

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a medium bowl, combine the cheeses with the red pepper flakes, black pepper, and the fennel seeds, mixing well.

Cook the pasta in the water according to the package directions, until tender yet al dente.  Reserve 1 cup of cooking water on the side and discard the rest.  Return the pasta to the dry pot and beat a few tablespoons of the hot water into the cheese mixture to thin it.  Pour the sauce over the pasta and toss over high heat 1 minute.  Season with salt, if necessary.

Serve with breadcrumbs sprinkled over and drizzled with Red Pepper Oil.

Red Pepper Oil:  Place the oil, jalapeÒos, and flakes in a medium saucepan and place over medium heat.  Heat to 175 degrees, remove from heat and allow to cool.  Allow to stand overnight and strain out solids.  This oil will last 3 weeks unrefrigerated in a cool and dark place.  (Makes approximately 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a 10-inch saute pan, heat the remaining 1/2 cup oil over medium-high heat and fry the bread cubes until golden brown on all sides.  Remove and drain on paper towels.

Divide hot stock meatballs and bread cubes among 6 to 8 warmed soup bowls and serve, garnished with extra grated cheese, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  onion -- coarsely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed, sliced
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus more,
                        to garnish
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped Italian parsley
  2               cans  tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
  1                     green pepper -- cored, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             pounds  white fish steaks
                        = (such as rock fish, mullet, cod,
                        haddock, halibut, or snapper)
  1              pound  spaghetti

In a large saucepan over medium heat, gently saute onion and garlic in oil until vegetables soften, about 10 minutes.  Stir all but 2 tablespoons of the parsley into the vegetables, then add the tomatoes, green pepper, pepper flakes, and salt, stirring to mix well.  Cover and cook over low heat for 20 minutes.

Add water and wine and bring to a simmer.  Adjust seasoning and add fish steaks, spooning sauce over to cover.  Cook 15 minutes, or until fish is cooked through.  Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Bring sauce to a boil and reduce until it coats the back of a spoon, removing any fish bones or skin you find.  Flake the cooked fish flesh and return to the reduced sauce.  Cook for 5 minutes to meld flavors, then remove from heat and set aside.

Cook spaghetti in boiling water until tender yet al dente, about 7 to 8 minutes.  Drain and add to the sauce.

Cook over high heat 45 seconds, then divide evenly among heated pasta bowls, sprinkle with remaining parsley, drizzle with oil, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves
  1              pound  boneless fillet salt cod -- soaked for 24 hours,
                        water changed every 8 hours, drained and
                        cut into 3" to 4" chunks
  1                     leek -- cleaned, and
                        thinly sliced into rings
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley -- plus extra,
                        for garnish
  2               cups  canned tomatoes -- chopped
  1              small  dried hot red chile pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a saucepan, large enough to hold sauce and pasta, heat olive oil over medium-low heat and gently saute garlic cloves 5 to 7 minutes, or until soft.

Add pieces of salt cod and raise heat slightly to cook cod on all sides, until it has lost its translucence.  Scatter leek and parsley over fish and continue cooking until vegetables have become very soft, about 10 minutes.  Add tomatoes, chile pepper, and salt and pepper, to taste, and stir to mix well.  Cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes, to reduce and thicken tomato juices.  Adjust seasoning.

Bring sauce back to a simmer, drain pasta and add to the sauce, stirring to mix well.  Return to medium-low heat and cook, covered, until pasta is cooked through.  Serve immediately, garnished with olives and parsley.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  2 1/2           cups  cake flour
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3                     eggs

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  blanched almonds
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cups  unseasoned fresh bread crumbs
  8                     salt-packed anchovy fillets -- rinsed, chopped

  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
  1                     onion -- finely chopped

Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil, drop in pasta and cook until al dente, about 10 to 12 minutes.

Drain and dress with tomato sauce and half of bread crumb mixture.  Sprinkle the remaining crumb mixture over top and serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- sliced
  6              small  tomatoes -- halved
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian parsley
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              piece  cinnamon stick - (2" long)
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless monkfish

In a saucepan over medium-low heat, gently sweat the garlic in the olive oil until it is very soft but not browned.  Add the onion and continue cooking 5 to 7 minutes, until the onion is soft and browning.  Increase the heat to medium-high and add tomato halves, cut-sides down. Cook the tomatoes, turning frequently, until they have released their juices and are very soft.

Stir in parsley, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and cinnamon, cover the pan and cook for 15 minutes, until the sauce is thick and flavorful.

Remove the cinnamon stick and push the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve or vegetable mill or process to a coarse puree.  Return the sauce to the rinsed-out pan over medium heat.  Cut the monkfish into 6 serving-sized pieces and add to the simmering sauce.  Cook, turning the fish pieces until the fish is cooked through but still firm, about 7 to 10 minutes.

Remove from heat and serve immediately, spooning sauce over fish pieces.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a saucepan over medium-low heat, gently sweat the garlic in the olive oil until it is very soft but not browned.  Add the onion and continue cooking 5 to 7 minutes, until the onion is soft and browning.  Increase the heat to medium-high and add tomato halves, cut-sides down. Cook the tomatoes, turning frequently, until they have released their juices and are very soft.

Stir in parsley, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and cinnamon, cover the pan and cook for 15 minutes, until the sauce is thick and flavorful.

Remove the cinnamon stick and push the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve or vegetable mill or process to a coarse puree.  Return the sauce to the rinsed-out pan over medium heat.  Cut the monkfish into 6 serving-sized pieces and add to the simmering sauce.  Cook, turning the fish pieces until the fish is cooked through but still firm, about 7 to 10 minutes.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  whole cuttlefish or squid of even size -- the 8 largest
                        pieces set aside and the remainder
                        cleaned and coarsely chopped
  2               cups  freshly-grated bread crumbs
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  3                     garlic cloves
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley -- plus
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  milk - (to 3)
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated caciocavallo cheese
                        = (or pecorino or Parmigiano-Reggiano)
  8              large  green olives -- pitted, and
                        coarsely chopped
  2                     drained canned plum tomatoes - (to 3) -- chopped
     1/2           cup  dry white wine -- more if necessary
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

In a medium bowl, combine the chopped cuttlefish with bread crumbs and eggs.  Chop two of the garlic cloves with the onion and add 1/3 cup parsley and add to bread crumbs.  Stir in the milk and 3 tablespoons oil and mix together briefly.  Add salt and pepper, cheese, olives, and tomatoes.  Using your hands, mix well, and stuff each of the whole cuttlefish loosely with the mixture.

Finely chop the remaining clove of garlic and mix with the remaining 3 tablespoons parsley.  In a pan large enough to hold the cuttlefish in one layer, heat remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat and add finely chopped garlic and parsley.

When aromatics begin to sizzle, arrange stuffed cuttlefish in the frying pan, open-side down.  Brown for about 3 to 4 minutes, then carefully turn, and brown on the other side.

When brown on both sides, add white wine to the pan, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, or until cuttlefish are tender.  If the pan starts to look dry, add more wine.

Serve immediately with lemon wedges, if desired, and the small amount of sauce left in the pan spooned over the liquid.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  finely-ground lean veal
     1/2         pound  finely-ground lean beef
  1                cup  freshly-grated bread crumbs -- plus
  3        tablespoons  freshly-grated bread crumbs
  1                cup  freshly-grated pecorino
  3                     eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  20                    leaves field spinach - (to 30) -- stems removed
  1                     carrot -- peeled, and
                        cut into 6 slices lengthwise
  3        tablespoons  flour
  6             slices  prosciutto
  6             slices  caciocavallo
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     rosemary sprigs
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  dry red wine

In a large bowl, combine the veal, 1 cup bread crumbs, grated cheese, eggs, and salt and pepper, to taste, and mix thoroughly with hands.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt.  Dip the spinach leaves in the water to just wilt and immediately remove.  Add the carrot slices to the boiling water and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, then remove and set aside.

Combine the flour with the remaining 3 tablespoons breadcrumbs and heavily dust a wooden work board with the mixture.  Pat the veal mixture into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle and lay the spinach leaves over the meat, leaving a 1-inch border on the short sides.  Lay the carrot slices over the spinach in the same fashion, then layer the prosciutto and the cheese.  Carefully roll the meat into a jellyroll, making it as firm as possible.  The sausage should be about 16 inches.  Cut the sausage in half crosswise, sealing the ends thoroughly with the meat to keep the cheese from oozing out during cooking.  Dust outsides with flour.

In a frying pan large enough to hold both rolls, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat.  Add the rosemary and polpettone and brown meat on all sides, turning it carefully with a wooden spoon or 2 spatulas.  When the meat is brown, remove and discard as much oil as possible.  Pour half the wine and the chicken stock over the browned rolls, turn heat to medium-low, cover pan and cook 15 minutes.  (If liquid evaporates, add a little water to the pan).  Remove cover, turn meat rolls over and pour remaining wine and chicken stock over them, cover again, and cook for an additional 15 minutes.

Transfer the meat rolls to a cutting board.  Return the skillet to medium-high heat and add 1/2 cup water to pan juices.  Cook down, scraping up any brown bits, until you have 2 to 3 tablespoons meat glaze.  Strain to remove rosemary leaves.  Let rolls cool to room temperature, then slice as thinly as possible, and serve with meat glaze drizzled over.

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatballs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  ground lean meat
                        = (a combination of veal and pork)
  1                cup  freshly-grated bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  grated pecorino
  2        tablespoons  minced flat-leaf parsley
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced
  1              whole  egg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  8                     drained canned plum tomatoes
  1              small  white onion -- peeled, sliced
  1         tablespoon  fresh herbs
                        = (such as basil, mint, or oregano)

Using your hands and working quickly, combine meat, bread crumbs, grated cheese, parsley, garlic, egg, salt, and pepper in a bowl.

In a pan with sides tall enough for deep-frying, heat 1 cup oil to 360 degrees.  While the oil is heating, form meat mixture into little balls no more than 3/4-inch in diameter.  When oil is hot, toss meatballs in, a few at a time, and fry until brown on all sides.  As they finish cooking, set aside to drain.

Gently stew the tomatoes and onion in 2 tablespoons oil in a saucepan over medium heat, crushing tomatoes with a fork as they cook, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the sauce is dense.  Taste and add salt, if necessary.  Transfer to a food processor or food mill and process briefly to make a smooth puree.

Return puree to pan, add drained meatballs, and let bubble over medium-low heat for 2 to 3 minutes to absorb flavors.  Just before serving, stir in fresh herbs.

This recipe yields 24 to 30 meatballs, 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              ounce  pancetta -- cut into lardons
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1                cup  farro or whole wheat berries
     1/2           cup  diced celery
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped escarole
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped zucchini
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped chicory
  1           teaspoon  fresh marjoram
  1         tablespoon  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)

Bring 2 cups of water to a boil and stir into the farro mixture.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, and cover and cook very slowly, adding boiling water from time to time as the grain begins to absorb the water.

When the kernels start to get tender, add the celery, escarole, zucchini, and chicory.  Stir in the marjoram and tomato sauce, and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Continue cooking until farro is very tender and serve immediately with grated cheese.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
