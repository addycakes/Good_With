Categories    : Appetizers                      Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lobe Grade A foie gras -- veins and
                        impurities removed
  4               cups  Kosher salt
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  ground nutmeg
  1         tablespoon  allspice
  2        tablespoons  cinnamon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground cloves
                        Crisped toast points -- for serving
                        Onion marmalade or berry compote -- for garnish
                        = (or peach, apricot preserves etc.)

Allow the foie gras to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Combine the spices in a mixing bowl and set aside.

Place a piece of cheesecloth on a flat work surface, and place the foie gras in the center.  Gently roll the foie gras in 1 direction (as though using a rolling pin) so that it forms a tight cylinder or log.  Continue rolling the foie gras in the cheesecloth until it is as tightly furled as possible, about 1 1/2 to 2-inches in diameter, then twist and tie the ends with twine.

Pour a third of the spice mixture into a loaf pan or small casserole dish at least 3 inches in height.  Place the rolled foie gras in the spice bed and cover completely with the remaining spice cure.  Cover the foie gras tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 3 days.

Remove the foie gras from the refrigerator, unwrap and thinly slice.  Serve the sliced foie gras atop toasted thinly sliced bread, with a dollop of something fruity on top.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 appetizer servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  melted butter
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Hot pepper sauce -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  minced spearmint leaves
     1/8      teaspoon  ground pink peppercorns
  6                     single baby rib lamb chops - (abt 1 lb) -- Frenched
  1                     garlic clove -- minced

In the top of a double boiler, whip the egg yolks over hot water until they thicken to the consistency of heavy cream.  Add the melted butter very slowly, whipping vigorously so the sauce emulsifies.  When all the butter has been added, add the lemon juice a bit at a time and remove from heat.  Add salt and hot pepper sauce to taste, and stir in the spearmint and peppercorns.  Keep warm while cooking the lamb chops.

Rub the lamb chops with garlic, salt and Essence and grill for 1 to 2 minutes per side (or broil under a broiler for 1 to 2 minutes per side) for medium-rare, turning once.  Serve with the Mint Hollandaise.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  24                    oysters in their shells -- washed

In a bowl combine all the ingredients except the oysters, and mix well.  Adjust the seasoning to taste and transfer the mixture to a large piece of plastic wrap.  Roll up the flavored butter to form a tight log and freeze.  (Alternately, the flavored butter can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.)

Preheat a gas or charcoal grill.  Remove the cold log of butter from the freezer and unwrap.  Shuck the oysters and discard the top shell, leaving the oysters on the bottom half shell.  Slice thin rounds of butter, about 1 1/2 teaspoons each, and place 1 round on top of each oyster.

Place the oysters on the heated grill, close the grill cover, and cook, covered, until the butter is melted and bubbly, and the oysters are no longer opaque and have curled around the edges, about 4 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings (24 baked oysters).

                        Parsley

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

For the Oxtails:  Season flour with salt and pepper.  Dredge oxtails in flour.  In a large Dutch oven, over medium heat, add the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the oxtails, in batches, and brown for about 3 minutes on all sides.  Remove from the pan and set aside.

Add the onions, celery, and carrots.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ until the vegetables start to wilt, about 6 minutes.  Stir in the garlic, bay leaves and stock.  Scraping the bottom and sides of the pan to loosen the brown particles.

Return the oxtails to the pot and cook, covered, until the sauce is stew-like and the meat starts to fall of the bone, about 2 hours.  Baste the oxtails often during the cooking time.  Check the seasoning and add salt and pepper if needed.

For the Pudding:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Mash the potatoes in a mixing bowl, until smooth.  Add the eggs and milk and mix well.  Add the nutmeg, cinnamon, 1/2 cup of the pecans, 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, syrup, salt, vanilla, and bourbon.  Mix well.  Pour the mixture into a 1 1/2-quart round baking dish.

Combine the remaining 1/2 cup pecans and the remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar with the butter and mix well.  Dot the top of the potato mixture with spoonfuls of the butter mixture.  Bake for about 45 minutes, or until bubbly.

For the Fried Okra:  In a mixing bowl, combine the buttermilk, hot sauce, and egg.  Mix well.  Add the okra, season with salt and turn to coat evenly.  Let sit for 30 minutes.

In another mixing bowl, combine the flour and cornmeal.  Mix well and season with Creole seasoning.  Heat the oil in a skillet.  Dredge each of the okra in the seasoned flour, coating completely.

When the oil is hot, add the okra, split-side down and fry, turning once, for about 2 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with Creole seasoning.

To serve, spoon some of the pudding in the center of each plate.  Place some of the oxtails and gravy around the pudding.  Pile the fried okra on top of the pudding.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

For the Pudding:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Mash the potatoes in a mixing bowl, until smooth.  Add the eggs and milk and mix well.  Add the nutmeg, cinnamon, 1/2 cup of the pecans, 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, syrup, salt, vanilla, and bourbon.  Mix well.  Pour the mixture into a 1 1/2-quart round baking dish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the remaining 1/2 cup pecans and the remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar with the butter and mix well.  Dot the top of the potato mixture with spoonfuls of the butter mixture.  Bake for about 45 minutes, or until bubbly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Fried Okra:  In a mixing bowl, combine the buttermilk, hot sauce, and egg.  Mix well.  Add the okra, season with salt and turn to coat evenly.  Let sit for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In another mixing bowl, combine the flour and cornmeal.  Mix well and season with Creole seasoning.  Heat the oil in a skillet.  Dredge each of the okra in the seasoned flour, coating completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the oil is hot, add the okra, split-side down and fry, turning once, for about 2 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with Creole seasoning.
</DirT>

To serve, spoon some of the pudding in the center of each plate.  Place some of the oxtails and gravy around the pudding.  Pile the fried okra on top of the pudding.  Garnish with parsley.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  old-fashioned or quick cooking grits -- (but not instant)
  4               cups  water
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1              bunch  scallions -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-grated cheddar
     1/2           cup  crumbled crispy bacon
     1/2           cup  egg whites - (from 4 eggs)

In a saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil over high heat and stir in grits.  Return to a boil and reduce heat to low, cover pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until grits are smooth and creamy, 10 to 20 minutes (depending on type of grits used).  Transfer grits to a large bowl and allow to cool, stirring frequently to prevent a skin from forming.

In a skillet melt butter and sautÈ scallions and garlic until softened and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.

When grits are cooled, stir in sautÈed scallions and season with crushed red pepper, salt, black pepper, grated cheese and crumbled bacon.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 9- by 13-inch heavy gratin dish or cast iron skillet and set aside.

In a large bowl beat egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff peaks form.  Gently mix 1/3 of the beaten whites into the grit mixture, then fold in remaining whites, being careful to not overmix.  Transfer to prepared baking dish and bake in top of oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until risen and golden brown on top.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil over high heat and stir in grits.  Return to a boil and reduce heat to low, cover pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until grits are smooth and creamy, 10 to 20 minutes (depending on type of grits used).  Transfer grits to a large bowl and allow to cool, stirring frequently to prevent a skin from forming.

<DirT>
In a skillet melt butter and sautÈ scallions and garlic until softened and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When grits are cooled, stir in sautÈed scallions and season with crushed red pepper, salt, black pepper, grated cheese and crumbled bacon.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 9- by 13-inch heavy gratin dish or cast iron skillet and set aside.
</DirT>

In a large bowl beat egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff peaks form.  Gently mix 1/3 of the beaten whites into the grit mixture, then fold in remaining whites, being careful to not overmix.  Transfer to prepared baking dish and bake in top of oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until risen and golden brown on top.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRABMEAT RAVIOLI ===
     2/3           cup  lump crabmeat -- picked over
                        to remove cartilage and shells
  1           teaspoon  white truffle oil
  2          teaspoons  chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  chopped tarragon
  1 1/2       teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  24                    wonton wrappers
  2 1/2           cups  canola or vegetable oil
                        === SWEET CORN MAQUE CHOUX ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3 1/2           cups  corn kernels
                        = (or 4 fresh ears, kernels removed)
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onion
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped green bell pepper
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped red bell pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a mixing bowl combine the lump crabmeat, truffle oil, parsley, tarragon, 1/2 teaspoon salt and white pepper.  Refrigerate until ready to assemble the ravioli.

Spread 12 wonton wrappers on a flat work surface.  In the center of each wrapper, place approximately 1 tablespoon of crabmeat filling.  Wet the edges of the wrappers with water and top with the remaining 12 wrappers, gently pressing from the center out to expel any air, and sealing the edges with your fingers.

In a heavy 2-gallon stockpot heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Carefully slip the ravioli into the hot oil in batches and fry until golden brown on each side, turning with a slotted spoon, about 1 1/2 minutes total cooking time.  Remove the ravioli to a paper towel covered plate to drain and sprinkle lightly with Essence to taste.

For the Sweet Corn Maque Choux:  In a large skillet, heat the butter over medium high heat.  Add the corn, onion, green and red bell peppers, and remaining teaspoon salt to the pan, and sautÈ until soft, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the garlic to the pan and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent sticking.  Add the heavy cream and reduce until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.  Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

Serve 3 ravioli per person on a bed of Sweet Corn Maque Choux.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer servings.

In a mixing bowl combine the lump crabmeat, truffle oil, parsley, tarragon, 1/2 teaspoon salt and white pepper.  Refrigerate until ready to assemble the ravioli.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread 12 wonton wrappers on a flat work surface.  In the center of each wrapper, place approximately 1 tablespoon of crabmeat filling.  Wet the edges of the wrappers with water and top with the remaining 12 wrappers, gently pressing from the center out to expel any air, and sealing the edges with your fingers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a heavy 2-gallon stockpot heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Carefully slip the ravioli into the hot oil in batches and fry until golden brown on each side, turning with a slotted spoon, about 1 1/2 minutes total cooking time.  Remove the ravioli to a paper towel covered plate to drain and sprinkle lightly with Essence to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Sweet Corn Maque Choux:  In a large skillet, heat the butter over medium high heat.  Add the corn, onion, green and red bell peppers, and remaining teaspoon salt to the pan, and sautÈ until soft, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the garlic to the pan and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent sticking.  Add the heavy cream and reduce until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.  Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve 3 ravioli per person on a bed of Sweet Corn Maque Choux.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CROSTINI ===
  1                     Italian baguette loaf -- cut into 1/4"
                        to 1/2" diagonal slices
                        Olive oil -- for brushing
                        === CHICKEN LIVER SPREAD ===
  2        tablespoons  bacon fat or butter
     1/2                yellow onion -- minced
  1              pound  chicken livers -- cleaned, trimmed,
                        and chopped
     1/2           cup  Cognac or brandy
  8                     fresh sage leaves -- minced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  capers -- drained
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

For the Crostini:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Set the slices on a baking sheet and lightly brush with the olive oil.  Bake until light brown on both sides, turning once, about 4 minutes.  Alternately the bread may be browned on a grill, which will impart a light smoky flavor.

For the Chicken Liver Spread:  In a large skillet melt the bacon fat over medium-high heat, add the onion and sautÈ until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the chicken livers, Cognac and sage to the pan and sautÈ until the livers are browned on all sides but still slightly pink in the center.  Stir in the capers and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Transfer the chicken liver mixture to a food processor and puree on high speed.  Allow to cool before spreading on the Crostini.

Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     duck - (4 to 5 lbs) -- skinned, and
                        cut into quarters
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  flour
  1                cup  finely-diced yellow onion
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped bell pepper
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1             bottle  amber or dark lager beer - (12 oz)
  1              quart  cold duck or chicken stock
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
     3/4         pound  hot Andouille sausage -- cut 3/4" pieces
  1                     sheet prepared puff pastry
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water

Cut the skin into strips, and season the duck quarters lightly with salt, cayenne and white pepper.

Heat a large stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add the strips of duck skin and the duck quarters to the pot and cook until the fat is rendered (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup), and the duck is brown on all sides, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove the skin and discard, and drain the duck pieces on paper towels.

Sprinkle the flour into the fat in the pan, stirring with a wooden spoon for approximately 15 minutes to make a brown roux.  Add the onions, celery and bell pepper to the pot and cook until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic to pan and cook another 2 minutes, then deglaze the pot with the beer, stirring well to remove any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.

Add the stock, bay leaves, parsley and return the duck quarters to the pot, and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until the duck meat is tender, skimming to remove any foam which forms on the surface.

In a frying pan, over medium-high heat, cook the andouille until brown on all sides, stirring to turn, about 10 minutes.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Using tongs or a slotted spoon, carefully remove the duck pieces from the hot stock and cool before pulling the meat from the bones.  Discard the bones and return the meat to the stockpot and add the cooked andouille.  Continue cooking as needed until the etouffee is thickened and slightly reduced.  Transfer the etouffee to a large casserole or skillet.

Place the puff pastry on a lightly floured board and roll out to fit the casserole dish.  Carefully lay the puff pastry sheet on top of the dish, turning the edges under and crimping to seal.  Brush the top of the sheet with the egg wash and bake in the oven until the top of the pastry is puffed and golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  foie gras
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              pound  duck meat -- cubed 1" pieces
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1           teaspoon  cumin -- or more to taste
     1/2           cup  zucchini brunoise
     1/2           cup  yellow squash brunoise
     1/2           cup  carrots brunoise
  1         tablespoon  minced jalapeÒos
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  chopped tomato
  1 1/2         quarts  rich duck stock
  2               cups  cooked white hominy -- rinsed, drained
  2               cups  blanched sweet corn
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
  2                     limes -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Divide foie gras in half.  Slice 1 portion into 6 slices, wrap well in plastic wrap and keep refrigerated.  Cut remaining portion into 1/2-inch pieces.

In a large pot render the foie gras pieces with the olive oil until only crispy bits remain and all fat is rendered.  Remove the foie bits with a slotted spoon or skimmer and set aside (reserve).

Add duck meat and sear well on all sides.  Add onions and cumin and continue to cook until onions are soft and have begun to caramelize, about 4 minutes.  Add zucchini, yellow squash and carrots and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add jalapeÒos and garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Add tomatoes and cook for 3 minutes, making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Add duck stock and drained hominy and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 1 hour.  Add blanched corn and cook for 10 minutes.

In a very hot skillet sear foie gras slices briefly on both sides until golden brown.  Remove from skillet and drain on paper towels.  Add cilantro and reserved foie gras bits to pozole and season with lime juice and salt and pepper.  Serve immediately, topped with 1 piece of seared foie gras.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  carrots
  3                     celery stalks
  2             medium  yellow onions
  1                     chicken - (3 to 4 lbs)
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  black peppercorns
  1                cup  peas
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     garlic cloves
  8             ounces  wood ear or shiitake mushrooms -- finely sliced
                        Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
                        === PIE DOUGH ===
  2 1/4           cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  cold unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  ice water
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Cut 1 carrot and 1 stalk of celery into large dice, and peel and quarter 1 yellow onion.

In a large stockpot, place the chicken, diced vegetables, onion, 1 bay leaf and peppercorns, cover with water, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Lower heat to a simmer and cook the chicken until tender, 20 to 30 minutes, skimming the foam which may form on the surface.

Remove the chicken from the pot and let cool.  Strain the stock into a clean stockpot and reduce over high heat to 3 cups, then cool.  Skin and bone the chicken, and discard.  Cut the meat into 1-inch pieces and set aside.

Make the pie dough by combining the flour and salt in a medium bowl.  Add the butter and work with your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Using the tines of a fork, stir in the water 1 tablespoon at a time, and work with your hands just until a smooth ball forms, being careful not to overwork the dough.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 20 minutes.

Peel and dice the remaining 2 carrots and onion, and dice the remaining 2 stalks of celery.  In a medium pot blanch the carrots and peas in boiling water until just cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Drain and reserve.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a large skillet or pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  SautÈ the onions and celery until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and mushrooms to the pan and continue cooking until the mushrooms are soft and give off their liquid, about 5 minutes.  Add Essence.  Sprinkle the flour into the vegetables to make a roux, cooking for 2 to 3 minutes to slightly thicken.  Add the wine, cream and cold stock, stirring well.  Add the chicken and parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Transfer the chicken mixture to a large skillet or casserole dish, or divide among 8 (2-cup) baking dishes.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a floured surface.  Roll out the dough to fit the skillet, or cut into 8 shapes to top the 2-cup casserole dishes.  Gently transfer to the skillet, turning the edges under to seal.  Brush the top of the pastry with the egg wash and cut a pattern of slits over the crust.  Bake until the crusts are golden brown and the contents are hot and bubbly, about 10 to 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut 1 carrot and 1 stalk of celery into large dice, and peel and quarter 1 yellow onion.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large stockpot, place the chicken, diced vegetables, onion, 1 bay leaf and peppercorns, cover with water, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Lower heat to a simmer and cook the chicken until tender, 20 to 30 minutes, skimming the foam which may form on the surface.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the chicken from the pot and let cool.  Strain the stock into a clean stockpot and reduce over high heat to 3 cups, then cool.  Skin and bone the chicken, and discard.  Cut the meat into 1-inch pieces and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the pie dough by combining the flour and salt in a medium bowl.  Add the butter and work with your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Using the tines of a fork, stir in the water 1 tablespoon at a time, and work with your hands just until a smooth ball forms, being careful not to overwork the dough.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Peel and dice the remaining 2 carrots and onion, and dice the remaining 2 stalks of celery.  In a medium pot blanch the carrots and peas in boiling water until just cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Drain and reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large skillet or pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  SautÈ the onions and celery until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and mushrooms to the pan and continue cooking until the mushrooms are soft and give off their liquid, about 5 minutes.  Add Essence.  Sprinkle the flour into the vegetables to make a roux, cooking for 2 to 3 minutes to slightly thicken.  Add the wine, cream and cold stock, stirring well.  Add the chicken and parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the chicken mixture to a large skillet or casserole dish, or divide among 8 (2-cup) baking dishes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a floured surface.  Roll out the dough to fit the skillet, or cut into 8 shapes to top the 2-cup casserole dishes.  Gently transfer to the skillet, turning the edges under to seal.  Brush the top of the pastry with the egg wash and cut a pattern of slits over the crust.  Bake until the crusts are golden brown and the contents are hot and bubbly, about 10 to 15 minutes.

                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3               cups  finely-chopped onions
  1                cup  finely-chopped celery
  1                cup  finely-chopped carrots
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2             pounds  ground turkey
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  Italian seasoning
  1         tablespoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2                     bay leaves
  3               cans  whole tomatoes - (15 oz ea) -- roughly chopped
  3               cans  tomato sauce - (15 oz ea)
  1                can  tomato paste - (6 oz)
  4               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  dry red wine
     1/2           cup  whole milk

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Add the ground turkey to the vegetables, stirring to mix and break up the meat, and cook until starting to brown and no longer pink, about 10 minutes.  Season the meat with thyme, Italian seasoning, Essence and salt, to taste.

Add all remaining ingredients except the milk, lower the heat and simmer uncovered until thickened, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours, stirring from time to time.

Immediately prior to serving, add the milk to the sauce and stir well to incorporate.  Serve over cooked pasta, such as spaghetti or linguini.

This recipe yields about 2 gallons of sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     3/4          cups  heavy cream
     3/4          cups  buttermilk
  3 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  1              pinch  salt
  4                     egg yolks
  2 1/2         ounces  Hawaiian Vintage or other
                        high quality semisweet chocolate
  1        tablespoons  butter
     3/4      teaspoon  vanilla
                        === CHOCOLATE COOKIE CRUST ===
  2               cups  graham cracker cookie crumbs
  1 1/2           cups  Oreo cookie crumbs (white centers removed)
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- melted

In a small saucepan combine the sugar, heavy cream, buttermilk, cornstarch and pinch of salt, and whisk until smooth.  Place over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil, whisking from time to time, for the sugar and cornstarch to dissolve and the mixture to thicken, about 5 minutes.  Continue cooking at a low boil for an additional 5 minutes, whisking constantly.

In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks lightly.  Pour 1/2 cup of the hot mixture into the egg yolks and whisk thoroughly.  Pour the egg yolk mixture into the saucepan and whisk over the heat until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds.  Pour the mixture into a mixing bowl, and whisk in the chocolate, butter and vanilla.  Continue whisking until thoroughly combined (mixture will be very thick).

Pour the chocolate batter into the prepared pie crust and refrigerate until firm and cool, at least 4 hours.

For the Chocolate Cookie Crust:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In the bowl of a food processor or blender, process the graham crackers and Oreos to make crumbs.

In a bowl mix together the cookie crumbs, sugar and butter with your hands.  Press the mixture evenly into a 9-inch pie pan.  (It will seem like an excessive amount of crumbs, but it will compress down quite a bit with pressure.)  Cover the crust with plastic wrap and top with another 9-inch pan, pressing quite firmly to make a smooth surface.

Bake the crust for 15 minutes.  Remove the crust from the oven and let cool completely before filling.  (Makes 1 (9-inch) crust)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE STOCK ===
  1              whole  chicken - (abt 5 lbs) -- rinsed, innards
                        removed, and patted dry
  2             medium  onions -- quartered
  4             medium  carrots -- peeled, chopped
  4                     celery stalks -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     bay leaves
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme
                        Water -- to cover
                        === FOR THE DRESSING ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2               cups  chopped onions
  1                cup  chopped celery
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  2               cups  cornbread cubes
  2               cups  white bread cubes
  2        tablespoons  ground sage
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves -- plus extra
                        for garnish
  1              large  egg

For the stock:  In a large stock pot, combine the chicken, onions, carrots, celery, garlic, salt, pepper, bay leaves, thyme and water.  Season heavily with salt.  Place the pot over medium heat and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 2 hours, or until the chicken is tender.

Remove the pan from the heat and cool the chicken completely in the cooking liquid.  Remove the chicken and strain the liquid, set aside.  Remove the skin, fat and bones from the chicken.  Medium dice the chicken meat and set aside.

For the dressing:  In a sautÈ pan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the onions and celery.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ for 3 to 4 minutes, or until wilted.  Add the garlic and continue to sautÈ for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and pour into a large mixing bowl.

Add the bread cubes, sage, parsley, and egg.  Mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the diced chicken meat.  Stir in enough of the stock, so the mixture is very wet, about 3 to 4 cups.  Allow the dressing to sit for 30 minutes.  (Add more of the stock if needed.  The mixture should still be very wet after it has set.)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a deep casserole baking dish and pour in the mixture.  Bake for about 1 hour, or until bubbly and golden brown.  Spoon onto serving plates and garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  Chinese cellophane or glass noodles -- cooked
  1               dash  sesame oil
  1               dash  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  chopped green onions
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     rice papers or spring roll wrappers
  1              pound  jumbo lump crabmeat -- picked over
                        for cartilage
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  2          teaspoons  chili paste
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  bean sprouts
     1/2           cup  julienned papaya
     1/2           cup  julienned carrots
     1/2           cup  cilantro leaves - (packed)
     1/2           cup  fresh mint leaves - (packed)
  1                cup  Spicy Peanut Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh cilantro leaves

Preheat the fryer.  In a small mixing bowl, add the noodles.  Season the noodles with sesame oil, soy sauce, salt, green onions and black pepper.  Mix thoroughly.

Bring water to a boil in a 10-inch sautÈ pan and remove from the heat.  Submerge each spring roll wrapper, 1 at a time, in the hot water, moving it around in the water until soft and pliable, 10 to 15 seconds.  Remove and lay on the parchment paper.

In another small mixing bowl, combine the crabmeat, mayonnaise, and chili paste.  Mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.

Place 1 tablespoon of the noodle mixture over the crab mixture.  On top of the noodles, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the sprouts.  Top the sprouts with the 1 tablespoon of the papaya, 1 tablespoon of the carrots, 1 tablespoon of the cilantro, and 1 tablespoon of the mint.  Fold 2 sides of the wrapper toward the center about 1/4-inch, then roll each like a jelly roll, pressing the edges together to seal.

Fry half of the spring rolls until golden.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt.  Repeat with remaining spring rolls.  Slice each roll in half diagonally.  Serve the rolls on a large platter with the spicy peanut dipping sauce.  Garnish with chives.

This recipe yields 8 rolls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  butter
  1              pound  Asiago or Parmesan -- freshly grated

In a medium non-stick skillet melt the butter to just coat the bottom of the pan.  Sprinkle a fine layer of grated cheese in a circular pattern over the bottom of the pan and shake the pan to evenly distribute, as though making an omelet.

Cook over medium heat until it has melted and formed a light crust, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Continue to cook the cheese until the edges set and a golden crust develops, about 1/2 minute.  Carefully lift and turn the layer of cheese with a spatula and cook until lightly golden on the second side, about 1/2 minute.

Remove the Frico from the pan and either set it flat on a paper towel, shape it over an inverted custard cup, or drape it over a rolling pin or dowel.  Allow to cool slightly before serving.  Continue with remaining cheese.

This recipe yields 20 frico.

     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  2               cups  canola oil
     1/4           cup  ketchup
  2        tablespoons  sweet pickle relish
  1         tablespoon  prepared horseradish
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  Crystal Hot sauce
  2        tablespoons  chopped scallions, green part only
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        === FOR PICKLES ===
  1 1/2           cups  sliced dill pickles -- drained, patted dry
  4                     eggs
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
  1                cup  masa harina
  2        tablespoons  Essence Creole seasoning -- see * Note
                        Oil -- for deep frying

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Prepare sauce:  In a blender combine eggs, salt, and juice of half a lemon.  Process briefly to combine.  While motor is running, add oil in a slow, steady stream until mayonnaise has emulsified.  Transfer to a non-reactive bowl and add all remaining ingredients.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside to serve with fried pickles.

Drain pickle slices on paper towels.  Combine the eggs and milk.  Coat pickles with egg wash.  Combine cornmeal and masa harina and season with Essence.  Transfer pickles to seasoned cornmeal, shake off any excess, and deep fry in 350 degree oil in batches until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Drain well on paper towels before serving.

This recipe yields about 2 cups fried pickles, enough to accompany 6 sandwiches.

        Goat Cheese-Vegetable Ravioli, Citrus-Tomato Broth, Leeks

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : First Course

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RAVIOLI ===
     1/2                of the roasted vegetables -- minced
  4             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     sheets fresh pasta, abt 10" by 12"
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
                        === ROASTED VEGETABLES ===
     1/2                fennel bulb
     1/2                leek
  1             medium  onion
  1              small  zucchini
  1              small  yellow squash
  1             medium  carrot
  1             medium  parsnip
  1              small  turnip
  1              small  beet
  1                     celery rib
  6                     Roma plum tomatoes -- quartered
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === CITRUS-TOMATO BROTH ===
     1/2                of the roasted vegetables
  2                     bay leaves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  black peppercorns
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled, smashed
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/2                orange -- juiced
     1/2                lime -- juiced
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === MELTED LEEKS ===
  2             pounds  leeks -- julienned
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

For the Ravioli:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a mixing bowl combine the minced roasted vegetables, goat cheese, salt and pepper, and mix well.  Lay 1 sheet of fresh pasta on top of a ravioli form, placing half on the form and the other half hanging off onto the work surface.  Place 1 tablespoon of vegetable filling in the center of each ravioli hollow.

Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the areas between hollows with some of the beaten egg.  Fold the sheet of pasta over so that the ravioli "pockets" are covered.  Using a rolling pin, roll over the ravioli form with firm pressure to seal the raviolis and to perforate pasta between each ravioli.

Remove excess pasta from the edges, and check to make sure the raviolis are properly sealed.  Repeat the entire procedure with the remaining 2 sheets of pasta.

Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over high heat.  Add the ravioli in batches and cook until just done, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the ravioli with a slotted spoon, place 3 on each serving plate, and top each serving with 1/2 cup broth and a large dollop of the melted leeks.

For the Roasted Vegetables:  Roughly chop the vegetables to an equal size, approximately 2-inch pieces.  Place in a large bowl and toss with the olive oil, then season lightly with salt and white pepper.  Roast the vegetables in a roasting pan until evenly browned, about 1 hour.

Remove the equivalent of 1/2-cup of assorted roasted vegetables from the pan to make the ravioli filling.  Finely chop the 1/2-cup vegetables and place, covered, in the refrigerator until ready to use.

For the Citrus-Tomato Broth:  In a large, heavy stockpot, combine the roasted vegetables with 1 gallon of water, 2 bay leaves, the peppercorns and thyme, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the stock for 3 hours.  Strain with a fine mesh strainer into a clean wide-mouth pot, bring to a boil, add the tomato paste, and reduce to 2 cups over medium-low heat.  Remove the broth from the heat and stir in the honey, orange juice, lime juice, and lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper.

For the Melted Leeks:  In a large sautÈ pan over medium heat lightly sweat leeks with butter until very soft, stirring constantly to avoid coloring, about 5 minutes.  Add wine and bring to a simmer and continue to cook at a low boil for about 20 minutes, until leeks are very soft and tender and almost all liquid has evaporated.  Season, to taste, with salt and white pepper.

This recipe yields 4 first-course servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  crawfish tails or small peeled shrimp
  1         tablespoon  Creole seasoning -- see * Note
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
     1/3           cup  chopped green onions
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  12             large  fresh poblano or New Mexico chiles
  2              large  corn ears
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6             ounces  soft fresh goat cheese, such as Montrachet -- crumbled, and
                        at room temperature,
  6             ounces  grated Colby or mild cheddar cheese
                        Salsa -- (optional)
                        Sour cream -- (optional)

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat a gas or charcoal grill.  Season the crawfish tails with the Creole seasoning.  In a medium, heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the green onions and garlic and sautÈ for 1 minute.  Add the crawfish tails and sautÈ for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Char the chiles over the grill until blackened on all sides.  Meanwhile, rub 1 teaspoon olive oil on each ear of corn and sprinkle with the salt.  Grill the corn until cooked through, about 8 to 12 minutes.  Remove the corn from the grill and let cool.  Seal the chiles in a plastic or paper bag and let stand 10 minutes.  Peel and seed the chiles, leaving the stem end intact, and set aside.

Cut the corn from the cob and place the kernels in a mixing bowl.  Add the crawfish tails, goat cheese and Colby cheese, and mix well.  Form the mixture into 12 equal portions, about 3 tablespoons each, and stuff into the seeded chiles, pressing to close.

Place the stuffed chiles on the hot grill and cook, turning, until the cheese is just melted, about 3 minutes.  Serve immediately with salsa and sour cream for dipping, as desired.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1              large  egg
  6                     six-inch pie crust rounds
  3                     chocolate bars
  1                cup  mini-marshmallows
  2        tablespoons  softened butter

Preheat a gas or charcoal grill.

Place the sweet potatoes on the grill and cook, turning often, until the sweet potatoes are soft and yield when gently squeezed, about 30 to 45 minutes.  Remove from the grill and allow to cool before handling.

Scoop the sweet potato flesh into a mixing bowl and discard the skins.  With a potato masher or heavy fork, mash the potatoes with the cream, then add the brown sugar, pecans, Bourbon, cinnamon, nutmeg and egg, mixing well.  Divide the mixture into 6 portions.

Place 1 pie crust on a flat work surface and place one portion of the sweet potato mixture in the middle.  Top the sweet potato filling with half of a chocolate bar and 2 tablespoons marshmallows, then fold one half of the crust over the filling.  Crimp the edges of the pie crust and turn over to seal well.  Repeat with the remaining crusts and fillings.

Gently rub about 1 teaspoon butter on both sides of the pies and place in aluminum foil.  Place the filled pies on the grill, and cook for 5 minutes on each side.  Unwrap the pies and return to the grill to brown on both sides, being careful that the crusts do not burn, about 2 minutes per side.

Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Candies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1                     vanilla bean -- halved, and
                        seeds scraped from pod
  1              pound  Hawaiian Vintage semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  Nocello
  1                cup  cashews -- finely chopped,
                        and lightly toasted

In a saucepan, bring the cream and vanilla bean and seeds to a simmer over medium heat.  Remove the pan from the heat and remove the vanilla bean.  Add the chocolate and whisk until smooth.  Mix in the Nocello.  Cool completely, stirring occasionally, usually about 30 minutes.  Chill the mixture, covered, until firm, usually 2 to 3 hours.

Line a baking sheet with waxed paper and place the chopped, toasted nuts in a medium bowl or baking dish.  Using a melon baller, scoop out the truffle mixture to form 1-inch round balls.  Roll lightly in your hands if necessary to shape, then roll in the nuts, pressing lightly so that nuts adhere to the truffle.  Place truffles on prepared baking sheet, cover and chill until firm, about 2 hours.

This recipe yields about 40.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          envelopes  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- plus
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2               cups  warm water -- (abt 110 degrees)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  salt
  5               cups  flour
  4        tablespoons  yellow cornmeal
  1                     egg yolk -- mixed with
  1         tablespoon  water

Using an electric mixer with a dough hook, combine the yeast, sugar and warm water and mix for 2 minutes to dissolve the yeast.  Add the salt and flour.  With the mixer on low, mix until the dough starts to come together.  Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl and crawls up to dough hook.

Grease a mixing bowl with the oil.  Place the dough in the greased bowl and turn once.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft free place until the dough doubles in size about 1 1/2 hours.

Remove the dough from the bowl and invert it onto a heavily floured surface.  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions.  Pat each portion into a large rectangle, about 3/4-inch thick.  Roll up the dough, beginning with the short side and stopping after each full turn to press the edge of the roll firmly into the flat sheet of dough to seal.  Press with your fingertips.  Tuck and roll so that any seams disappear into the dough.

Sprinkle a baking sheet evenly with 2 tablespoons of the cornmeal.  Place the loaves on the baking sheet, about 3 inches apart.  Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons cornmeal.  Cover the loaves with a cloth and let rise until double in size, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

With a sharp knife, make diagonal slashes, about 1-inch apart, on the top of each loaf.  With a pastry brush, brush the egg wash evenly over each loaf.  Place a cup of hot water in an oven-proof container on the baking sheet with the loaves.

Bake for 45 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown.  Remove from the oven and cool on a rack.  Slice to serve.

This recipe yields 2 large loaves.

Using an electric mixer with a dough hook, combine the yeast, sugar and warm water and mix for 2 minutes to dissolve the yeast.  Add the salt and flour.  With the mixer on low, mix until the dough starts to come together.  Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl and crawls up to dough hook.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grease a mixing bowl with the oil.  Place the dough in the greased bowl and turn once.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft free place until the dough doubles in size about 1 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the dough from the bowl and invert it onto a heavily floured surface.  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions.  Pat each portion into a large rectangle, about 3/4-inch thick.  Roll up the dough, beginning with the short side and stopping after each full turn to press the edge of the roll firmly into the flat sheet of dough to seal.  Press with your fingertips.  Tuck and roll so that any seams disappear into the dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sprinkle a baking sheet evenly with 2 tablespoons of the cornmeal.  Place the loaves on the baking sheet, about 3 inches apart.  Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons cornmeal.  Cover the loaves with a cloth and let rise until double in size, about 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With a sharp knife, make diagonal slashes, about 1-inch apart, on the top of each loaf.  With a pastry brush, brush the egg wash evenly over each loaf.  Place a cup of hot water in an oven-proof container on the baking sheet with the loaves.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake for 45 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown.  Remove from the oven and cool on a rack.  Slice to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 large loaves.

  8             ounces  butter -- softened
  2             pounds  confectionersí sugar
     1/2           cup  bourbon whiskey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  grated Key Lime peel
  3              large  eggs -- separated
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  fresh Key Lime juice
  1                cup  milk
                        Powdered sugar
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- for garnishing

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter six (6 ounce) custard cups with 1 1/2 teaspoons butter, then place in a large roasting pan.

In a large bowl, cream 1 1/2 tablespoons butter, the sugar and lime peel using an electric mixer.  Add the egg yolks 1 at a time, beating well after the addition of each.  Beat in the flour, then the lime juice.  Gradually mix in milk (mixture will be thin and may look curdled).

In a large bowl beat the egg whites until stiff.  Gently fold the meringue into the yolk mixture in 3 additions.  (The mixture will be runny; do not overmix.)  Divide the pudding-cake mixture among the prepared custard cups.

Pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of dishes.  Bake until puffed and lightly firm to touch, about 30 to 40 minutes.  Sprinkle the Custard Cakes with powdered sugar and serve warm, garnished with fresh mint sprigs if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1              large  baking potato, like russets -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  6                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2           cup  grated Asiago
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2         pound  chorizo sausage -- removed from the
                        casings and crumbled
  1              small  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2                green bell pepper -- finely chopped
                        === OPTIONAL TOPPINGS ===
                        Cornmeal-Crusted Fried Oysters -- (see recipe)
                        Sauce Piquante II -- (see recipe)

Put the potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water.  Boil for 4 minutes, or until tender.  Drain and cool slightly.  In a mixing bowl whisk together the eggs, salt and pepper, and add 1/4 cup Asiago cheese.  Set aside.

In a large non-stick, broiler-proof skillet, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add sausage and cook, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes.  Add the onion, garlic and bell pepper and sautÈ until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the potatoes to the pan and continue to cook until until golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Stir in the egg mixture and mix well.  Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook until the eggs are almost set, about 10 minutes.

Preheat the broiler.  Sprinkle the frittata with the remaining Parmesan cheese.  Place the frittata under the broiler and cook until the top is set and starts to brown, about 3 minutes.  Place a large serving plate over the pan, and carefully invert to turn out the frittata to serve.

If desired, top with Cornmeal-Crusted Fried Oysters and Sauce Piquante before serving.

                          Kicked Up Scotch Eggs

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  country-style sausage, casings removed
                        and crumbled
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4                     hard-boiled eggs -- shells removed
  1                cup  bread crumbs
                        Creole seasoning -- see * Note
     1/2           cup  flour
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a large bowl combine the sausage, cayenne and salt.  Divide into 4 portions and on a sheet of waxed paper, shape each portion into a thin round.  Place 1 hard-boiled egg on the sausage round and wrap to enclose the egg, patting gently to smooth the surface.  (This step is much easier with wet hands.)

Season the bread crumbs with Creole seasoning.  Dredge the sausage-wrapped egg in the flour, then dip in the egg and roll in the bread crumbs until well coated.  Chill in the refrigerator until ready to cook.

In a deep fryer or large heavy skilled, heat 2 to 3 inches of oil to 350 degrees.  Fry the eggs, 2 at a time until golden brown and crisp, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1              ounce  Sevruga caviar -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

In a food processor, puree the lobster meat with the salt and paprika.  With the motor running, add the cream in a steady stream and blend until the mixture is smooth, then add the tarragon.

Place the pastry shells on a lightly greased baking sheet, brush the tops with the egg wash, being careful not to let the wash drip down the sides, and bake in the middle of the preheated oven until they are just beginning to color, about 7 minutes.  Transfer the shells to a rack and let them cool completely.

Pipe or spoon the lobster mousse into the puff pastry shells and bake in the oven until the mousse is set and the shells are golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.

Serve immediately topped with a dollop of caviar.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  lump crabmeat -- picked over,
                        cartilage and shell removed
  1         tablespoon  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  minced green onions

  1           teaspoon  capers
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  solid vegetable shortening
     1/3           cup  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  4             pounds  fresh or frozen peaches -- peeled, pitted
                        and sliced
  4               cups  sugar
  4        tablespoons  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  12            scoops  vanilla ice cream

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In mixing bowl, combine flour, salt and shortening.  Mix until the mixture becomes mealy.  Add water and mix well.  Form into a ball and cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

For the Filling:  Melt the butter in a large saucepan, over medium heat.  Add peaches and mix well.  In a small bowl, combine sugar, flour, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Add to the peaches and mix well.  Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook for 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.  Stir in the vanilla and set aside.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide in half.  On a floured surface, roll out half of the dough into a rectangle, 12 by 10 inches.  Using a knife, cut the dough to fit the pan, reserving the excess trim.

Place the dough in an 11- by 9- by 4-inch pan and press down to mold.  Pour half of the filling over the crust.  Cut reserved dough into nickel-size pieces.  Dot peach filling with dough.  Pour remaining filling over the dough pieces.

Roll out remaining ball of dough and place on top of the peaches, pinching the edges to seal in the juices.  Make 3 slits in the top crust and place in oven.

Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from oven and rest for 10 minutes before serving.  Spoon cobbler into individual bowls and serve with a scoop of ice cream.

This recipe yields about 12 servings.

Add enough beef stock to casserole to come up 1 inch on sides, cover with foil and bake one hour.

While brisket is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and sautÈ onions in vegetable oil, stirring occasionally, until caramelized and most liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes.  Set aside.

Remove brisket from oven after one hour and add caramelized onions and all remaining ingredients, moving meat around to combine ingredients.  Cover and continue to bake until very tender but not falling apart, another 2 to 3 hours.

Remove brisket to a carving board and slice.  Strain reserved cooking liquids and pour over sliced brisket.  Brisket may be returned to casserole dish and allowed to cool, then served the next day.  (Reheated in oven.)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Brisket is better if made a day in advance.

          Pork Tenderloins With Quince Puree And Port Wine Glaze

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  pork tenderloins - (2 to 3 loins) -- trimmed of excess
                        fat and silverskin
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  3        tablespoons  canola oil
  2        tablespoons  soy
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  apple cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar - (packed)
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  allspice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === QUINCE PUREE ===
     1/2                lemon -- juiced, plus
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon juice
  6               cups  water
  6                     quince -- peeled
  2              large  parsnips
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1              pinch  allspice
                        === PORT WINE REDUCTION ===
  4               cups  Ruby Port wine - (750-ml bottle)

Place the pork tenderloins in a large non-reactive pan.  In a mixing bowl combine all remaining ingredients except salt and pepper and pour over the pork tenderloin, turning over to coat both sides.  Cover the pork tightly and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, and up to 12 hours.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees and remove the pork tenderloins from the marinade.  Season pork with salt and pepper and sear on all sides in a hot, ovenproof skillet over high heat.  Transfer to oven and cook to an internal temperature of 150, about 12 to 15 minutes.  Let rest for 5 minutes before serving with Quince Puree and Port Wine Reduction.

For the Quince Puree:  In a small, heavy, non-reactive stockpot, add the lemon juice and 6 cups of water.  Peel, core and quarter the quince, and peel the parsnips and cut into 1/2-inch slices, then place in the lemon water to prevent discoloration.  Bring the quince, parsnips, lemon water, 2 tablespoons sugar, and cinnamon sticks to a boil over high heat, and gently boil until very tender, about 20 to 30 minutes.

Remove the fruit with a slotted spoon to the bowl of a food processor, and in batches, process with 3 tablespoons reserved cooking liquid, heavy cream, butter, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, salt, remaining 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice and allspice until very smooth.

For the Port Wine Reduction:  In a large heavy saucepan, bring the Port to a boil over high heat.  Continue cooking at a low boil until the wine thickens and reduces to a syrup measuring 1/3 cup, about 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken -- cut into pieces
  1                     celery stalk -- coarsely chopped
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  4                     parsley sprigs
  2             pieces  lemon zest
  4                     mint sprigs
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper -- or to taste
  3             quarts  water or chicken stock
     1/4           cup  raw rice
     1/2                lemon juiced - (2 tbspns)

When chicken is cool enough to handle, remove meat from bones and tear into bite-sized pieces.  Add to broth and rice and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add lemon juice, mint and salt and pepper, to taste and let cook for 2 to 3 minutes.

Serve immediately, garnished with lemon slices and sprigs of mint if desired.

  2                     bay leaves
  6              small  turnips -- peeled, quartered
  1             medium  rutabaga -- peeled, and
                        cut into eighths
  1 1/2         pounds  small new potatoes
  8             slices  French bread -- plus additional
                        for passing with marrow bones
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled
                        === CONDIMENTS ===
                        Coarse sea salt
                        Cornichons
                        Pickled onions
                        Grated horseradish
                        Dijon mustard
                        Whole grain mustard

In a large stockpot place 6 leeks, 6 carrot pieces, 6 celery pieces and onion.  Tie each piece of meat individually to hold its shape during the long cooking time, and place on top of the vegetables.  Add 2 marrowbones to the pot, tucking them between the meat, and the bouquet garni, salt and peppercorns.  Add enough water to cover and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat and simmer partially covered for 3 hours, skimming any foam which forms on the top.

Strain the broth and discard the cooking vegetables.  Return the broth and meats to the pot and add the bay leaves, and the remaining marrowbones and vegetables except the potatoes.  Bring the broth to a simmer and cook, partially covered, for 1 hour, adding the potatoes after a 1/2 hour.

Remove the meat from the broth and discard the trussing strings.  Carefully remove the vegetables from the broth, place them on a large serving platter, and moisten with some broth.  Cover and keep warm.

Strain the broth and discard any remaining vegetables.  Carve the meat and place on the serving platter with the vegetables.  Cover and keep warm.

Rub the bread with garlic and lightly toast before placing in the bottom of a shallow bowl.  Pour equal amounts of broth over the croutons and serve as a first course.  Pass the marrowbones at the table and serve with additional toast for spreading the marrow.  Serve the meat and vegetables as a main course with desired condiments.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

In a large pot, bring chicken stock, onion, carrots, celery, salt and crab boil to a boil.

Season pork roast with Creole seasoning and add to boiling liquid and vegetables.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer covered for 1 1/2 hours, or until fork-tender.  Reserve cooking liquid and vegetables separately to use in BBQ sauce.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place roast on a rack and bake for 1 hour, or until meat pulls away easily with a fork.

Set aside to cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then pull meat away from the bone with a fork and pull into bite-size pieces.  Coarsely chop meat if desired.  Mix with 2 cups of the BBQ sauce before assembling sandwiches.  Pass remaining sauce for dipping on the side.  (Makes 6 cups pulled pork, enough for 6 sandwiches)

For BBQ Sauce:  In the bowl of a food processor, combine reserved vegetables, cooking liquid, garlic and ginger and process until smooth and the consistency of ketchup.  Add remaining ingredients and process until thoroughly mixed.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Makes about 4 cups sauce)

For Cabbage Salad:  In a non-reactive mixing bowl combine all ingredients and mix well.  Let stand at room temperature at least 15 minutes before serving.  (Makes about 2 cups salad, enough for 6 sandwiches)

Spoon Salad onto warmed tortilla filled with BBQ Pulled Pork, roll up and serve with Fried Pickles And Spicy Dipping Sauce.

This recipe yields 6 sandwiches.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             ounces  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  chopped carrots
     1/2           cup  sliced mushrooms
  1                     bay leaf
  48            ounces  chicken stock
  4             ounces  unsalted butter -- melted
  4             ounces  flour
                        === RICHARDíS DUMPLINGS ===
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  minced onions
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  rubbed sage
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  4                     eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
                        === GARNISH ===
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley

Season chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat the vegetable oil, over medium heat, in roasting pan on top of stove.  Place chicken in the oil and brown on both sides.  Add the vegetables and bay leaf.  SautÈ the vegetables for 1 minute.  Add the chicken stock, cover and place in the oven.  Bake for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is tender.  Remove from the oven.

To create a sauce, remove the chicken and vegetables from the pan, leaving the stock.  In a small sauce pan, over medium heat, combine the melted butter and flour.  Mix well.  Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly for a blond roux.  Place roasting pan on stove, over a low flame and whisk in the roux.  Once the sauce has thickened, about 6 to 8 minutes, add the reserved chicken and vegetables.  Add the dumplings and simmer for 5 minutes.

Spoon into individual serving bowls.  Garnish with chopped parsley.

For the Dumplings:  Melt butter in medium saucepan over low heat.  Add minced onions.  Cook onions for approximately 2 minutes until tender.  Do not brown.  Remove from heat.  Combine all dry ingredients in a small bowl.  Mix dry ingredients with butter and onions in saucepan.

In a separate bowl, combine eggs and milk, beating slightly.  Add eggs and milk to flour mixture in saucepan.  Mix so it achieves the consistency of mashed potatoes.  To cook, drop by the teaspoon onto a rack in a steamer.  Steam until dumplings are cooked, about 4 to 6 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Whisk the mixture until fully incorporated.  Stir in the sauteed sausage mixture.  Add the bread cubes and mix well.

Pour the filling into the prepared pan.  Sprinkle the pudding with the grated cheese.  Bake for 55 minutes.  During the last 20 minutes of cooking, move the pudding down to the bottom rack and place the chicken on the middle rack.  Roast the chicken for 20 minutes.

          Salmon With Satsuma Orange Butter Sauce And Chive Oil

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  canola or vegetable oil
                        === SATSUMA ORANGE BUTTER SAUCE ===
  1                cup  satsuma juice
  2                     satsumas -- zested
     1/4           cup  julienned shallots
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2                     fresh thyme sprigs - (to 3)
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2             sticks  cold unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
                        === CHIVE OIL ===
  2            bunches  fresh chives
  1                cup  vegetable oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Season the salmon lightly on both sides with salt and pepper.  In a large skillet heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.  Add the salmon to the pan and cook for 4 minutes per side.

For the Satsuma Orange Butter Sauce:  In a saucepan combine satsuma juice, zest, shallots, bay leaf, peppercorns, garlic, thyme, wine and honey and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and allow to cook until liquid has reduced by 3/4.  Add heavy cream and continue to cook until liquid has reduced by half.  Whisk in cold butter little by little, until sauce is smooth and thick and all butter is incorporated.  Do not allow sauce to boil.  Keep warm in a bain marie until ready to serve.  (Makes about 2 cups)

For the Chive Oil:  In a small saucepan blanch the chives in boiling water for 10 seconds.  Remove from water and place in an ice bath to stop cooking.  Pat dry on paper towels.

In a blender combine the chives with the vegetable oil, and salt and pepper to taste, and mix on high speed.  Remove from the blender and pour into a small measuring cup.

Serve the chive oil at room temperature.  The oil can be made up to 1 day in advance, and should be kept covered in the refrigerator.  (Makes about 1 cup)

Serve the salmon topped with a light coating of the Satsuma Orange Butter Sauce, and a drizzle of Chive Oil.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe would also work well grilled.

For the Satsuma Orange Butter Sauce:  In a saucepan combine satsuma juice, zest, shallots, bay leaf, peppercorns, garlic, thyme, wine and honey and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and allow to cook until liquid has reduced by 3/4.  Add heavy cream and continue to cook until liquid has reduced by half.

       Sausage, Onion And Bell Pepper Brochettes With Grilled Polen

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  assorted sausages -- cut 2" slices
                        = (such as Kielbasa, Linguica,
                        Spicy Italian, and/or Bratwurst)
  2                     red bell peppers -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and cut into 1" pieces
  2                     green bell peppers -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and cut into 1" pieces
  3             medium  yellow onions -- peeled, and
                        cut into 8 wedges
                        Wooden skewers - (8" to 10" long) -- soaked in water
                        for 30 minutes
                        === KICKED UP POLENTA SQUARES ===
  4               cups  water
  1                cup  polenta
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  grated Fontina or Monterey Jack
  1         tablespoon  minced jalapeÒo

For the Polenta Squares:  In a heavy medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil over high heat.  Stir the polenta and salt into the water, lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, stirring from time to time.  Cook until the polenta is cooked through and thickens, about 20 to 25 minutes.

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cheese and jalapeÒos until smooth.  Pour the polenta into a lightly oiled, shallow baking dish.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 6 hours and up to 2 days in advance.

Run a knife around the edge of the baking dish and unmold the polenta onto a cutting board.  Cut into 3-inch by 3-inch squares and keep cool, wrapped, until ready to grill.

Preheat a gas or charcoal grill.  Thread the sausages, red and green bell pepper pieces, and onions alternately onto the skewers.  Grill the brochettes until the sausage is cooked through and the vegetables are lightly charred, turning occasionally, about 8 to 12 minutes.

Meanwhile, place the polenta squares on the grill and cook until warmed through and marked by the grill, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Remove the brochettes and grilled polenta from the grill.  With the prongs of a fork, slide the sausages and vegetables from the skewers and serve on top of the grilled polenta squares.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : First Course                    Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LOBSTER WITH TRUFFLE OIL ===
  2                     egg yolks
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1 1/4           cups  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  white truffle oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  4                     lobsters - (1 3/4 lb ea) -- cooked, cleaned,
                        and meat cut into bite-size pieces
     1/4           cup  chopped red onion
  2          teaspoons  chopped tarragon
  2          teaspoons  chopped chives
                        === GASTRIQUE ===
  2          teaspoons  tangerine zest
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  champaigne vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === PROFITEROLES ===
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  1                cup  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                cup  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  5                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  assorted chopped fresh herbs, such as
                        chives, tarragon and basil
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest

For the Lobster With Truffle Oil:  In the bowl of a food processor combine egg yolks and lemon juice and pulse to combine.  While the motor is running, add olive oil and truffle oil in a slow but steady stream until incorporated and emulsified.  Season with salt and white pepper to taste.

Transfer mayonnaise to a bowl and add lobster meat along with chopped red onion, chopped tarragon, and chopped chives.  Taste and season with salt and white pepper if necessary.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

For the Gastrique:  Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and heat over high heat until sugar dissolves and reduces to a thick syrup, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Once gastrique has reached desired stage of doneness, transfer to a cool bowl to keep from burning.  Drizzle while still hot over profiteroles.

For the Profiteroles:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  In a medium saucepan heat butter and milk over high heat until mixture comes to a boil.  Stir in salt and pepper.  Combine flour and baking powder and add to milk mixture all at once, whisking and then stirring until mixture pulls away from sides of pan and forms a ball of dough.  Remove from heat and turn into a bowl.

Using an electric mixer, add eggs, 1 at a time, making sure each egg is completely incorporated before adding the next one.  Add herbs and lemon zest and stir until incorporated.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Transfer mixture to a pastry bag with no tip and pipe out 16 generous, golf-ball sized portions of dough.  Bake for 10 minutes, until puffed up and then reduce temperature to 375 degrees and bake until golden brown, and pastries feel light to the touch and are dry inside, about 25 minutes.  Cool on a cooling rack.

Using a spoon, slice off the very top of the profiteroles and fill with the lobster and truffle oil filling.  Arrange on a platter and drizzle with the gastrique.

This recipe yields 8 servings as a first course.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TURNOVER DOUGH ===
  3               cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  lard -- cut small pieces
     1/4           cup  butter -- cut small pieces
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten with
     1/2           cup  water
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  Annatto Oil -- (see recipe)
                        = (or vegetable oil)
  1             medium  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  1                     green bell pepper -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2         pound  ground beef
     1/2         pound  ground pork
     1/4           cup  tomato sauce
     1/4           cup  Annatto Paste -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  chopped pimento-stuffed green olives
     1/2           cup  raisins
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.  Work in the lard and butter, using your fingers.  Work the egg mixture into the dough and knead until smooth.  Form into a ball, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour while making the filling.

In a large skillet heat the Annatto Oil over medium-high heat and sautÈ the onion and bell pepper until softened and caramelized around the edges, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for another 3 minutes.  Add the meat and cook until evenly browned.  Add tomato sauce, Annatto Paste, green olives, raisins, vinegar, sugar, salt, and Essence.  Lower the heat and simmer until the mixture thickens, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool on a plate before using.  Adjust seasoning to taste.

Roll the dough out on a floured surface and cut into 3-inch rounds.  Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each round, fold it in half, and press the edges together to seal.  Crimp the edges of the pastry with a fork to seal.

In a deep fryer or large skillet, heat the oil to 375 degrees.  Fry the empanaditas in batches until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels before serving.

This recipe yields about 25 empanaditas.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.  Work in the lard and butter, using your fingers.  Work the egg mixture into the dough and knead until smooth.  Form into a ball, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour while making the filling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large skillet heat the Annatto Oil over medium-high heat and sautÈ the onion and bell pepper until softened and caramelized around the edges, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for another 3 minutes.  Add the meat and cook until evenly browned.  Add tomato sauce, Annatto Paste, green olives, raisins, vinegar, sugar, salt, and Essence.  Lower the heat and simmer until the mixture thickens, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool on a plate before using.  Adjust seasoning to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll the dough out on a floured surface and cut into 3-inch rounds.  Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each round, fold it in half, and press the edges together to seal.  Crimp the edges of the pastry with a fork to seal.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a deep fryer or large skillet, heat the oil to 375 degrees.  Fry the empanaditas in batches until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels before serving.

                        Assorted fresh greens
  12            ounces  beef tenderloin or sirloin

                    Stuffed Grape Leaves - {Dolmades}

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4            cup  olive oil -- divided
  2             medium  yellow onions -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  pine nuts
  1                cup  long-grain rice
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
  1         tablespoon  minced mint
  2                     lemons -- juiced
  1                jar  grape leaves - (8 oz)
                        = (or 36 medium-sized fresh leaves)
                        Kicked-Up Tzatiziki Sauce -- (see recipe)

In a large sautÈ pan over medium-high heat, heat 1/4-cup of the olive oil.  Add the onions and sautÈ until translucent, about 6 minutes.  Add the garlic and pine nuts and sautÈ for 2 minutes.  Transfer to a large mixing bowl and allow to cool slightly.  Add the rice, salt, raisins, mint and juice of 1 lemon to the bowl with the onion mixture and mix well.  Set aside.

Bring a medium pot of water to a simmer.  Remove the grape leaves from the jar and drop them in batches of 4 or 5 into the hot water.  Quickly remove them from the water and spread flat on a towel-lined work surface.  Cut the stem from each grape leaf, as needed.  (NOTE: Fresh grape leaves also need to be blanched for 1/2 minute.)

To assemble the dolmades, place 1 grape leaf on the work surface, dull side (or underside) of the leaf up.  Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of rice filling near the stem end of the leaf.  Fold the stem (bottom) end up over the filling, fold the sides toward the filling in the center, then roll up the leaf into a small cylindrical package, being careful not to fold too tightly, as the rice will expand during cooking.

Place the dolmades in a large Dutch oven or wide sautÈ pan, seam-side down.  Combine the remaining cup of olive oil and juice of 1 lemon, and pour over the dolmades.  Cover with a heavy plate or baking dish and add water to cover to the level of the plate.  Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer for 1 hour, or until rice is tender.

Serve at room temperature, with Kicked Up Tzatziki as a dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 36 dolmades.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  sour orange juice
                        = (or 1 cup sweet orange juice
                        and 1 cup lime juice)
  10                    garlic cloves -- peeled, crushed
  1                     bay leaf
  1         tablespoon  paprika
                        Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
  1                     boneless pork loin - (6 to 7 lbs) -- cut lengthwise
                        into 2 pieces, butterflied open lengthwise
     1/2         pound  country ham -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  bacon -- fried crisp, and
                        broken into pieces
  3                     hard-boiled eggs -- peeled, sliced
  1                cup  pitted prunes
  1                cup  grated carrots
     1/2           cup  chopped bell pepper
  2               cups  brown sugar
  1             bottle  Malta - (7 oz)
                        = (or other sweet dark malt beer)

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a large glass baking pan or bowl, combine the juice, garlic, bay leaf, paprika and about 2 teaspoons Essence.  Place both pork pieces in the baking pan.  Pour the marinade over the meat, cover and refrigerate.  Allow the meat to marinate at least 4 hours, turning several times.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Remove the meat from the marinade.  In a large rectangular baking pan, lay one of the pork loin pieces flat.  Sprinkle the meat with Essence, then spread the ham across the pork, followed by the bacon, eggs, prunes, carrots and bell pepper.  Place the remaining pork loin on top of the layered meat, then roll up the two pieces into a roulade, firmly securing with butcherís twine or wooden skewers.

In a small bowl combine the sugar with the Malta and pour over the rolled pork.  Bake until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 170 degrees, about 1 hour, basting with the Malta sauce.

Pour the reserved marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes.  Set aside.

Remove the roast from the oven and allow to cool before serving with the reduced sour orange juice sauce.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  veal breast
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             recipe  Veal Forcemeat -- (see recipe)
  4                     very thin slices pancetta
                        Butcherís twine
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1              pound  fettuccine -- cooked until
                        tender and cooled
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  4             ounces  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1             recipe  Spicy Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
  3        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Bone and butterfly the veal breast.  (Remove rib bones, breast bone, and cartilage.)  Place the meat, skin-side down, and lightly pound out the meat.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spread the forcemeat, evenly over the meat.  Lay the slices of pancetta over the forcemeat.

Roll the veal breast and tie it in a cylinder, with the butcherís twine.  Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Roast for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees, and continue roasting.  Roast to medium or until the internal temperature reaches 140 degrees, about 45 to 50 minutes.

In a large sautÈ pan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the pasta.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ for 1 minute.  Add the cream and cheese, and bring to a simmer.  Cook until the liquid thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 6 minutes.

Remove the roast and allow to sit for 10 minutes before slicing.  Remove the butcherís twine and place on a carving board.  Slice the veal into 1/2-inch pieces.

Mound the pasta in the center of each serving plate.  Spoon the Spicy Tomato Sauce over the pasta.  Lay several slices of the veal over the sauce.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  8                     sweetbread medallions, peeled, poached,
                        and pressed overnight, (see below)
     1/2           cup  flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  capers
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley

In a small mixing bowl combine flour with half of the salt and pepper and season sweetbreads with remaining salt and pepper.  Lightly dredge sweetbreads in flour and set aside.

In a large sautÈ pan over medium high heat olive oil and sautÈ sweetbreads for 2 minutes, or until golden brown.  Turn and continue to cook, adding butter after 1 minute.  Cook for 1 minute longer and place sweetbreads on an absorbent cloth or paper towels to drain.  Add lemon juice, capers and parsley and cook for 30 seconds.  Place sweetbreads on plate or serving platter, ladle sauce over sweetbreads and serve immediately.

  4                     tournedos of beef - (3 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste

                        === BEARNAISE SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallots
  1                     lemon -- juiced
     1/4           cup  distilled white vinegar
  2                     tarragon stems - (to 3)
  1                     egg yolk
  1           teaspoon  water
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- melted
  2        tablespoons  chopped tarragon
     1/4     teaspoons  salt

In a metal bowl, combine egg yolk, water and reduction over a pot of simmering water.  Whisk well until egg mixture begins to form ribbons when whisk is lifted out of mixture.  While continuing to whisk, drizzle in melted butter little by little until completely incorporated and sauce is thick.  Add chopped tarragon, taste and season with salt and white pepper.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2         pound  all-purpose potato -- cut 1/8" slices
                        = (like long whites, or waxy potatoes,

  1 1/4           cups  half-and-half

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Butter a small glass loaf pan with 1 teaspoon butter.  Place a layer of potatoes along the bottom of the pan and dot with small pieces of butter.  Top with freshly ground black pepper, salt, a sprinkling of Parmesan and light drizzle of truffle oil.  Continue layering the potatoes, topping with layers of butter, pepper, salt, cheese and oil, finishing with a light coating of Parmesan on top.  Pour the half-and-half into the potato dish, bringing it up to the top layer, but not submerging the potatoes.

Bake the potato casserole until the top is golden brown and bubbly, and the half-and-half is absorbed by the potatoes, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes.

Let potatoes cool until firm, about 30 minutes, then slice into squares with a very sharp knife.  Warm the potato squares as necessary before serving.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

                 Twice Fried Plantain Slices - {Tostones}

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  green or slightly yellow plantains
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Emeril's Essence -- see * Note

In a deep fryer or large skillet, heat the oil over moderate heat to 350 degrees.

With a sharp knife, cut the ends from each plantain and score the skins lengthwise several times to peel away the skin.  Cut the plantains into 1 1/2-inch thick slices.  In batches, fry the plantain pieces until just golden, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer with tongs to paper towels to drain.

Place a plantain slice on a flat work surface, and press down on it firmly with the back of a heavy plate or skillet until flattened to about 1/4-inch thick.  Repeat with the remaining slices.

Reheat the oil and fry the tostones to a deeper color and warmed through, about 1 minute.  Drain on paper towels and season with salt and Essence.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 20 to 24, or 4 to 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         ounces  good-quality semi-sweet chocolate -- finely chopped
     1/2         ounce  unsweetened chocolate -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  unsalted better -- plus
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter -- softened
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1              large  egg
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2    tablespoon  unsweetened cocoa powder
                        Whipped cream -- for garnish
                        Cocoa powder -- for garnish

Lightly butter 2 ramekins with 1 teaspoon of butter and set aside.

In the top of a double boiler place semisweet and unsweetened chocolate and stir occasionally until melted.  Remove from heat and stir in 3 tablespoons butter and sugar until smooth.  Add eggs, flour, baking powder and cocoa.  With an electric mixer, beat at medium-high speed until pale and very thick, about 5 minutes.  Place mixture in prepared ramekins, filling about half-full.  Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 3 hours.

When ready to serve, preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place ramekins on the middle shelf in the oven and bake until edges are set but centers are still shiny, about 10 or 11 minutes.  Invert pudding cakes onto plates and serve immediately, garnished with whipped cream or ice cream, and dust with cocoa powder.  (Desserts may also be served directly from ramekins.)

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Categories    : Mushrooms

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PORCINI FLAN ===
  2             ounces  dried porcini mushrooms
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped thyme
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  4                     egg yolks
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        === WILD MUSHROOM CONFIT ===
  1 1/2         pounds  assorted wild mushrooms, such as oyster,
                        shiitakes, chanterelles, and creminis
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  light, non-flavored oil - (to 4 cups)
                        = (such as safflower oil)
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     fresh rosemary sprig
  2                     fresh thyme sprigs
  3                     garlic cloves
                        === TRUFFLE EMULSION ===
  1                     portobello mushroom -- stem removed
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  egg
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  minced shallots
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  white truffle oil
                        === CRISPY PHYLLO THREADS ===
  4                     sheets frozen phyllo
  4        tablespoons  clarified unsalted butter -- melted

Lightly butter 6 (4-ounce) ramekins and set aside.  Under cold running water, quickly rinse porcinis to rid of any sand or dirt.

In a small saucepan place porcinis with 3/4 cup water and bring to a boil.  Lower heat to a simmer and cook until porcinis are very soft and liquid has reduced to 1/2 cup.  Remove from heat, and set aside to cool.  When cooled, remove porcinis from liquid and set aside.  Strain liquid through a fine meshed sieve and reserve.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a small sautÈ pan melt butter and sautÈ shallots until softened, about 3 minutes.  Add garlic and thyme and cook another minute.  Transfer to the bowl of a food processor and add reserved mushroom liquid and porcinis and process until smooth.  Transfer to a bowl and whisk in the heavy cream, egg yolks, nutmeg, cheese and salt and pepper, to taste.

Divide mixture between ramekins and place the ramekins in a baking pan.  Add enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins and bake flans until set, about 45 to 50 minutes.

To serve, gently loosen flans with a knife and invert onto serving plates with Wild Mushroom Confit, a generous dollop of the Truffle Emulsion and Crispy Phyllo Threads.

For the Wild Mushroom Confit:  In a large colander combine mushrooms and sprinkle with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Set aside for 1 hour, allowing mushrooms to release as much liquid as possible (do not reserve liquid), stirring occasionally.

Preheat oven to 275 degrees.  In a baking dish combine mushrooms with remaining ingredients, making certain that mushrooms are completely covered with oil.  Cover with foil and bake for 1 1/2 hours, until mushrooms are very tender.  Transfer mushrooms to a strainer or colander, remove bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme sprigs, and allow to drain.  (Oil may be reserved and used for another purpose.)  Serve mushrooms either warm or at room temperature.

For the Truffle Emulsion:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Rub the mushroom with the olive oil then season lightly with salt and pepper.  Place the mushroom gill-side down on a small baking pan and roast for 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool slightly.

Chop the mushroom into small dice.  In the bowl of a blender, blend the egg and lemon juice until frothy.  Add the garlic and shallots, and process briefly, then add the mushrooms and puree until smooth.  When the mixture is smooth, add the vegetable and truffle oils in a slow stream with the blender running.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper, and reserve until ready to serve.  (Makes 1 generous cup)

For the Crispy Phyllo Threads:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Thaw phyllo in refrigerator, then transfer to a dry work space.  Brush each sheet lightly with clarified butter, and layer one on top of the other.  Roll sheets up as tightly as possible and, with a very sharp chefís knife, slice phyllo into very thin threads.  Toss threads around in your fingers to create jumbled threads on a baking sheet, and spread out evenly.  Bake for 10 minutes, until golden brown and crispy.  Allow to cool.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  2                     firm but ripe Bosc or Bartlett pears -- peeled, halved,

     1/2           cup  Marsala or other sweet wine

In a medium saucepan, bring the water, honey, seeds from the vanilla bean and vanilla bean to a boil until the honey dissolves.  Add the pear halves, cover, reduce the heat and simmer until the pears are tender when pierced with a sharp knife, about 12 to 15 minutes.

Transfer the pears with a slotted spoon to a plate, allow to cool, then carefully slice into fans on individual dessert plates.

In the top of a double boiler or in a stainless steel bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar over simmering water.  When the mixture begins to thicken and become frothy, gradually add the wine and whisk constantly until soft peaks begin to form, about 5 to 8 minutes.

Remove the zabaglione from the heat and serve immediately over the poached pear slices.
