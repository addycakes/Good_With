  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  cod fillets
  2                     cucumbers -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut on bias into thin strips
  1                cup  Orzo (rice-shaped pasta)
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
  8                     lettuce leaves
  4                     lemon wedges
     1/2           cup  blue cheese salad dressing
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
     1/4      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  4          teaspoons  diced red bell pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Mix the blue cheese salad dressing with the lemon zest and lemon juice; hold aside. 
Broil or saute the cod fillets, turning 1 time until cooked through.  Fish should be opaque but barely translucent in the center.  Cooking time will vary depending on cooking method and thickness of fish, but should take between 4 to 8 minutes.  Set aside to cool. 
Bring 4 cups of salted water to a boil, add the orzo and cook to al dente (about 8 to 10 minutes).  Cool by running under cold water.  Drain well and set aside. 
Flake the cooled cod fillets.  Place cod flakes, cucumber slices and orzo in a mixing bowl.  Add the dressing mixture and green onion slices; mix well.  Taste, adding salt and pepper as necessary. 
Place 2 lettuce leaves each on 4 chilled plates.  Divide the salad among the 4 plates.  Garnish with 1 teaspoon of red bell pepper and 1 lemon wedge; serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  Pacific albacore steaks
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme - (rounded)
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  chopped green onion
     1/4           cup  cubed smoked ham or smoked sausage
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- drained, chopped
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped green pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  1 1/2    tablespoons  lemon juice

Rinse albacore with cold water; pat dry with paper towels.  Cut albacore into 1-inch cubes. 
In large non-stick skillet, melt butter.  Add garlic and onion; saute until tender but not browned.  Stir in tomatoes, wine, lemon juice, thyme and cayenne.  Mix well. 
Add albacore, green pepper and ham.  Bring to simmer.  Cover and braise 4 to 5 minutes.  Do not overcook!  Albacore should be pink in center when removed from heat. 
Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Sprinkle with parsley.  Serve over cooked rice. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Jambalaya, the classic Cajun one-dish meal, is a spicy combination of rice and tomatoes flavored with meat, poultry or seafood.  According to the Acadian Dictionary, the word "Jambalaya" comes from the French word "jambon" (meaning ham) and the African "ya" (meaning rice).  Mild and firm, Pacific albacore is an especially good choice for jambalaya, which can be served with a tossed salad and crusty French bread.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3         pounds  skinless Pacific albacore
                        loin cuts, 3/4" thick
  1                cup  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  ground toasted almonds
     1/2           cup  fresh toasted bread crumbs
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
  1              Whole  berry cranberry sauce

Rinse albacore with cold water; pat dry with paper towels.  Soak albacore in buttermilk for 10 to 15 minutes. 
Mix together almonds, bread crumbs and orange peel.  Drain buttermilk from albacore.  Dredge albacore in coating mixture.  Place on greased baking sheet. 
Bake at 425 degrees for 6 to 8 minutes.  Do not overcook!  Albacore should be pink in center when removed from heat. 
Serve with cranberry sauce. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  In this recipe, albacore is coated with a mixture of ground, toasted almonds and bread crumbs which, when baked, creates a crunchy coating without the added oil of frying.  This crunchy, slightly sweet coating enhances the delicate flavor of albacore, and cranberry sauce on the side adds a complimentary zing!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  wild rice
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds
     1/2           cup  bran flakes
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- divided
  4                     sole fillets - (3 to 4 oz ea)
                        or other mild flaky white fish
  2                     egg whites -- beaten lightly
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  4               cups  spinach leaves - (lightly packed)
  2                     Red Delicious apples -- cut thin wedges
  1                     carrot -- shredded

Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat baking sheet with vegetable oil cooking spray. 
Bring rice and water to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer about 40 minutes until rice is tender and water absorbed. 
Meanwhile, in resealable plastic bag, crush almonds and bran into coarse crumbs.  In shallow bowl, mix flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Evenly coat each fillet with flour mixture.  Dip into egg, then coat with almond mixture. 
Lay each fillet on baking sheet and bake 10 to 12 minutes until cooked through (depending on thickness of fish). 
Meanwhile, make vinaigrette.  In bowl, whisk vinegar, oil and remaining salt and pepper. 
In nonstick skillet over medium heat, combine half the spinach, apples, carrot and rice with 1 tablespoon of vinaigrette.  Cook and toss until spinach is wilted slightly and salad is no more than just warm.  Remove to bowl and repeat with remaining salad ingredients.  Divide salad and sole among 4 plates. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This healthy recipe was created by one of the best chefs in the country and tastes as good as it looks.  High in fiber and ideal for those watching their cholesterol, it's great for lunch or a light supper.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  Pacific albacore loin cuts or steaks - -- (to 1 1/2 lbs)
  1 1/2            cup  low-fat plain yogurt
  1         tablespoon  orange marmalade
  2          teaspoons  lime juice
  1 1/2       teaspoon  curry powder
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
     1/8      teaspoon  salt - (scant)
                        Assorted fresh fruit

Rinse albacore with cold water; pat dry with paper towels.  Set aside. 
Blend together yogurt, marmalade, 2 teaspoons lime juice and curry powder.  Chill for 15 to 20 minutes. 
Combine oil, 2 tablespoons lime juice and salt.  Baste albacore with oil mixture.  Place on well-greased grate 5 to 6 inches from hot briquettes.  Cook 8 minutes per inch of fish, measured at thickest point, turning once and basting frequently.  Do not overcook!  Albacore should be pink in center when removed from heat. 
Albacore may be broiled on a well-greased broiler pan 5 to 6 inches from source of heat.  Follow grilling times and directions. 
Serve with curry-yogurt sauce.  Garnish with assorted fresh fruit such as sliced strawberries, melon and grapes. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The low-fat yogurt sauce in this recipe is flavored with orange marmalade and curry powder -- a taste sensation without heavy cream or unnecessary fats!  Caribbean-Style Albacore is especially nice with the combined flavors of the albacore, fruit and a little dipping sauce in each bite!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  halibut -- thawed if necessary,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
  8                     skewers
  1         tablespoon  chili power
  4        tablespoons  fat free Italian salad dressing
  2                     garlic cloves -- lightly crushed
                        === SALSA ===
     1/2                avocado -- medium diced
  1              large  tomato -- medium diced
     1/2                red onion -- medium diced
  1                     jalepeÒo pepper -- seeded, small diced
                        Juice of 1 to 2 limes
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place 1 skewer on each of eight serving plates; remove the halibut cubes from the skewer.  Divide the salsa among the eight plates and serve. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  hoki fillet
                        (or substitute orange roughy)
  4             ounces  long-shredded coconut
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  orange marmalade
     1/4           cup  honey
  2        tablespoons  grated horseradish -- squeezed dry
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice -- or to taste
  1              slice  fresh ginger - (abt 1") -- shredded
                        === TEMPURA BATTER ===
  1                     egg -- combined with
                        Milk -- to make 2/3 cup
  1                cup  flour
  1              pinch  paprika
  1                     ice cube

Assemble the dipping sauce ahead of time, and don't be afraid to vary the ingredients to taste.  Try raspberry jam instead of orange marmalade.  Wing it! 
For the tempura batter, lightly beat the egg with chopsticks inside a cup measure.  Pour milk on top of egg to make 2/3 cup (milk plus egg).  Add flour and stir well till smooth.  Add ice cube and stir in to make the batter crisper. 
Dip foods to be fried in this batter.  It should be thin and drippy.  The paprika is to give the batter a warmer color liked by Westerners.  May be omitted. 
Cut the fish into fingers about 1/2-inch by 3 inches.  Using tongs, dip them into the tempura batter, and then drag them through the coconut, which will stick.  Deep fry.  Do some tempura veggies to go along. 
Do you like the old soy sauce, vinegar, red oil mix for dim sum?  No one says you can't have that too. 
By the way, slivered almonds work well instead of coconut.  These also make nice passing hors d'oeuvres. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Get out your Frybaby for this one.  Some thin slices of sweet potato dipped in the tempura batter go well with this.  Can you cut gaufrettes of sweet potato?  Rings of small Italian eggplant are good too.  Catfish or tilapia work equally well, and no one will cry if you sneak in a few shrimp or crab sticks (Kani).  Don't fry too much at a time.

<DirS>
<DirT>
Assemble the dipping sauce ahead of time, and don&apos;t be afraid to vary the ingredients to taste.  Try raspberry jam instead of orange marmalade.  Wing it! 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the tempura batter, lightly beat the egg with chopsticks inside a cup measure.  Pour milk on top of egg to make 2/3 cup (milk plus egg).  Add flour and stir well till smooth.  Add ice cube and stir in to make the batter crisper. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dip foods to be fried in this batter.  It should be thin and drippy.  The paprika is to give the batter a warmer color liked by Westerners.  May be omitted. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut the fish into fingers about 1/2-inch by 3 inches.  Using tongs, dip them into the tempura batter, and then drag them through the coconut, which will stick.  Deep fry.  Do some tempura veggies to go along. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Do you like the old soy sauce, vinegar, red oil mix for dim sum?  No one says you can&apos;t have that too. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
By the way, slivered almonds work well instead of coconut.  These also make nice passing hors d&apos;oeuvres. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Get out your Frybaby for this one.  Some thin slices of sweet potato dipped in the tempura batter go well with this.  Can you cut gaufrettes of sweet potato?  Rings of small Italian eggplant are good too.  Catfish or tilapia work equally well, and no one will cry if you sneak in a few shrimp or crab sticks (Kani).  Don&apos;t fry too much at a time.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  skinless Pacific albacore
                        loin cuts or steaks, 3/4" thick
  4                     bacon slices
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped onion
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped cabbage
  1           teaspoon  caraway seeds
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/3           cup  coarsely-grated carrots -- plus
  2        tablespoons  grated carrots
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  low-fat plain yogurt
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground balck pepper -- to taste

Rinse albacore with cold water; pat dry with paper towels. 
In nonstick skillet, saute bacon until crisp.  Drain, reserving 1 tablespoon bacon fat.  Crumble bacon; set aside. 
In skillet with reserved bacon fat, saute onion, cabbage and caraway seeds until limp but not browned.  Remove from heat.  Mix in 1/3 cup carrots, bacon, sour cream, and yogurt. 
Arrange albacore in single layer in well-greased baking dish.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Sprinkle with lemon juice and lemon peel.  Top with cabbage mixture spread to cover evenly. 
Cover with foil and bake at 425 degrees for 13 minutes.  Do not overcook!  Albacore should be pink in center when removed from heat.  Garnish with 2 tablespoons grated carrots. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Add Old World flavor to Pacific albacore!  A warming dish just right for fall can be simply prepared by baking albacore with a tangy mixture of seasonal vegetables.  In this recipe, cabbage and onions are sauteed with bacon, then combined with carrots and a yogurt-sour cream mixture for spreading over albacore before baking.  The entire dinner can be conveniently cooked in the same dish.  Serve this German-Style Albacore with crusty sourdough, hearty pumpernickel or freshly-baked cornbread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  Pacific albacore loin cuts or steaks
                        Water -- to cover
                        Lemon slices -- to taste
                        Onion slices -- to taste
                        Bay leaf -- to taste
                        Black peppercorns -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  salt-reduced soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic - (to 1 1/2 tspns)
     1/8      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/8      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/4           cup  feta cheese
                        Assorted fresh vegetable and greens

Rinse albacore with cold water; pat dry with paper towels.  Place albacore in a large skillet in just enough water to cover.  Season water with lemon and onion slices, bay leaf and black peppercorns to taste.  Cover and simmer.  Cook 8 minutes per inch of fish measured at its thickest point.  Do not overcook!  Albacore should be pink in center when removed from heat.  Drain, cool and break into large chunks. 
While albacore is cooling, make dressing by combining olive oil, lime juice, wine vinegar, soy sauce, mustard, garlic, oregano and basil.  Gently toss albacore with dressing. 
Serve on bed of fresh chopped lettuce and spinach.  Garnish with tomato wedges, onions, olives, artichoke hearts and cucumber slices.  Sprinkle with feta. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This salad, also called "salata horiatiki," is a refreshing change for a lunch or light dinner.  Traditional Greek ingredients such as garlic, olive oil, basil and oregano are further enhanced with a little lime juice and Dijon mustard, and don't forget the feta cheese!

  1                cup  sliced mushrooms
     1/4           cup  chopped green onion
  1                     garlic clove -- minced

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  albacore loin cuts - (to 1 1/2 lbs)
  1                can  pineapple chunks - (20 oz)
  3        tablespoons  salt-reduced soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  sherry
  1         tablespoon  grated ginger root
                        Skewers
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dry mustard
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              large  green peppers - (to 2) -- cut large pieces

Rinse albacore loin cuts with cold water; pat dry with paper towels.  Set aside. 
Drain pineapple, reserving 3 tablespoons of juice; set pineapple chunks aside. 
Make marinade by combining reserved juice, soy sauce, sherry, ginger, mustard, garlic, brown sugar, and oil.  Stir well and pour over albacore.  Cover and marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour, turning once. 
Using bamboo or metal skewers, make kabobs by alternating pineapple and green pepper; set aside. 
Drain albacore, reserving marinade.  Place on well-greased grate 4 to 5 inches from hot coals and cook 4 to 5 minutes.  Baste with marinade and turn.  Cook an additional 4 to 5 minutes, or until albacore flakes when tested with a fork. 
Albacore may be broiled on a well-greased broiler pan 4 to 6 inches from source of heat.  Follow grilling times and directions. 
Baste fruit and vegetable kabobs and place on grill.  Cook 15 to 30 seconds on each side or until just browned. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Some teriyaki recipes can be a bit overpowering, yet this one isn't too salty or sweet -- a balanced oriental accent for the mildly flavored Pacific albacore!

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  skinless Pacific albacore
                        loin cuts or steaks, 3/4" thick
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
  4          teaspoons  chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground balck pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-grated lemon peel

Rinse albacore with cold water; pat dry with paper towels. 
In small saucepan, melt butter with oil.  Add basil, parsley, mustard, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste.  Stir. 
Place albacore on greased broiler pan.  Baste with marinade.  Broil 4 to 5 inches from source of heat for 3 minutes.  Turn and baste.  Broil an additional 3 minutes, or until albacore is medium-rare, leaving a pink core in center.  Do not overcook! 
Transfer to serving platter and sprinkle with lemon peel. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Simple, quick yet elegant, this recipe brings out the delicate flavor of Pacific Albacore.  We suggest serving herb-broiled albacore with steamed new red potatoes and brussel sprouts lightly sprinkled with olive oil, basil and just a hint of garlic.  Don't forget the white wine and crusty French bread for a complete, satisfying summer dinner!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Macruronus Novaezelandiae
                        Also known as blue hake, blue grenadier,
                        New Zealand whiting (wrongly),
                        and whiptail

Hoki is a widespread fish found in most New Zealand waters and also occurs off southern Australia.  Its color is bluish-green above, silvery on the sides and belly.  The average size is 2 to 3 feet in length, although they can reach a bit over 4 feet in length.  It is the largest commercial fishery in the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone. 
Hoki is a middle depth fish found between 975 feet to 2,000 feet, although they can extend down to almost 3,000 feet. 
Hoki has a delicate, bright white, moist flesh, with few bones.  The flesh flakes easily and is excellent for forming into a fish block.  It is well suited to further processing into a wide range of consumer presentations. 
Hoki is most suited to frying or baking as it's flesh is very low in oils.  However it can be cooked equally well by grilling or barbequing.  If frying Hoki, a light batter or crumb is best. 
When filleting your Hoki, remember to remove the fat line which runs down the center of the fillet. 
Hoki is an excellent fish to make into fish cakes.  In fact you eat it every time you order a Fillet 'o' Fish at McDonalds. 
BUY extra, and cook extra for quick meals the next two days.  One pound of Hoki feeds 2 to 4 depending on appetite and trimmings. 
OVEN "FRY" this low-fat fish (see the "Oven Fried Hoki for Four" recipe) with vegetables, such as zucchini.  Dip and bread vegetables, same as fish.  Serve spread over the fish, as over a pizza. 
SEASON between dipping fish and breading with oregano or dill, cayenne pepper or a few drops of pepper sauce. 
GRILL Hoki wrapped in foil with shredded carrots, snow peas, and drizzle fish with soy sauce.  Or try sliced leeks and drizzling white wine on hoki. 
To compliment a Hoki dish, try serving it with either a Sauvignon blanc or a Rhine riesling.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  skinless New Zealand hoki fillets
  1              pound  sweet potato -- peeled, cooked
                        Salt -- to taste
  2                     egg yolks
  6                     spring onions -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped coriander
  1                     green chilli -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        seasoned flour
  2                     egg whites -- lightly beaten with
  1              whole  egg
  2               cups  dry breadcrumbs
  1         tablespoon  Cajun spices - (to 2 tbspns) -- to taste
                        Oil -- for frying

Microwave the hoki on full power for 4 minutes or foil bake in a moderately-hot oven 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Cool, drain and flake.  Mash the sweet potato and add hoki, egg yolks, onions, coriander and chilli.  Mix well and season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Form roughly into bite-size cakes -- the mixture is quite soft and holds together well.  Dip first in seasoned flour, then in egg mix and finally into the breadcrumbs mixed with Cajun spices.  Fry in batches in hot oil until crisp and golden brown.  Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm.  Serve with a spicy Mexican tomato salsa.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3         pounds  skinless Pacific albacore
                        loin cuts or steaks
  1                can  chicken broth - (10 3/4 oz) -- preferably
                        low-sodium or salt-free style
  1                cup  diced new potatoes
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
     1/2           cup  chopped carrots
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  frozen corn kernels
     1/2           cup  low-fat milk
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley

Rinse albacore with cold water; pat dry with paper towels.  Cube fish; set aside. 
In medium saucepan, mix broth with 1 can of water.  Place albacore in steamer tray over broth and steam 2 to 3 minutes.  Do not overcook!  Albacore should be pink in center when removed from heat.  Set albacore aside. 
Strain broth into large saucepan.  Add potatoes and simmer until tender.  Remove cooked potatoes from broth, reserving liquid. 
Puree cooked potatoes with 1/4 cup broth.  Return with remaining broth to pot.  Add thyme, basil, and vegetables.  Simmer until vegetables are almost tender. 
Before serving, stir in albacore and milk and heat to serving temperature without boiling.  Sprinkle with parsley just before serving. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Traditionally, chowder is a thick, hearty soup generally made with seafood, salt pork, vegetables and milk.  But for all of their warmth and flavor, most chowders are quite high in fat and calories.  For a low-calorie change, try this Light Albacore Chowder, an adaptation of the New England classic.  While retaining all of the flavor of a traditional chowder, this recipe has only 397 calories and 12 grams of fat per serving -- and it's a meal in itself!

                       Maple-Mustard Glazed Halibut

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  halibut filet or steak -- cut 2 oz medallions
     1/4           cup  Dijon or Creole mustard
     1/3           cup  dark amber maple syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flake
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  canola oil
  1           teaspoon  minced sage
  1           teaspoon  minced oregano

Place glaze ingredients in a non-reactive bowl and whisk to combine.  Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.  Dip the halibut medallions in the glaze, turning to coat thoroughly. 
Add oil to skillet, then fish.  Turn every minute or so until all sides take on a golden tint, brushing on extra glaze if desired.  The halibut is done when the edges just start to flake, about 4 minutes total. 
Serve with sautÈed spinach tossed with toasted sesame seeds. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  The largest of the flatfish, the halibut has an almost crab-like sweetness and a lean, firm texture that makes it suitable for almost any cooking method.  Look for the freshest halibut in spring and summer.

Add oil to skillet, then fish.  Turn every minute or so until all sides take on a golden tint, brushing on extra glaze if desired.  The halibut is done when the edges just start to flake, about 4 minutes total.

Comments:  The largest of the flatfish, the halibut has an almost crab-like sweetness and a lean, firm texture that makes it suitable for almost any cooking method.  Look for the freshest halibut in spring and summer.

                          Sand Dabs Grenobloise

Recipe By     :Steve K. Holzinger
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  sand dabs or small flounder
     1/2           cup  flour
  1           teaspoon  sugar -- see * Note
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  light olive oil light -- for frying
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                     lemon -- peeled, cubed
  1         tablespoon  capers
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  1                     lemon -- quartered
  2              small  parsley bunches

* Note:  Sugar in seasoned flour?  Am I nuts?  Well, yes I am, but it is a trick I learned in China.  The sugar caramelizes when the fish is cooking, and the crust is darker and crisper.  The amount given is approximate, as I was shown, "See, we toss a little sugar in the flour to make the fish crisp and brown."  That's the way I do it, and you will have to learn like I did, a little at a time.  Start with only a little, and as you gain experience, you can get braver, just like me. 
Dredge the fish in the seasoned flour. 
Heat the oil in a pan, and fry the fish on each side, turning only once.  You want the oil hot but not smoking.  Olive oil becomes fragrant when it wants you to fry.  You will want a spatula and a fork for this.  Remove the cooked fish to a plate garnished with parsley bunch and lemon wedges. 
Lower the heat, and dump any excess oil, add butter and when it foams and is just starting to brown, add the diced lemon and its juice, and the drained capers.  It will seethe and froth, and the butter will brown.  Add a dash of the caper vinegar, chopped parsley, and spoon it over the fish. 
This recipe yields 1 serving. 
Comments:  Sand Dabs are a species of small flounder abundant on Long Island in the summer.  They are not very meaty, but are very sweet.  If they are small, you will need 2 per person.  This also works well with baby bluefish, called snappers, or blue snappers, and butterfish.  These are all inexpensive summertime fish.  Kids love to catch them on a pole.  Come to think of it, little sunnies (sunfish) can be prepared this way.  It is basically a way to cook any small fish that it doesn't pay to filet.  Freshness is part of the recipe's appeal.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter -- melted
  4                     halibut steaks - (6 oz ea) -- thawed if necessary

Mix together all dry-seasoning ingredients until well combined. 
Place halibut steaks on a non-stick or spray-coated baking sheet or broiler pan.  Brush butter onto top surface of halibut.  Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon seasoning mixture over the surface of each halibut steak. 
Broil 10 minutes per inch of thickness, measured at thickest part, or until fish flakes when tested with a fork.  Store remaining seasoning mixture in airtight container for future use. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This seasoning mixture works well on pollock and cod fillets, too!  Just brush fillets with butter before sprinkling with spices and broil. 
Side Dishes include: 
Asparagus:  Steam or boil 12 ounces fresh asparagus until tender, about 5 minutes.  Pour 1 tablespoon melted butter over asparagus and serve. 
Carrots:  Clean and shred 3 medium carrots.  Microwave on High setting 90 seconds.  Season with salt and pepper, toss to blend.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  albacore tuna (loin cuts or steaks)
     1/4           cup  dry sherry
  3 1/2    tablespoons  lime juice
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  4          teaspoons  oil
  1 1/4      teaspoons  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lime rind

Rinse albacore with cold water; pat dry with paper towels.  Cut albacore into 1 1/2-inch cubes; set aside. 
Combine remaining ingredients except lime rind.  Pour over albacore and marinate in refrigerator for a minimum of 30 minutes, turning once to recoat albacore. 
Using metal or bamboo skewers, make kebabs dividing albacore into 4 equal servings reserving marinade. 
Place kebabs on well-greased grate 5 to 6 inches from hot briquettes.  Cook 3 to 4 minutes, turning once.  Baste frequently with reserved marinade.  Do not overcook!  Albacore should be pink in center when removed from heat. 
Sprinkle with lime rind just before serving. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This recipe gives albacore a distinctive Tex-Mex flavor from a marinade containing a minimal amount of oil; while a little oil is needed to prevent sticking on the grill, these kebabs shatter any misconceptions that Tex-Mex cookery has to be fattening!  Serve with rice, tortillas, low- or no-fat black beans and a ration of your favorite white cheese.

Cover and simmer.  Cook 8 minutes per inch of fish measured at its thickest point.  Do not overcook!  Albacore should be pink in the center when removed from heat.  Drain, cool and break into large chunks. 
Combine yogurt, sour cream, chutney, lime juice, green onion celery and lime rind.  Blend well.  Toss albacore and grapes with dressing.  Serve on bed of lettuce and garnish with almonds. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This salad includes a unique dressing of yogurt flavored with chutney and ginger.  Chutney, originally from India, is made from chopped fruits and spices.  There are both sweet and sour varieties on the market today; use a sweet chutney for this recipe.  Grated fresh ginger root adds zing to the dressing.  Remember that ginger root can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks, or freeze it and grate the amount needed without thawing.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dry Great Northern beans
                        (or use flageolets, baby limas
                        or other firm beans)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1                cup  dry bread crumbs
     1/2         pound  smoked whitefish -- skin and bones
                        removed, coarsely flaked
  3               cups  torn clean greens, such as spinach
                        kale, escarole or chard
  1                cup  diced tomato
  2 1/2    tablespoons  red wine or sherry vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Seafood Alternatives:  smoked salmon, smoked trout, smoked halibut 
Soak the beans in cold water to cover overnight.  Drain the beans, put them in a saucepan and add 4 cups fresh cold water.  Cook the beans over medium-high heat until just tender, about 35 minutes.  Drain well and set aside. 
Heat the oil in a large pan, add the garlic and sautÈ until aromatic.  Add the cooked beans and bread crumbs and continue to cook, stirring regularly, until the beans are lightly coated and the crumbs begin to brown, about 3 minutes. 
Add the flaked fish, greens, tomato, vinegar, salt and pepper.  Saute until the greens are lightly wilted, about 2 minutes, and serve. 
This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings 
Comments:  This is a great cold-water salad -- a healthy, warming mixture of beans and vegetables that makes a fancy first course or hearty meal.

           Warm Calamari Salad With End-Of-The-Season Tomatoes

Recipe By     :Chef Michael Chiarello, Tra Vigne
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced or pressed garlic
  2             pounds  squid -- cleaned, and
                        cut into large pieces
                        (or 1 lb cleaned squid mantles)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  white wine
  2                     Meyer lemons or regular lemons -- juiced
  1                     vine-ripened tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and quartered
  4        tablespoons  minced Italian flat-leaf parsley
  2            bunches  arugula - (abt 4 oz) -- rinsed, trimmed

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat, add the garlic and cook, stirring, until lightly browned.  Add the squid and sautÈ for 1 minute, then put in the preheated oven until evenly opaque but still tender, 2 to 4 minutes. 
Transfer the skillet to the stovetop, season the squid with salt and pepper, add the white wine and stir to deglaze the pan.  Immediately remove the squid with a slotted spoon. 
Add the lemon juice to the pan, bring to a boil and boil to reduce by half, about 3 minutes.  Return the squid to the pan with the tomato, parsley and arugula and toss just to coat; the arugula should maintain its shape and not be fully cooked. 
Spoon the warm salad onto individual plates and drizzle with the remaining olive oil. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  End-of-the-season tomatoes are slightly more acid than earlier tomatoes, but any ripe tomato can be used.  The Meyer lemon is larger than a regular lemon, with juice that is smoother and less sharply acidic.  Again, regular lemons can be used. 
Chef Chiarello uses a technique of first cooking the squid for 1 minute on top of the stove, then transferring the pan to a hot oven.  This cooks the squid gently and helps preserve its tender texture.  You can do all of the cooking on top of the stove, if you prefer, but take care not to overcook the squid, which leaves it quite tough.

                  Warm Crab, Artichoke And Parmesan Dip

Recipe By     :Kathy Casey
Serving Size  : 14    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  cream cheese
  2               cups  mayonnaise
     3/4         pound  crabmeat
  2               cups  shredded Parmesan cheese - (5 oz)
  1                jar  artichoke hearts - (abt 14 3/4 oz) -- not marinated,
                        drained well, and coarsely chopped
     3/4           cup  thinly-sliced onion
     1/2           cup  minced celery
     1/4           cup  minced red bell pepper or diced pimiento -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  minced green onion
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  minced or pressed garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce -- or to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Minced parsley -- or
                        Thinly-sliced green onions

Seafood Alternative:  tiny cooked shrimp 
In a medium bowl, stir the cream cheese until soft, then beat in the mayonnaise until just blended.  Do not overmix.  Fold in the remaining ingredients, except the garnish, until well combined. 
Put the dip in a 9- by 13-inch baking dish or oven-proof serving dish.  Smooth out the top but do not pack down.  The dip can be covered and refrigerated up to 2 days at this point. 
Shortly before serving, preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Bake the dip until it just starts to bubble around the edges and the cheese has melted, 8 to 12 minutes.  Sprinkle with minced parsley or green onions and serve immediately, with toasted bread and crackers alongside for spreading. 
This recipe yields 14 servings. 
Comments:  This dip can be prepared up to 2 days in advance and baked when your guests are just starting to arrive.  Serve with thin slices of baguette brushed with a little garlic-and herb-seasoned olive oil and lightly toasted in the oven, or with crackers.

In a medium bowl, stir the cream cheese until soft, then beat in the mayonnaise until just blended.  Do not overmix.  Fold in the remaining ingredients, except the garnish, until well combined. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the dip in a 9- by 13-inch baking dish or oven-proof serving dish.  Smooth out the top but do not pack down.  The dip can be covered and refrigerated up to 2 days at this point. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Shortly before serving, preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Bake the dip until it just starts to bubble around the edges and the cheese has melted, 8 to 12 minutes.  Sprinkle with minced parsley or green onions and serve immediately, with toasted bread and crackers alongside for spreading. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 14 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This dip can be prepared up to 2 days in advance and baked when your guests are just starting to arrive.  Serve with thin slices of baguette brushed with a little garlic-and herb-seasoned olive oil and lightly toasted in the oven, or with crackers.

                   Warm Spinach Salad With Crab Croutes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  onion -- thinly sliced
  6             ounces  crabmeat - (to 8 oz)
  6             ounces  cream cheese, preferably light
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12            slices  baguette-style bread
  8             ounces  cleaned spinach leaves - (to 10 oz) -- tough stems removed
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil, add the onion slices and cook over medium heat until the onions are softened and lightly colored, about 15 minutes.  Set aside. 
Set aside a few large chunks of crabmeat to garnish the salad.  Combine the remaining crabmeat and the cream cheese in a small bowl and mix with a fork until thoroughly combined.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Preheat the broiler.  Arrange the bread slices on a baking sheet and lightly toast.  Take the sheet from the oven and top the untoasted side of each slice with the crab mixture, mounding it slightly in the center. 
Return the sheet to the oven and continue broiling until the crab mixture bubbles and is lightly browned, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Set aside. 
Coarsely tear the spinach leaves and put them in a large bowl.  Reheat the onions and add the red wine vinegar with salt and pepper to taste.  Pour the hot dressing mixture over the spinach and quickly toss to coat.  The spinach should wilt slightly without fully cooking. 
Immediately divide the spinach mixture among 4 individual plates.  Top each salad with 3 crab croutes.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  To show off large claw or leg pieces of crab, save them for garnishing the salad rather than crumbling them into the cream cheese mixture.

                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  seaweed -- (optional)
  12             small  red potatoes - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- scrubbed
  6              small  white onions (abt 3/4 lb) -- peeled
  6                     corn ears -- shucked, husks
                        reserved, silk discarded
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- (if not using
                        seaweed)
  4                     fresh basil sprigs
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried basil)
  2                     live Dungeness crabs - (abt 1 3/4 lb ea)
  2             pounds  live clams -- scrubbed
  2             pounds  live mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
  3               cups  beer - (2 12-oz bottles)
                        (or substitute 3 cups dry white wine)
                        Lemon Butter
                        Spicy Mayonnaise
                        Lemon Wedges

Preheat an outdoor grill. 
Place a metal steamer rack in the bottom of a 16-quart pot at least 10 inches in diameter.  If using seaweed, place half of it on and under the steamer rack.  Add potatoes (reserving 1 for the top as a "tester") and onions.  Stand corn along edge of pot, stem end down.  Sprinkle with pepper, salt (if using) and basil. 
Add the crabs.  Place clams, tied loosely in cheesecloth, and mussels, also tied in cheesecloth, over the crabs.  Place the "tester" potato on top.  Pour beer or wine over.  Place a layer of seaweed and/or corn husks on the top and cover with the lid. 
Place the pot on fire grate over a white-hot fire (adding more briquettes first, if necessary) or on a stove over high heat.  Cook until a strong gush of steam escapes (about 12 minutes on the stove, about 35 minutes on the grill). 
Reduce the stove heat to medium-high (leave the outdoor fire as is) and start timing.  Steam-cook for about 15 minutes, or until the "tester potato" is tender and the crabs are bright red. 
Discard the seaweed and/or corn husks.  Arrange the crabs and other ingredients on a large serving platter.  Serve with Spicy Mayonnaise and/or Lemon Butter and lemon wedges. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

             White Beans, Catfish And Sauteed Mustard Greens

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1              pound  mustard or turnip greens -- stems removed,
                        leaves coarsely cut crosswise 2" strips
  1 1/4         pounds  boneless skinless catfish -- cut 1" chunks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cans  chicken or vegetable broth - -- (14 1/2 oz ea)
  2               cans  cannellini or other white beans - -- (15 oz  ea), drained,
                        and rinsed

Seafood Alternatives:  lingcod, monkfish, cod, halibut 
For the mustard sauce, combine the mayonnaise and mustard in a small bowl and set aside. 
Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion and garlic and sautÈ until softened, about 3 minutes.  Add the mustard greens and cook until barely tender, stirring often, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove from the pan and set aside. 
Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in the same skillet.  Season the catfish with salt and pepper and sautÈ until the fish is just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Remove the fish from the pan and set aside with the greens. 
Add the broth to the skillet and bring to a boil.  Add the beans and simmer until they are heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.  Gently stir in the greens and catfish, heat gently and season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Ladle the mixture into bowls and add a dollop of the mustard sauce to each serving. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Once you've added the fish to the simmering stew, stir gently and don't overcook or the fish will fall apart.  A dollop of mustard-flavored mayonnaise carries the mustard theme one step further.

                        Whole Grilled Red Snapper

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  red snapper (5 to 6 lbs) -- scaled, dressed
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5             slices  fresh ginger - (quarter size)
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  2                     green onions -- coarsely chopped
  1                     lemon

Seafood Alternatives:  salmon, rockfish 
Preheat a charcoal grill until the coals glow red with white ash on the edges. 
Rinse the fish inside and out; pat dry with paper towel.  Brush lightly inside and out with oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Lay the ginger slices, crushed garlic cloves and green onion inside the cavity; squeeze the juice from 1/2 lemon inside. 
Grill in a hinged grilling rack over hot indirect heat, turning once, until the fish flesh is opaque, about 40 minutes. 
Alternatively, you can wrap the fish in foil if you don't have a grilling basket for fish. 
Transfer the fish to large serving platter, garnish with lemon slices and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  A Gulf Coast favorite, red snapper has a beautiful color that makes it the perfect centerpiece for a festive summer party.  To complete the warm-weather theme, serve with a fresh vegetable relish such as Chile and Corn Relish.

        Yellowtail Snapper With Rum, Brown Butter, Mango And Mint

Recipe By     :Chef Mark Militello, Mark's Place
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     snapper fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- skin-on preferred
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  clarified butter
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped macadamia nuts
  1         tablespoon  julienned fresh ginger
  1                cup  diced fresh mango
     3/4           cup  fresh mint leaves - (loosely packed)
     1/3           cup  rum

Seafood Alternatives:  grouper, halibut, haddock 
Run your fingers over the fish fillets, feeling for pin bones, and remove any you find with pliers.  Take care not to pierce the flesh.  If the fillets have skin, score them on the diagonal through the skin side 3 times with a sharp knife.  Season the fish with salt and pepper.  Lightly dust the fillets with flour, shaking off the excess. 
Heat the clarified butter in a large non-stick frying pan.  Saute the fish, starting skin-side down, until nicely browned and just opaque through, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer the fish to plates or a platter. 
Add the remaining butter to the pan and cook until browned.  Add the nuts, ginger, mango and mint leaves and sautÈ for 1 minute.  Whisk in the rum and bring to a boil. 
Correct the seasoning, adding salt and pepper to taste.  Spoon the sauce over the fish and serve at once. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
CHEF'S NOTE:  Clarified butter is butter from which the milk solids have been removed.  It is preferred as a cooking fat by many chefs because clarified butter carries the rich flavor of butter without the added problem of potential burning that whole butter has. 
To make clarified butter, melt a stick of butter in a small saucepan.  When completely melted, there will be a foamy residue on top, which you can skim off and discard with a small spoon.  Then, slowly pour the melted butter into a small dish, leaving behind the milk solids which have settled in the bottom of the pan.

                       Zesty Broiled Salmon Steaks

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              small  salmon steaks - (5 to 7 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1               dash  Tabasco sauce
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley -- for garnish

Rinse the salmon steaks and pat dry with paper towels.  In a shallow dish, combine the Worcestershire sauce, mustard, Tabasco, salt and pepper and stir with a fork to combine.  Set the salmon steaks in the dish and turn so that they are evenly coated with the mixture.  Let stand for 15 minutes. 
Set the oven rack 3 to 4 inches below the element and preheat the broiler.  Line the broiler pan or baking sheet with a piece of foil and lightly oil the foil.  Using tongs, take the salmon steaks from the marinade, allowing excess to drip off, and arrange them on the foil with at least an inch between them; reserve the marinade. 
Broil the salmon until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.  Take the pan from the oven, turn the steaks and spoon on some of the reserved marinade.  Continue broiling until the salmon is just barely opaque through the thickest part (cut to test), 3 to 5 minutes longer. 
Transfer the salmon steaks to individual plates, sprinkle with the minced parsley and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The rich flavor of salmon stands up well to pronounced ingredient accompaniments.  You can also follow this recipe without the marinade, broiling the salmon unadorned for another delicious option.

                     Zucchini-Wrapped Scallop Kebabs

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-minced rosemary
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  24             large  sea scallops - (abt 1 1/4 lbs)
  2              small  zucchini - (to 3) -- trimmed
  16                    cherry tomatoes

Seafood Alternatives:  large shrimp, cubed firm fish 
If using bamboo skewers, soak 16 of them in a large bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes. 
In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, rosemary, salt and a generous amount of pepper.  Add the scallops and stir to thoroughly coat.  Set aside for 15 minutes. 
Preheat the grill.  Cut the zucchini into 1/8-inch thick lengthwise slices.  Take one scallop from the marinade, wrap in a piece of zucchini and skewer on two parallel bamboo skewers.  Add one cherry tomato and finish with a third zucchini-wrapped scallop.  Continue with the remaining scallops, zucchini and tomatoes, making 8 kebabs. 
Lightly brush the kebabs with some of the remaining marinade.  Set the kebabs on the preheated grill and cook until the zucchini and scallops are lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes. 
Turn the kebabs and continue grilling until the scallops are just opaque through (cut one to test), about 3 minutes longer. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Larger sea scallops work best for kebabs; if they are very large, consider cutting them in half (as much as possible, the scallops should be consistently sized.)  If you have a slicer to help cut thin slices of zucchini, this is the place to use it; otherwise carefully cut the thin slices with a very sharp chefs knife.

Lightly brush the kebabs with some of the remaining marinade.  Set the kebabs on the preheated grill and cook until the zucchini and scallops are lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes.

Turn the kebabs and continue grilling until the scallops are just opaque through (cut one to test), about 3 minutes longer.

Comments:  Larger sea scallops work best for kebabs; if they are very large, consider cutting them in half (as much as possible, the scallops should be consistently sized.)  If you have a slicer to help cut thin slices of zucchini, this is the place to use it; otherwise carefully cut the thin slices with a very sharp chefs knife.
