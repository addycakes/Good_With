  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  molasses
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  chile peppers in adobe sauce
  20                    oysters in their shells
                        = (or 1 pint oysters)

Combine the sugar, vinegar, tomato paste, sesame oil, molasses, soy sauce, and chili peppers in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until it starts to become syrupy and dime-sized bubbles form, 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a blender or food processor.  Process on high speed until smooth.

Preheat the grill.

Using an oyster knife, shuck the oysters, drain off their liquor, and keep on the half shell, reserve the other half of the shells.  Place the oyster on the half shell on the grill.  Top each oyster with 1 heaping teaspoon of the sauce and cover with the other half of the shell.  Grill until edges of the oysters start to curl, about 4 minutes.  Remove from grill and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

          Asparagus Soup With Red Pepper Sauce And Lump Crabmeat

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4         pounds  fresh thin asparagus -- tough ends discarded
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  chopped yellow onion
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  4               cups  chicken stock or vegetable stock
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Red Pepper Sauce II -- (see recipe)
     1/4         pound  lump crabmeat -- for garnish

Cut 16 tips from the tops of the asparagus and reserve for garnish.  Cut the remaining asparagus into 1/2-inch pieces.

In a medium-sized, heavy pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the asparagus, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the chicken stock and white wine and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the asparagus are very tender, about 25 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring a small pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the asparagus tips and blanch until just tender, about 2 minutes.  Drain and refresh in an ice bath.

Add the cream to the soup and bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.

Transfer the soup in batches to a blender and process on high speed until very smooth.  Remove from the heat and ladle into 4 large soup bowls.  Swirl the Red Pepper Sauce in a decorative pattern over the soup in each bowl.  Spoon 1 tablespoon of crabmeat into the center and arrange the blanched tips around the crabmeat.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                            Baby Bam Seasoning

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse

Categories    : Condiments                      Spice Blends

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  paprika
  2        tablespoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  dried parsley
  2          teaspoons  onion powder
  2          teaspoons  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  celery salt

Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir well to combine with a wooden spoon.

Store in an airtight container for up to 3 months.

This recipe yields about 3/4 cup

Comments:  Here's something to season your foods, like the grown-ups do with Emeril's Original Essence.  Add another dimension by sprinkling it into everything, from soups and sauces to pizza and hamburger patties.  You fearless bammers out there can kick this up a notch by adding cayenne, to taste.  (I'd start with about 1/4 teaspoon, and then take it from there.)

         Bacon Pancakes With Walnut Butter And Caramelized Onions

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             slices  thick-cut bacon -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  2 1/4           cups  buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil - (to 2)
                        === WALNUT BUTTER ===
     1/2           cup  walnut pieces
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces,
                        and at room temperature
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === CARAMELIZED ONIONS ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              pound  yellow onions -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced - (4 cups)

Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook, stirring, over medium-high heat, until crisp and the fat is rendered, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels.

Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder into a large bowl.  Add the egg and buttermilk, and stir just until blended, being careful not to over mix.  Add the chives and crumble the bacon into the batter and mix to incorporate.

Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.  Ladle 2 tablespoon portions of batter into the pan, being careful not to overcrowd, and cook until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm.  Add more oil to the pan as needed and repeat with the remaining batter.

To serve, place 3 pancakes on each serving plate.  Top each pancake with a pat of Walnut Butter and Caramelized Onions, and serve immediately.

Walnut Butter:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Spread the walnuts on a baking sheet and lightly toast in the oven for 7 to 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool.  Roughly chop.

Place the butter, walnuts, shallots, garlic, and salt in a medium bowl, and mix well with a rubber spatula.  Spoon down the middle of an 8-inch piece of parchment paper and roll into a log, about 1-inch in diameter.  Wrap tightly and refrigerate until ready to use.

To use, cut into thin slices and place on top of the Bacon Pancakes.  (The Walnut Butter can be frozen, tightly wrapped in plastic, for up to 1 month.  Makes 2/3 cup)

Caramelized Onions:  Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and lower the heat to medium-low.  Cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and caramelized, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Remove from the heat and set aside until ready to serve with the Bacon Pancakes.  (Makes 1 cup)

This recipe yields 18 pancakes; 6 servings.

     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled and smashed

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  cream
  1                cup  milk
     1/2           cup  sugar
  6                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  banana puree
                        = (1 banana mashed with a fork)
     1/2      teaspoon  banana extract

In a saucepan, combine the cream and milk and warm gently over a low flame.

Place the sugar and egg yolks in a mixing bowl and beat until smooth in texture and pale yellow in color.  Slowly add about 1 cup of the cream and milk mixture to the egg mixture and whisk vigorously to combine.

Pour the egg mixture into the saucepan with the remainder of the cream and milk mixture and whisk continuously until the custard starts to thicken and can coat the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes.  Add the chocolate chips, banana puree, and the banana extract to the custard and stir to combine.  Cook for 1 minute longer, then remove from the heat, and strain through a fine mesh sieve.

Place the custard in a non-reactive container, cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.  Remove from the refrigerator and mix in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Once frozen, place the ice cream in a plastic tub to continue freezing in the freezer.

                           Basic Italian Bread

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water -- lukewarm
  1 3/4         ounces  cake yeast - (1/3 cup)
  5 3/4           cups  bread flour
  1         tablespoon  dark brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds

Place the water and yeast in the bowl of an electric mixer and allow the yeast to bloom for about 5 minutes.  Using a dough hook attachment, add the flour and sugar to the water and mix on low speed until a dough starts to form.  Drizzle the oil and salt into the dough and beat on medium speed for 8 to 10 minutes, or until a smooth, firm, elastic dough is formed.

Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and spray the dough with a thin coating of cooking spray.  Wrap the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside to proof in a warm, draft-free place for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in size.

Remove the plastic wrap, punch down and flatten the rounded dough with the heel of your hand.  Roll the dough up tightly, sealing the seam well after each roll.  The dough should be elongated and oval-shaped, with tapered and rounded (not pointed) ends.

Preheat the oven lined with a pizza stone to 425 degrees.  Alternately, an inverted baking sheet may be used in place of a pizza stone.

Place the dough on a baker's peel heavily dusted with semolina flour, or cornmeal, or alternately on an inverted baking sheet.  Allow the dough to proof, loosely covered with a damp towel, for 30 minutes, or until doubled in size.

Brush the dough with the egg white and sprinkle the sesame seeds over the top.  Using a razor blade or sharp knife, score 3 (1/4-inch deep) slashes across the top of the dough at a 45 degree angle.

Spray the dough generously with water from a water bottle and place in the oven on the baking stone.  Immediately close the oven and bake for 3 minutes.  Open the oven door and spray the dough again with the water bottle.  Close the oven door and bake for an additional 3 minutes before spraying the dough for a third time (the spraying of the dough will ensure a crisp golden brown crust).

Bake the dough for 45 minutes, or until a hollow thud is heard when the bread is whacked with the bowl of a wooden spoon.  Allow the bread to cool slightly before serving.

This recipe yields 1 large loaf Italian bread.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  beef top round -- cut 2" to 3" pieces
  3        tablespoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- for dredging
  6        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2               cups  chopped onions
  1                cup  chopped celery
  1                cup  chopped green bell peppers
  1              pound  button mushrooms -- brushed cleaned,
                        and quartered
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     3/4           cup  dry red wine
  3               cups  veal stock
  2               cups  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme lesves
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
                        Baked Cheese Grits -- (see recipe)

Lay the beef pieces a few at a time between sheets of parchment paper.  Using a meat mallet, pound the meat to tenderize and break up some of the connective tissue.  Season the meat pieces with 2 tablespoons of Essence and dredge in the flour.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat a large cast-iron pan or a 3-quart braising pan over medium-high heat.  Once the pan is hot add 2 tablespoons of oil in the pan and brown the floured beef, working in batches and adding more oil as necessary.  Do not overcrowd the pan with the meat.  Cook the beef for about 3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.  As the beef is browned, transfer to a large plate and set aside until you have cooked all of the beef.

Add the butter to the pan and, when melted, add the onions, celery, peppers and mushrooms.  Cook the vegetables, stirring often, until softened, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the garlic to the pan and cook for 1 minute.  Pour the red wine to the pan and scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to remove any browned bits that may have formed on the bottom.

Add the veal stock, tomatoes, bay leaves, thyme, salt, cayenne and black peppers to the pan and bring to a boil.  Return the beef to the pan and reduce the heat to a simmer.  Place a lid on the pan and place in the oven.  Allow the beef to cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, for 2 hours, or until the beef is fork tender.

When the beef is tender, remove the pan from the oven and stir the oregano and basil into the pot.  Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.  Serve with Baked Cheese Grits.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings when served with Baked Cheese Grits.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUBLE PIE CRUST ===
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4             ounces  cold unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
     1/3           cup  solid vegetable shortening
  6        tablespoons  ice water -- or more as needed
                        === APPLE FILLING ===
  4             pounds  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced
     3/4           cup  roughly-chopped toasted walnuts
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into slivers
                        === FOR SERVING ===
  2        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter
  8             ounces  thinly-sliced Cheddar
  8             scoops  vanilla ice cream

Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large mixing bowl.  By hand incorporate the butter pieces and shortening, working with your fingertips until it comes together and forms small pea shapes.  Work the ice water into the dough with your hands until it just comes together, being careful not to over-mix.  Form the dough into 2 disk shapes, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to rest for at least 30 minutes before rolling out the 2 crusts on a lightly floured surface to fit into the pie pan.  (Makes 2 (10-inch) pie crusts)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Roll out the piecrust and line a deep 10-inch pie pan.

In a large bowl, combine the apples, walnuts, 1/2 cup sugar, brown sugar, lemon juice, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.  Toss to coat the apples with the other ingredients and let sit for 10 minutes.  Spoon the apple mixture into the prepared pie pan and dot the fruit with the butter slivers.  Top with the second crust.  Using a sharp knife, cut away the excess dough.  Crimp the edges of the pie firmly to seal the dough.  With a sharp knife, cut a decorative pattern of slits into the top crust.  With a pastry brush, brush the cream over the top crust, and sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons of sugar over the top.

Bake until the crust is golden and the juices begin to bubble, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let cool at least 1 hour before serving.

Preheat a griddle.

To serve, slice the pie into 8 equal portions.  Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter on the griddle.  Add the pie, and top each slice with a slice of cheese.  Cook until the cheese melts and the bottom crust is golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Serve hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large mixing bowl.  By hand incorporate the butter pieces and shortening, working with your fingertips until it comes together and forms small pea shapes.  Work the ice water into the dough with your hands until it just comes together, being careful not to over-mix.  Form the dough into 2 disk shapes, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to rest for at least 30 minutes before rolling out the 2 crusts on a lightly floured surface to fit into the pie pan.  (Makes 2 (10-inch) pie crusts)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Roll out the piecrust and line a deep 10-inch pie pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, combine the apples, walnuts, 1/2 cup sugar, brown sugar, lemon juice, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.  Toss to coat the apples with the other ingredients and let sit for 10 minutes.  Spoon the apple mixture into the prepared pie pan and dot the fruit with the butter slivers.  Top with the second crust.  Using a sharp knife, cut away the excess dough.  Crimp the edges of the pie firmly to seal the dough.  With a sharp knife, cut a decorative pattern of slits into the top crust.  With a pastry brush, brush the cream over the top crust, and sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons of sugar over the top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake until the crust is golden and the juices begin to bubble, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let cool at least 1 hour before serving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat a griddle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, slice the pie into 8 equal portions.  Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter on the griddle.  Add the pie, and top each slice with a slice of cheese.  Cook until the cheese melts and the bottom crust is golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Serve hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  flour -- plus
  1 1/2    tablespoons  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  sugar -- plus
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening
  2        tablespoons  ice water
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  semi-sweet chocolate chips -- plus
  2        tablespoons  semi-sweet chocolate chips
  2 1/4           cups  pecan pieces
  6                     eggs -- beaten
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  cane syrup or molasses -- plus
  2        tablespoons  cane syrup or molasses
  1                cup  light corn syrup -- plus
  2        tablespoons  light corn syrup
     3/4     teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  3        tablespoons  Bourbon whiskey - (or more)
                        === VANILLA BEAN ICE CREAM ===
  3               cups  heavy cream
  2               cups  milk
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  12             large  egg yolks
  1                cup  sugar

Combine 1 cup of the flour, salt and 3/4 teaspoon of the sugar in a mixing bowl.  Add the shortening and work it in your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the water, a little at a time, and work it in with your hands.  Add only as much as you need for a smooth ball of dough.  Wrap the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface.  Roll out the dough on the floured surface into a circle about 12 inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick.  Gently fold the circle of dough in half and then in half again so that you can lift it without tearing it, and unfold into a 9-inch pie pan.  Refrigerate for 1 hour, or until ready to fill.

In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream until scalded, and pour over the chocolate chips that are in a small, heat-proof mixing bowl.  Stir until the chocolate has melted and a smooth sauce has formed.  Set aside and reserve for the pie.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Remove the pie shell from the refrigerator, and spread the pecan pieces evenly on the bottom.  Combine the eggs, the remaining 3/4 cup sugar, brown sugar, cane syrup, corn syrup, vanilla, salt, butter, and the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons flour in a mixing bowl.  Mix well.  Pour the mixture over the pecans.

Bake for about 1 hour, or until the filling sets and the pastry is nicely browned.  When you remove the pie from the oven, drizzle the whiskey over-top the pie.  Pokes holes into the pie filling with the tip of a sharp knife so the bourbon has a route to travel.

Cool for 10 minutes, and then pour the ganache over top the pie.  Let the ganache set in the refrigerator for 10 minutes, then slice, and serve the pie with the Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.  The pie may also be served warmed briefly in a microwave.

Vanilla Bean Ice Cream:  Combine the cream and 1 cup of the milk in a large heavy saucepan.  Scrape the seeds into the cream mixture and add the bean pod.  Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.

Whisk the yolks and sugar in a medium bowl.  In a slow and steady stream, whisk 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture.  Gradually whisk the egg mixture back into the saucepan.  Stir constantly over medium-low heat until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof medium bowl.

Stir in the remaining 1 cup milk into the ice cream base and cover with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap against the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming.  Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours.

Pour the chilled custard into an ice cream machine.  Churn according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Pack into an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.

This recipe yields about 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7             pounds  veal bones -- cut 3" to 4" pieces
                        = (from the back, neck and shanks)
  1                cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped onions
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped carrots
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped celery
     1/3           cup  peeled garlic cloves
     1/3           cup  tomato paste
  2            gallons  cold water
                        SACHET CONSISTING OF:
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed black peppercorns
  6                     parsley stems -- all wrapped in
                        cheesecloth and tied with string

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.

Place the veal bones in a large roasting pan, being sure that they all rest in a single layer.  If you cannot fit all the bones in a single layer, roast them in batches.  Place the roasting pan in the oven and roast the bones for about 1 hour, turning the bones periodically to ensure even browning.  Remove the pan from the oven and pour off and reserve the fat.

Place the bones in a large 3 gallon stockpot.  Place the roasting pan on the stove over a medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of the reserved fat to the pan.  Add the onions, carrots, celery and garlic to the pan and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes.  Add the tomato paste to the roasting pan, stir to incorporate, and continue to cook another 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are a deep amber color.

Add the red wine to the pan to deglaze, scraping the bottom of the roasting pan with a wooden spoon to loosen the browned bits.  Pour the contents of the roasting pan into the stockpot and cover with the water and sachet.

Bring the stockpot to a boil then reduce to a simmer.  Allow stock to simmer for 8 to 10 hours, skimming the scum and fat that will rise to the top frequently.  If at any point the water level falls below the bones, add water so that the bones remain submerged.  It is not unusual to have to add up to 3 quarts of additional water during the 8 hours of simmering, adding the water a quart at a time to the stockpot.

When the stock has simmered for the full 8 hours, remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth.  Refrigerate or freeze whatever is not used.  Alternately, the stock can be returned to the stove and reduced by 1/2 or more for easier storage.

This recipe yields about 1 gallon.

Add the red wine to the pan to deglaze, scraping the bottom of the roasting pan with a wooden spoon to loosen the browned bits.  Pour the contents of the roasting pan into the stockpot and cover with the water and sachet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring the stockpot to a boil then reduce to a simmer.  Allow stock to simmer for 8 to 10 hours, skimming the scum and fat that will rise to the top frequently.  If at any point the water level falls below the bones, add water so that the bones remain submerged.  It is not unusual to have to add up to 3 quarts of additional water during the 8 hours of simmering, adding the water a quart at a time to the stockpot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the stock has simmered for the full 8 hours, remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth.  Refrigerate or freeze whatever is not used.  Alternately, the stock can be returned to the stove and reduced by 1/2 or more for easier storage.

<DirT>
This recipe yields about 1 gallon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour -- sifted twice
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  melted butter
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar -- plus
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     3/4           cup  milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  2               cups  vegetable oil - (to 3) -- for frying
                        Melted bittersweet chocolate -- garnish
                        === MANGO SALSA ===
  1 1/2           cups  small-diced mango
  1         tablespoon  chopped mint
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  honey -- (1 to 2)
     1/4           cup  chopped -- toasted walnuts

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.

In a small bowl, beat the eggs, butter, vanilla and 1 tablespoon of sugar.  Add the milk and stir to combine.  Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir to make a dough, adding more milk 1/4 teaspoon at a time if the mixture is too dry.

Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth.  Shape into 20 equal balls.  Cover with a kitchen cloth and let stand for 30 minutes.

In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar and the cinnamon to make the cinnamon-sugar.

In a large, deep skillet, heat 1 to 2 inches of oil to 360 degrees.

Roll each ball out on a lightly-floured board into very thin circles, about 6-inches in diameter.  Fry the dough until golden brown, turning once.  Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar.

To serve, drizzle with the chocolate and sprinkle with chopped nuts.  Serve hot.

Mango Salsa:  Mix all of the ingredients together.  Let sit for 15 minutes for flavors to develop.

This recipe yields 20 fritters.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  buttermilk -- plus
                        more for thinning
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- plus about
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil -- for the pan
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into teaspoons
                        === ORANGE SYRUP AND RASPBERRIES ===
  3               cups  fresh orange juice
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  1                cup  fresh raspberries and blueberries -- well rinsed, dried
                        Powdered sugar -- for sprinkling

Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.  Add the buttermilk, the egg, and 1 tablespoon of oil, and stir just until blended, being careful not to over mix.  (Lumps are okay.)  Let the batter stand, covered, in the refrigerator, for at least 1 hour, and up to 8 hours.  If necessary, thin with extra buttermilk after resting.

Preheat a large, heavy skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.  Add enough oil to lightly grease and leave a film on the bottom of the pan.

Working in batches, ladle the batter about 1/2 cup at a time into the pan.  Cook until golden brown and bubbles start to form on the top, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer to a platter and cover to keep warm.

To serve, divide the pancakes into stacks among 4 plates.  Pour syrup over each stack and sprinkle with powdered sugar and pass the butter at the table.  Serve immediately.

Orange Syrup and Raspberries:  Combine the juice, sugar, and orange peel in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Reduce the heat to a low boil and cook to a thick syrup, and reduced by half, about 15 minutes.  Add the butter and almond extract and whisk to combine.  Add berries and remove from the heat.  Let cool slightly before serving with pancakes.

This recipe yields about 12 to 15 medium pancakes.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3               cups  thinly-sliced yellow onions
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  chopped toasted walnuts
  4             ounces  prosciutto -- chopped
  2                     sheets prepared puff pastry -- thawed
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  4             ounces  blue cheese -- crumbled
  3               cups  mesclun greens -- tossed with
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Grease a large baking sheet and set aside.

In a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and saute until caramelized, 12 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the wine and cook until dry, 2 minutes.  Add the thyme, salt, and pepper, stir well, and remove from the heat.  Add the walnuts and prosciutto and stir well to combine.  Let cool.

On a lightly floured surface, 1 at a time, roll out the pastry sheets to about 12 by 12 inches.  Cut each into an 11-inch round.

Place 1 round on the prepared sheet.  Brush a 1/2-inch border of egg wash around the outside of the round.  Spread the onion mixture evenly across the round.  Top with blue cheese.  Top with the remaining pastry round.  Press down on the edges of the pastry to close, and crimp with a fork to seal.  Paint the top pastry with egg wash and cut small slits in the center to vent.  Bake until golden and puffed, 20 to 25 minutes.

Remove from the oven and cut into 4 wedges.  Divide the lettuces and tart among 4 plates and serve.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer portions.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Grease a large baking sheet and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and saute until caramelized, 12 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the wine and cook until dry, 2 minutes.  Add the thyme, salt, and pepper, stir well, and remove from the heat.  Add the walnuts and prosciutto and stir well to combine.  Let cool.

<DirT>
On a lightly floured surface, 1 at a time, roll out the pastry sheets to about 12 by 12 inches.  Cut each into an 11-inch round.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1 round on the prepared sheet.  Brush a 1/2-inch border of egg wash around the outside of the round.  Spread the onion mixture evenly across the round.  Top with blue cheese.  Top with the remaining pastry round.  Press down on the edges of the pastry to close, and crimp with a fork to seal.  Paint the top pastry with egg wash and cut small slits in the center to vent.  Bake until golden and puffed, 20 to 25 minutes.
</DirT>

Remove from the oven and cut into 4 wedges.  Divide the lettuces and tart among 4 plates and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  bacon
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
                        Essence -- recipe follows
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1              large  avocado -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into 12 even vertical slices
     1/4           cup  chopped drained sun-dried tomatoes
  4             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  Chardonnay wine
  3        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === SHOESTRING POTATOES ===
  1 1/2         pounds  potatoes -- peeled, julienned
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Salt -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until golden and not quite crisp, about 4 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.

Place each chicken breast half between 2 sheets of plastic wrap.  With a meat mallet, pound the chicken to about 1/8-inch thickness.  Discard the top piece of plastic and season the chicken breasts with Essence.  Lay 2 slices of bacon lengthwise along the middle of each breast.  Top with 3 slices of avocado, 1 tablespoon of chopped sun-dried tomato, and 1-ounce of crumbled cheese.  Sprinkle the filling with 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper.  Using the plastic wrap, tightly roll the upper edge of chicken up and over the filling to completely enclose.  Secure with 2 wooden toothpicks.

In a large, ovenproof skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken roulades and sear on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes.  Place the skillet in the oven and roast until cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, to make the sauce, combine the Chardonnay and shallots in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Bring to a boil and cook until the wine is reduced to 1 tablespoon, about 3 minutes.  Reduce the heat to medium, add the mustard and swirl to blend.  Add the cream and simmer until thickened and reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the parsley, stir to blend, and remove from the heat.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

Remove the chicken from the oven and discard the toothpicks.  Cut each roulade into 4 equal slices.  Divide the sauce among 4 plates and arrange the roulade slices on top.  Garnish with fried shoestring or waffle cut potatoes.

Shoestring Potatoes:  Preheat a pot of oil or a fryer to 360 degrees.

Add potatoes and fry until golden brown.  Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.  Season with salt immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Pair with: St. Francis Chardonnay

In a large mixing bowl dissolve the yeast and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of sugar in 1/4 cup of warm water (110 degrees).  Add the eggs and stir to combine.  Set aside until foamy, about 10 minutes.

Add the milk mixture to the yeast mixture and stir to combine.  Using a wooden spoon, add the flour 1 cup at a time.  The dough will be quite stiff and somewhat sticky.  If the dough gets too stiff to stir with a spoon, use your hands to mix.

Lightly grease the inside of a large bowl with 1 teaspoon of the remaining butter.  Transfer the dough to the bowl and turn to coat.  Lightly grease a piece of waxed paper or plastic wrap with the remaining teaspoon of butter and use it to cover the bowl.  Set aside in a warm place until doubled in size, at least 3 hours.

Melt remaining 1/4 cup of butter and transfer to a small bowl to cool.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 2 to 3 minutes.

Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough to a thickness of 1/2-inch.  Using a sharp knife, cut the dough into 36 equal pieces.  Tuck the cut edges of each piece under so as to form a smooth round ball of dough.

Place 3 balls of dough side by side into each well of a muffin tin.  Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the top of each roll with some of the melted butter.  Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm, draft-free area until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Bake the dinner rolls in the center of the oven until golden brown and puffed, about 18 to 20 minutes.  Be sure to serve the rolls while they are still warm with your favorite jams.

This recipe yields 12 super-sized dinner rolls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CUPCAKES ===
  1              large  egg -- cracked
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  flour
     1/2           cup  sifted cocoa powder
                        = (optional for chocolate cupcakes)
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  hot water
                        === ICINGS ===
  3               cups  powdered sugar -- sifted
  3        tablespoons  sifted cocoa powder
                        = (optional for chocolate icing)
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
  2        tablespoons  buttermilk
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        === OPTIONAL TOPPINGS ===
                        Chocolate sprinkles
                        Multi-colored sprinkles
                        Colored sugar
                        Silver dragees (balls)
                        Mini-chocolate chips
                        Candy covered chocolates
                        Crushed chocolate sandwich cookies
                        Fresh blueberries
                        Toasted chopped nuts

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and make sure the oven rack is in the center position.

Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper cups, and place 4 paper cups inside a second muffin tin.  Add 2 tablespoons of water to each of the remaining empty muffin wells.

Combine all the cupcake ingredients in a bowl, adding the water last.  Beat with an electric mixer until smooth.  Divide the batter evenly between the lined muffin cups.  Bake until risen and golden in color and a toothpick inserted into the center of 1 cupcake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

To make the icing, combine all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl.  Blend with a hand-held mixer until smooth and creamy.

Remove from the oven and carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.  Using a small spatula or butter knife, spread either Vanilla or Chocolate icing onto each cupcake (using about 2 tablespoons per cupcake).  If desired, place optional toppings on separate plates and dip the cupcakes into desired toppings and serve.

This recipe yields 16 cupcakes.

<DirT>
Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper cups, and place 4 paper cups inside a second muffin tin.  Add 2 tablespoons of water to each of the remaining empty muffin wells.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine all the cupcake ingredients in a bowl, adding the water last.  Beat with an electric mixer until smooth.  Divide the batter evenly between the lined muffin cups.  Bake until risen and golden in color and a toothpick inserted into the center of 1 cupcake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

<DirT>
To make the icing, combine all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl.  Blend with a hand-held mixer until smooth and creamy.

Remove from the oven and carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.  Using a small spatula or butter knife, spread either Vanilla or Chocolate icing onto each cupcake (using about 2 tablespoons per cupcake).  If desired, place optional toppings on separate plates and dip the cupcakes into desired toppings and serve.

     1/2           cup  chopped Maui onions
     1/4           cup  grated peeled fresh ginger
     1/4           cup  sake

  3        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)

     1/3           cup  sake
  3        tablespoons  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  rice wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  2        tablespoons  grated peeled fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        === FRIED MAUI ONION RINGS ===
  2              large  Maui onions -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/8" thick rings
  1                cup  buttermilk
     1/4           cup  Emeril's hot sauce
     1/4           cup  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
                        Peanut or vegetable oil -- for frying

In a bowl, combine all the ingredients except the fish, and whisk well to combine.  Cut 3 horizontal slits in both sides of the fish, and place flat in a non-reactive dish.  Cover with the marinade, turning to coat both sides.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Preheat a grill.

Remove the fish from the marinade and place in a grill basket.  Place on the hot grill and spoon a small amount of the marinade over the fish, being careful not to extinguish the flame.  Cook until the fish is opaque and cooked through, about 15 minutes per side, turning occasionally so the fish does not burn.

Remove from the grill and serve with the Ginger-Sake Sauce, and Fried Maui Onion Rings.

Ginger-Sake Sauce:  In a bowl, combine all the ingredients, mixing well.  Allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, or, cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.  Serve at room temperature.

Fried Maui Onion Rings:  In a bowl, combine the buttermilk with the hot sauce and 2 teaspoons of Essence.  Add the onion rings and toss to coat.  Marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.

Heat the oil in a large wok or pot to 360 degrees.

In a shallow bowl or large dish, combine the flour with 2 tablespoons of the Essence.  Dredge the onions in the seasoned flour, coating each ring evenly.  Shake off any excess flour and carefully place the rings in the hot oil.  Fry until golden brown, turning to cook evenly and prevent sticking, about 3 minutes per batch.  Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.  Season the fried onion rings with Essence, and repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Serve immediately while hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     farm-raised pheasants - (abt 3 lbs ea) -- innards removed,
                        wing tips and necks trimmed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     onion -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1                     carrot -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1                     orange -- halved
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme
  6             slices  thick-cut bacon -- cut in half
     1/4           cup  Madeira
  1                cup  rich chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  cold -- unsalted butter
                        Wild Mushroom Bread Pudding -- (see recipe)

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees and position the oven rack in the bottom third of the oven.

Season the cavities and the outside of each pheasant liberally with salt and pepper.  Divide the chopped onion and carrot equally among the cavities of the pheasants.  Squeeze the juice from both halves of the orange and set aside.  Cut 1 of the squeezed halves into 3 pieces, and tuck inside of the cavities along with the veggies.  Insert 1 sprig of thyme into the cavity of each pheasant.

Arrange the pheasants in a large roasting pan, breast sides up.  Lay 2 strips of bacon over the top of each pheasant, cutting the bacon into pieces if necessary to cover as much of the pheasant as possible.  Roast for 15 minutes, then remove the bacon strips and continue roasting for approximately 30 to 40 minutes, or until the juices run clear.  (It is important to not overcook the pheasants, as they are very lean birds.)  Remove the pheasants from the oven and transfer to a serving platter, loosely tented, while you make the sauce.

Using a spoon, carefully remove as much extra fat from the pan as possible.  Place the roasting pan over high heat and, when hot, deglaze with the reserved orange juice and Madeira, using a wooden spoon to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  When the orange juice and Madeira have reduced by half, add the chicken stock and continue to cook until sauce has reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Swirl in the butter and remove from the heat.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Remove the back bone from each pheasant, then cut along the breast bone to divide the birds into two halves.  Serve 1/2 pheasant per person, napped with some of the sauce and with some of the Wild Mushroom Bread Pudding.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Wild pheasants are usually smaller birds, and thus will cook in less time.  If you are using wild pheasants, please adjust the recipe accordingly.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  sliced yellow onions
  10            ounces  assorted wild mushrooms
                        = (such as oyster, shitake, chanterelles,
                        wood ear, or porcini)
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  3          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  lager beer
  5              large  eggs
  3               cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  molasses
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme
     3/4           cup  grated Gouda cheese
     3/4           cup  grated white cheddar cheese
     3/4         pound  stale white bread -- cut into 1" cubes
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  plain bread crumbs

Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over high heat.  Add the onions and cook until golden brown and tender, 5 minutes.  Add the mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon of the garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the Essence, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 3/4 teaspoon of the pepper, and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are tender and have given off their liquid, about 5 minutes.  Add the beer and cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan and until the mixture is almost dry, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

In a large bowl, combine the eggs, cream, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of Essence, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, and whisk well to combine.  Add the mushroom mixture and cheeses and stir well.  Add the bread cubes and let sit until the bread has absorbed the liquid, 2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Butter a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with the butter.  Add the bread crumbs, shaking to cover the bottom evenly.  Pour the bread pudding mixture into the prepared pan and cover with aluminum foil.  Bake for 1 hour and uncover.  Continue baking until risen and firm in the center, and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool slightly before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- and
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     3/4           cup  white chocolate chips or pieces
  1               pint  rocky road ice cream -- slightly softened
                        = (or chocolate-chocolate chip ice cream}
                        === MARSHMALLOW ICING ===
  4               cups  mini marshmallows
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Toffee shards -- as garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease an 8-inch square pan with the 2 teaspoons of butter and set aside.

In a medium pot, melt the remaining stick of butter and unsweetened chocolate over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat.

In a mixing bowl, beat together the sugar and eggs.  Slowly add the chocolate mixture and mix well.  Sift the flour and salt into the bowl, and fold into the mixture.  Fold in the vanilla and white chocolate chips, and turn into the prepared pan.  Bake in the middle of the oven until risen and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool in the pan on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before cutting into 2- by 4-inch rectangles.

Cut each brownie rectangle in half lengthwise.  Spread bottom half with 1/2 cup of ice cream, and top with remaining brownie half.  Repeat with remaining brownies and ice cream, and place in freezer to harden slightly, about 30 minutes.

Remove from the freezer and place on dessert plates.  Pour Marshmallow Icing over the top, place 1 toffee shard straight up from the top brownie, and serve.

     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  2             pounds  firm white fish -- cut 4" x 1" x 1/4"
                        strips

  4               cups  shredded mixed green and red cabbage
                        Lime wedges
                        === MEXICAN CHIPOTLE CREMA ===
  1                cup  half-and-half
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  sour cream
  4          teaspoons  chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === SALSA FRESCA ===
  4              large  tomatoes - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- seeded, and
                        roughly chopped
  1                cup  chopped white onions
  5          teaspoons  minced garlic
  4                     Serrano peppers -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and minced
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  chopped fresh cilantro -- garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil and place in the oven until soft and pliant, about 12 minutes.  Remove and keep wrapped until ready to use.

In a large pot or deep fryer, heat the oil to 350 degrees over high heat.

In a large bowl, beat the egg with the milk and water.  Add the flour, Essence, and baking powder, and whisk to make a thin batter.  Dip the fish in the batter, turning to coat, and shake to remove any excess.  Fry in batches in the oil until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels, and season lightly with the Essence.

Stack 2 tortillas together on plates, and top with the fish.  Squeeze with lime juice, and top the fish with cabbage, crema, and salsa to taste.  Garnish with cilantro and serve immediately.

Mexican Chipotle Crema:  In a bowl, mix the half-and-half, cream, and sour cream.  Let crema sit at room temperature for 24 hours to develop culture.

In the bowl of a food processor or blender, combine the cream mixture with the peppers, adobo sauce, and salt.  Process on high speed until smooth.

Serve with the fish tacos or other dishes, as desired.  (Makes about 2 cups)

Salsa Fresca:  Combine all the ingredients and stir well to combine.  Let salsa sit for 30 minutes for the flavors to blend.

Serve as an accompaniment to fish tacos, or other dishes, as desired.  (Makes about 3 cups)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sirloin tip roast - (4 to 5 lbs) -- netted or
                        tied at 1" intervals
  10                    garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        halved lengthwise, plus
  4                     garlic cloves - (to 6) -- peeled
  1         tablespoon  Essence -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1 1/4      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  dry red wine
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  4              large  carrots -- scrubbed
  2                     celery stalks -- trimmed, and
                        cut in half crosswise
  2             medium  yellow onions -- peeled, quartered
  1              pound  small new potatoes
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  beef stock
                        = (or canned low-sodium beef broth)
  2                     bay leaves

With a small, sharp knife, make 30 (1 1/2-inch deep) slits around the outside of the roast.  Insert the half cloves of garlic into the slits.  Rub the roast with 1 tablespoon of the Essence, 1 teaspoon of the black pepper, and 1 teaspoon of the salt.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the roast and sear on all sides, about 4 minutes per side.  Remove from the pan.  Deglaze the pan with the red wine, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  In a mixing bowl, whisk together the tomato paste and 1 cup of water.  Add the tomato paste mixture to the red wine and cook for 2 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a large roasting pan or Dutch oven, alternate the carrots and celery flat on the bottom of the pot.  Place the bay leaves on the vegetables.  Scatter the onions, potatoes, and garlic over the bottom.  (The vegetables will form a "nest" on which the roast will be placed.)  Place the roast on top of the vegetables.  Add the red wine mixture and the stock.  Cover the roasting pan tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 1 1/2 hours.

Uncover the pot roast, baste with the pan juices, and lower the heat to 350 degrees.  Cover the roast and continue cooking until the meat is completely tender and begins to fall apart, 2 to 2 1/2 hours, uncovering and basting each hour.

Remove from the oven, uncover, and baste.  Let rest for 15 minutes before carving.  Serve each portion of the carved roast with onion quarters, new potatoes, 1 carrot, and 1 piece of celery.  Spoon the pan juices over the meat and vegetables, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2              large  apples -- peeled, cored,

     1/3           cup  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  nutmeg
     1/2           cup  roughly-chopped toasted pecans
  4              large  eggs -- beaten
  1                cup  whole milk

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small zucchini -- grated, and
                        squeezed dry in a towel
     1/4           cup  grated yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
  2          teaspoons  chopped lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1                     goat cheese log - (5 oz) -- very thinly sliced
                        === TOMATO SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/3           cup  chopped yellow onions
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped carrots
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1 1/2           cups  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano leaves
  1              pinch  cayenne
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan -- for sprinkling

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine the zucchini, onions, basil, zest, garlic, salt, and pepper.  In a small bowl, combine the flour and baking powder.  Add the eggs and flour mixture to the vegetables and stir just until combined.

Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes.  When hot, add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan.  Add the batter by tablespoons into the skillet (making sure to spoon both batter and vegetables), leaving 1-inch between the cakes.  Immediately drop a round of cheese into the center of each pancake.  Top with another tablespoon of batter to enclose the cheese.  Cook until golden brown on the bottom side, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Flip with a spatula and cook on the 2nd side until golden brown, about 1 minute.  Remove from the pan and place on a baking sheet.  Keep warm in the oven while preparing the remaining pancakes.

Arrange the pancakes on a platter, drizzle with the Tomato Sauce, and serve immediately.

Tomato Sauce:  Heat the oil in a large saucepan over high heat.  Add the onions, carrots, salt, and black pepper and cook, stirring, until the onions are soft, about 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add tomatoes, basil, oregano, and cayenne, and cook for 1 minute.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and fragrant, about 15 minutes.

Remove from the heat and puree in a food processor or blender.  Serve immediately over the Stuffed Zucchini Pancakes, or store, refrigerated, in an airtight container for up to 2 days.  Reheat in a saucepan over low heat.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields about 24 small pancakes; 4 to 6 servings.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, combine the zucchini, onions, basil, zest, garlic, salt, and pepper.  In a small bowl, combine the flour and baking powder.  Add the eggs and flour mixture to the vegetables and stir just until combined.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes.  When hot, add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan.  Add the batter by tablespoons into the skillet (making sure to spoon both batter and vegetables), leaving 1-inch between the cakes.  Immediately drop a round of cheese into the center of each pancake.  Top with another tablespoon of batter to enclose the cheese.  Cook until golden brown on the bottom side, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Flip with a spatula and cook on the 2nd side until golden brown, about 1 minute.  Remove from the pan and place on a baking sheet.  Keep warm in the oven while preparing the remaining pancakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the pancakes on a platter, drizzle with the Tomato Sauce, and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tomato Sauce:  Heat the oil in a large saucepan over high heat.  Add the onions, carrots, salt, and black pepper and cook, stirring, until the onions are soft, about 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add tomatoes, basil, oregano, and cayenne, and cook for 1 minute.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and fragrant, about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the heat and puree in a food processor or blender.  Serve immediately over the Stuffed Zucchini Pancakes, or store, refrigerated, in an airtight container for up to 2 days.  Reheat in a saucepan over low heat.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

<DirT>
This recipe yields about 24 small pancakes; 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Pacific or rock lobsters - -- (1 1/2 to 2 lbs ea)
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3                     poblano chiles
     1/4           cup  chopped white onion
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  lime juice
  1              ounce  tequila
                        Papaya-Avocado Salad -- (see recipe)
  1             Sprigs  fresh cilantro -- garnish

Preheat a grill to medium-high heat.

Fill a large stockpot three-fourths full with salted water and bring to a boil.  Plunge the lobsters headfirst, 2 at a time, into the boiling water and cook, covered, for 3 minutes.  (They will be only partially cooked.)  Transfer with tongs to a large bowl filled with ice water to cool.  Place on a cutting board and with a sharp knife, cleanly cut the lobster in half lengthwise from the head to the tail.  (If female, reserve the roe for another use; discard or reserve the bodies for another use.)

In a skillet, heat the oil over high heat.  Add the chiles, and cook, stirring, until they turn a light color, 4 to 5 minutes, being careful not to let them burn.  Transfer the chiles to a cutting board until cool enough to handle.  Add the onions, garlic, and salt and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Trim and discard the chile stems.  Cut the chiles into pieces and transfer to a blender.  Add the onions, garlic, salt, oil, and lime juice, and process on high speed to make a smooth sauce.  Add the tequila through the feed tube while the machine is running and process until smooth.  Transfer to a small saucepan.

Brush the lobster shells lightly with olive oil and place, shell-side down, on the grill.  Spoon the pepper tequila mixture onto the lobster meat and grill, basting occasionally, until the juices are bubbly and the meat is opaque, about 8 minutes.

Remove from the grill and transfer to plates.  Serve with the Papaya-Avocado Salad and garnish with cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (4 to 4 1/2 lbs) -- giblets removed,
                        and rinsed and patted dry
  4          teaspoons  butter -- cut 4 thin pieces
  1         tablespoon  butter -- softened
                        Leaves from 2 sprigs fresh tarragon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     yellow onion -- peeled, and
                        cut into 8 wedges
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2             sprigs  fresh parsley
  2             sprigs  fresh tarragon
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
                        Herbed Rice Pilaf With Peas -- (see recipe)

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Place the chicken in a small roasting pan.  Slip your fingers between the skin and breast to make a pocket and insert the 4 slivers of butter and tarragon leaves.  Pull the skin back in place.  Rub both sides of the bird lightly with the softened butter.  Season both sides and inside the cavity with salt and pepper.  Arrange the onions and remaining herbs inside the cavity and tie the legs together with kitchen twine.

Roast for 20 minutes breast-side down.  Turn the bird and roast for 20 minutes breast-side up.  Lower the temperature to 375 degrees, turn the bird breast-side down, and roast until golden brown, the juices run clear and an internal thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 170 degrees, about 30 to 45 minutes more.  Remove from the oven and transfer to a platter to rest for 15 minutes.  Tent to keep warm.

Spoon off the fat from the pan juices, and place the roasting pan on 2 stovetop burners over medium heat.  Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil, stirring to deglaze the pan, and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Simmer until reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 3 minutes.

Make a slurry using the white wine and cornstarch.  Whisk the slurry into the hot sauce and bring to a boil to thicken.  Remove from the heat and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Transfer to a gravy boat or decorative bowl.

Carve the chicken and serve with the Herbed Rice Pilaf with Peas, and pan gravy.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Place the chicken in a small roasting pan.  Slip your fingers between the skin and breast to make a pocket and insert the 4 slivers of butter and tarragon leaves.  Pull the skin back in place.  Rub both sides of the bird lightly with the softened butter.  Season both sides and inside the cavity with salt and pepper.  Arrange the onions and remaining herbs inside the cavity and tie the legs together with kitchen twine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast for 20 minutes breast-side down.  Turn the bird and roast for 20 minutes breast-side up.  Lower the temperature to 375 degrees, turn the bird breast-side down, and roast until golden brown, the juices run clear and an internal thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 170 degrees, about 30 to 45 minutes more.  Remove from the oven and transfer to a platter to rest for 15 minutes.  Tent to keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon off the fat from the pan juices, and place the roasting pan on 2 stovetop burners over medium heat.  Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil, stirring to deglaze the pan, and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Simmer until reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make a slurry using the white wine and cornstarch.  Whisk the slurry into the hot sauce and bring to a boil to thicken.  Remove from the heat and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Transfer to a gravy boat or decorative bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Carve the chicken and serve with the Herbed Rice Pilaf with Peas, and pan gravy.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  chopped yellow onions
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1 1/2           cups  basmati rice
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  warm water -- about 110 degrees
  2            packets  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz ea)
  4        tablespoons  granulated sugar -- divided
  5               cups  all-purpose flour - (to 6)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  yellow cornmeal
                        === OPTIONAL TOPPINGS ===
     1/2           cup  lightly-toasted chopped onions -- (2 tspns ea)
  2        tablespoons  poppy seeds -- (abt 1/2 tspn ea)
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- (abt 1/2 tspn ea)
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt -- (abt 1/4 tspn ea)

Combine the water, yeast, and 3 tablespoons of the sugar in the bowl of an upright mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Stir and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.  Gradually add 4 cups of the flour and the salt, and mix until the mixture comes together.

Add 1 to 1 1/2 cups additional flour 1/2 cup at a time to make a stiff dough, either stirring with the wooden spoon or working with your hands.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and no longer sticky, about 5 minutes, adding just as much flour as needed.  (Dough should be heavier and stiffer than regular yeast bread dough.)

Grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon of the oil.  Place the dough in the bowl, turning to coat.  Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until almost doubled, about 1 hour.

Remove from the bowl and punch down the dough.  Divide into 12 equal pieces, about 2 to 3 ounces each, measuring about 4 inches across.  Form each piece of dough into a ball.  Roll each ball into a 4- to 6-inch log.  Join the ends and place fingers through the hole and roll the ends together.  Repeat with the remaining dough.  Place on a lightly greased surface, cover with a clean cloth, and let rest until risen but not doubled in a draft-free spot, 20 to 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Grease a baking sheet with the remaining teaspoon of oil.

In a large, heavy pot, bring 12 cups of water and the remaining tablespoon of sugar to a boil.  In batches, add the bagels to the water and boil, turning, for 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Flip bagels onto the prepared sheet pan.  Bake for 5 minutes, turn over and cook for another 30 to 35 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack.

This recipe yields 12 bagels.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  salt
     1/4           cup  Essence -- plus
  2        tablespoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/3           cup  honey
  1                     lemon -- zested
  1              quart  buttermilk
  1              whole  chicken -- cut into 8 pieces
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Peanut oil -- for frying

Combine salt, 1/4 cup of the Essence, the honey and the lemon zest in a large plastic container or non-reactive stockpot.  Whisk in the buttermilk and stir until salt is dissolved and honey is fully incorporated.  Immerse chicken and refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to 24 hours.

Combine flour, remaining 2 tablespoons Essence and black pepper in a large plastic or doubled brown paper bag; shake to combine.  Drop 1/2 of the chicken pieces into flour mixture and shake excess flour from each piece.  Repeat coating with remaining chicken pieces.  Place coated chicken pieces on a large wire rack, set over a sheet tray and let rest, at room temperature for 20 minutes.

Heat 4 inches of oil to 375 degrees in a large cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven.  Adjust oven rack to middle position and set a second wire rack over a second baking sheet.  Place baking sheet in oven and preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Line 2 large plates with a double layer of paper towels.

Fry the chicken in batches, skin-side down, until golden brown, about 8 minutes.  Turn pieces over and continue to fry until chicken pieces are golden brown on second side, about 8 to 10 minutes longer.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Using tongs, transfer to oven while you cook the remaining pieces.

Return oil to 375 degrees and fry remaining pieces.  (Note: an even oil temperature is the key to the success of this recipe; a clip-on candy or deep-frying thermometer should be kept in the pot at all times, and the temperature should remain no lower than 325 degrees.)

Serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3 1/2           cups  corn kernels
                        = (from 4 ears fresh white or yellow corn)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RANCHERO SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1                cup  chopped white onions
     1/2           cup  chopped red bell pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped green bell pepper
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1         tablespoon  minced jalapeÒo
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  chopped tomatoes and their juice
  1                cup  chicken stock
  3        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  4              large  corn tortillas
     1/2           cup  warm refried beans
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  8              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  pepper Jack

To make the Ranchero Sauce, in a medium pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and bell peppers, and cook, stirring, for 3 to 5 minutes.  Add the cumin, salt, cayenne, jalapeÒo, and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the tomatoes and their juices and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the stock and simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the cilantro.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, and cover to keep warm.

In a large skillet, heat 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable oil over medium-high heat.  Add 1 tortilla and cook until warmed through and just starting to brown about 30 seconds.  Turn and cook on the second side.  Remove, cover to keep warm, and repeat with the remaining oil and tortillas.

In 2 medium skillets, melt 1 tablespoon of butter each, over medium-high heat.  Break 4 eggs into each skillet and fry until beginning to set, about 1 minute.  Sprinkle the eggs with the cheese and cover to finish cooking, about 1 1/2 minutes.

Place 1 warm tortilla on each of 4 plates and spread each with 2 tablespoons of warm refried beans.  Place 2 eggs on top of each tortilla and top with the warm Ranchero Sauce.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  button mushrooms
  1             medium  yellow onion -- peeled
  1              large  green or red bell pepper
  1 1/2         pounds  beef sirloin -- fat trimmed by
                        the butcher or an adult
  1         tablespoon  Baby Bam -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
                        Wood or metal skewers

Place the mushrooms in a large bowl of water and gently turn to remove any grit or dirt.  Dry on a clean kitchen towel and set aside.

Cut the onion in half.  Cut each half into quarters, keeping the pieces together as much as possible.  Remove the upper fourth of the bell pepper.  Remove the stem end, inside ribs, and seeds.  Cut the pepper into quarters crosswise, then into 1-inch pieces.

Cut the meat into 1-inch pieces and place in a large glass bowl.  Add the Baby Bam and toss to coat.  Add the Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, vegetable oil, and garlic, and stir to combine.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and place the oven rack in the top position.  Line the baking sheet with aluminum foil.

Remove the meat from the refrigerator.  Thread 1 meat cube onto a skewer, followed by a mushroom, bell pepper, and onion.  Continue threading alternating ingredients onto the skewer until the skewer is full.  Place the filled skewers on the baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes for medium.

          Kiawe Wood-Smoked Pork Chops With Green Apple Chutney

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Green Apple Chutney -- (see recipe)
                        = (or use good-quality storebought)
  4                     double-cut bone-in pork chops - (16 oz ea)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1         tablespoon  Kiawe wood chips - (to 2) -- see comments
  2                     mirlitons -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" thick lengthwise slices
  2        tablespoons  vegetable or olive oil
  4               cups  apple cider
                        Peels and cores from 6 Granny Smith apples -- reserved from
                        making the Chutney
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce

Make the Green Apple Chutney and allow to cool.  Reserve the peels and cores from the Granny Smith apples to make the apple-soy glaze.

Season each pork chop with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of the Essence.

Place the kiawe wood chips in the bottom of a stovetop smoker and position the smoking rack on top of the chips.  Close the smoker and set over medium-high heat until smoke begins to appear.  Working quickly, open the lid of the smoker and position the pork chops on top of the smoking rack.  Close the top of the smoker and continue smoking the pork chops over medium-high heat for 5 minutes.  After 5 minutes, turn off the heat and allow the pork chops to smoke in the stovetop smoker, undisturbed, for 20 minutes.

Prepare a grill.

While the pork chops are smoking, grill or saute the merliton slices.  Combine the merliton slices with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, remaining 1/4 teaspoon of pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of Essence and toss to combine.  Grill over high heat for about 3 minutes on each side, or until slightly charred and tender.  Transfer to a serving platter, cover with foil and set aside.

Make the soy-apple glaze by combining the apple cider and the reserved apple peels and cores to a large saucepan and cooking until reduced to about 1/2 cup, and sauce is thick and syrupy, 30 to 40 minutes.  Strain the syrup over a fine meshed sieve and discard the apple peels and cores.  Add the soy sauce to the syrup and stir to combine.  Transfer to a small bowl and set aside to cool.

When the chops have smoked for 20 minutes, remove them from the stovetop smoker and brush on both sides with the remaining oil.  Grill for about 10 minutes on each side for medium.  Serve immediately, with the grilled merliton slices and the Green Apple Chutney and drizzled with the apple-soy glaze.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Kiawe (pronounced kee ah vay) wood is often used in Hawaii in grilling both meat and seafood.  The flavor of the smoke is strong, somewhat akin to mesquite.

     1/2           cup  chopped red or yellow bell pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped rinsed fresh limu or ogo seaweed
     1/4           cup  minced green onions
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  minced Hawaiian chile pepper
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  4               cups  assorted greens
  4                     avocados -- halved, peeled,
                        and seeded
                        === TARO ROOT CHIPS ===
  2             pounds  taro -- peeled, and
                        cut into very thin rounds
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
                        Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)

Combine all the ingredients except the greens, avocados, and chips in a large bowl and mix well.  Refrigerate, covered, until ready to serve.

Divide the greens among 8 plates and top with one avocado half.  Spoon a generous 1/2-cup of poke in each avocado half and serve with Taro Root Chips.

Taro Root Chips:  In a large, deep wok or pot, heat the oil to 360 degrees.  Add the taro rounds in batches and stir to prevent them from sticking.  Cook until just golden brown, about 45 seconds.  Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.  Sprinkle with Essence while still hot.  Repeat with the remaining chips.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf French or Italian bread - -- (abt 22" long)
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  olive or vegetable oil
     3/4         pound  fresh mild or spicy Italian sausage -- removed from casing
  1                cup  thinly-sliced yellow onion
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green bell pepper
  1              pinch  crushed red pepper
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.

Using a serrated bread knife, cut the bread in half lengthwise.  Lay the two halves of bread cut-side up on the lined baking sheet.

In a small mixing bowl combine the butter, olive oil, grated Parmesan, Essence, garlic, parsley, and salt and mix well with a rubber spatula or fork.  Spread the butter mixture evenly onto the two halves of bread.  Place on the baking sheet and bake until just starting to get bubbly but not brown, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the sausage and cook, stirring and breaking up with a large wooden spoon, until cooked through and the fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Add the onions, peppers, and red pepper, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat, add the sausage back to the pan, and stir well.

Spread the sausage mixture evenly over the bottom half of the French bread and cover with the top half.  Wrap in aluminum foil and return to the oven to warm through and for the flavors to blend, 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove bread from the oven, slice and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                        frozen hash brown potatoes -- thawed, and
                        squeezed dry in towels
  1         tablespoon  melted butter
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/4           cup  finely-grated Parmesan
  8             ounces  hot Italian sausage -- removed from
                        casings, crumbled and cooked
  1                cup  thinly-sliced onions
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  4             ounces  green chiles -- roasted, skins and
                        seeds removed, and chopped
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  milk
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  grated smoked Gouda
     1/2           cup  grated Cheddar
     1/2                red bell pepper -- ribs and seeds
                        removed, and cut into thin rings

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

In a bowl, combine the potatoes, melted butter and Essence, and toss to combine.  Add the cheese and toss to combine.  Press the potato mixture into a 9-inch round glass pan, spreading to evenly cover the bottom and sides.  Bake until the potatoes are golden brown, about 25 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack.

Reduce the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large skillet, cook the sausage over medium-high heat, stirring with a spoon to break up the meat, until browned, about 4 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat.

To the fat, add the onions and cook, stirring, until caramelized, 10 to 12 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the chiles and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

In a bowl, whisk the eggs.  Add the milk, cream, hot sauce, salt, and pepper, and whisk until creamy.  Add the cheeses and whisk to combine.

Spread the sausage mixture evenly across the potato crust.  Pour the egg-cheese mixture over the filling.  Arrange the bell pepper rings across the top.  Bake until the custard is set, puffed and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes before serving.  Cut into even slices and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  sliced yellow onions
  1             medium  zucchini -- chopped
     1/4         pound  mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and sliced
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  4             ounces  oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes -- drained, chopped
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/4           cups  half-and-half
     1/2           cup  grated Gruyere
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  3             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
                        === SAVORY PIE CRUST ===
  8             ounces  flour
                        = (abt 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tbspns)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4             ounces  cold butter - (1 stick) -- cut 1/4" pieces
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  3        tablespoons  ice water

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a large skillet melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and zucchini and cook, stirring, for 6 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until the liquid is rendered and the vegetables are wilted, about 10 minutes.

Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.

Add the tomatoes, basil, and thyme and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

In a bowl, beat the eggs and half-and-half together.  Add the salt, pepper, grated Gruyere, and crushed red pepper.

Spoon the vegetable mixture into the prepared Savory Pie Crust, pour in the egg mixture, and crumble the goat cheese on top.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until set.  Remove from the oven and let cool for 30 minutes before serving.

Savory Pie Crust:  Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl.  Incorporate the butter and shortening by hand, working the fat into the flour with your fingertips until the dough starts to come together and form small pea shapes.  Work the ice water into the dough until it just comes together, being careful not to over mix.

Form the crust into a disk shape, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to rest for at least 30 minutes.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface and roll out into an 11-inch circle.  Fit into a 9-inch pie pan, trimming any excess and crimping the edges to fit the pan.  Cover the bottom with parchment paper and pie weights or uncooked beans, and bake for 12 minutes.  Remove from the oven and uncover.  Let cool slightly on a wire rack before filling.  (Makes 1 crust)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground beef
     1/2         pound  ground pork
  1                cup  finely-chopped onions
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped green bell peppers
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2                     eggs
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  bread crumbs - (to 1)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        Vegetable oil
  8             ounces  chorizo -- halved crosswise
  1                cup  bottled chili sauce -- (optional)

Preheat the grill, or an oven to 350 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, combine the beef, pork, onion, bell pepper, garlic, eggs, cream, bread crumbs, salt, pepper and Essence, and stir with a wooden spoon to blend thoroughly.  Divide the mixture into fourths.  Form 2 pieces into a loaf shape about 9 by 4 inches.  Lay one sausage down the middle of each loaf.  Mold the remaining 2 meatloaf portions over and around the sausages to cover it completely, and seal into 2 oblong loaves.

Rub the entire surface of the meatloaf with vegetable oil and make sure the grill is well oiled.  Place on the hot grill and brown on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side, turning with spatulas.  Transfer to the rack above the grill, and top each meatloaf with 1/2 cup chili sauce.  Close the grill lid and cook until the meatloaves reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees, about 45 minutes.

Remove from the grill and transfer to a cutting board or serving platter and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.  (Alternately, the meatloaves can be placed on a lightly greased baking sheet and roasted in a preheated 350 degree oven until an internal temperature of 160 degrees is reached, about 45 minutes to 1 hour, basting occasionally with the pan juices.)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  4                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
  1                cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  rum
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1                     egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  milk
                        Banana Chocolate Ice Cream -- (see recipe)

For the dough:  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large bowl.  Add the butter and shortening.  Rub the fats between your fingertips and thumbs, or use a pastry blender, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  One tablespoon at a time, work in enough ice water just until the dough comes together, being careful not to over-mix.

Shape into a smooth ball of dough, flatten into a disk, and wrap in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 days.

When ready to use, sprinkle a little flour on a smooth work surface, and using a rolling pin or dowel, roll the pie dough into a large circle about 1/8-inch thick.  Use a cookie cutter or small knife to cut 6 (6-inch) rounds into the dough.  Place the pie dough rounds on a parchment lined baking sheet and place in the refrigerator to cool.

For the filling:  In a large saute pan set over a medium-high heat, add the butter and melt.  Place the apples in the saute pan and cook for 1 minute.  Add the sugar, cinnamon, and rum to the pan and cook for 2 minutes more.  While the apples are cooking, make a slurry out of the cornstarch and lemon juice and add it to the apples.  Continue to cook for 1 minute and remove from the heat.  Place the apples on a parchment lined sheet pan to cool.

When the apples are sufficiently cool enough to handle, remove the pie dough rounds from the refrigerator.  Divide the apples evenly between the rounds.  Be sure to place the apples on only half of the round to allow space to fold the other half over the first.  Once you fold the dough over, pinch the edges together and then crimp the edges with the tines of a fork.  Make a slit in the top of the turnover to act as a vent for the steam.  Whisk the egg yolk and milk together and brush the turnovers with the egg wash.  Place the turnovers in the refrigerator to cool.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

When the oven is hot, put the turnovers in the oven and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove from the oven and serve either hot, or when cooled.  Serve with Banana Chocolate Ice Cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BAGEL DOUGH ===
  2               cups  warm water -- about 110 degrees
  2            packets  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz ea)
  4        tablespoons  granulated sugar -- divided
  5               cups  all-purpose flour - (to 6)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  yellow cornmeal
  1              large  egg yolk -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water
                        === CRAWFISH BAGELS ===
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  yellow cornmeal
  8             ounces  cooked crawfish tails -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped red bell peppers
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
     1/2           cup  grated white cheddar

Bagel Dough:  Combine the water, yeast, and 3 tablespoons of the sugar in a large bowl.  Stir and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.  Gradually add 4 cups of the flour and the salt, and stir well with a large wooden spoon until the mixture comes together.

Add 1 to 1 1/2 cups additional flour 1/2 cup at a time to make a stiff dough, either stirring with the wooden spoon or working with your hands.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and no longer sticky, about 5 minutes, adding just as much flour as needed.  (Dough should be heavier and stiffer than regular yeast bread dough.)

Grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon of the oil.  Place the dough in the bowl, turning to coat.  Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until almost doubled, about 1 hour.

Crawfish Bagels:  Lightly grease a large baking sheet with the vegetable oil, sprinkle lightly with the cornmeal, and set aside.  In a bowl, toss the crawfish with the Essence.

In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the green onions, bell peppers, and garlic, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the parsley and thyme, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the crawfish mixture and let sit until cool, about 10 minutes.  Add the cheeses and stir to combine.

Roll and pull the dough into a rectangle measuring about 14 by 18 inches and let rest for 5 minutes.  Sprinkle the crawfish filling evenly over the dough.  Roll the dough into a log and knead to incorporate the crawfish mixture, about 1 minute.

Divide dough into pieces about 2 to 3 ounces each, measuring about 4 inches across.  As needed, knead the crawfish filling into each bagel before shaping.  Roll each piece of dough into a ball, then stick an index finger through the middle to make a hole.  Smooth the top and sides, and pull the sides apart gently to enlarge the hole.  Repeat with the remaining dough.  Place the bagels on the prepared baking sheet, 1-inch apart.  Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise for 20 to 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Grease a baking sheet with the remaining teaspoon of oil.

In a large, heavy pot, bring 12 cups of water and the remaining tablespoon of sugar to a boil.  In batches, add the bagels to the water and boil, turning, for 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Place on the prepared baking sheet and brush with the egg glaze.  Bake until golden brown and crusty, about 35 to 40 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack.

This recipe yields 12 bagels.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     lamb shanks - (1 lb ea)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  turmeric
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced yellow onions
  1                cup  large diced carrots
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1              pound  sweet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" pieces
  2               cups  dry red wine
  1                cup  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
  4               cups  lamb stock
                        = (or chicken stock)
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
                        Pistachio-Mint Couscous -- (see recipe)

Season the shanks generously on all sides with the salt and black pepper, and lightly with the turmeric.  Place the flour on a large plate.  Dredge the shanks in the flour and shake to remove any excess.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a Dutch oven or large, heavy saute pan over high heat.  Add the shanks and sear until well-browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove the shanks.

Add the remaining teaspoon of oil, then the cinnamon, cumin, ginger, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the onions and carrots and cook, stirring, until the onions are starting to color, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 minutes.

Add the potatoes and cook for 1 minute.  Add the wine and stir to deglaze the pan, cook until reduced slightly, 3 to 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.

Return the shanks to the pot, add the stock, cilantro, parsley, orange juice, and orange peel, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover with the lid slightly ajar, and simmer until the shanks are tender and the meat starts to fall from the bones, 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours, skimming occasionally to remove any scum that forms on the surface.

Remove from the heat.  Divide the Pistachio-Mint Couscous among 4 plates and top with the lamb shanks.  Drizzle with the sauce and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Season the shanks generously on all sides with the salt and black pepper, and lightly with the turmeric.  Place the flour on a large plate.  Dredge the shanks in the flour and shake to remove any excess.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a Dutch oven or large, heavy saute pan over high heat.  Add the shanks and sear until well-browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove the shanks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the remaining teaspoon of oil, then the cinnamon, cumin, ginger, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the onions and carrots and cook, stirring, until the onions are starting to color, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the potatoes and cook for 1 minute.  Add the wine and stir to deglaze the pan, cook until reduced slightly, 3 to 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the shanks to the pot, add the stock, cilantro, parsley, orange juice, and orange peel, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover with the lid slightly ajar, and simmer until the shanks are tender and the meat starts to fall from the bones, 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours, skimming occasionally to remove any scum that forms on the surface.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the heat.  Divide the Pistachio-Mint Couscous among 4 plates and top with the lamb shanks.  Drizzle with the sauce and serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPONGE CAKE ===
     1/4           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
  8              large  eggs
  1                cup  sugar -- plus

  3               cups  heavy cream
  2               cups  milk
  1                     vanilla bean -- split
  12             large  egg yolks
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  chopped white chocolate
                        Broken Pecan Praline -- (listed below)
                        === PECAN PRALINES ===
  1                cup  light brown sugar
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                cup  pecan halves
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
     1/2           cup  almond liqueur -- plus
  4          teaspoons  almond liqueur
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  2 3/4           cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  6              large  chocolate-toffee bars -- frozen

Sponge Cake:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a small saucepan, warm the milk and 2 teaspoons butter together over medium-low heat.

With an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip, beat the eggs and 1 cup of the sugar on medium-high speed until the mixture is pale yellow and thick, and has tripled in volume, about 8 minutes.  With the mixer on low, beat in the warm milk mixture.

Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium-size mixing bowl.  Fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture and blend thoroughly until smooth.  Add the vanilla and mix gently.

Grease a 17- by 12-inch baking pan or jellyroll pan with 2 teaspoons butter.  Sprinkle evenly with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.  Pour the batter into the pan, spreading it evenly.  Bake until the cake springs back when touched, about 15 minutes.  Cool for about 2 minutes, then gently flip it out onto a large wire rack or a large sheet of parchment paper.  Let cool completely.

White Chocolate Praline Ice Cream:  Combine the cream and the milk in a large heavy saucepan.  Scrape the vanilla bean seeds into the cream mixture and add the bean pod.  Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.

Whisk the yolks and sugar in a medium bowl.  In a slow and steady stream, whisk 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture.  Gradually whisk the egg mixture back into the saucepan.

Add the white chocolate to the custard, and stir constantly over medium-low heat until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes.

Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof medium bowl.  Cover the mixture with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap against the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming.  Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours.

Pour the chilled custard into an ice cream machine.  Churn according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Remove from ice cream machine and fold in the broken Pecan Pralines. Place in the freezer and freeze until frozen, about 2 hours.

Pecan Pralines:  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the light brown sugar, granulated sugar, heavy cream, butter, and water.  Place over a medium-high heat and stir constantly until the pralines reach the softball stage, 238 to 240 degrees.  Add the pecans to the candy, and pull the pan off of the stove.  Continue to stir the candy vigorously with a wooden spoon until the candy cools, and the pecans remain suspended in the candy, about 2 minutes.  Spoon the pralines out onto a parchment or aluminum foil lined sheet pan and cool completely before serving.

Assembly:   Cut the sponge cake into 3 equal pieces to fit into the bottom of a 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan.  Line the loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving an overhang over the sides.  Lay 1 piece of cake flat in the pan.  Sprinkle about 2 1/2 tablespoons of liqueur evenly over the cake.  Spread one-third of the softened ice cream over the cake, smoothing the top with a rubber spatula and top with another cake layer.  Repeat the process, working carefully to create 3 layers of cake soaked with liqueur and ice cream on top.  Wrap with the plastic wrap and place in the freezer to firm up the ice cream, 1 to 2 hours.

To make the caramel sauce, in a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and water, and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved.  Continue cooking until amber in color, about 7 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally.  Remove from the heat and slowly add 3/4 cup of the cream.  Return to low heat and stir until the sauce is smooth, about 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and add 2 teaspoons of the almond liqueur.  Let rest until cool but still liquid, about 40 minutes.

In a bowl, whip the remaining 2 cups of cream until stiff peaks start to form.  Add the powdered sugar and whip into stiff peaks.  Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of liqueur and whip to incorporate.

Place the frozen toffee bars in a plastic bag and smash into pieces with a mallet or rolling pin.

Remove the layered ice cream cake from the freezer.  Lift from the loaf pan and remove the plastic wrap.  Place the cake on a platter.  Spread the whipped cream over the top and sides of the cake.  Sprinkle the top and sides with the broken Heath bar pieces and drizzle the cake with the caramel sauce.

To serve, slice into 1-inch thick servings with a knife dipped in hot water.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Whisking constantly, drizzle in the melted butter a bit at a time until is added and an emulsion forms.  Remove from the heat.  Add the orange juice, chipotle, and lemon juice and whisk to incorporate.  Adjust seasoning, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Cover and keep warm until ready to serve.

Shrimp:  Preheat the fryer to 360 degrees.

Season the flour with Essence.  Beat the eggs together with the milk and season with essence.  Dredge the shrimp in the flour, shaking off any excess.  Dip the shrimp in the egg wash and then the panko crumbs.  Fry until golden brown and cooked through.

Serve fried shrimp on a bed of greens, drizzled with Hollandaise.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  Baby Bam -- (see recipe)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  grated cheddar - (2 oz)
  14                    fully-cooked cocktail sausages
                        === OPTIONAL CONDIMENTS ===
                        Ketchup
                        Mustard
                        Chili sauce
                        Cheese sauce

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and make sure the oven rack is in the center position.

Lightly grease the corn-shaped wells of the cast-iron pan with 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil.  Place the pan in the oven to preheat (pan should heat in the oven at least 15 minutes).

While the pan is heating, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, cornmeal, flour, baking powder, Baby Bam, salt, buttermilk, egg, and cheddar in a mixing bowl and stir with a fork until just combined.  Carefully remove the hot pan from the oven and spoon about 3 tablespoons of the batter into each well.  (This will use up only half of the batter.)  Lay 2 cocktail sausages down the center of each well.  Spoon the remaining batter into each well, dividing evenly between the wells, completely covering the sausages.  Bake until golden brown, about 18 minutes.

Remove pan from the oven and let sit for 3 to 5 minutes before turning the muffins out of the pan.  Serve hot, with desired condiments for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     dried pasilla chiles
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped white onions
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  roughly-chopped fresh cilantro -- plus
                        more for garnish
     1/4           cup  roughly-chopped fresh parsley
  1 3/4           cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  long-grain white rice

Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chilies and toast 2 at a time to blister the skin, turning, about 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat and soak in a bowl of water until soft, about 15 minutes.  Remove the stems, skins, and seeds, and discard.  Roughly chop the chiles.

In a medium saucepan, heat 1 1/2 teaspoons of the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and chiles and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, cumin, salt, cilantro and parsley, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a blender with 1/2 cup of the stock.  Process on high speed until smooth.

Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the pan over medium heat.  Add the rice and cook, stirring, until translucent, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the puree and cook, stirring, to evaporate most of the liquid, about 2 minutes.  Add the remaining stock, stir and cover, and lower the heat to medium-low.  Simmer without stirring, until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let sit without stirring for 10 to 15 minutes.  Fluff with a fork and serve, garnished with additional cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  4              large  russet or kinnebec potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" by 1/4" thick batons
  2             quarts  peanut oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Rinse cut potatoes in a large bowl with lots of cold running water until water becomes clear.  Cover with water by 1-inch and cover with ice.  Refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 2 days.

In a 5-quart pot or Dutch oven fitted with a candy or deep-frying thermometer, (or in an electric deep fryer), heat oil over medium-low heat until the thermometer registers 325 degrees.  Make sure that you have at least 3 inches of space between the top of the oil and the top of the pan, as fries will bubble up when they are added.

Drain ice water from cut fries and wrap potato pieces in a clean dishcloth or tea towel and thoroughly pat dry.  Increase the heat to medium-high and add fries, a handful at a time, to the hot oil.  Fry, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are soft and limp and begin to turn a blond color, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Using a skimmer or a slotted spoon, carefully remove fries from the oil and set aside to drain on paper towels.  Let rest for at least 10 minutes or up to 2 hours.

When ready to serve the French fries, reheat the oil to 350 degrees.  Transfer the blanched potatoes to the hot oil and fry again, stirring frequently, until golden brown and puffed, about 1 minute.  Transfer to paper lined platter and sprinkle with salt and pepper, to taste.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  red beets -- stems and
                        leaves removed
  1                cup  apple cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
     1/8      teaspoon  pickling spice
  6              large  hard-boiled eggs -- peeled
  1              small  yellow onion -- peeled, sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, smashed
                        Fresh dill sprigs -- for garnish
                        Sliced French bread -- as an accompaniment

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Wrap the beets tightly in aluminum foil and roast until tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Remove from the oven, uncover, and let sit until cool enough to handle.  When cool, slip the skins from the beets and cut into eighths.

Add the eggs, onions, garlic, and beets and turn to coat evenly.  Cover tightly and refrigerate, turning occasionally, until the eggs are a deep pink color, at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours.

To serve, remove the eggs, beets, and onions from the marinade and arrange on a platter.  Garnish with sprigs of dill and serve with sliced French bread.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  dry crab boil spices
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1                     lemon -- quartered

     3/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled, crushed
  1                     bay leaf
  1              large  sweet onion -- peeled, and

  1                     lemon -- thinly sliced, plus

In a large bowl, combine the Creole mustard, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes.  Whisk in the vinegar to combine.

Toss with the onions and lemon slices to evenly distribute.

Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours before serving.

Preheat a grill.  Prepare pizza dough and roll out into 4 (6-inch) rounds.  Brush the dough with oil and place on the grill.  Cook for about 3 minutes per side, until cooked through.  Chop arugula and toss with olive oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper.  Place the arugula on top of the pizza dough and top with shrimp.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

         Pork Medallions In Mustard-Green Peppercorn Cream Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  8                     pork medallions - (4 oz ea)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  crushed drained green peppercorns
                        === MATCHSTICK POTATOES ===
     1/2         pound  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled
     1/2         pound  sweet potatoes -- peeled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley -- garnish

In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Season both sides of the pork lightly with the salt and pepper.  Add the medallions to the pan and cook for 2 1/2 minutes on the first side and 2 minutes on the second side.  Transfer to a large plate and cover to keep warm.

Add 1 tablespoon of butter to the skillet, and when foamy, add the shallots and garlic.  Cook, stirring, until soft, 1 minute.  Add the white wine and simmer until reduced to 3 tablespoons, about 4 minutes.  Add the cream, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by half, about 4 minutes.

Reduce the heat to medium and add the mustard, whisking to incorporate.  Add the remaining tablespoon of butter, whisking to incorporate.  Stir in the green peppercorns.  Return the pork medallions and any accumulated juices to the pan and cook until the meat is just warmed through, about 30 seconds.

To serve, divide the potatoes among the 4 plates.  Arrange 2 medallions on each plate and top with sauce.  Garnish each serving with parsley and serve.

Matchstick Potatoes:  Preheat a fryer to 365 degrees.

Using a mandolin, cut the potatoes into thin matchsticks.  Fry separately, in batches, until golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                           Potato And Leek Soup

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  leek - (abt 1 lb)
                        = (or 2 small leeks)
  2                     bay leaves
  20                    black peppercorns
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     strips bacon -- chopped
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  5               cups  chicken stock
  1              pound  russet potatoes - (to 1 1/4) -- diced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2           cup  creme fraiche or heavy cream - (to 3/4)
  2        tablespoons  snipped chives

Trim the green portions of the leek and, using 2 of the largest and longest leaves, make a bouquet garni by folding the 2 leaves around the bay leaves, peppercorns and thyme.  Tie into a package-shaped bundle with kitchen twine and set aside.  (Alternately, tie 2 leek leaves, bay leaves, peppercorns and thyme together in a piece of cheesecloth.)

Using a sharp knife, halve the white part of the leek lengthwise and rinse well under cold running water to rid the leek of any sand.  Slice thinly crosswise and set aside.

In a large soup pot over medium heat, melt the butter and add the bacon.  Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the bacon is very soft and has rendered most of its fat.  Add the chopped leeks and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes.  Add the wine and bring to a boil.  Add the reserved bouquet garni, chicken stock, potatoes, salt and white pepper, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are falling apart and the soup is very flavorful.

Remove the bouquet garni and, working in batches, puree the soup in a food processor or blender.  (Alternately, if you own an immersion blender, puree the soup directly in the pot.)  Stir in the creme fraiche and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.  Serve immediately, with some of the snipped chives sprinkled over the top of each bowl of soup.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 quarts soup, or about 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Armagnac or Cognac -- more as needed
  1              pound  pitted prunes
  1              large  egg
     1/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  sifted all-purpose flour
  1                cup  heavy cream -- plus
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
                        === SWEET TART CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  4          teaspoons  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              stick  cold unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  3        tablespoons  ice water
                        Powdered sugar -- as garnish

In a saucepan, warm the Armagnac over medium heat.  Remove from the heat, add the prunes, and let steep, stirring occasionally, until softened, 1 to 2 hours.  Drain and reserve the steeping liquid.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a bowl, beat the egg with 1/3 cup of the sugar until thick, about 2 minutes.  Add the flour and 1 cup cream, and beat well.  Add 3 tablespoons of the reserved prune soaking liquid and beat well.

Arrange the prunes in the bottom of the prepared tart shell.  Pour the cream mixture over the top and bake until risen and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

In a bowl, whip 3/4 cup cream with an electric mixer until soft peaks just start to form.  Add the remaining tablespoon of sugar and 1 to 2 tablespoons of the remaining prune liquid, and whip until soft peaks form.  Transfer to a decorative bowl.

To serve, sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve with the Armagnac cream on the side.

For the Sweet Tart Crust:  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large mixing bowl.  Add the butter pieces and shortening, and work with your fingertips until it comes together and forms small pea shapes.  Work the ice water into the dough until it just comes together, being careful not to overmix.  Form the crust into a disk shape, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to rest for at least 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll into an 11-inch circle.  Transfer to a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, trim any excess dough, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Remove from the refrigerator and cover the bottom with a sheet of parchment paper and layer of pie weights or uncooked beans.  Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove the parchment and beans, and cook until the crust has just colored and is set, about 10 minutes.

Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) tart, 6 to 8 servings.

In a saucepan, warm the Armagnac over medium heat.  Remove from the heat, add the prunes, and let steep, stirring occasionally, until softened, 1 to 2 hours.  Drain and reserve the steeping liquid.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl, beat the egg with 1/3 cup of the sugar until thick, about 2 minutes.  Add the flour and 1 cup cream, and beat well.  Add 3 tablespoons of the reserved prune soaking liquid and beat well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the prunes in the bottom of the prepared tart shell.  Pour the cream mixture over the top and bake until risen and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl, whip 3/4 cup cream with an electric mixer until soft peaks just start to form.  Add the remaining tablespoon of sugar and 1 to 2 tablespoons of the remaining prune liquid, and whip until soft peaks form.  Transfer to a decorative bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve with the Armagnac cream on the side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Sweet Tart Crust:  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large mixing bowl.  Add the butter pieces and shortening, and work with your fingertips until it comes together and forms small pea shapes.  Work the ice water into the dough until it just comes together, being careful not to overmix.  Form the crust into a disk shape, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to rest for at least 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll into an 11-inch circle.  Transfer to a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, trim any excess dough, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Remove from the refrigerator and cover the bottom with a sheet of parchment paper and layer of pie weights or uncooked beans.  Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove the parchment and beans, and cook until the crust has just colored and is set, about 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) tart, 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     red bell pepper - (abt 8 oz)
  4 1/2      teaspoons  minced shallots
  5                     fresh cilantro leaves -- roughly chopped
  2                     fresh basil leaves
  1           teaspoon  garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  ground white pepper
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, about 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler, or on top of a gas or charcoal grill.)  Place the blackened peppers in a plastic or paper bag, and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.  Peel the peppers, remove the seeds and stems and roughly chop.

Combine the peppers, shallots, cilantro, basil, garlic, crushed red pepper, vinegar, salt, and pepper in the bowl of food processor or blender, and process for 20 seconds.  With the machine running, add the oil through the feed tube in a steady stream and process until thick and smooth.  Drizzle into soups, and transfer any remaining into an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

This recipe yields about 3/4 cup.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     pork butts - (4 to 5 lbs ea)
                        Essence -- as needed
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        Homemade Barbecue Sauce -- (see recipe)
  8               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
  10             large  baking potatoes -- like russets,
                        peeled, and
                        cut into thin sticks
                        Salt -- as needed
  1                     loaf French bread - (6 feet long)
  1 1/2           cups  mayonnaise
  1 1/2           cups  Creole mustard

Place the pork butts in one or two large baking dishes and season evenly with Essence.  Cover with plastic and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.

Preheat and oven to 225 degrees.

Bring the pork to room temperature and place in a large roasting pan, fat-side up.  Smoke, or slow cook in the oven until tender and falling apart, and the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees.  (The cooking should take 6 to 8 hours.)  Remove from the oven and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes.

With a knife and fork, or two forks, pull apart the meat into small slices or chunks.  Toss with the barbecue sauce, to taste.

In a deep fryer, or large pot over medium-high heat, heat the oil to 360 degrees.

Add the potatoes in batches and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes, stirring to brown evenly.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Season with Essence and salt.

Slice the bread in half lengthwise.  Spread the mayonnaise on one half, and the mustard on the other.  Lay the pork along the bottom half of bread and top with the French fries.  Top with the remaining bread half, and cut into servings.

Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FLAKY BUTTER CRUST ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into pieces
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  ice water -- or more as needed
                        === TART FILLING ===
  4             slices  apple wood-smoked bacon -- diced
                        = (or other aromatic, thick cut bacon)
  8                     leeks -- white portions only
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  ground nutmeg
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
     1/2           cup  grated Gruyere

Flaky Butter Crust:  To make with a food processor, combine the flour, butter and salt in the bowl of a food processor.  Pulse for 10 seconds and add the ice water.  Pulse quickly 5 or 6 more times until the dough comes together.  Remove the dough and place on a floured surface.  Using your hands, work the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.

To make by hand, combine the flour and butter in a medium bowl, and mix with a pastry blender or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the water 1 tablespoon at a time and mix until the dough comes together and is no longer dry, being careful not to over mix.  Form into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.

Roll out the dough to an 11-inch circle on a lightly floured surface.  Transfer to a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and trim the edges.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Tart Filling:  Cut the leeks in half lengthwise and then crosswise into 1/4-inch thick half circles.  Place in a bowl and rinse well in 2 changes of water.  Drain.

Line the pastry with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake until the crust is set, about 12 minutes.  Remove the paper and weights and bake until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

In a medium skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until crisp and the fat is rendered, about 5 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Add butter to the fat remaining in the pan.  When foamy, add the drained leeks, garlic, salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and stir well to combine.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the leeks are very soft but not browned, 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and drain in a fine mesh strainer.

Combine the eggs and the cream in a medium bowl and whisk well.  Add the prosciutto, Parmesan, and Gruyere, and whisk well.  Add the leeks and whisk to combine.  Pour into the chilled tart shell and bake until risen and golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.

Remove from the oven and cool for at least 20 minutes on a wire rack before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped onions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1                cup  arborio rice
  3               cups  Classic Fish Fumet -- (see recipe)
     1/2         pound  shrimp -- peeled, deveined
     1/2         pound  Alaskan halibut -- cut 1 1/2" pieces
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  chopped green onions
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves

In a large saute pan, over medium heat, add the oil and heat.  When the oil is hot, add the onions, season with salt and pepper and saute until the onions are slightly soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the rice and saute until the rice is coated with the oil, about 2 minutes.

Add 1 cup of the stock and simmer, stirring often, until the stock is almost completely absorbed by the rice.  Add another 1 cup of stock and cook, stirring, until the stock is absorbed by the rice.  Add the final 1 cup of stock and cook about 5 minutes, the rice should be getting tender, but the mixture should still be a little soupy.

Season the seafood well with salt and pepper.  Add the seafood to the mixture and cook until the rice is tender and the mixture is no longer soupy, about 5 more minutes.  It should take about 20 minutes to incorporate all of the stock and until the rice is tender.  Stir in the butter, cream, and green onions and cook about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Spoon the risotto into shallow bowls.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pounds  cooked bone-in butt portion ham - (to 7) -- rinsed, patted dry
  1                cup  dark brown sugar - (loose) -- plus
  2          teaspoons  dark brown sugar
     3/4           cup  fresh orange juice
     3/4           cup  Creole mustard
                        = (or other spicy whole-grained mustard)
     1/2           cup  dark molasses
  3        tablespoons  prepared horseradish -- drained
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
     3/4      teaspoon  allspice
  3             pounds  small sweet potatoes -- peeled, quartered
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon

With a sharp knife, score parallel lines in a grid pattern, with cuts 1-inch apart and 1/4-inch deep, across the rounded, skin side of the ham.

In a large bowl, whisk the 1 cup of the sugar, orange juice, mustard, molasses, horseradish, cayenne, and 1/2 teaspoon of the allspice.  Place the ham in a 2-gallon, plastic bag and pour the marinade into the bag.  Gently squeeze the bag to evenly distribute the marinade around the ham.  Place in a large bowl or baking dish and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large mixing bowl, toss the potatoes with the vegetable oil, salt, cinnamon, remaining 1/4 teaspoon allspice, and remaining 2 teaspoons dark brown sugar.  Layer the potatoes on the bottom of a Dutch oven or large, heavy roasting pan.  Remove the ham from the marinade and place, scored-side up, on the potatoes.  Bake for 45 minutes.

Pour the ham marinade into a 2-quart saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to a bare simmer and cook uncovered until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Remove the ham from the oven and evenly baste on all sides with the reduced marinade.  Bake for 15 minutes.  Remove the ham from the oven, baste again, and turn the sweet potatoes that can be reached.  Return the ham to the oven and continue baking for an additional 1 1/2 hours, basting every 15 minutes, for a total cooking time of 2 1/2 hours.

Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes before carving.  Serve hot with the sweet potatoes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  small yukon gold potatoes -- well scrubbed,
                        and quartered
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  Spicy Dill Pickle juice -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh dill
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  cayenne
  3                     hard-boiled eggs -- peeled, and

Place the potatoes in a large bowl and add the dressing, tossing to coat evenly.  Add the eggs, pickles, onions and toss to combine.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.

Refrigerate until cool, 2 to 3 hours, before serving.

  6                     small bunche fresh dill
  1              small  yellow onion -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  12                    garlic cloves -- peeled, crushed
  6                     dried small red chili peppers
  1 1/2      teaspoons  black peppercorns
  3               cups  water
  3               cups  apple cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  pickling salt
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar

Place the cucumbers in a large bowl and cover with cold water.  Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight.

Sterilize 6 pint-sized jars and 6 lids in a hot water bath according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Divide the dill, onions, garlic, peppers and peppercorns among the jars.  Drain the cucumbers and tightly pack into the jars.

Bring a large pot or canner of water to a boil.

Pour the hot liquid over the cucumbers, leaving a 1/2-inch of headspace at the top of each jar.  Tap the jars on the counter to dispel any air bubbles, cover with lids and rings, and seal tightly.

Place the jars in the pot or canner of boiling water and process for 15 minutes.  Remove carefully with tongs and when cool, store in a cool, dry place for at least 3 weeks before opening.

This recipe yields 6 pints of pickles.

Comments:  If tap water in your area is hard or high in mineral content, use bottled water to prevent discoloration of pickles.

  8             ounces  dried Chinese egg noodles
     1/2           cup  dried shiitake mushrooms
     3/4         pound  flank steak -- trimmed of any fat
                        and julienned
  1         tablespoon  oyster sauce
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic

     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  1                cup  bok choy -- cut 1 1/2" pieces

Drop noodles into a large quantity of boiling water -- at least 2 quarts -- and cook 3 1/2 to 5 minutes, until barely tender to the bite.  Drain, rinse with cold water and reserve.

Place the mushrooms in a bowl and add boiling water to cover.  Let stand 15 to 30 minutes, until tender, then drain and squeeze the mushrooms to extract most of their moisture.  Cut off and discard the tough stems and julienne the caps.

Combine the beef and oyster sauce in a bowl; stir to coat.  Let stand for 10 minutes.

In another bowl, combine the chicken broth, soy sauce and sesame oil.  Set aside.

Heat a wok over high heat.  When hot, add the vegetable oil, swirling to coat the sides.  Add the garlic, ginger, and green onions and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the beef and cook, stirring constantly, about 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms and bok choy and cook for a minute longer.  Add the sauce and noodles.  Gently toss until heated through and sauce has thickened.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  sweet potatoes - (abt 3 lbs total)
  2             quarts  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne
  1              pinch  cinnamon

Boil sweet potatoes in water to cover for 10 minutes.  Remove and allow to cool.  Peel potatoes and cut into 1/4- by 1/4-inch thick batons.

Meanwhile in a 5-quart pot or Dutch oven fitted with a candy or deep-frying thermometer, (or in an electric deep fryer), heat oil over medium-low heat until the thermometer registers 300 degrees.  Make sure you have at least 3 inches of space between the top of the oil and the top of the pan, as fries will bubble up when they are added.

Increase the heat to medium-high and add fries, a handful at a time, to the hot oil.  Fry, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are soft and limp and just begin to brown, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Using a skimmer or slotted spoon, carefully remove fries from the oil and set aside to drain on paper towels.  Let rest for at least 10 minutes or up to 2 hours.

When ready to serve the fries, reheat the oil to 350 degrees.  Transfer the blanched potatoes to the hot oil and fry again, stirring frequently until browned and puffed, about 1 minute.  Transfer to paper lined platter and allow to drain for a minute.

Combine the brown sugar, salt, cayenne and cinnamon in a large bowl.  Add the fries and toss to coat.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Using a skimmer or slotted spoon, carefully remove fries from the oil and set aside to drain on paper towels.  Let rest for at least 10 minutes or up to 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve the fries, reheat the oil to 350 degrees.  Transfer the blanched potatoes to the hot oil and fry again, stirring frequently until browned and puffed, about 1 minute.  Transfer to paper lined platter and allow to drain for a minute.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the brown sugar, salt, cayenne and cinnamon in a large bowl.  Add the fries and toss to coat.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  milk
     1/2           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  quick-cooking tapioca
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
  1              pinch  salt
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  8                     lady fingers -- torn into pieces
     1/4           cup  orange liqueur
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2                     mandarin oranges -- segmented

Layer with a spoonful of the tapioca pudding, cocoa, orange segments, and coconut, and repeat, ending with coconut on top.  Top each portion with sweetened whipped cream.  Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator until well chilled, 2 to 3 hours.

       Tropical Fruit And Macadamia Nut Wontons, Ginger Creme Angla

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  assorted tropical fruit -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" dice
                        = (such as mango, papaya, pineapple,
                        and banana)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped toasted macadamia nuts
  3        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  1 1/4      teaspoons  minced fresh ginger
  1              large  egg
  16                    wonton wrappers
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Powdered sugar -- for garnish
                        Dried banana chips -- for garnish
                        Dried pineapple chips -- for garnish
                        Chopped crystallized ginger -- for garnish
                        === GINGER CREME ANGLAISE ===
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  4              large  egg yolks
  6        tablespoons  sugar

In a bowl, mix the tropical fruit with the brown sugar, nuts, and ginger together.  In a small bowl, beat the egg.

Lay several of the wonton wrappers on a work surface.  Spoon 2 teaspoons of filling into the center of each wrapper.  Paint the edges with the beaten egg and fold the bottom up over the top to enclose the filling and make a triangle.  Press down to completely seal the edges.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

In a large wok or pot, heat oil to 360 to 370 degrees.  Add the fruit wontons in batches to the oil and cook until golden brown, about 45 seconds, turning as they cook.  Remove, drain on paper towels, and dust with powdered sugar.  Repeat with the remaining wontons.

Spoon Ginger Creme Anglaise on the bottom of dessert plates, and top with 3 to 4 wontons per plate.  Garnish the plates with dried banana and pineapple chips, and crystallized ginger, if desired.

Ginger Creme Anglaise:  In a small, heavy saucepan, combine cream and ginger.  Warm to about 110 degrees over medium-low heat.  Remove from the heat and let steep for 10 minutes.

In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar.  Add 1/2 cup of the hot cream to the egg mixture, whisking constantly.  Gradually whisk the egg mixture into the cream and cook, stirring, over medium heat until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain into a clean bowl.  Discard the ginger.

Serve immediately.  If not serving immediately, press plastic wrap against the surface of the custard so a film will not form, and refrigerate.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  butter -- plus
  6        tablespoons  butter -- cut into pieces
  1                cup  pecan pieces
  4        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
                        === HERB NAGE ===
  2               cups  mild herb leaves
                        = (mint, tarragon, parsley, basil and
                        chives)
     1/2           cup  frisee
     1/2           cup  radicchio
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil

In a shallow bowl, combine the flour with 1 tablespoon of Essence.  In another shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk.  Season both sides of each fish with the remaining 2 teaspoons of Essence.

In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Dredge the fillets in the flour, coating evenly.  Dip the fillets in the egg mixture.  Dredge again in the flour, shaking to remove any excess.  When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the fillets and pan fry until golden, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to a warm platter.

Discard any oil remaining in the skillet and wipe clean with paper towels.  Return the skillet to the stove.  Over medium heat-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter.  When the butter foams, add the pecans and cook, stirring, until lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the parsley, garlic, lemon juice, Worcestershire, and cream, and cook, whisking, for 15 seconds.  Remove from the heat.  Add the salt and cayenne.

Return to low heat and whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, adding each piece before the previous one has been completely incorporated.  Continue until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, removing the pan from the heat to prevent the sauce from getting too hot and breaking.  Remove from the heat.

To serve, place the fillets on dinner plates and spoon the sauce on top.  Place Herb Nage next to trout fillets.

Herb Nage:  In a large bowl, toss together herbs, frisee and radicchio.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add olive oil and toss until well combined.  Serve with Trout with Pecan Meuniere Sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     chickens - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs ea) -- well rinsed,
                        and quartered with the excess fat removed
  1 1/2        gallons  cold water -- or enough to
                        cover the chickens
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped onions
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped carrots
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped celery
     1/4           cup  peeled garlic
                        SACHET CONSISTING OF:
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  cracked black peppercorns
  4                     parsley stems -- all wrapped in
                        cheesecloth and tied with string

Place all the ingredients into a large (3 to 4 gallon) stockpot and set over a medium-high heat.  Bring the contents of the pot to a boil and reduce to a simmer.  Skim the impurities and fat that rise to the top.  Cook the stock over the next 6 hours, skimming as needed.  Do not allow the stock to boil, or the fat and scum will mix with the stock and cause it to become cloudy.

When the stock is complete, strain through a fine mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth and refrigerate or freeze what is not used.  Once cool enough to handle, pick the meat off of the chicken bones and use it for a chicken salad, or a soup, gumbo or ragout.

This recipe yields about 1 gallon.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  butter -- plus
  1           teaspoon  butter -- at room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  light brown sugar
  2                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  3               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  2               cups  white chocolate chips
  1                cup  macadamia nuts -- toasted, and
                        roughly chopped

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place 1/2 pound of the butter and the brown sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until a smooth batter is formed.  While the machine is running, add the eggs and vanilla extract, until incorporated into the batter.

Sift together 3 cups flour and baking powder.  Slowly add the flour mixture to the batter and mix on low speed until a dough is formed.  Very gently, by turning the mixer on and then off, fold the chips and nuts into the dough.

Once the dough is all blended, grease a 9- by 9-inch baking pan with the remaining butter and dust with the 1 tablespoon of flour.  Pour the batter into the pan and place in the preheated oven.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until set yet still moist.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
