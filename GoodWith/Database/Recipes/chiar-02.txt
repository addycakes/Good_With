                   'Quintessential' Roasted Vegetables

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  carrots - (to 8)
  1              pound  jumbo asparagus
  1              pound  large cipollini onions -- peeled, and
                        halved through the root
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- more for drizzling
     3/4         pound  shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, quartered
                        Finely-ground gray sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  sliced garlic
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme leaves

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Chop the carrots diagonally first, then straight.  Cut off the ends of the asparagus, and shave their ends.

In a stock pot, bring 1 gallon of salted water to a boil.  Add onions, let cook 2 minutes, then add carrots and asparagus, cook 2 minutes more.  Remove everything with slotted spoon and drain all in a colander.  Quickly spread out on a baking sheet and place in refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes to set color.

Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms in a single layer and cook until well caramelized on the first side, about 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Turn the mushrooms once, and use a slotted spoon to remove the mushrooms onto the plate.

In a roasting pan or skillet over medium-high heat, add remaining 1/2 cup of extra-virgin olive oil, onion, and carrots.  Caramelize for 2 minutes, and while those are cooking, cut asparagus into thirds.  Season carrots and onions with salt and pepper.  Add mushrooms to pan with carrots and onions.  Add asparagus and garlic to pan.

Drizzle with more olive oil, if desired, and place pan in the oven.  Roast until vegetables are medium brown in color, about 20 minutes.  Remove pan from oven and put on stovetop over high heat.  Add the fresh thyme, by sprinkling over the top, allowing to crackle, and mixing in.

The vegetables can be cooked and left at room temperature at this point for up to 2 hours.  Reheat when needed.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  1                cup  creme fraiche, sour cream or yogurt

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FLOUR MIXTURE ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2    tablespoons  California chili powder
  1         tablespoon  gray sea salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === SALAD ===
  2                     blood oranges -- peeled, sectioned,
                        pith removed
  2                     tangelos -- peeled, sectioned,
                        pith removed
  2                     grapefruit -- peeled, sectioned,
                        pith removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  shrimp - (16 to 20 ct/ 4 per person) -- peeled, but
                        with the tail on
  6              large  garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2                     serrano or jalape√ío peppers -- thinly sliced
  1 1/2           cups  basil leaves -- stemmed, cleaned
  1         tablespoon  julienned orange
  1              bunch  basil -- cleaned
  3               cups  pre-washed spinach -- stems removed

Mix the flour mixture for shrimp:  Combine the ingredients and set aside in container.   This step can be done the day before dinner.

Peel and cut the citrus fruit into sections over a plate.  Drain the juice from the plate into a bowl.  Season liberally with gray salt and black pepper.  Whisk in olive oil to form a vinaigrette (it should be in proportion, about 2 parts juice to 1 part olive oil).

Season citrus sections with salt and pepper.  Drizzle a little of the vinaigrette on them to marinate and put them on a platter.

Have your fishmonger peel the prawns but leave the tails on for handles.  Season liberally with salt and pepper.  Preheat a saute pan on high.  Dredge the shrimp in the flour mixture.  This will give them a nice crust and allow them to stay crispy and fresh at room temperature.  Add olive oil to the pan and put in 1 layer of shrimp.  You want them to caramelize, so don't toss or move them.  Add a little more oil if the flour absorbs what's in the pan.  After about 3 minutes, turn over the prawns.  Let it caramelize, toss and turn out onto a cookie sheet.

Add about 1/4 cup more olive oil to the already hot saute pan.  Drain pan juices from the cookie sheet into the saute pan.  Add sliced garlic and let it get light brown.  Add chiles and let them get soft.  Add the basil and stand back √± there's a lot of water in basil and it will pop.  Let it get crispy, less than a minute.  While this is happening, arrange prawns over the citrus salad.  Add the orange zest to the basil/garlic/chile mixture in the saute pan.  Season with salt and pepper, then spoon basil/garlic/chile mixture over the prawns.

Toss the spinach with the citrus vinaigrette and mound on top of the prawns.  Serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Mix the flour mixture for shrimp:  Combine the ingredients and set aside in container.   This step can be done the day before dinner.

Peel and cut the citrus fruit into sections over a plate.  Drain the juice from the plate into a bowl.  Season liberally with gray salt and black pepper.  Whisk in olive oil to form a vinaigrette (it should be in proportion, about 2 parts juice to 1 part olive oil).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season citrus sections with salt and pepper.  Drizzle a little of the vinaigrette on them to marinate and put them on a platter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Have your fishmonger peel the prawns but leave the tails on for handles.  Season liberally with salt and pepper.  Preheat a saute pan on high.  Dredge the shrimp in the flour mixture.  This will give them a nice crust and allow them to stay crispy and fresh at room temperature.  Add olive oil to the pan and put in 1 layer of shrimp.  You want them to caramelize, so don&apos;t toss or move them.  Add a little more oil if the flour absorbs what&apos;s in the pan.  After about 3 minutes, turn over the prawns.  Let it caramelize, toss and turn out onto a cookie sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add about 1/4 cup more olive oil to the already hot saute pan.  Drain pan juices from the cookie sheet into the saute pan.  Add sliced garlic and let it get light brown.  Add chiles and let them get soft.  Add the basil and stand back √± there&apos;s a lot of water in basil and it will pop.  Let it get crispy, less than a minute.  While this is happening, arrange prawns over the citrus salad.  Add the orange zest to the basil/garlic/chile mixture in the saute pan.  Season with salt and pepper, then spoon basil/garlic/chile mixture over the prawns.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Toss the spinach with the citrus vinaigrette and mound on top of the prawns.  Serve.

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BATTER ===
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  salt
  3                     eggs -- plus
  1                     egg yolk
  1                cup  whole milk
                        === APPLES ===
     1/4                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              pinch  salt
  1 1/2           cups  diced peeled Granny Smith apple
                        = (abt 1 large apple)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  grappa, Calvados, or
                        other fruit brandy
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting
     1/3           cup  creme fraiche

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Make the batter:  Sift the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt into a bowl.  In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, egg yolk, and milk until well blended.  Add about 1/3 of the egg mixture to the flour mixture and whisk until smooth, then gradually incorporate the remaining egg mixture.  Whisk until well blended.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate while you prepare the apples.

Cook the apples:  With the tip of a knife, scrape the vanilla bean seeds from the pod into an ovenproof 10-inch cast-iron or stainless steel skillet.  Add the pod and the butter and cook over moderately-high heat until the butter turns nut brown.  Add a pinch of salt.  Add the apples and cook, stirring often, until slightly softened, about 2 minutes.  Remove the vanilla bean pod and discard.  Sprinkle the apples with the sugar, reduce the heat to moderately-low, and cook until the apples are almost cooked through and the sugar has melted and is coating the apples in a light syrup.  Add the grappa or other brandy off the fire while pouring, place back on the fire, wait for flame to die down, the swirl the pan briefly.  Spread the fruit evenly in the skillet.

Working quickly, pour batter evenly over the fruit.  Bake until the edges of the clafouti are puffed and browned and the center is set, about 15 minutes.

Put some confectioners' sugar in a sieve and generously dust the surface of the clafouti.  Serve warm directly from the pan with a dollop of creme fraiche.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Michael's Notes:  If you plan to serve individual clafoutis from mini pans, heat the pans in the oven until quite hot, about 5 minutes, then divide the cooked fruit among the pans, top with the batter, and bake.  Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the pans.

To make a cherry clafouti, use 1 1/4 cups pitted cherries.  Substitute 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest for the cinnamon and Grand Marnier for the grappa.

                           Arborio Rice Coating

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Arborio rice
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  semolina
  2        tablespoons  table salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Grind the rice in a blender until very fine.  Put it in a bowl and add the all-purpose flour, semolina, salt and pepper.  Toss until well blended.  Store in a sealed container in the freezer for maximum freshness.

This recipe yields about 5 cups.

Chef's Notes:  The Arborio Rice Coating is by far the best coating I know for anything fried.  It gives an especially crisp crust to fried fish fillets, squid, shrimp, eggplant and veal cutlets.  You may as well make a lot because it keeps well in the freezer, and it's hard to grind less than 1 cup of rice in a blender.  If you have a spice mill, you can halve the recipe.

Arborio Rice Coating is one of the few places I use table salt.  Sea salt and kosher salt are too heavy to stay evenly distributed in the coating.

               Asparagus Pesto With Tiny Potatoes And Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PESTO ===
  1              bunch  asparagus - (abt 1 lb) -- trimmed, and
                        cooked for 5 minutes in boiling salted
                        water (reserve water for pasta)
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh basil - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts -- toasted
  8                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  pure olive oil - (about)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        === POTATOES AND PASTA ===
     3/4         pound  marble-size potatoes
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  uncut fresh basil leaves
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4         pound  dried orecchiette
                        = (or other pasta the same size as
                        potatoes)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - (about)

For the Pesto:  Cut the cooked asparagus spears into thirds.  Put in a food processor with the basil, pine nuts, garlic, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Keep in mind you will add Parmesan as well, so be careful not to oversalt.  With the machine running, slowly add the cup of olive oil.  When the sauce is about the consistency of mayonnaise, it has enough oil.  Pulse in the Parmesan.  Thin with water if necessary to achieve a slick, saucy pesto.  Scrape into a bowl or jar, cover, and refrigerate until needed.  You should have about 3 cups.  (Keeps about 2 to 3 days, refrigerated.)

Put the potatoes in a pan of salted cold water to cover and bring to a boil.  Cook until tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain and let cool for a few minutes.  If the potatoes are larger than about 1/2 inch in diameter, cut in half.

Heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Add the potatoes and cook until browned and crispy all over, about 5 minutes.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Keep warm.  Add basil, toss with potatoes and set aside.

While the potatoes are browning, return the water used for cooking the asparagus, if reserved, to a boil or brint a new pot of water to a boil.  Add more salt and the pasta and cook until al dente, about 12 minutes.  Drain through a colander, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water.  Pour the pasta into a warm serving bowl, add the potatoes, about 1 cup of the asparagus pesto, several twists of pepper, and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan.  Toss well, thinning with the pasta cooking water as necessary.

Dust with a light grating of Parmesan (a microplane grater works well for this) before serving and pass the remaining cheese and a bowl of pesto at the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the Pesto:  Cut the cooked asparagus spears into thirds.  Put in a food processor with the basil, pine nuts, garlic, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Keep in mind you will add Parmesan as well, so be careful not to oversalt.  With the machine running, slowly add the cup of olive oil.  When the sauce is about the consistency of mayonnaise, it has enough oil.  Pulse in the Parmesan.  Thin with water if necessary to achieve a slick, saucy pesto.  Scrape into a bowl or jar, cover, and refrigerate until needed.  You should have about 3 cups.  (Keeps about 2 to 3 days, refrigerated.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the potatoes in a pan of salted cold water to cover and bring to a boil.  Cook until tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain and let cool for a few minutes.  If the potatoes are larger than about 1/2 inch in diameter, cut in half.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Add the potatoes and cook until browned and crispy all over, about 5 minutes.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Keep warm.  Add basil, toss with potatoes and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the potatoes are browning, return the water used for cooking the asparagus, if reserved, to a boil or brint a new pot of water to a boil.  Add more salt and the pasta and cook until al dente, about 12 minutes.  Drain through a colander, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water.  Pour the pasta into a warm serving bowl, add the potatoes, about 1 cup of the asparagus pesto, several twists of pepper, and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan.  Toss well, thinning with the pasta cooking water as necessary.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dust with a light grating of Parmesan (a microplane grater works well for this) before serving and pass the remaining cheese and a bowl of pesto at the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

            Bitter Greens With Poached Egg And Prosciutto Bits

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon leaves
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt -- preferably gray salt
  2        tablespoons  sherry vinegar
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === SALAD ===
     1/2         pound  bitter mixed greens
                        = (such as frisee, mizuna, radicchio,
                        and arugula)
  4             quarts  water
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
                        = (or Champagne vinegar)
  1         tablespoon  sea salt -- preferably gray salt
  4                     eggs
     1/2           cup  Prosciutto Bits -- (see recipe)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To begin the dressing, placed minced tarragon in a bowl, and add Dijon mustard.  Add a pinch of grey salt, sherry vinegar, and olive oil.  Whisk mixture together thoroughly.

In a large bowl, toss the greens with enough of the dressing to coat them lightly.  Taste and adjust the seasoning.  Set aside.

For eggs, make sure that upon starting they are room temperature.  Bring the water to a boil in a deep saucepan.  Add the wine vinegar and salt.  Adjust the heat so the water barely bubbles.  One at a time, break the eggs into a custard cups or small bowl, then slide gently into the water.  Allow eggs to cook for about 1 1/2 minutes, then, with a slotted spoon, gently lift and shape the whites around the yolks.  Continue to cook until the whites are just set and the yolks are glazed but still liquid about 2 1/2 minutes longer.  Transfer the poached eggs with a slotted spoon to a clean dish towel or paper towels to drain.

Place poached eggs on top of coated greens in large bowl, add a pinch of salt, to taste, and top with about 3 tablespoons or more of the prosciutto bits.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Eggs poach best when the water is relatively deep, so use a deep saucepan.  Adding vinegar to the water helps to set the whites.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  white marrow beans (or other white beans) -- cooked and cooled
  1                cup  reserved bean cooking liquid
  2        tablespoons  olive paste
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh thyme leaves -- plus
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme -- for garnish,
                        optional
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
     1/4      teaspoon  gray sea salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    paper muffin cups
  1                     bar bittersweet chocolate - (9.7 oz) -- chopped
                        = (Scharfenberger recommended)
  1                cup  favorite peanut butter
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
  1              pinch  grey salt
  12                    dried banana chips

Cut the top half off of the muffin cups so that they are shallower.

Reserve 1/4 cup of the chopped chocolate.  Pour the rest into a glass bowl and melt them in the microwave: Microwave at 50 percent power for 1 minute.  Stir the chips gently, and let them sit for a minute or so.  If the chocolate needs more melting, microwave those chippies again at half power for 30 seconds.  Stir gently.  Continue the process, stirring gently as you go.  But be very careful not to overcook the chocolate.

Temper the melted chocolate by stirring in the reserved 1/4 cup of chopped chocolate chips as it cools.  This will 're-emulsify' the chocolate and enable it to harden at room temperature.

Using a teaspoon, spoon a portion of the chocolate into the middle of a muffin cup.  Draw the chocolate up the edges of the cup with the back of the spoon (or you can paint the chocolate on with a small paintbrush).  Coat the entire inside of the muffin cup with chocolate and place it into a muffin tin.  Repeat with the remaining muffin cups and then put the whole muffin tin in the refrigerator so that the chocolate hardens.

Combine the peanut butter, powdered sugar, and salt in a mixer.  Pour the mixture into a resealable plastic bag and seal.

When the chocolate in the muffin cups has hardened, pop the sweetened peanut butter into the microwave on full power for 1 minute.  This will soften up the peanut butter so that it easily flows into the cups.

Cut a corner off the edge of the plastic bag.  You can use this to pipe the peanut butter into each of the chocolate-coated cups.  Put a banana chip on top of each cup.  Put the candy in the refrigerator to harden the peanut butter.  This should take 15 to 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 12 candies.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  ground pork
  2        tablespoons  grey sea salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  California chili powder
     1/2    tablespoon  chili flakes
     1/2           cup  beer
     1/4           cup  fennel seed

Season the pork well with a good amount of black pepper and grey salt.  Mince the garlic and then, sprinkle with salt to help the mashing process.  Using the side of a knife, mash it into a paste (this process is helped along if you sprinkle the garlic with a little salt to help break it up).  The mashed garlic flavor will spread throughout the sausage more easily than minced garlic.  Add the garlic to the sausage, then add the California chili powder (this is a sweet chili that will give the sausage a strong red color).  Add the chili flakes, beer, and fennel seeds and mix well.  Cover sausage in a bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Chef's note:  If you'd like to test pork sausage for seasoning, fry a little in a small pan with some olive oil before tasting.  Remember, you can always add more seasoning, but you can never take it away!

To form spiedini:  Preheat a grill.  Just before your cookout, soak 12-inch wooden skewers in water for 1 hour so they won't catch on fire when you place them on the grill.  Cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil.  Form the sausage into baseball-sized meatballs and place on the cookie sheet.  To form the spiedini, flatten the balls into patties, place 2 skewers in the middle of a sausage patty, then wrap the patty firmly around the skewer.  Wrap the spiedini in foil that you will use to bring them to the grill.

To Grill spiedini:  Place spiedini on the cooler part of the coals or on a medium grill.  Drizzle with olive oil.  Grill for about 10 minutes on each side, until well cooked.

This recipe yields about 12 skewers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  chicken thighs -- skin and bones
                        removed, cut into 3/4" chunks
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4          teaspoons  fennel seeds
  2          teaspoons  smoked paprika
  1                cup  masa harina
                        = (or all-purpose flour)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        additional as needed to cook the chicken
                        and for garnish
  4                     red onions -- minced
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     green jalape√ío peppers (with seeds) -- diced
  2                     red jalape√ío peppers (with seeds) -- diced
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
  6        tablespoons  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme leaves
  2               cups  white wine
  4               cups  chicken stock
  1                can  diced tomato in juices - (12 oz)
  2               cans  white beans - (15 oz ea) -- rinsed, drained
                        = (or 4 cups cooked white beans)
  3                     zucchini -- cut into 3/4" pieces
  1                     poblano pepper -- diced
  1                     orange or red bell pepper -- diced
  1              bunch  scallions -- sliced
     1/2           cup  torn basil leaves
                        Grated Parmesan -- for garnish

Place the chicken in a large bowl.  Season liberally with pepper and grey salt.  Toss with fennel seed and smoked paprika.  Sprinkle the masa harina or flour over the chicken and toss to coat.

Heat a cast-iron pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add 1/4 cup olive oil, when it begins to smoke, add the chicken, leaving the excess flour or masa harina in the bowl.  Spreading the chicken evenly so it covers the bottom of the pot in 1 layer.  (You may have to cook the chicken in batches to do this, adding more olive oil as necessary.)

Leave the chicken alone, without turning it, so the meat will brown and caramelize, about 5 minutes per side.  The chicken has a lot of moisture in it, so a good amount of steam will come from the pan before it is caramelized.  As it browns, turn each piece with tongs.  Once all sides are caramelized, remove the meat from the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving juices in the pot.

Over medium heat, add another 1/4 cup of olive oil to pan along with the onions and garlic, cook until onions soften and caramelize, about 5 minutes.  Add the jalape√íos, cook until softened, about 2 minutes.  Add the tomato paste, chili powder and thyme, stir to combine.  Add wine, bring to a simmer, then add the chicken stock, diced tomatoes and cooked chicken.  Stir to incorporate everything, season with salt.  Simmer until chicken is wonderfully tender, about 45 minutes.

Add the white beans, zucchini, poblano, red pepper and scallions.  Bring to a simmer and cook until vegetables are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Stir in basil.  Serve immediately or cool and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.  To serve, sprinkle with grated Parmesan and drizzle with olive oil.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

                   Chiarello Chocolate Chili Con Carne

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  beef chuck
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon -- divided
  3          teaspoons  ground cumin -- divided
  4        tablespoons  chili powder -- divided
                        Masa harina (Mexican corn flour)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  lard (Manteca)
  4                     red onions -- peeled and minced
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  4                     jalape√ío peppers -- sliced thin with
                        seeds, stems removed
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  2            bottles  beer - (12 oz) -- to 3 bottles
  1                can  diced tomato in juices - (12 oz)
  1              quart  chicken stock
  3               cans  black beans - (12 oz ea)
  2             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- cut large chunks

Cut the chuck into 3/4-inch pieces, or, to save time, have your butcher do this for you.  Place the chuck in a large bowl.  Season liberally with pepper (about 20 turns of the pepper grinder) and grey salt to taste √± remember half of this will come off in the pan.  Season with 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of the cumin, and 2 tablespoons of the chili powder.  Mix this well and coat the meat with the masa harina (this is a ground hominy flour common to Mexican cuisine and easily found in the Mexican food sections of many grocery stores).  The flour will thicken the sauce and give it a specific, Mexican taste.

Preheat a cast-iron Dutch oven on the stove over medium-high heat.  Add the olive oil and then the coated meat, spreading it evenly so it covers the bottom of the Dutch oven in 1 layer.  Leave it alone, without turning it, so the meat will brown and caramelize.

Meanwhile, add the lard.  The meat has a lot of moisture in it, so a good amount of steam will come from the pan before it is caramelized.  As it browns, slowly turn each piece with tongs.  Once all sides are caramelized, remove the meat from the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a cookie sheet to cool, leaving juices in the Dutch oven to saute vegetables.

Add the onions and garlic and saute for 5 minutes over medium heat until they start to caramelize and get soft.  Add the jalape√íos and allow to cook for 2 more minutes until soft.  Add the tomato paste.  Some of the same spices as were used on the meat will be used in the sauce.  Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of the cumin, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, the oregano, and 2 heaping tablespoons of the chili powder.  Add beer.  Stir to incorporate everything.  Add diced tomatoes, and stir.  Then add the reserved meat.  Add chicken stock.  Simmer for 1 1/2 hours until meat is wonderfully tender.

Strain juice from the black beans, add the beans to the chili pot and bring up to simmer.  Then add chunks of bittersweet chocolate.  Stir until it melts.  Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Cut the chuck into 3/4-inch pieces, or, to save time, have your butcher do this for you.  Place the chuck in a large bowl.  Season liberally with pepper (about 20 turns of the pepper grinder) and grey salt to taste √± remember half of this will come off in the pan.  Season with 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of the cumin, and 2 tablespoons of the chili powder.  Mix this well and coat the meat with the masa harina (this is a ground hominy flour common to Mexican cuisine and easily found in the Mexican food sections of many grocery stores).  The flour will thicken the sauce and give it a specific, Mexican taste.
</DirT>

Preheat a cast-iron Dutch oven on the stove over medium-high heat.  Add the olive oil and then the coated meat, spreading it evenly so it covers the bottom of the Dutch oven in 1 layer.  Leave it alone, without turning it, so the meat will brown and caramelize.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, add the lard.  The meat has a lot of moisture in it, so a good amount of steam will come from the pan before it is caramelized.  As it browns, slowly turn each piece with tongs.  Once all sides are caramelized, remove the meat from the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a cookie sheet to cool, leaving juices in the Dutch oven to saute vegetables.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the onions and garlic and saute for 5 minutes over medium heat until they start to caramelize and get soft.  Add the jalape√íos and allow to cook for 2 more minutes until soft.  Add the tomato paste.  Some of the same spices as were used on the meat will be used in the sauce.  Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of the cumin, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, the oregano, and 2 heaping tablespoons of the chili powder.  Add beer.  Stir to incorporate everything.  Add diced tomatoes, and stir.  Then add the reserved meat.  Add chicken stock.  Simmer for 1 1/2 hours until meat is wonderfully tender.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain juice from the black beans, add the beans to the chili pot and bring up to simmer.  Then add chunks of bittersweet chocolate.  Stir until it melts.  Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon leaves
  2             pounds  littleneck clams
  1              pound  cooked crab legs -- cracked 1 1/2"
                        pieces
  1              pound  large shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        and tails left on
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- room temperature

                        cut into 1 1/2" pieces

Heat 2 cups fumet, clam juice or water in a small saucepan.  Add saffron, simmer about 5 minutes, remove from heat and set aside.

Heat 1/4 cup olive oil oil in an 8-quart pot over medium-high heat.  Add garlic, allowing it to brown for about 20 seconds, then add onions, fennel, and a pinch of salt.  Cook until vegetables are softened, about 4 minutes.  Add fennel seed, bay leaf and oregano.  Stir and cook for 30 seconds.  Add tomato paste.  Cook, stirring, until paste darkens a bit, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Add chopped tomatoes (squeeze them slightly through your fingers to soften first), white wine, pernod and the saffron flavored fish fumet, clam juice or water.

Meanwhile, season halibut and scallops with salt and pepper.  Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons oil.  Cook the haibut and scallops, without stirring, until browned, about 2 minutes.  Turn and cook another 30 seconds.  Fish will be slightly underdone.  Cover scallops and saut√àed fish with ladles of broth, bring to a simmer, then transfer scallops and fish to the serving bowls.

Remove bay leaf and the jalape√ío peppers from pot.  Season broth with salt and pepper.  Pour broth over fish in bowls.

Mash the softened jalape√ío peppers into a paste, and serve as a garnish for guests who like their Cioppino spicy.

                    Crispy White Beans With Chili Oil

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beans

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  white beans -- cooked
     3/4           cup  buttermilk
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  chili oil
  1                cup  Arborio Rice Coating -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced garlic
                        Grey sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced serrano or jalape√ío chile
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh sage leaves
  1         tablespoon  julienned lemon zest

In a bowl, let the beans soak in the buttermilk for a few minutes, then drain in a sieve.  Place the sieve over a bowl.

Heat 3/4 cup olive oil and the chili oil in a 10-inch skillet over high heat.  While the oil is heating, sprinkle the coating over the beans and shake in the sieve to coat the beans well.  Repeat with the coating that falls into the bowl.  Don't worry if they don't absorb all the coating.

Carefully add the beans to the hot oil, spread them into an even layer, and cook without stirring until they are browned and crisp on the bottom, 6 to 7 minutes.  Turn with a spatula and brown on the other side, another 5 to 6 minutes, adjusting the heat so they don't burn.  When they are evenly browned, add sliced garlic and brown for another 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Add chiles to the pan, and continue to fry for another 15 seconds before adding the sage.  With a slotted spoon, transfer the beans to paper towels to drain.  Saute until the leaves turn crisp, about 1 minute.  Top with lemon zest, then remove from the heat.

This recipe yields 5 servings.

Comments:  Bringing the beans up to a simmer slowly helps keep the skins from splitting.

                       Double Dipped Fried Chicken

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     free-range chickens -- cut serving pieces
  1                cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh rosemary leaves
  3               cups  buttermilk (full fat, if possible) -- plus
                        more as needed
                        Arborio Rice Coating -- (see recipe)
                        Peanut oil -- for frying

Wash the chickens and place in a large bowl.  (Make sure to wash your hands after you handle raw poultry.)  Mix the balsamic and the rosemary and pour over the chickens.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

The next day, remove the chicken and discard the balsamic.  In a clean bowl, toss the chicken with the buttermilk.  Remove the chicken pieces, reserving the buttermilk.

Pour Arborio Rice Coating into a large plastic bag or container.  Add the chicken in batches, shaking to coat.  Put chicken back in buttermilk, adding more buttermilk if necessary to coat all the pieces.  Dip the chicken pieces in the rice mixture to dredge them, then carefully dip them in the buttermilk again, and then dip a second time in the rice mixture.  Pat well to remove excess flour.  Refrigerate coated chicken for at least 1 hour to allow coating to adhere to flesh of the chicken.

Heat about 2 inches of peanut oil in a heavy skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat to 335 degrees.  Slip some of the chicken pieces skin-side down into the hot oil.  Do not overcrowd; fry in batches (or 2 separate skillets) if necessary.  Cook until chicken is cooked through and golden brown, about 10 to15 minutes per side.  Drain thoroughly on a wire rack or crumpled paper towels and serve.  Can be eaten hot, cold, or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     eggs
  2                     egg yolks
  1                cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/4           cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  whole milk
  1                cup  Caramel -- (listed below)
  1              pinch  grey sea salt
     1/2           cup  melted butter - (1 stick)
  6        tablespoons  hot brewed espresso
                        === CARAMEL ===
     1/2           cup  water
  1                cup  sugar

In a large bowl, whisk together egg and egg yolks.  While whisking add the sugar slowly until fully dissolved.  Add vanilla, heavy cream, milk, and salt and continue to whisk.  In order to get rid of air bubbles in mixture, transfer to large bowl through a fine strainer.

In the bottom of 6 (1/2 cup) ramekins (small ceramic custard cups), place about 1 1/2 teaspoons of caramel.  When all 6 ramekins have caramel at the bottom, brush each bottom and side with melted butter to secure flan and yet allow it to be removed easily.  Fill each ramekin with the flan mixture, SLOWLY to avoid air bubbles, until about 2/3 full.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place almost full ramekins in shallow baking pan and then fill the pan with boiling water.  The hot water bath will allow the flan cups to cook evenly in the oven.  Right before placing pan in oven, top each ramekin with a tablespoon of hot espresso.  Bake for 40 minutes.

When removing pan from oven, allow the ramekins to remain cooling in their original water bath, overnight if necessary.

Before serving, place ramekins in another shallow pan of warm water to loosen the custard.  Run a thin knife around the inside edge of cup to further loosen, place a plate on top of ramekin and flip onto plate to serve.

For the Caramel:  In preheated saucepan over medium heat, pour in water and bring to boil.  Add sugar and stir until caramel brown (about 4 minutes).  Remove from heat and allow to cool for about 2 to 3 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     Dungeness crabs - (abt 1 1/4 lbs ea) -- cooked, cleaned,
                        and cracked
  3               cups  extra-virgin olive oil
  20                    garlic cloves -- finely minced
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1                cup  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  8                     #10 tin cans -- lined with
                        newspaper

Cleaning dungeness crab:  Holding the body backside up, place your right thumb in the joint between the upper and lower shell on the side opposite the mouth.  Your palm will be stretched across the top of the shell.  Hold the bottom of the crab in your opposite hand.  Force your thumb in and pull up and back to your right until shell snaps off.  Pour any juices in the shell into a small bowl.  Cut the body into quarters with a large knife.  Twist the legs off the body.  Crack lightly in several places with a nutcracker and set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a very large ovenproof saute pan over medium-high heat until hot.  (You may need 2 pans.)  Add the crab and garlic, and toss well.  Saute for about 10 minutes.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and mix in lemon juice.  Saute for another 5 minutes, then add parsley.  After another 1 or 2 minutes, remove the crab and serve in the newspaper lined cans.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Cleaning dungeness crab:  Holding the body backside up, place your right thumb in the joint between the upper and lower shell on the side opposite the mouth.  Your palm will be stretched across the top of the shell.  Hold the bottom of the crab in your opposite hand.  Force your thumb in and pull up and back to your right until shell snaps off.  Pour any juices in the shell into a small bowl.  Cut the body into quarters with a large knife.  Twist the legs off the body.  Crack lightly in several places with a nutcracker and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the olive oil in a very large ovenproof saute pan over medium-high heat until hot.  (You may need 2 pans.)  Add the crab and garlic, and toss well.  Saute for about 10 minutes.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and mix in lemon juice.  Saute for another 5 minutes, then add parsley.  After another 1 or 2 minutes, remove the crab and serve in the newspaper lined cans.

                           Forever Roasted Pork

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  pork leg or shoulder
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
  2             medium  onions -- thinly sliced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh sage leaves
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  Fennel Spice Rub -- (see recipe)

Bring pork to room temperature by removing it from refrigerator 1 to 2 hours before cooking.

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until hot.  Add the onions, cover pan, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until light brown, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the sage and season with salt and pepper.  Cook until the onions cease throwing off water, about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat, allow to cool on plate.

Peel back the pork skin, and spread a good amount of the fennel spice and add the onions directly on the fat layer.  Fold the skin back over the onions and tie closed with kitchen string.  Season well all over with the remaining fennel spice.

Arrange the meat on a rack in a casserole pan lined with foil, drizzle with more olive oil and cook until the meat is very tender, about 8 hours.  It is ready when it pulls away easily if picked at with a pair of tongs.  It is often easiest to cook the meat overnight, or put it in the oven in the morning and let it cook all day.  It does not need to be attended.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Variations:  This dish can be simplified or made more elaborate depending on your taste.  You can omit the onions and simply season the meat with the fennel spice.  You can roast aromatic vegetables until caramelized and add them to the bottom of the roasting pan.  Or you can add another layer of flavor to the onions: mince fresh rosemary and fruits such as oranges, kumquats, Meyer lemons, apples, pears, or quince, and cook with the onions, or make a paste of garlic and fresh or dried chiles and add to the onions.

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TART DOUGH === (or use store bought
                        puff pastry dough)
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  superfine sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  chilled unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- cut tbspn-size
                        pieces
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  ice water -- plus
                        additional as needed
                        === FILLING ===
  4               cups  Granny Smith, Pippin, or your
                        favorite apples -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" wedges
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/3           cup  cranberry sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt -- preferably gray salt
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream -- for egg wash
  2          teaspoons  coarse sugar

Make the Tart Dough:  Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor and pulse to blend.  Add the butter and pulse until the mixture forms coarse crumbs.  Add vanilla and water to processor, then slowly add flour and cinnamon sugar.  Pulse just until a dough forms, adding a little extra ice water if necessary.  Divide the dough in half, and shape each half into a 1-inch-thick round.  Wrap 1 disk tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour; freeze the other for future use.

Put a pizza stone or cookie sheet in the oven and preheat the oven to 425 degrees for 45 minutes.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 15 minutes before rolling to soften it slightly.

Place the dough round between 2 sheets of parchment paper and roll into a 13-inch round (about a 1/4-inch thickness), flouring the round lightly as needed to keep the dough from sticking.  Remove the top sheet of parchment.  Use the rim of a small round bowl to make 6 individual crostatas.  Cut around the edge of the bowl, in the dough, with a sharp knife.  Slide a pizza peel or rimless baking sheet under the bottom sheet of parchment, and remove excess dough from crostatas.

Make the Filling:  Combine the apples, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a bowl and toss well.  Add cranberry sauce and salt and toss again, briefly.  Paint the edges of the crostatas with egg yolk wash.  Fill the center of the dough rounds with the apples (about 1/2 cup each) in an even layer, leaving a border of about 1 1/2 inches.  Fold the border up and over the apples to make a rim.  Brush the rim with egg wash, then sprinkle with coarse sugar.  Trim the excess parchment with scissors, and press sides together.

Use the pizza peel or baking sheet to transfer the crostatas, still with parchment underneath, to the oven, sliding it, with the paper, directly onto the pizza stone.  Bake until the crust is nicely browned and the apples are bubbling, about 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven with the peel or baking sheet and let cool on a rack for 15 minutes before serving.  Serve warm.  This can be made hours ahead and reheated before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Michael's Comments:  Every region has its own best baking apples.  Be sure to talk to your green grocer to find out what's best near you!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2             ounces  sugar
  2             ounces  butter
  2             pounds  white chocolate
  6              drops  green food coloring - (to 12)
  2                     bags pretzels
                        Strawberries, bananas, pineapples, apples -- for dipping
                        Candy corn and Halloween shaped sprinkles

Make a ganache.  In a non-reactive double boiler set over medium-low heat, bring the cream, sugar, and butter to a boil.  Meanwhile, chop the chocolate into small chunks - a serrated knife works best for this.

Add the chocolate chunks to the cream mixture in the double boiler, whisking, until it is melted and incorporated into the cream.  Finally, add the food coloring until it is the desired shade of green.

Keep mixture warm in a fondue pot near the door.  Set out the fruit and the pretzels for dipping with long wooden skewers next to the fondue pot.  Guests can dip their pretzels or fruit into the fondue and then roll them in the candy sprinkles, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  2             medium  avocados -- pitted, peeled,
                        grilled and chopped into cubes
  2        tablespoons  lemon or lime juice
  1         tablespoon  roughly-chopped basil leaves
  1         tablespoon  roughly-chopped tarragon leaves
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/8      teaspoon  asorbic acid or Vitamin C
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     ripe avocados -- peeled, pitted,
                        and halved
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for grilling
  2                     lemons -- juiced
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  finely-minced garlic
     3/4           cup  julienned basil leaves
     1/2           cup  sour cream or creme fraiche
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan

Place peeled and pitted avocado halves in a bowl.  Drizzle with olive oil and lemon juice (to prevent oxidation), and sprinkle with a good amount of grey salt and black pepper.  To grill indoors, preheat a grill pan over medium heat.  Douse a paper towel with olive oil, then swipe it across the grill pan so you have just enough olive oil so the avocados won't stick (they will supply their own fat).  Place avocados on the grill, cut-side down.  Grill for 1 full minute.

Meanwhile, preheat a 10-inch saute pan.  Add 1/2 cup of olive oil to the pan, add minced garlic and saute until it gets light brown.  Add julienned basil and saute until wilted and transfer to a large glass or ceramic bowl.  Take the avocados off the grill and add to the bowl.  With a fork, mash the avocado/basil mixture well.  Add sour cream and stir.  Add Parmesan and stir.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALSA CRUDA ===
  5                     vine-ripened tomatoes - (to 6)
  1              large  red bell pepper
  2                     jalape√ío chiles
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 7) -- plus
                        extra for brushing bread
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Wooden skewers -- soaked in water for
                        30 minutes
  1                     onion -- sliced thick rings
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh oregano leaves
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  1                     flank steak - (abt 1 lb)
  4             ounces  Gorgonzola -- crumbled
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano
  4              large  bread slices -- cut from a good
                        crusty loaf

Prepare the grill and let it burn down to medium coals.  Core the tomatoes and cut an X through the skin on the bottom of each.  In a bowl, toss the tomatoes, bell pepper, and chiles with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the olive oil; season with salt and pepper.  Secure the chilies with metal or soaked wooden skewers so they won't fall through the grill grate.  Place the tomatoes on the grill, X-side down and away from direct heat, with the other vegetables.  Cover the grill and cook, turning the bell pepper and chiles to char evenly all over, until the tomatoes have softened but are still firm enough to stand on their own and the bell pepper and chilies are blistered, about 15 minutes.  Put the pepper and chiles in a bowl and cover to steam and loosen the skins.  Let the tomatoes cool to room temperature.

In a large, shallow bowl, combine 4 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, vinegar, oregano.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Set aside.

Peel the grilled vegetables.  Cut the tomatoes in half horizontally and squeeze out the seeds into a sieve suspended over a bowl to catch the juices.  Finely chop the tomatoes.  Return the tomato pulp and any juices from the chopping board to the bowl holding the tomato juices.  Seed and chop the chiles.  Cut the bell pepper into small dice.  Mash the chiles and taste to determine their heat.

Add all vegetables with garlic olive oil mixture.  Mix well before topping pasta or flank steak.

Season the flank steak with salt, pepper, and brush with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Grill, turning once, until done to your taste, about 10 minutes for rare meat (to cook indoors try a cast-iron, skillet or bistecca pan).  A minute before removing steak from the heat, top with oregano and Gorgonzola.  Transfer to a cutting board, drizzle with another 1 tablespoon olive oil, and crumble the remaining 1/2 teaspoon oregano over the top.  Let rest for about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, brush the bread on both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill the bread on both sides until brown and crunchy on the outside but still soft within.

Carve the meat on the diagonal into thin slices and arrange on a platter or plates, on top of crusty bread.  Top with about 1/4 cup of the Salsa Cruda, per slice of bread drizzled over each portion.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  fresh yeast
                        = (or 2 envelopes active dry yeast)
  2               cups  whole milk -- lukewarm
  1         tablespoon  sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  5               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for the work surface
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1                cup  red grapes -- halved or quartered
  1                cup  golden raisins
  1 1/2       teaspoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
  1                     egg -- beaten well

In a large bowl or the work bowl of an electric mixer, dissolve the yeast in the milk and add 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 cup of the flour.  Mix well, cover bowl with tea towel and let stand in a warm place about 15 minutes for the yeast to activate.  Place risen dough in mixer, set aside.

Take a large saute pan and heat it dry over medium-high heat.  Pour in 1 cup of the olive oil and add rosemary.  Add grapes, and raisins, mix together and allow to cool.

Begin to mix the dough, slowly, and mix another 4 cups of flour in to the yeast mixture with the dough hook attachment, then add a pinch of gray salt.  Add half of the olive oil/grape mixture into dough.  Knead until smooth with hands.  Form the dough into a ball.  Place some olive oil in large bowl to coat the sides.  Place dough ball into bowl, and cover with tea towel.  Cover with a damp towel and allow to rise in refrigerator until doubled in bulk about 45 minutes, or up to overnight for a fuller rise.

The next day, take the risen dough, and place in mixing bowl.  With more olive oil from the grape/raisin mixture, press dough down into a flat disk with the heel of your hand.  Using your fingertips, nudge the dough into a rectangle.  The dough can be rolled but the pressure will produce heavier bread.  Transfer the dough to the baking sheet and brush with the remaining 1/3 cup olive oil.  Cover with tea towel, and let rise again until doubled, 30 to 40 minutes.

To bake, preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Bake 15 minutes then remove from the oven and brush with the egg.  Sprinkle with the remaining grape mixture then the remaining sugar.  Top with lemon zest and finish with some coarse salt.  Return to the oven and continue to bake until golden brown on top and crisp on the bottom, about 7 or 8 minutes.

In a large bowl or the work bowl of an electric mixer, dissolve the yeast in the milk and add 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 cup of the flour.  Mix well, cover bowl with tea towel and let stand in a warm place about 15 minutes for the yeast to activate.  Place risen dough in mixer, set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Take a large saute pan and heat it dry over medium-high heat.  Pour in 1 cup of the olive oil and add rosemary.  Add grapes, and raisins, mix together and allow to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Begin to mix the dough, slowly, and mix another 4 cups of flour in to the yeast mixture with the dough hook attachment, then add a pinch of gray salt.  Add half of the olive oil/grape mixture into dough.  Knead until smooth with hands.  Form the dough into a ball.  Place some olive oil in large bowl to coat the sides.  Place dough ball into bowl, and cover with tea towel.  Cover with a damp towel and allow to rise in refrigerator until doubled in bulk about 45 minutes, or up to overnight for a fuller rise.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The next day, take the risen dough, and place in mixing bowl.  With more olive oil from the grape/raisin mixture, press dough down into a flat disk with the heel of your hand.  Using your fingertips, nudge the dough into a rectangle.  The dough can be rolled but the pressure will produce heavier bread.  Transfer the dough to the baking sheet and brush with the remaining 1/3 cup olive oil.  Cover with tea towel, and let rise again until doubled, 30 to 40 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To bake, preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Bake 15 minutes then remove from the oven and brush with the egg.  Sprinkle with the remaining grape mixture then the remaining sugar.  Top with lemon zest and finish with some coarse salt.  Return to the oven and continue to bake until golden brown on top and crisp on the bottom, about 7 or 8 minutes.  Let cool in the pan before cutting.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  ripe heirloom tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
     1/4           cup  minced red onion
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon leaves
  1           teaspoon  sea salt -- preferably gray salt
                        Several grinds black pepper
                        Panzanella Croutons -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  trimmed arugula
                        Parmesan wedge -- for shaving

Drain the tomatoes in a sieve to remove excess liquid while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

In a bowl, combine the tomatoes, onion, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, basil, tarragon, salt, and pepper.  Add the croutons and toss well.

Divide tomato mixture among 4 plates.  Top each serving with an equal amount of the arugula.  With a vegetable peeler, shave the Parmesan over the salad.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Michael's Notes:  I've used basil and tarragon here, but you can use any herbs you like.  Parsley and marjoram come to mind as good alternatives.

Heat a large skillet or roasting pan over medium-high heat.  Add the butter.  When the butter begins to brown, add lemon juice, then add the apples and salt.  Cook until the apples just begin to color, about 4 minutes.

Stir in the honey.  Roast the apples in the oven until soft and lightly caramelized, about 12 minutes.  Fork mash for a chunky version or puree in food processor for a smoother sauce.

Serve warm, room temperature or cold.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

     3/4           cup  water
  1                     vanilla bean
                        = (or 1 tspn vanilla extract)
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  instant espresso - (heaping)
  1              pinch  salt
  2 1/2         ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- grated
                        = (the best quality chocolate possible)

                       Leftover Pumpkin Pie Brulee

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Leftover pumpkin pie
  5        tablespoons  sugar

Peel crust off the outside of overturned pieces of pie and line the inside of small ramekins of coffee cups with the pie crust pieces.  Spoon pumpkin pie filling (straight from the pie!) equally into small ramekins or stoneware coffee cups.

Sprinkle a tablespoon of sugar over the filling in each ramekin.

Using a mini-torch, torch the top until sugar is caramelized.  The ramekins can also be browned under a broiler.  If using a broiler, stick the cups inside a pan filled with 1/2-inch of water and place under the broiler until just browned on top.

This recipe yields 5 servings.

Comments:  Propane gas torches are highly flammable and should be kept away from heat, open flame, and prolonged exposure to sunlight.  They should only be used in well-ventilated areas.  When lighting a propane gas torch, place the torch on a flat, steady surface, facing away from you.  Light the match or lighter and then open the gas valve.  Light the gas jet, and blow out the match.  Always turn off the burner valve to "finger tight" when finished using the torch.  Children should never use a propane gas torch without adult supervision.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  medium Yukon gold potatoes
  3        tablespoons  salt -- plus
                        additional for seasoning
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  minced chives
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves -- chopped fine
  1         tablespoon  fresh tarragon leaves -- chopped fine
  2               cups  lemon extra-virgin olive oil
                        Zest of 4 lemons -- (optional)

In a large saucepan, add potatoes and water to cover by 1-inch.  Bring to boil over high heat.  Lower the heat to a simmer, and cook until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Dry by setting out on a board or in a colander.

Quarter potatoes and set on a sheet pan in 1 layer to dry.  Once they're dry, place potatoes in a bowl.  Mash with a fork until broken up but not smooth.  Add pepper, chives, thyme and tarragon.  Season with salt.  Mix well.  Add the oil a half cup at a time.  You may find you do not need all the oil.  Add lemon zest, if using.  Mix well.

This recipe yields 5 servings.

Chef's note:  Cook the potatoes whole so they don't get water logged and dilute the flavor.

  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  tasso ham or bacon
  5              large  shallots -- minced

  1                cup  white wine
  2               cups  cream
  1                cup  grated fontina
     1/2           cup  grated sharp Cheddar
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan
  18            medium  to large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  2               cups  spinach - (gently packed)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Drain the pasta, making sure to shake all of the water off and out of the shells.

In a large ovenproof baking dish, place drained shells.  Add the cheese and shrimp mixture and gently fold into the pasta.  Sprinkle with the bread crumbs and chopped parsley.  Place under the broiler until the breadcrumbs are toasted about 2 to 3 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  mashed potatoes
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

     1/4           cup  extra virgin olive oil
                        Leftover gravy

Re-season potatoes with salt and pepper, stir in cheese.  Take a mayonnaise or peanut butter lid, line with plastic wrap to use as a mold.  Pack the potato mixture into the lid, unwrap it and place the patty on a baking sheet.  You may refrigerate them covered with plastic wrap until the next day, or fry immediately.

To cook, dredge the patties in flour.  Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, add patties.  Just before frying, dredge the patties again with flour.

Add the patties to the oil without crowding them (you may have to cook them in batches).  Cook until underside is golden brown, about 5 minutes, flip and brown the other side.  Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels.  Serve hot with leftover gravy.

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  tomatoes (heirloom if possible) -- cored, roughly cut
  2                     jalape√ío chilis - (to 3) -- stems removed,
                        and roughly cut
  1                     bulb fennel, white part -- roughly cut
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     lemon -- halved
     1/2           cup  favorite spice rub
  6              whole  red jalape√íos - (to 8)
                        Jalape√ío Ice Cubes -- (see recipe)
                        Lemon vodka -- as needed

Place tomatoes, jalape√íos, and fennel in a bowl.  Season liberally with pepper, salt and the Worchestershire sauce.  Coat with olive oil, tossing lightly.  Put a few of the tomatoes in the blender and liquefy √± this will make it easier to puree the rest of the solids.  Add the fennel/tomato/jalape√ío mixture to a blender and puree until liquefied.  Store in refrigerator up to 6 hours until chilled.

Assembling the cocktail:  Rub a cut lemon around the rim of a chilled martini glass.  Dip the glass, upside down, in salt or your favorite spice rub.  Slice the tip of a red jalape√ío pepper vertically and slip over the rim.  Place 1 or 2 of the jalape√ío ice cubes in each glass, pour chilled bloody maria mixture on top, and top each glass with 1 ounce of lemon vodka.  Stir carefully and serve.

This recipe yields 1 large pitcher (6 to 8 servings).

Hint:  If you can find them, heirloom tomatoes can really boost the flavor of this drink.  Heirloom tomatoes are typically varieties that were grown over 50 years ago, before tomatoes were bred for ease of picking and distribution.  Heirlooms tend to be a little more acidic than modern commercial tomatoes, and often the fresh tomato flavor is more pronounced.

Hint:   If you don't have lemon vodka, use regular vodka and squeeze a little lemon juice in each glass.

              Mozzarella Martini With Fresh Tomato Consomme

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  clear tomato water set aside from
                        Tomato Puree - (see recipe) -- refrigerated
  1                     green zebra tomato -- thinly sliced
  4                     fresh mozzarella boccacini - (1" dia ea)
  4                     cherry tomatoes
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8              large  fresh basil leaves
                        Basil oil -- optional

You will need enough tomato water to fill your martini glasses, so measure their capacity, probably something between 5 and 9 ounces.  Chill the martini glasses in the freezer, if there is room, or refrigerate 1 hour ahead of serving.  (A freezer gives a heavy frost.)

Place 1 slice of green tomato in each glass.  Halve or quarter the bocconcini if they are larger than 1 inch in diameter.  Thread a bocconccini, and a cherry tomato onto each of 4 wooden skewers 4 to 5 inches long.  Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with basil oil, if desired.  Working quickly, divide the tomato liquid among the chilled martini glasses.  Balance the skewers on top of the glasses, then take a leaf of basil per glass, and rub it around the glass rim, before placing on top of each glass, near skewer.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Cook's Note:  It is impossible to give a specific amount for the tomatoes because how much "water" a tomato releases depends on many factors, including the growing season and the variety.  Do not let the tomato pulp go to waste.  Use this recipe as an excuse to start your quick tomato sauce season.  You can freeze or can your sauce and then have it on hand for quick meals.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
                        Sea salt -- preferably gray salt
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh oregano
                        = (or 1 tspn dried oregano)
  1                     bay leaf
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Open the can of tomatoes and pour the juice into a bowl.  Use the lid to press against the tomatoes to extract as much juice as possible.  In the can, avoiding cutting yourself with the rim, use your hand to squeeze the tomatoes to a pulp.  Re-strain out the new juices, and reserve the juice and pulp separately.  Fill the empty can half full with water and set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and cook with a pinch of salt, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook until golden.  Add the tomato juices and bring to a boil.  Simmer rapidly until the juice thickens, then add the crushed tomato pulp, oregano, the half can of water, bay leaf, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Adjust the heat to maintain a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching, until the mixture thickens and reduces to about 3 1/2 cups, about 30 to 45 minutes.  Discard the bay leaf.

This recipe yields 3 1/2 cups.

                           Next Day Turkey Soup

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello

Categories    : Poultry                         Soups/Stews
                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  chicken broth
  1                     turkey carcass -- all meat removed
  1                     onion -- halved, plus
  1                     onion -- minced
  1                     carrot -- halved lengthwise,
                        plus
  1                     carrot -- minced
  1              whole  celery stalk -- plus
  1                     celery stalk -- minced
  2                     bay leaves
  3               cups  dark turkey meat
  2                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3               cups  leftover cooked Thanksgiving side
                        vegetables
                        = (Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes,
                        green beans)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh sage leaves

Put chicken broth, turkey, onion halves, carrot halves, 1 celery stalk, and 1 bay leaf in a large stock pot.  Bring to a boil, then simmer about 1 1/2 hours.  Finely dice the remaining onion, carrot and celery and reserve.

Dice the turkey meat.  Make sure meat pieces are no larger than the size of a soup spoon.  (If preparing soup the next day, be sure to store leftover turkey meat in an airtight container before placing it in the refrigerator, top with 1 or 2 ladles full of broth to keep meat moist.)

Before straining broth, remove large bones and carcass with tongs.  Strain the broth through a sieve, covered with wet cheese cloth.  Discard the solids.  Transfer broth to a bowl set in a bath of ice water, which will cool the broth quickly and help keep it fresher longer.  This can be done the night before and stored in the refrigerator until the next day.

In a large soup pot, heat garlic cloves in the olive oil.  Allow to brown slightly and add minced carrots, celery, and onion.  Sweat over medium-low heat until softened, about 7 or 8 minutes.

Dice the leftover vegetables (here Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, and green beans).  Add the chopped sage to the soup pot along with the turkey broth and the remaining bay leaf.  Bring to a simmer.  When simmering, add Brussels sprouts, green beans and diced turkey meat to the soup.  Bring it back up to a simmer.  Finally, add the sweet potatoes to the center, and gently push them down.  Turn the heat off and cover.  Allow to sit and steam for 5 to 7 minutes.

Let simmer for 5 more minutes and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Condiments

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  6               cups  crustless cubed 1/2" day-old bread
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  finely-grated Parmesan

Preheat oven to 375 degrees and preheat a cookie sheet in it.

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and cook until it foams.  Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Add the bread cubes and toss to coat with the butter.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer the bread to a baking sheet.  Immediately sprinkle with the cheese and toss again while warm to melt the cheese.

Bake, stirring once or twice, until the croutons are crisp and lightly colored on the outside but still soft within, about 8 or 9 minutes.  Let cool.  Store in an airtight container.

This recipe yields about 6 cups.

Michael's Notes:  I use a serrated knife to remove the crust from day-old bread, then switch to a chef's knife to cut the cubes because it doesn't tear the bread.  Also note that I recommend grating the Parmesan finely so that it will stick to the bread better.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  chopped and smashed anchovies
  2          teaspoons  salted or canned capers -- rinsed and chopped
  1 1/2           cups  marinara sauce
     1/4           cup  clam juice (preferably unsalted)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2      teaspoons  hot chili paste -- finely chopped
                        = (Peperoncino Piccante Chili "Paste"
                        recommended)
     1/2           cup  roughly-chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
                        = (if you don't have any tomatoes on
                        hand, increase marinara sauce to 2 cups)
     1/2           cup  Kalamata olives -- pitted and quartered
     1/2           cup  picoline olives -- pitted and quartered
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh oregano leaves
                        = (or 1 1/2 tspns dried oregano)
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley -- (optional)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Smash out the anchovy fillet with the flat side of the knife.  After the capers are rinsed, mash those with flat of knife as well.

Whisk the marinara and clam juice together in large sauce pot, season with fresh black pepper, to taste.  Add the anchovies, capers, and chili paste, and stir.  Add the tomatoes to sauce with the olives.  Add parsley, oregano, vinegar, and olive oil.  Bring to boil.  Check and adjust the seasoning.

Just before serving, warm the sauce and toss in a pan with some hot pasta.  Top with grated pecorino.  Add some pasta water, if desired, to thin out the sauce.  The sauce is also terrific over grilled fish or on a bruschetta.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 to 3 cups or 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into large chunks
  1 1/2         pounds  English peas
                        = (or 2 lbs frozen peas)
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic - (abt 3 to 4 cloves)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Grated Parmesan -- (optional)

Put the potatoes in a large saucepan with cold water to cover by 3 inches.  Salt the water, cover and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes.  While the potatoes are cooking, cook the peas in a separate saucepan of salted water.  Simmer until just tender, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove with a sieve and cool on a baking sheet.  When the potatoes are done, drain well, scatter on a baking sheet, and let cool for several minutes.

In a small saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of the cream until it reaches a boil then simmer for a few minutes.  Add the cream to a blender with the cooked peas and puree until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until the butter stops foaming and turns a light brown.  Add the garlic and cook quickly until pale gold.  Add remaining cream, season, to taste, with salt and pepper and bring to a boil.

Press the cooled potatoes through a ricer or food mill into the butter and garlic mixture, tossing to coat.

Reduce the heat to low.  Add the remaining butter by tablespoonfuls, stirring vigorously after each addition.  In this way, the butter does not melt into a golden puddle.  Instead, it forms an emulsion with the potatoes, creating a very smooth puree.

Fold the pea puree into the mashed potatoes and adjust seasoning, as necessary.  Instead of salt, the puree can be seasoned with a little grated Parmesan, if desired.

Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                 Planked Salmon With Honey-Balsamic Glaze

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  side of salmon
                        = (or 4 six-ounce salmon fillets)
  1         tablespoon  fine sea salt -- preferably gray salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
                        Melted butter -- for brushing salmon
  2                     untreated cedar planks, each abt 5" by 12" -- soaked in water to
                        cover for at least 12 hours (available at
                        hardware stores)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for oiling planks

Preheat the broiler. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

If using a side of salmon, cut about halfway through the flesh about every 5 to 6 inches so there are some spaces for the glazes to sink in.  If using salmon fillets, slice about 8 to 10 sliced angles into flesh, to help flesh more completely soak in the glaze.

In a small bowl or cup, mix the salt, pepper, and dry mustard.

In a medium glass bowl, heat the honey in the microwave for 30 seconds to liquefy further.  Remove from the microwave and mix in balsamic vinegar.

Brush the top of the salmon fillets (not the skin side) with the melted butter.  Season the flesh side with the spice mixture.  Brush with the honey-balsamic mixture, reserving some for later.

Put the soaked planks under the hot broiler, about 5 inches from the heat source, until the wood is browned on top, about 3 minutes.  With tongs, carefully remove the planks from the oven.

Immediately brush the browned surface with olive oil, then lay the salmon fillets on the oiled surface, skin side down.

Put 2 cookie sheets in the oven below where the planks will go to catch any glazes or juices that run off.  Return the planks to the broiler and cook the fish for 10 minutes.  Baste with honey-balsamic and place in oven.  Cook until it is done to your taste, about 10 to 15 more minutes, or 20 minutes total for medium.

Remove the fillets to a platter, or immediately serve directly from the planks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                           Poached Garlic Soup

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  diced 1/4" onion
  1                cup  finely-chopped leek, white part only
     1/2           cup  diced 1/4" celery
  1                     bay leaf
  1         tablespoon  grey salt
  1                cup  diced peeled russet potatoes
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  chicken stock or
                        canned low salt chicken broth - (to 5)
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-chopped fresh oregano leaves
  4               cups  roughly-chopped spinach leaves
  1                cup  heavy cream

Peel the garlic cloves, cut in half lengthwise, and remove the central greenish core.  Put in a small pan of salted water and bring to a boil.  Drain and repeat twice to remove the garlic's heat and leave only the sweetness behind.

Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat until hot.  Add the onion, leek, celery, bay leaf, and a little salt to draw the water out of the onion.  Cover and cook until the vegetables are soft but not brown, about 10 minutes.  Add the potatoes.  Add the blanched garlic and stock.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook until the vegetables are very tender, about 15 minutes.

Remove soup from the heat and cool to room temperature.  Place cooled pot with soup in refrigerator to chill.  Day of party re-heat soup over medium heat.  Add the oregano, spinach, and cream and cook 1 minute to wilt the spinach.  Transfer to blender and carefully blend until smooth *see note below.

*When blending hot liquids:  Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes.  Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway.  If using a blender, release one corner of the lid.  This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions.  Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.

This recipe yields 7 cups, 4 to 6 servings.

                              Potato Gnocchi

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  1              pound  russet potatoes
  3              large  egg yolks - (to 4)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  gray sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting board and dough

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Spread a layer of kosher salt on a baking sheet and arrange the potatoes on top (see Cook's Note).  Bake until a bit overcooked, about 45 minutes.  Let sit until cool enough to handle, cut in half, and scoop out the flesh.  Reserve the potato skins, if desired, for another use.

Pass the potatoes through a potato ricer or grate them on the large holes of a box grater.  You should have about 2 cups.  Make a mound of potatoes on the counter with a well in the middle, add 3 of the egg yolks, the cheese, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.  Mix in the potatoes and mix well with hands.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the flour over the potatoes and, using your knuckles, press it into the potatoes.  Fold the mass over on itself and press down again.  Sprinkle on more flour, little by little, folding and pressing the dough until it just holds together, (try not to knead it.)  Work any dough clinging to your fingers back into the dough.  If the mixture is too dry, add another egg yolk or a little water.  The dough should give under slight pressure.  It will feel firm but yielding.  To test if the dough is the correct consistency, take a piece and roll it with your hands on a well-floured board into a rope 1/2-inch in diameter.  If the dough holds together, it is ready.  If not, add more flour, fold and press the dough several more times, and test again.

Keeping your work surface and the dough lightly floured, cut the dough into 4 pieces.  Roll each piece into a rope about 1/2-inch in diameter.  Cut into 1/2-inch-long pieces.  Lightly flour the gnocchi as you cut them.  You can cook these as is or form them into the classic gnocchi shape with a gnocchi board, ridged butter paddle, or the tines of a large fork turned upside down.  Rest the bottom edge of the gnocchi board on the work surface, then tilt it at about a 45 degree angle.  Take each piece and squish it lightly with your thumb against the board while simultaneously pushing it away from you.  It will roll away and around your thumb, taking on a cupped shape √≥ with ridges on the outer curve from the board and a smooth surface on the inner curve where your thumb was.  (Shaping them takes some time and dexterity.  You might make a batch just for practice.)  The indentation holds the sauce and helps gnocchi cook faster.

As you shape the gnocchi, dust them lightly with flour and scatter them on baking sheets lined with parchment paper or waxed paper.  Set gnocchi filled cookie sheet in front of a fan on low for 1/2 hour (turning gnocchi after 15 minutes).  If you will not cook the gnocchi until the next day or later, freeze them.  Alternatively, you can poach them now, drain and toss with a little olive oil, let cool, then refrigerate several hours or overnight.  To reheat, dip in hot water for 10 to 15 seconds, then toss with browned butter until hot.

When ready to cook, bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt.  Drop in the gnocchi and cook for about 90 seconds from the time they rise to the surface.  Remove the cooked gnocchi with a skimmer, shake off the excess water, and serve as desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Cook's Note:  Baking potatoes on a layer of salt allows heat to circulate 360 degrees.  Scrape the salt into a jar and reuse it again and again.  If you do not have time to shape the gnocchi, you can freeze the dough, defrost it in the refrigerator, and then shape it.  To freeze shaped gnocchi, line baking sheets with waxed paper and dust with flour.  Spread the gnocchi on the prepared sheets and freeze until hard.  Remove to individual-portion-size freezer bags.  Store in the freezer for up to 1 month.  To cook, drop the frozen gnocchi into boiling salted water.  Cook for about 2 minutes after they rise to the surface.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MUSTARD PARMESAN COATING ===
  20            cloves  garlic -- peeled
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh -- roughly chopped
                        thyme
  3        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
                        === STEAKS ===
  3                     thick beef rib-eye steaks - (abt 2" to 2 1
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Olive oil -- for drizzling
  2               cups  fresh finely-grated parmesan cheese

In a pre-heated saute pan over medium-low heat, pan roast the garlic in olive oil, tossing only once.  Allow to brown for about 5 to 10 minutes.  Drain the cloves through a strainer.  Allow to cool before mashing roughly with fork.  Add thyme to garlic paste and mash that in as well.  When they are pasty but still chunky, mix in the Dijon mustard.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Preheat a grill to high.

Season steaks well with salt and pepper.  Pound the seasonings in well.  Drizzle steaks on both sides with olive oil.  Place meat on grill to brown, about 5 minutes each side.

Remove steaks from grill, place on a large cookie tray.  Cover top generously with mustard parmesan coating.  Top with large piles of parmesan, spreading out to edges carefully with fingers.  Place steaks in oven for 8 or 9 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a pre-heated saute pan over medium-low heat, pan roast the garlic in olive oil, tossing only once.  Allow to brown for about 5 to 10 minutes.  Drain the cloves through a strainer.  Allow to cool before mashing roughly with fork.  Add thyme to garlic paste and mash that in as well.  When they are pasty but still chunky, mix in the Dijon mustard.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Preheat a grill to high.

Season steaks well with salt and pepper.  Pound the seasonings in well.  Drizzle steaks on both sides with olive oil.  Place meat on grill to brown, about 5 minutes each side.

Remove steaks from grill, place on a large cookie tray.  Cover top generously with mustard parmesan coating.  Top with large piles of parmesan, spreading out to edges carefully with fingers.  Place steaks in oven for 8 or 9 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  prosciutto (preferably from the shank) -- very finely minced
                        or ground with the medium blade
                        of a meat grinder
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

Place prosciutto in heated pan.  Drizzle bits with olive oil, and cook, stirring.  The prosciutto will give off steam for about 5 minutes while it releases its moisture.  When the hiss of steam turns to a sizzle, turn the heat down to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the prosciutto bits are crisp, about 30 minutes.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bits to several thicknesses of paper towel to drain.  The bits will crisp even more as they cool.  Use immediately or freeze the bits for up to 6 months and warm in a skillet as needed.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 cups.

Tip:  The best way to make these bits is with the shanks of prosciutto.  Ask your local butcher to save those shanks, and grind them on the medium grind if you want to save some chopping, or dice it finely yourself.  Shank should cost about half of sliced prosciutto, as the store probably has no use for it.

Comments:  Whether you are chopping the prosciutto by hand or putting it through a meat grinder, you'll have an easier time if the prosciutto is partially frozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RADICCHIO LETTUCE CUPS ===
  12             whole  radicchio leaves
  10              cups  ice water
                        === CAPONATA ===
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil - (about)
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1 1/2           cups  diced 1/4" onion
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     anchovy fillets -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  chili flakes
  2        tablespoons  caper juice
     1/3           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1                     eggplant - (abt 1 lb) -- peeled, and
                        diced into small pieces (see Chef's Note)
  1         tablespoon  roughly chopped capers
     1/2           cup  peeled seeded 1/4" diced Roasted Peppers -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley

Soak lettuce leaves for about 10 minutes in ice water to reduce bitterness.  Wrap in damp paper towel to keep moist until ready to serve.

In large saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat until hot.  Add the garlic and saute briefly until brown.  Add the onion and brown lightly, about 3 minutes.  Reduce the heat to medium, add a pinch each of salt and pepper (go easy on the salt because the anchovies will add that extra bit of saltiness).  Continue to cook until the onion is well browned, about 5 minutes.  Add the anchovies and cook and stir until they melt into the onion.  Add the chili flakes, then the caper juice and stand back to avoid getting splattered.  Stir and scrape all around the pan.  Add 1/4 cup of the vinegar, return the heat to high, and boil until reduced and thick, 1 to 2 minutes.

In a separate pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until hot.  Add the eggplant and saute until browned and cooked through, about 6 minutes.  Saute only a small bunch at a time, to avoid letting the eggplant boil in its own juices.  If the pan gets too dry, add more olive oil as the cooking progresses - if you add too much olive oil early in the process, the eggplant will absorb all of it and still need more.  Make sure to scrape the bottom of the pan well so nothing burns.  Season with salt and pepper.  Scrape into a bowl.

Add the garlic-anchovy mixture to the eggplant with the capers and remaining vinegar.  Stir well, then scrape into a bowl.  Stir in the roasted peppers and parsley and taste again for seasoning.  Let cool to room temperature before serving.

When ready to assemble, place 1 to 2 tablespoons of caponata in chilled lettuce cups.  Wrap into ball and enjoy.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Chef's Note:  If you plan to serve the caponata as part of an elegant appetizer, use a sharp chef's knife to cut the eggplant into 1/4-inch dice.  If your style is more casual, you may dice them as large as 3/4 inch.  The caponata also makes a wonderful sandwich filling or stuffing a chicken paillard.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bulb garlic
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Chop off the top part of the garlic bulb, exposing the tops of the cloves.  Wrap the garlic bulb loosely in foil, pour in olive oil, and top with thyme.  Tighten the wrap around the bulb, leaving the top slightly loose to allow heat into the bulb.  Place the bulb in the oven and bake for 45 minutes, or until the roasted cloves begin to peak out of the head.

This recipe yields 1 bulb.

Chop off the top part of the garlic bulb, exposing the tops of the cloves.  Wrap the garlic bulb loosely in foil, pour in olive oil, and top with thyme.  Tighten the wrap around the bulb, leaving the top slightly loose to allow heat into the bulb.  Place the bulb in the oven and bake for 45 minutes, or until the roasted cloves begin to peak out of the head.

                           Roasted Garlic Bread

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              heads  garlic
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3             sprigs  thyme -- plus
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped thyme
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  1                     loaf of good crusty bread -- cut into slices

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cut top from each head of garlic, exposing the cloves.  Place heads of garlic (cut side up), on a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil.  Pour olive oil over them, and top with thyme springs.  Season with salt and pepper.  Wrap the foil tightly.  Place in a small ovenproof pan, and bake until the cloves begin to pop out, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and cool.

To remove the cloves, open the foil and squeeze the lower part of the head of garlic.  In a small bowl, mash the cloves to form a paste.  (At this point the paste can be used or stored in the refrigerator or freezer.)

Add butter and chopped thyme to the bowl, stirring to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Toast both sides of the bread, using a hot grill, grill pan, or broiler.  Spread the roasted garlic butter paste onto the toasted bread.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    celery stalks -- peeled
     1/2           cup  pecans
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1         tablespoon  melted butter
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  1              pinch  sea salt
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  2                     red jalape√íos -- seeded

Cut the celery into 4-inch-long pieces, then slice off a thin edge at the rounded part of the stalk to help them lie flat while stuffing.  Place them in a bowl of ice water and refrigerate until ready to stuff.

In a bowl, toss the pecans with the honey, butter, cayenne and salt, making sure the nuts are well coated.  Spread on a baking sheet, bake until nuts are toasted, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow them to cool completely.

Chop pecans coarsely in a food processor.  Add the cream cheese and process until smooth.  Remove celery from the refrigerator, drain and dry well.  Scrape cream cheese/nut mixture out of the food processor into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.  Fill each celery boat with a generous amount of the mixture.

Cut the jalape√íos into thick strips, and then cut each strip in half at an angle.  This should look like a sail.  Garnish each of your celery boats with its red jalape√ío sail.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  1                     box graham crackers
  1                     bag marshmallows
  4                     bars good quality milk chocolate

                        Halloween cookie cutters

Lay the graham crackers in a single layer on a microwave-safe plate.  Heat them in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute on high.

Using a metal cookie cutter, cut the graham crackers into a Halloween shape (pumpkins, bats, cats, and eyeballs without too many little details work best).

Light a hibachi on a table near your door.  Make sure there is fireproof stone underneath to prevent melting things.  Next to the hibachi, put some wooden skewers.  Set out a tray of the marshmallows, graham cracker shapes and chocolate near the hibachi.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless steaks - (abt 4 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Flour -- for dredging
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4               cups  beef stock
  8             ounces  white button mushrooms -- quartered
  8             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, and
                        caps quartered
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1                     onion -- minced
  1                     carrot -- diced
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  balsamic vinegar
                        Pea Whipped Potatoes -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

Use a jaccard steak tenderizing tool, or tenderize the steak yourself with a fork.  Lay the meat out in front of you, pushing it flat with your hands or a meat mallet, and pull it gently apart with tines of the fork until the meat is slightly pulled apart and tender.  Season with salt and pepper and dredge in flour.  In a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat, add olive oil and brown steaks, in batches if necessary, on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.  Set aside, keep warm.

Meanwhile, in a saucepan, reduce stock by half.

Season mushrooms with salt and pepper, to taste.  Saute quartered mushrooms in the same pan as the meat, in the leftover olive oil, until very brown, about 5 minutes.  Add butter, minced onion, carrot, thyme, and garlic.  Cook until vegetables are caramelized, about 5 minutes, add balsamic vinegar and reduce for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add broth, slide meat back into sauce, cover and bake until tender, about 1 hour.

Stack steaks with pea whipped potatoes and drizzle with balsamic/mushroom sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

        Salsa Rosa Tossed With Spaghettini Topped With Flank Steak

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALSA ROSSA ===
  12             whole  red bell peppers
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for coating, plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  grey sea salt
  4              whole  serrano chiles
  6                     garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  tomato puree
  2             sprigs  fresh oregano
     3/4           cup  red wine vinegar
                        === STEAK & SPAGHETTINI ===
  1                     flank steak
  1              pound  spaghettini

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Coat peppers with olive oil and place on a foil lined baking sheet.  Salt liberally.  Bake in the oven, turning every 10 minutes until peppers are blistered and black, about 20 to 30 minutes total.

Meanwhile, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a hot saute pan.  Add the serrano chiles and the garlic.  Lower the heat to moderate, and cook, turning occasionally, until the chiles are softened, lightly browned, and blistered on all sides.  Remove the pan from the heat and let the chiles cool in the oil for several minutes

When the roasted bell peppers are blistered and blackened, removed them from the oven, place in a glass bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  This will steam the skins off and make them easier to remove.  After 15 to 20 minutes, remove the peppers and peel.  Remove the seeds, stems and ribs.  Do not run under water √± this will just wash the flavor off!  You should have about 4 cups.

Note:  You can roast the peppers under the broiler or over a gas flame, if you prefer, but I like to do them in a hot oven.  It takes a little longer, but you don't have to monitor them as closely.

Chop the garlic finely, then use the side of your knife to mash them to a paste √± a pinch of grey salt will help this process.  Mashing insures that the garlic add just an undercurrent of flavor, with no big pieces to bite into.  Add to the blender.

When cool enough to handle, peel the chiles and remove the stems and seeds (or leave some or all of the seeds if you prefer a spicy sauce).  Then add the tomato puree and the oregano (no need to chop the oregano because it's going to be blended in).  Add to the blender the olive oil used to roast the chilis and garlic.  Turn the blender on high until everything is smooth and thick.

Turn a medium saute pan on high for 30 seconds with about 1/4 cup of olive oil.  Stand back as you pour the blender mixture into the pan.  Be careful, it can splatter.  This second heating brings the flavors together.  Season with salt and pepper.  Whisk in the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and the red wine vinegar.  The vinegar gives it a little sharpness and protects it in the refrigerator for about a week.

Ladle it into canning jars and store in the refrigerator for a week.  It can be frozen for 5 months.

Preheat a grill to high.  Season the steak with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil.  Grill the steak to medium-rare, about 4 minutes per side.  Remove from the grill and let rest for 10 minutes.

To a large pot of boiling, salted water, add the spaghettini and cook to al dente.  Drain and toss with the salsa rossa.

Slice the flank steak thinly against the grain and place on top of the pasta.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ONION RINGS ===
  2               cups  buttermilk
  2               cups  Arborio Rice Coating -- (see recipe)
  6                     red onions -- thickly sliced,
                        and loosely separated into rings
  8               cups  peanut oil
                        === TOMATO STACK ===
  4                     vine-ripened tomatoes
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- to drizzle
     1/2           cup  basil leaves -- julienne
                        Balsamic vinegar -- to drizzle
  1                cup  crumbled blue cheese -- frozen

For the Onion Rings:  Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl.  In a separate bowl spread out the rice coating.  Take onion rings and coat with buttermilk, and then cover with coating, shaking off excess.  Place coated rings on a tray.

In a large deep saucepan, heat peanut oil to 375 degrees.  With a slotted wire spoon, carefully lower the coated rings into pan to fry.  Do the rings in small batches to allow oil to remain a consistent temperature.  Place fried rings on a paper towel on a tray to dry.

For the Tomato Stack:  Cut a small slice from the bottom of the tomatoes - enough so that they will stand.  Slice the tomatoes into 1/2-inch thick slices (about 2 or 3), leaving the stem on top.  Season the slices with salt and pepper to taste, drizzle with olive oil.

Place the basil leaves in between the tomato slices, and re-stack tomato.  Serve re-stacked tomatoes around a larger stack of onion rings in center of a large serving plate.  Drizzle more olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Grate the frozen blue cheese over top.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced fresh wild or domestic
                        mushrooms
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

  1         tablespoon  minced garlic -- plus
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2         pound  yellow squash -- cut into 1/4" dice,
                        about 1 1/2 cups
     1/4           cup  diced red bell pepper -- cut into 1/4" dice
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh thyme leaves
     1/2         pound  zucchini -- cut into 1/4" dice,
                        about 1 1/2 cups
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced leek -- white part only
     3/4           cup  chopped peeled seeded vine-ripened
                        tomatoes - (abt 1/2 lb)
  1                cup  baby spinach - (loosely packed) -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot.  Add the mushrooms and cook, without moving them, until brown on 1 side, about 1 minute.  Continue to saute for another 1 to 2 minutes.  Season mushrooms with salt and pepper and pour onto cookie sheet to cool.  Set used pan aside.

In a separate, clean skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat.  Add minced garlic.  Cook until golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.  In the pan where the mushrooms were, add 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat.  Add yellow squash.  Cook until browned, about 1 to 2 minutes and drain onto same cookie sheet with mushrooms.

Place peppers in hot pan where squash was cooking, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of thyme.  When heated thoroughly, add peppers to waiting mushrooms and yellow squash.  Add zucchini to the same pan, add remaining thyme, cook until browned, about 2 minutes.  Pull both pans (onions and zucchini) off the heat, and add to cookie sheet with other vegetables.

In the former zucchini/mushroom pan, cook leeks to soften, about 2 minutes.  In the other, bring the tomatoes to a simmer.  Season the leeks with salt and pepper, to taste, and add spinach.  When spinach is wilted, add cooked leeks to cooling vegetables on cookie sheet.  Add basil to the tomatoes, then add tomatoes to cookie sheet.  Stir gently, and top with Parmesan and serve.

Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  8                     mild Italian sausages -- roughly chopped
                        into 1" rounds
  1              pound  dried sausage -- roughly chopped
  7                     chicken breasts -- seasoned to taste
                        with paprika, salt and pepper on both
                        sides, and cut into 1 1/2" chunks
  20                    peeled iced uncooked shrimp -- seasoned to taste
                        with paprika, salt and pepper
  2                     carrots -- finely minced
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- finely minced
  10                    garlic cloves -- minced
  6               cups  arborrio rice/risotto
  3               cups  white wine
                        Ham Hock Flavored Broth -- (see recipe)
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large paella pan over medium heat, add olive oil and then fresh sausage.  Saute for about 5 to 8 minutes, or until sausage is well browned.  Add chicken and dried sausage to pan and saute 5 to 8 minutes, or until chicken starts to brown.  Add the shrimp and saute just until the shrimp begin to turn red and curl, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove all meats from paella pan, using a slotted spoon, and place them on cookie tray to cool.

                Strawberries Served With Honey Zabaglione

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ZABAGLIONE ===
  2                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  honey
  1                cup  dry Muscat white wine
     3/4           cup  lowfat yogurt
                        === STRAWBERRIES ===
  2              pints  fresh strawberries -- hulled and sliced

Make the Zabaglione:  In a large stainless-steel bowl or the top pan of a double boiler, whisk the egg yolks with the honey until blended.  Set the bowl over √≥ not touching √≥ simmering water and whisk vigorously until the mixture lightens in color and thickens and the whisk leaves a trail, about 3 minutes.  Add the wine and continue whisking constantly until the mixture is pale, thick, and greatly expanded in volume, about 10 minutes.  The mixture will curdle if it gets too hot, so whisk it off the heat for a few seconds if you fear the eggs are cooking too fast.

When the zabaglione is light, fluffy, and capable of holding a soft peak, transfer the bowl to a larger bowl filled with ice water to cool the zabaglione quickly.  When cool, fold in the yogurt.  Use immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.

Serve fresh strawberries on plates and put a dollop of zabaglione alongside.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        The Ultimate Cheese Course

Recipe By     :Michael Chiarello
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheese                          Information

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Soft goat cheese
                        Aged goat cheese
                        Teleme
                        Camembert
                        Gorgonzola
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1                     loaf walnut bread or
                        other dark dense bread

Cheese Plate tips:  Lavender Honey drizzled over pungent Stilton or creamy Point Reyes Blue Cheese is surprisingly well-matched.

The crumbly sweetness of biscotti with big cheeses and red wine is a wonderful flavor combination.

Serve candied almonds or other candied nuts for an accompaniment with a sweet, salty crunch.

The most elegant thing you can serve with a cheese course is a bowl full of warm pistachios...to occupy hand and mouth while you're sitting around the table talking with friends and finishing that great bottle of red wine.

If serving Parmigiano-Reggiano, drizzle with a couple of drops of aged balsamic vinegar to enhance the flavor.

Set out and arrange cheeses 1 hour before serving, cheeses are best consumed at room temperature.

Serve cheeses on a round tray or wheel, arranging clockwise from 6:00 from the sweetest to the strongest cheeses.

Serve sweeter accompaniments, such as figs with the stronger cheeses to get some agre dolce flavor.

Serve stronger cheeses with lemon and orange wedges to enhance the flavors.

Wine Pairings:  As a general rule, the cheeses you choose should follow the flavors and intensity of the wine.  If you are drinking a big, intense wine, choose a big, intense cheese.  For example, if you've chosen Petit Sirah (usually big, deep-colored and full bodied), choose a Gorgonzola, the creamy, classic Italian cow's milk blue cheese that comes in Mountain (aged) and Dolce (sweet) varieties.

If you are serving a Sauvignon Blanc (which tends to be crisp and light - medium bodied), pair it with goat cheese, light and delightfully tart--even tangy.  Also, the more acidic your wine is, the higher the fat content of the cheese needs to be (generally).

A young, fresh goat cheese, goes well with Robert Mondavi Winery Fume Blanc Reserve or the Luna Pinot Grigio.  Or try, St. Paulin (also known as Port Salut), good company for fruit and light wine.

Buy a well-aged Brie, Camembert or Cambozola for Chardonnay.  This wine has the acid to take the creamier, "fatty" cheeses.

For Reggiano and Blue cheeses try my Old Vine Petit Sirah Zinfandel.

Of course, contrasting flavors can also guide you toward great cheese course combinations, so from time to time I like to serve a crisp, fruity sparkling wine with Reggiano!  What contrast for the mouth!

With numerous varieties to choose from, cheese's companionship with both sweet and savory ingredients can make serving the ultimate cheese course a creative and colorful celebration every time.  Have fun and experiment with your favorite flavors!

Chef's Note:  Next to buying good cheese, the single most important element of serving a great cheese course is the temperature of the cheese when you serve it--room temperature!  Set the cheese out at least 3 hours before serving time.  It really is true that $5 cheese will taste like $20 cheese at the right temperature and $20 cheese will taste like $5 cheese at the wrong temperature.  When you offer it to your guests, your Brie should be weeping, your Blue stinking and your Reggiano glistening with a whisper of its oil.

With cheese and wine, I like to add sweetness and texture and present them together on a memorable serving platter.

  1 1/2         pounds  russet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" rounds
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        extra for baking dish
  1              pound  zucchini
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3 1/2           cups  Tomato Puree -- (see recipe)
  4        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1                cup  fine dried bread crumbs - (about)
     1/3           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh basil leaves

Place potatoes into a glass bowl, coat lightly with about 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil.  Mix to coat.

Trim the ends of the zucchini, then cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Put in a separate bowl.  Top with 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly oil a deep 2 1/2- to 3-quart baking dish (about 9 by 12 inches).  Then place about 1/4 cup of tomato puree and spread out to coat the bottom of the pan.

In zucchini and potato bowls, add 2 tablespoons of garlic each and mix in well with a rubber spatula.  Using the potatoes and zucchinis, make a layer in the prepared baking dish, alternating between the potato and zucchini, filling in any gaps with small pieces.  Spread 1/2 cup of the tomato puree on top, then sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan and 2 tablespoons of the bread crumbs.  Top with some of the basil.  Repeat the layering of the vegetables, tomato puree, Parmesan, bread crumbs and basil using all the vegetables.  Cover the top with the remaining bread crumbs and Parmesan.

Bake, uncovered, for about 1/2 an hour, then cover for the next 45 minutes of baking, finally uncovering for the last 15 minutes, until tender and bubbling, about 1 1/2 hours total cooking time.  Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature to allow the dish to settle and deepen in flavor.

Tiella may be served hot, warm, or at room temperature.  Reheat in a low oven, if desired.  To serve, cut into squares and carefully lift out of the pan with a spatula.

This recipe yields 6 main course or 8 to 10 side dish servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Snacks

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  shelled almonds -- preferably unsalted
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  sea salt -- preferably gray salt
  3        tablespoons  Toasted Spice Rub -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Blanch the almonds in boiling water, until the skins peel off.

Melt the butter in a large ovenproof skillet over moderate heat and cook until it turns light brown and smells nutty.  Add the almonds and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, over moderate heat until the almonds begin to color, about 5 minutes, coat and toss in the spice mix thoroughly.  Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the almonds are medium-brown, about 15 minutes.

Remove from the oven, taste for flavor, add more spice mix or salt, if necessary.  Return to the oven for another 5 minutes.  Transfer the nuts to a sheet pan; they will crisp as they cool.  Store the cooled almonds in an airtight container at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 3 cups.

Comments:  Chop these nuts and add them to a turkey stuffing or a rice pilaf.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting work surfaces
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  gray salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  crystal sugar -- plus
                        more to roll logs in (see Chef's Note)
     1/3           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  5              large  eggs
  6        tablespoons  anise seeds
  1                cup  unblanched whole almonds -- toasted

Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt and set aside.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and crystal sugar until light and fluffy.  Add brown sugar while mixing.  Add the eggs, flour mixture, and anise seeds.  Beat on low just until the dough begins to come together.  Add the almonds and mix just until distributed.  Do not overwork.  On a floured board, shape the dough into a log, flatten, put on a baking sheet, and chill for 2 hours to allow the dough to relax.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions on a lightly floured work surface.  Using your hands, roll each portion into a log about 3 inches in diameter.  Top generously with crystal sugar.  Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet and press down lightly to flatten slightly.  Logs should be several inches apart.

Bake until firm and light brown, about 1 hour or more.  When poked with a finger, the dough should feel firm to the touch and not collapse or cave in.  Remove from the oven.  Let the logs cool completely before serving.

This recipe yields 40 cookies.

Variation:  Try substituting 1/2 cup of cacao nibs for 1/2 a cup of almonds.  They'll add a subtle chocolate flavor.

* Chef's Note:  Crystal, or sparkling sugar is large-grained, decorative sugar available in both white and colored versions.  It gives the cookies a slightly lighter and moister texture since it has a higher moisture content than granulated sugar.  You can substitute turbinado sugar, which is also large grained.  It gives a slightly coarser texture.  You can also use granulated white sugar with very good results.

On a floured board, shape the dough into a log, flatten, put on a baking sheet, and chill for 2 hours to allow the dough to relax.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions on a lightly floured work surface.  Using your hands, roll each portion into a log about 3 inches in diameter.  Top generously with crystal sugar.  Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet and press down lightly to flatten slightly.  Logs should be several inches apart.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake until firm and light brown, about 1 hour or more.  When poked with a finger, the dough should feel firm to the touch and not collapse or cave in.  Remove from the oven.  Let the logs cool completely before serving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 40 cookies.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Variation:  Try substituting 1/2 cup of cacao nibs for 1/2 a cup of almonds.  They&apos;ll add a subtle chocolate flavor.
</DirT>
<DirT>
* Chef&apos;s Note:  Crystal, or sparkling sugar is large-grained, decorative sugar available in both white and colored versions.  It gives the cookies a slightly lighter and moister texture since it has a higher moisture content than granulated sugar.  You can substitute turbinado sugar, which is also large grained.  It gives a slightly coarser texture.  You can also use granulated white sugar with very good results.

  1             gallon  orange juice
  1                cup  raspberry sorbet
  1              quart  seltzer
                        === BODY PART ICE CUBES ===
  12              cups  cold water
  2              drops  green food coloring - (to 3)

Place it in a bowl that will hold the mask as still as possible while freezing.  Fill with the colored water up to the line of the mask, making sure not to spill over if possible.  Place bowl in freezer to solidify, at least 24 hours.

Fill 2 food service gloves with colored water and twist and knot opening closed to make a tight seal.  Freeze gloves for 12 to 24 hours.

When frozen, cut plastic gloves off.  Take ice out of mask, putting hot water on the outside of the mask, if necessary, to help it come out easily.

Carefully float the face and hands in the punch.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  dried cherries
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4         pound  pancetta -- cut 1/4" dice
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  porcini oil
                        Grey sea salt -- to taste
  6               cups  mixed greens
                        = (such as frisee and baby spinach)
  5             ounces  fresh goat cheese

In a small bowl, combine dried cherries with warm water to cover.  Set aside to soften.

In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and pancetta.  Cook until fat is rendered, about 6 minutes.  Drain pancetta on paper towels and discard all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the skillet.

Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the skillet and increase heat to medium-high.  Return pancetta to pan and cook until crispy.  Add garlic and cook until just golden, about 1 minute.  Reduce heat, add thyme and stir well.  Add 15 good turns of black pepper.  Add vinegar, return pan to heat, and deglaze pan, scraping up all the brown bits that cling to the bottom and sides of the pan.  Simmer until vinegar reduces by half.  Whisk in porcini oil.  Season with salt.

Put mixed greens in a salad bowl.  Crumble the goat cheese over the greens.  Quickly toss mixture with pancetta dressing so greens barely wilt.  Drain cherries.  Add cherries, toss again.  Immediately transfer to plates and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lemons -- cut into wedges,
                        seeded
     1/2                navel orange or 1 small seedless orange -- cubed
  1                     shallot -- quartered
  1           teaspoon  gray salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  pure olive oil

In a blender, place the lemons and orange cubes.  Blend for 1 to 2 minutes, and then add the shallot.  Pulse and then blend until as smooth as possible.  Strain through a sieve, using a spoon to push through.  Discard the pulp.  Season the strained juice with salt and pepper.  Whisk the strained juice while adding olive oil in a thin, steady stream.  The vinaigrette will be thick like a mayonnaise.

Taste for seasoning.  Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days.  If the vinaigrette separates, return it to the blender and blend until smooth again.

This recipe yields about 3 cups.

In a blender, place the lemons and orange cubes.  Blend for 1 to 2 minutes, and then add the shallot.  Pulse and then blend until as smooth as possible.  Strain through a sieve, using a spoon to push through.  Discard the pulp.  Season the strained juice with salt and pepper.  Whisk the strained juice while adding olive oil in a thin, steady stream.  The vinaigrette will be thick like a mayonnaise.
