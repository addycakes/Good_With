                        === CRUST ===
  5        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  1 1/2           cups  graham cracker crumbs
     1/2           cup  slivered almonds
                        === FILLING ===
  1                can  sweetened condensed milk - (14 oz)
     1/2           cup  Key lime juice
  2          teaspoons  grated lime zest
  2                     eggs -- separated
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/4           cup  sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

For the crust, combine ingredients and pat down into a 9-inch pie pan.  Bake for 5 to 10 minutes.

In a medium bowl, combine the milk, lime juice, and 1 teaspoon zest; blend in the egg yolks.  Pour the filling into the crust.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
  4              large  onions
                        Cajun seasoning -- (optional)
                        Ranch dressing -- (optional)
                        === BEER BATTER ===
  2 1/2           cups  beer
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  Cajun seasoning
  1              pinch  salt

Fill a large cast-iron Dutch oven with enough peanut oil to completely cover an onion by 1-inch.  Heat the oil to 350 degrees over medium heat.

Slice top tip of onions off, but do not disturb the root end and gently peel off outer skin.  With a paring knife, starting 1/2-inch from the bottom of the onion, slice down to top of onion and continue at 1/4-inch intervals until onion is sliced all the way around (like a mum flower).  Gently shake each onion to open the "petals" more.  Gently pick up onion and spoon batter onto onion ensuring every part is coated, then gently allow to drain slightly.

Carefully place onion root-side down into the pan of hot oil and allow it to cook until light brown in color, about 5 to 8 minutes.  Remove onion with a slotted spoon and use a knife to pull apart petals that are stuck together.  Place onion back into the oil but this time top-side down.  When the onion turns golden brown, about 5 minutes, remove it with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.  Repeat with remaining onions.  Shake onions with Cajun seasoning and serve with ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.

Beer Batter:  Whisk together beer, flour and seasonings; let sit on the counter for several hours.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  butter - (2 sticks)
  1              small  onion -- diced
  1              small  carrot -- finely diced
  1              small  celery stalk -- diced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  white corn kernels -- fresh or frozen
  3               cups  chicken stock
  2               cups  half-and-half
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Melt 1 stick of butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic, and saute for 2 minutes.  Add the flour and stir to make a roux.  Cook until the roux is lightly browned; set aside to cool to room temperature.

Meanwhile, combine the corn and chicken stock in another saucepan, and bring to a boil.  Simmer for 10 minutes.  Pour the boiling stock with the corn (a little at a time) into the saucepan with the roux, whisking briskly so it doesn't lump.  Return the skillet to the heat and bring to a boil.  The mixture should become very thick.

In a small saucepan, gently heat the half-and-half; stir it into the thick corn mixture.  Add the nutmeg and salt and pepper, to taste.  Just before serving, cut the remaining stick of butter into large chunks.  Add it to enrich the soup, stirring until the butter melts.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BUNDLES ===
  1                     sheet puff pastry
  2                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  heavy cream
  8                     chocolate kisses
  8                     miniature chocolate candy bars
                        === GANACHE ===
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  4             ounces  milk chocolate -- broken small pieces
                        Sweetened whipped cream -- (optional)
                        Fresh strawberries -- sliced, for garnish
                        Mint sprigs -- for garnish

Bundles:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Unfold puff pastry and cut the sheet into 2 (4- by 4-inch squares).  Beat eggs and cream together to create an egg wash.  Brush pastry squares with egg wash.  Place 2 chocolate kisses and 1 mini candy bar in the center of each pastry square.  Repeat with remaining kisses and mini-bars.  Pull corners of the square up around the chocolate, brushing edges with more egg wash, if necessary, to create a secure bundle.  Brush exteriors of chocolate bundles with more egg wash.  Repeat with remaining bundles.

Place bundles on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.  Bake for about 35 minutes, or until golden brown.

Ganache:  In a sauce pan bring the heavy cream to a boil.  Place the chocolate pieces in a bowl and pour hot cream over top.  Whisk until smooth.

Puddle ganache onto a plate and place 1 bundle on top.  Top with whipped cream and additional ganache, if desired.

Serve bundles garnished with strawberry slices and mint sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a large bowl, combine coconut and bread crumbs and season with salt and pepper.  Place flour, eggs, and bread crumb mixture into 3 separate bowls.  Dredge the shrimp in flour and shake off excess.  Next, dip the shrimp thoroughly in the egg and rub against the side of the bowl to lightly remove excess.  Finally, coat the shrimp thoroughly with the bread crumb mixture.  Lay out the shrimp so they do not touch on a parchment-lined baking sheet or platter until ready to fry.

In a large Dutch oven, heat several inches of oil to 350 degrees.  Fry the shrimp in batches until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes per batch.  Be careful not to overcrowd shrimp in the oil while frying.  Drain on paper towels.

For the Dipping Sauce:  Heat the marmalade in a small saucepan over low heat.  Thin with rum as desired.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  ham hocks, smoked turkey wings, or
                        smoked neck bones
  1           teaspoon  House Seasoning -- plus
                        more for seasoning -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  seasoned salt
  1         tablespoon  hot pepper sauce
                        = (Texas Pete recommended)
                        Olive oil -- for drizzling
     1/2                large bunch collard greens
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- softened
  70                    wonton wrappers - (to 80)
                        Peanut oil -- for frying

In a large pot, bring 1 1/2 quarts water to a boil and add smoked meat, House Seasoning, seasoned salt, hot sauce and a drizzle of olive oil.  Reduce heat to medium and cook for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, wash collard greens thoroughly.  Remove the thick stem that runs down the center of the greens by holding the leaf in your left hand and stripping the leaf down with your right hand.  Stack 6 to 8 leaves on top of each other, roll up and slice into 1/2- to 1-inch thick slices.

Place greens in pot.  Add butter.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until greens are tender, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.  When done, taste and adjust seasoning.  Remove collard greens from broth and transfer to a large bowl.  Mix in softened cream cheese.

To assemble, place a spoonful of mixture in the center of a wonton wrapper and fold into a triangle, pressing to seal.  Repeat with remaining wrappers.

Heat several inches of peanut oil in a heavy deep pot to 350 degrees.  Fry wontons in batches until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes per batch.  Drain on paper towels.  Best if served immediately.

This recipe yields 35 servings.

  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz)
  1           envelope  unflavored gelatin -- softened in

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  ducks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Garlic powder -- to taste
                        Poultry seasoning -- to taste
  1              large  onion -- quartered
  1                     apple -- quartered
  1                     orange -- quartered
  4                     ribs celery -- cut 1" pieces
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  red Burgundy wine

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Clean the ducks well and rub the body cavities lightly with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and poultry seasoning.  Stuff the cavities with pieces of onion, apple, orange and celery.  Rub the ducks with the soy sauce and oil.  Place in a baking pan and roast, uncovered, basting often with Burgundy wine, about every 10 minutes.  Allow 10 to 15 minutes baking time per pound of duck.  Remove the stuffing before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The flavor in this recipe really comes out if you can let the duck marinate in the seasoning for a few hours or overnight.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
     3/4           cup  water water -- (98 to 105 degrees)
  2 1/2           cups  prepared biscuit mix -- plus
     1/2           cup  prepared biscuit mix - (to 1)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  melted butter - (1/2 stick)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Dissolve the yeast in the water.  Put the 2 1/2 cups of biscuit mix in a large bowl; stir in the sugar.  Add the yeast mixture, stirring vigorously.  Sprinkle the work surface generously with the remaining 1/2 to 1 cup biscuit mix.

Turn the dough out onto the surface and knead well, 15 to 20 times.  Shape the dough as desired.  (I shape heaping tablespoons of dough into balls).  Place on a lightly greased baking sheet, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.

Just before putting into oven, brush rolls with melted butter.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.  Brush the rolls again with melted butter while they're hot.

This recipe yields 15 rolls.

                        === CAKE ===
                        Butter -- for greasing pan
  2               cups  sugar
  3                     eggs
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  3               cups  finely-chopped peeled apples
  1                cup  shredded coconut
  1                cup  chopped pecans

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Salt and pepper -- for seasoning
                        chicken
                        Crisco shortening -- for frying
  3                     eggs
     1/3           cup  water
  2               cups  self-rising flour
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     chicken - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- cut into pieces

Heat shortening in a cast-iron skillet to 350 degrees.

Beat eggs with water in a small bowl.  In a shallow bowl, season flour with pepper.  Dip chicken pieces in egg mixture and then coat well in flour mixture.  Carefully add to hot shortening, in batches if necessary, place lid on top of skillet, and fry until brown and crisp.  Remember that dark meat requires a longer cooking time (about 13 to 14 minutes, compared to 8 to 10 minutes for white meat.)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  My Grandmother Paul always said to season chicken and return it to the refrigerator and let it sit as long as time permits, at least 2 to 3 hours.  And always use small chickens.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter or olive oil
     3/4           cup  chopped onion
  2               cups  shredded Monterey Jack
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
                        = (Texas Pete recommended)
  1           teaspoon  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  4                     grouper fillets - (abt 8 oz ea)
  1                     lemon -- halved
                        Crushed red pepper flakes -- to taste
  1              stick  cold butter -- cut into 8 slices

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a small skillet, add 1 tablespoon butter or oil over medium heat.  Add onion and cook until softened, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to a large bowl and cool slightly.

To the bowl, add the cheese, mayonnaise, hot pepper sauce and 1/2 teaspoon House Seasoning.  Mix well and set aside.

Grease a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish.  Sprinkle the fish with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon House Seasoning.  Place the fish in the baking dish and squeeze the juice of the lemon over it and sprinkle with red pepper flakes.  Top fish with slices of butter.

Bake for about 10 to 15 minutes or until fish is almost done; the time will depend on the thickness of your fish.  Remove the dish from the oven and cover each fillet with 1/2 cup of the cheese mixture.  Return to the oven and bake until cheese melts, about 8 to 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a small skillet, add 1 tablespoon butter or oil over medium heat.  Add onion and cook until softened, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to a large bowl and cool slightly.

<DirT>
To the bowl, add the cheese, mayonnaise, hot pepper sauce and 1/2 teaspoon House Seasoning.  Mix well and set aside.

<DirT>
Grease a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish.  Sprinkle the fish with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon House Seasoning.  Place the fish in the baking dish and squeeze the juice of the lemon over it and sprinkle with red pepper flakes.  Top fish with slices of butter.

Bake for about 10 to 15 minutes or until fish is almost done; the time will depend on the thickness of your fish.  Remove the dish from the oven and cover each fillet with 1/2 cup of the cheese mixture.  Return to the oven and bake until cheese melts, about 8 to 10 minutes.

                        === CRUST ===
                        Cooking spray
  1 3/4           cups  fat-free vanilla wafer cookie crumbs
                        = (or any fat-free cookie crumbs of your
                        choice)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  3           packages  fat-free cream cheese - (8 oz ea)
  1                cup  fat-free sour cream
  2               cups  sugar or sugar substitute
                        = (Splenda recommended)
  3              large  eggs
                        = (or 3/4 cup egg substitute)
  2          teaspoons  lemon zest
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
                        === LEMON CURD ===
  1 1/2      teaspoons  lemon zest
  6        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1              large  egg -- plus
  1              large  egg yolk
     1/2           cup  sugar or sugar substitute
                        = (Splenda recommended)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into bits
                        = (or any fat-free butter substitute)

Make Crust:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Lightly spray a (9-inch) springform pan with cooking spray.

Mix crumbs and melted butter in a bowl.  Press crumb mixture onto bottom and 1 1/2 inches up side of pan.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until edges are lightly golden and crust is set.  Cool on rack.

Make Filling:  In large bowl with electric mixer on medium-high, beat cream cheese and sour cream for 2 to 3 minutes until fluffy.  Gradually beat in sugar or sugar substitute.  Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, just until incorporated.  Beat in zest and juice.  Pour into crust.  Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour, 15 minutes, or until center is almost set, but still slightly jiggly.  (Do not overbake, as it will firm as it cools).  Let cool completely.

Make Lemon Curd:  In the top of a double boiler, combine lemon zest, lemon juice, egg, egg yolk, and sugar or sugar substitute over gently simmering water.  Whisk until hot and frothy, about 5 minutes.  Gradually whisk in butter and continue whisking for 7 minutes or until thickened and coats back of spoon.  Remove from heat and cool for 30 minutes.

Run a thin blade around the edge of the springform pan and remove sides.  Transfer to a serving plate.  Spread lemon curd over top.  Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Garnish with raspberries and zest, if desired.  Cool cheesecake in refrigerator several hours or overnight before serving.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     sheets frozen puff pastry
  1                     egg -- beaten
  4                     chicken breast halves
                        = (or 2 cups leftover cooked chicken)
                        Seasoned salt and pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
     1/3           cup  butter
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  1              quart  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  chicken base
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2         small  yellow onion -- minced
  1                cup  frozen green peas -- cooked
  1                cup  chopped cooked carrots
  1              pinch  fresh grated nutmeg -- (optional)

Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cut each sheet of frozen puff pastry into 1-inch strips, 8 inches long.  On a large cookie sheet, weave strips into a lattice large enough to cover each pot pie.  Brush beaten egg onto each lattice square.  Bake for 5 minutes, or until dough has risen and turned light golden brown.  Set aside until ready to assemble pies.  Leave oven on at 350 degrees.

Filling:  Season chicken with seasoned salt and pepper.  Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chicken and saute until cooked through.  Remove from heat and cut into chunks.  Alternatively, you may use precooked chicken.

In a large saucepan, melt butter and then slowly add flour, stirring until consistency of peanut butter, but not brown like a roux.  Slowly add cream and keep stirring.  Add chicken base, garlic, and onion and stir until thickened.  Add peas, carrots, nutmeg, if using, and cut up chicken.  Remove from heat.  Fill 4 individual oven-proof bowls with chicken mixture and then top each with a pre-cooked lattice square.  Bake for 5 minutes or until bubbly.  Any remaining pie filling may be frozen.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === CRUST ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  confectioners' sugar -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature,
                        plus more for greasing
                        === FILLING ===
  2                     eggs
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease an 8- by 8- by 2-inch pan.

Make the crust by combining the flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt in a large bowl.  Cut in the butter to make a crumbly mixture.  Press the mixture into the prepared pan.  You may need to dip your fingers into a little flour or confectioners' sugar to keep the dough from sticking to your fingers.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, to make the filling, mix the eggs, granulated sugar, flour, and lemon juice.  Pour this over the baked crust and bake for 25 minutes longer.  Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar, if desired, when the bars are done.

This recipe yields 16 bars.

  2        tablespoons  softened butter - (to 3)
                        Sugar for sprinkling ramekins
  7        tablespoons  melted butter
     1/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1                cup  warm milk
  4                     eggs -- separated, plus
  2                     egg whites
  1         tablespoon  grated lime zest
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Toasted coconut -- for garnish
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for garnish
                        Lime slices -- for garnish
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
  4                     coconuts or 6 (1-cup) ramekins

For an impressive presentation, use coconut halves instead of ramekins for this recipe.  To prep the coconuts, first drain the milk by using a corkscrew.  Once drained, bake the coconuts in a 400 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes.  Use a hammer to crack open coconuts to create halves.  Create 4 foil rings and place them under the coconut shells for support.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Rub the inside of the ramekins or coconut shells with softened butter.  Sprinkle granulated sugar into the molds, and twist so the sugar crystals coat the inside of the ramekins or coconut shells.  Shake out any excess sugar.

In a saucepan, combine the melted butter, 1/3 cup sugar, the flour and cornstarch.  Slowly whisk the warm milk into the mixture.  Bring to a boil, and reduce to low heat.  Stirring constantly, simmer until thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon.  Slowly whisk the thickened mixture into the egg yolks a little at a time to temper them.  Cover and allow to cool to room temperature.  Stir in lime zest and juice.

In a large bowl, beat the 6 egg whites, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and a pinch of salt at high speed with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.  Gently fold the whipped whites into the cooled egg mixture.

Divide the souffle batter among the ramekins or coconut shells.  If using the coconut shells, use your finger to clear the inside of the coconut rims, giving space for the souffle to rise.  Bake until puffed and lightly browned, about 35 to 40 minutes.

Top with toasted coconut, sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and garnish each a slice of lime.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings (if using coconuts) 6 servings (if using ramekins).

  1                     large bag white corn tortilla chips
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1                cup  shredded pepper jack
  1                     jalapeÒo -- sliced crosswise,

  1                cup  shredded Cheddar
  1                cup  sour cream
  1                cup  chopped green onion
  1                     tomato -- diced

Have all the prepped ingredients easily accessible to assemble nachos.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

On a large ovenproof platter, spread out a layer of tortilla chips and quickly put a teaspoon of hot refried beans on each chip.  Working quickly, sprinkle with some onions, jack cheese, and jalapeÒo slices.  Spoon on chili and top that with Cheddar.  Repeat this layering process until ingredients are used up.  Save some of the jalapeÒo slices for garnish.

Place platter in the oven and bake until cheese has melted, about 5 to 10 minutes.  Remove from oven and place on a trivet or heatproof surface.  Top nachos with sour cream, green onions, diced tomato and jalapeÒo slices and serve hot.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

                        === CRUST ===
  8        tablespoons  butter -- cubed and softened
  1            package  cream cheese - (3 oz) -- softened
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
                        === FILLING ===
  6        tablespoons  butter -- sliced
  6        tablespoons  all-purposes flour
  1              large  yellow onion -- diced
  4                     celery stalks -- diced
  2              small  carrots -- diced
  1              bunch  scallions -- diced
  1                     green pepper -- diced
  2                     shallots -- diced
  1              pound  frozen crawfish tails -- thawed
  3        tablespoons  Cajun seasoning
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               cups  chicken stock

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

For the Crust:  In a large bowl, blend together the butter and cream cheese.  Stir in flour and chill for 1 hour in the refrigerator.  Separate dough; reserving 1/3 for pie tops, and using 2/3 for pie crust bottoms.  To form bottom portions of dough, create dough balls approximately 1-inch in diameter and place into bottom of muffin tin cups, flattening to form crust bottoms.  Bake crusts only until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

For the Filling:  In a saucepan, add butter and flour, stirring together over heat to create a roux.  Cook until mixture is the color of peanut butter.  Add all vegetables and saute until soft, about 5 to 10 minutes.  Add crawfish, Cajun seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste.  Saute mixture for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add chicken stock and cook, stirring, until mixture boils and thickens.  Spoon mixture into crusts.  Top with circles of unbaked dough cut from the reserved 1/3 of original dough.  Make a small slit in the top of the dough to allow steam to escape.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve while warm.

This recipe yields 8 pies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === OYSTERS ===
     1/2         pound  button mushrooms -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  celery salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  1                cup  fresh oysters -- drained and chopped
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2         ounces  cream cheese
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Freshly chopped parsley
                        Grated Parmesan

Oyster Preparation:  In a frying pan, saute the mushrooms in butter until tender.  Blend in flour and cook until bubbly.  Gradually add milk and cook until smooth and thickened, stirring constantly.  Add salt, celery salt, pepper, lemon juice, and oysters.  Cook over medium-low heat until oysters start to curl up, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Crust Preparation:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Soften cream cheese and butter and blend well in a medium bowl.  Stir in flour to form dough.  Transfer dough into a plastic kitchen bag and chill in refrigerator for 1 hour.  Remove from fridge and shape into 7 balls about 1/2-ounce each.  Flatten and place in an ungreased 4-ounce cup muffin tin.  Bake 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden.

Assembly:  Fill crusts with oyster filling; garnish with parsley and Parmesan.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 7 servings.

Tip:  For a quicker recipe, a store-bought mini-pie crust may be substituted.

Recipe By     :Paula Deen
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  light or fat-free cream cheese - (8 oz) -- softened
  1           teaspoon  dried parsley flakes
  1           teaspoon  dried chives
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
  1                can  refrigerated crescent rolls
                        Cooking spray
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
                        = (or egg substitute equivalent)
  2          teaspoons  poppy seeds

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a small mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, parsley, chives, and garlic powder.  Set aside.

On a floured surface, unroll the crescent rolls into rectangles and combine to make 1 long rectangle.  Spread cream cheese mixture on and roll up like a pinwheel, starting at the long side.  Seal edges.

Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray.  Place roll on the cookie sheet, brush with egg, and sprinkle with poppy seeds.  Score at 1/2-inch intervals along the roll (not all the way through).  Pull apart slightly so that your scoring will not completely seal back up during baking.  Bake until golden brown.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     boneless pork chop per person
  1              slice  red onion per person
  1             slices  green bell pepper per person

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
     3/4           cup  cake flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1 1/4      teaspoons  ground ginger
     3/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
  6              large  eggs -- separated
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
     1/3           cup  golden brown sugar - (packed)
     2/3           cup  canned pumpkin - (packed)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        Powdered sugar
                        === FILLING ===
  1           teaspoon  unflavored gelatin
  2        tablespoons  dark rum
  1                cup  whipping cream -- chilled
  3        tablespoons  powdered sugar
  6        tablespoons  English toffee pieces -- plus
     1/2           cup  English toffee pieces -- for garnish
                        Additional powdered sugar -- for garnish
  1 1/2           cups  purchased caramel sauce -- warmed, for garnish

For the Cake:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line a 15- by 10- by 1-inch baking sheet with parchment paper.  Spray the parchment with nonstick cooking spray.

Sift the flour, cinnamon, ginger, and allspice into a small bowl.  In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until very thick.  Add the pumpkin to the egg mixture and combine at a low speed until incorporated.  Add the dry ingredients and beat at a low speed until mixed.  In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites and salt until stiff but not dry.  Fold into the cake batter, stirring with a spatula, until most of the white streaks are gone.

Spread the batter onto a baking sheet and smooth out.  Transfer baking sheet to the oven and bake until a tester comes out clean, about 15 to 18 minutes.  While the cake is hot, dust generously with powdered sugar.  Loosen the edges and turn the cake out onto a kitchen towel.  Fold the towel over the edge of the cake and roll up.  Cool completely, edge down, for 1 hour in the refrigerator.

For the Filling:  Soften the gelatin in the rum.  Stir over low heat until the gelatin dissolves.  Cool.  Beat the chilled whipping cream and powdered sugar in a large bowl until peaks form.  Fold in the gelatin and 6 tablespoons English toffee pieces.

To assemble, unroll the cake and sprinkle with 4 tablespoons of English toffee pieces.  Spread the filling over the toffee.  Start at 1 long side of the cake roll and, using the towel as an aid, roll up the cake to encase the filling.  Place the cake, seam-side down, on a platter.

Trim the ends of the cake at a slight diagonal.  Dust the cake with powdered sugar.  Spoon some warm caramel sauce and the remaining toffee chips over the top of the cake.  To serve, use a serrated knife to cut the cake crosswise into 1-inch thick slices.  Drizzle more sauce on each slice and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  boiling water
  1 1/4           cups  white cornmeal
                        Vegetable oil or bacon drippings -- enough to
                        fill skillet 1" deep

Add the salt to the boiling water; gradually sift in the cornmeal.  Stir to combine.  Cool the mixture in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.  Shape into balls and then flatten to form patties about 2-inches across.

Heat the vegetable oil or bacon drippings in a skillet.  Fry patties until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Turn once.  Drain and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Spray hands with nonstick cooking spray to prevent batter from sticking when shaping the balls.

  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              pound  small or medium shrimp

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dry pinto beans
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2         pound  ham hocks
                        = (or 1/4 lb streak o' lean)
  4               cups  water
  1                     onion -- chopped
                        House Seasoning -- (see recipe)

Wash the beans and soak overnight in cold water.  Drain the beans and dump into slow cooker.  Stir in chili powder and oregano.

If using ham hock:  Pre-soak ham in a separate pot, for at least 2, or refrigerated up to 24 hours, depending on how salty you want your stock to be.  Add ham hock to slow cooker with beans and pour in ham soaking liquid.  Add more water until ham hock is completely covered.

If using streak o' lean:  Cut into cubes, brown in a skillet, and place the meat and any rendered fat in the slow cooker with beans.  Pour 4 cups water into pot.

Add onion to slow cooker with beans and meat.  Stir well.  Season, to taste, with House Seasoning, cover the pot, and cook on high until beans are very tender, about 5 hours.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  warm water -- (abt 98 degrees)
  1            package  active dry yeast
  2 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- sifted
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  4               cups  water
  5          teaspoons  baking soda
  4        tablespoons  butter -- melted
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

In a large mixing bowl, combine warm water and yeast.  When the yeast dissolves, add half of the flour, the butter, salt, and sugar and mix for about 3 minutes.  Stir in the remaining flour.  Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until the dough is no longer sticky.  Let the dough rise in a greased, covered bowl until it doubles in size, about 45 to 50 minutes.

Punch down the dough and divide into 12 pieces.  Roll each piece of dough into 18-inch long ropes.  On a greased cookie sheet, shape each rope into a pretzel shape.  Let rise again until almost doubled, about 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.

In a large non-aluminum Dutch oven over high heat, bring 4 cups of water and baking soda to a boil.  Using a large spoon, gently lower pretzels into water a few at a time and boil for about 1 minute, or until they float.  Return the pretzels to the cookie sheet and brush with melted butter then sprinkle with kosher salt.  Bake until browned, about 12 minutes.  Serve hot with mustard.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     eggs -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  cold water
  2               cups  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla or almond extract -- or both
  1 1/2           cups  cake flour -- sifted
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- plus pinch
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
                        === ORANGE BUTTER CREAM FROSTING ===
  2             sticks  butter
  2 1/2           cups  powdered sugar
                        Orange juice
                        Orange peel or zest -- (optional garnish)

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Separate eggs carefully, putting whites in a large mixing bowl and yolks in another large mixing bowl.  Beat egg yolks until light and foamy.  Slowly add the water.  Gradually beat in the sugar, then vanilla and/or almond extract; beat until pale and thick in texture (total beating time can be as long as 7 minutes).  Sift flour again with salt and baking powder.  Return to sifter and fold flour mixture into egg yolk mixture, sifting in a little at a time.

Beat egg whites gently until foamy.  Add a pinch of salt and the cream of tartar.  Increase the mixer speed and beat until they form moist, glossy peaks.

Pour the egg yolk mixture in thin stream over the entire surface of the egg white mixture, gently cutting and folding with rubber spatula, making sure everything is completely folded.  Pour into an ungreased 10-inch round tube pan with a removable bottom.  Draw a thin spatula gently through the batter to get rid of any large air pockets.

Bake on the second rack from the bottom of the oven for 1 hour.  (The cake tends to fall a small amount after 50 minutes, so do not worry.)

Invert pan onto a rack and let cool out of the pan for 1 1/2 hours.  Frost when cake is completely cooled.  If desired, garnish cake with orange peel or zest.

Orange Butter Cream Frosting:  Combine butter and sugar in a medium bowl.  Add just enough orange juice to thin the frosting to a spreading consistency.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2           cup  solid vegetable shortening
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  2                     eggs
  2                     ripe bananas -- mashed
     1/4           cup  buttermilk
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  chopped black walnuts*
                        === FROSTING ===
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  1                cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/3           cup  heavy cream -- plus
                        more as necessary
  1         tablespoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                     box confectioners' sugar - (16 oz)
  2               cups  finely chopped black walnuts* -- (optional garnish)

*Cook's Note:  DO NOT substitute English walnuts for black walnuts.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour 2 (9-inch) cake pans.

For the cake:  In a medium bowl, stir together flour and baking soda; set aside.  Using an electric mixer, cream together shortening and sugar in a bowl until light and fluffy, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Add eggs 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition.  Mix in mashed bananas, buttermilk, and vanilla.  Add flour mixture, mix until just combined.  Stir in black walnuts.

Pour into prepared pans.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes.  Cool in pans on a cooling rack for 10 minutes.  Remove from pans and cool completely.

Meanwhile, prepare frosting.  Melt butter in small saucepan.  Add brown sugar and 1/3 cup cream.  Cook over medium-low heat until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and add vanilla.  Transfer to a large bowl.

Using a handheld electric mixer, beat in confectioners' sugar a little at a time until smooth.  If frosting is too thick, add 1 tablespoon heavy cream at a time until consistency is right.  Sandwich 2 layers of cake with frosting.  Frost the outside of the cake.  Press chopped black walnuts on the sides of the cake, if desired.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     brisket - (5 to 6 lbs) -- trimmed but left
                        with a layer of fat abt 1/4" thick
  6        tablespoons  House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  3        tablespoons  chili powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  brown sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  6               cups  hickory wood chips -- soaked in water
                        for 30 minutes

Rinse brisket thoroughly under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  In a small bowl, mix together House Seasoning, chili powder, brown sugar, onion powder, oregano and cayenne.  Rub brisket with the rub on all sides.

Follow directions on your grill/smoker for indirect grilling.  Place the soaked chips into the chip box, or make a pouch with tin foil for the chips, then place pouch directly on the coals.  Place brisket fat-side up in a large disposable aluminum pan and place in the center of the grate and cover the grill.

Slow grill the brisket until tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the meat reads about 190 degrees, about 6 hours.  Add coals and wood chips as necessary to maintain a constant temperature.  Transfer the brisket to a cutting board to rest for about 10 minutes.  Slice the brisket across the grain and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  1                cup  thinly-sliced carrots
  1                cup  diced celery
  1                cup  sliced green beans -- fresh or canned
  1                cup  frozen black-eyed peas
  1                cup  frozen butter beans
  1                cup  cut okra -- fresh or frozen
  1                cup  corn kernels -- fresh or canned
  1                cup  diced potatoes
     1/2           cup  uncooked elbow macaroni
                        Chopped fresh parsley leaves

* The chuck roast will yield more meat, but the bones from the short ribs give the soup an incredible flavor.

If using chuck roast, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Place the roast in the skillet and cook until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.  Remove the roast from the skillet and cut it into 1 1/2- to 2-inch cubes; discard the fat.  Place the beef cubes in a large stockpot.  (If using short ribs, you can put them right in the pot with no preparation).

Add the water, tomatoes, onions, dried parsley, beef bouillon, dried Italian seasoning, House Seasoning, seasoned salt, Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, garlic powder, black pepper and bay leaves.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Cover the pot; reduce the heat so that the liquid simmers, and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the meat is very tender.

If using short ribs, remove them from the pot and cut the meat from the bones, discard the bones and fat, and return the meat to the pot.  Add the remaining vegetables and the macaroni and return the soup to a boil, stirring to distribute the ingredients.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes.  Just before serving, season with salt and pepper and add fresh chopped parsley.  To remove excess fat from the surface of the soup, swirl a lettuce leaf around the surface ó it will pick up a lot of the fat.

This recipe yields 8 quarts.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STOCK ===
  1                     fryer chicken - (2 1/2 to 3 lbs) -- cut up
  3 1/2         quarts  water

  1 1/2      teaspoons  Italian seasoning - (to 2)
  1           teaspoon  lemon-pepper seasoning
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  4                     bay leaves
  3                     chicken bouillon cubes

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SOUP ===
  2               cups  sliced carrots
  2               cups  sliced celery with leafy green tops
  2 1/2           cups  uncooked egg noodles
  1                cup  sliced mushrooms
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
     1/3           cup  cooking sherry
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1                cup  grated Parmesan -- (optional)
     3/4           cup  heavy cream -- (optional)

For the Stock:  Add all ingredients to a soup pot.  Cook until chicken is tender, about 35 to 45 minutes.  Remove chicken from pot and set aside to cool.  Remove and discard bay leaves and onion.

When noodles are done, add chicken, mushrooms, parsley, sherry and rosemary.  Add Parmesan and cream, if using.  Cook for another 2 minutes.  Adjust seasoning, if needed, by adding seasoning salt and pepper.  Enjoy along with a nice hot crusty loaf of French bread.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  yellow bell peppers -- roasted
  1            package  cream cheese with chives - (3 oz) -- room temperature
  1            package  basil and roasted
                        garlic goat cheese (5.3 oz) - -- room temperature
                        = (or 6 oz soft fresh herb-flavored goat
                        cheese)
  1              bunch  arugula -- stems trimmed
  16             large  fresh basil leaves
  1                     boneless veal loin - (abt 3 lbs)
                        House Seasoning -- (see recipe)
  14                    oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes -- drained
  8                     bacon slices
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SAUCE ===
  2 3/4           cups  chicken broth
  3             medium  shallots -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  capers
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces, at
                        room temperature
                        Reserved cheese mixture
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Char the peppers over a gas flame or in the broiler, turning until blackened on all sides.  Place peppers in a paper bag for 10 minutes to loosen the skins.  Peel, seed, and stem the peppers.  Cut lengthwise into strips.  Set aside.

Stir the cream cheese and goat cheese in a small bowl until blended.  Set aside.

Plunge the arugula and basil into hot water with tongs.  Remove immediately, drain, and place into a bowl of ice water to blanch and shock.

Slice the veal open like a book and cover with plastic wrap.  With a meat pounder or rolling pin gently pound the veal to approximately a 10- by 12-inch rectangle of even thickness.  Season with House Seasoning, as desired.

Overlap the arugula leaves down the center of the veal forming a 2-inch wide strip.  Cover with half of the pepper strips, skinned-side up.  Arrange the sun-dried tomatoes in 2 rows on top of the peppers.

Set aside 1/4 cup of the cheese mixture for the sauce.  Spoon the remaining cheese mixture in an even log over the tomatoes.  Arrange the remaining pepper strips, skinned-side up, over the cheese.  Arrange the basil leaves over the peppers.

Fold 1 long side of the veal over the filling.  Roll up the veal jelly roll style and secure by tying with string.  Wrap the string lengthwise around the veal to secure ends.  Cover the ends of the veal with aluminum foil to enclose the filling completely.  Cover the veal and the reserved cheese separately and chill for at least 6 hours.  Can be prepared 1 day ahead.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Melt the butter and olive oil in a heavy large shallow roasting pan over medium-high heat.  Season the veal with salt and pepper.  Brown the veal on all sides, turning frequently, about 10 minutes.  Remove the pan from heat.  Drape the bacon over the veal and tuck in the ends.

Place the veal in the oven and roast until a thermometer inserted into the center of the meat (not the filling) registers 140 degrees, about 45 minutes.  Transfer to a work surface and let stand for 15 minutes.

Sauce:  Combine the broth and shallots in a heavy medium saucepan.  Boil over high heat until the mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 20 minutes

Whisk in the lemon juice, capers, and parsley.  Reduce the heat to low; gradually whisk in the butter and reserved cheese mixture.  Season the sauce with salt and pepper, to taste.

To serve, remove the tinfoil from the ends of the roast, the bacon and the string.  Cut the veal roast crosswise into even slices.  Spoon a few tablespoons of sauce onto each plate.  Top with 2 veal slices.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GANACHE ===
     3/4           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        === FILLING ===
  6 1/2         ounces  cream cheese -- softened
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  heavy cream -- plus
     3/4           cup  heavy cream -- whipped soft
  6 1/2        squares  premium white baking chocolate - (1 oz ea) -- melted
     1/2      teaspoon  orange zest
     2/3           cup  roasted chopped macadamia nuts
  1                     pre-baked 9" deep-dish pie shell
                        === GARNISH ===
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar
  1              ounce  chopped macadamia nuts - (to 2)

Ganache:  Place chocolate chips in a metal mixing bowl.  Bring cream to a simmer over medium heat.  Pour simmering cream over chips and stir until melted.  Set aside and allow to cool to room temperature.

Filling:  Beat cream cheese and sugar with a handheld electric mixer until smooth.  Scrape bowl with a spatula and mix in 1/3 cup heavy cream.  Add the melted white chocolate, zest, and nuts and stir just until incorporated.  Fold in the whipped cream.  Spread into pre-baked pie shell and level off using a rubber spatula.  Put in freezer until frozen.

To finish pie, place the ganache in the microwave on low for no more than 10 seconds at a time.  Stir after each warming, until ganache pours loosely but is not even close to boiling.  Be very careful when warming chocolate, as it will burn very quickly when heated in the microwave.  Once chocolate is scorched it is unusable.  Spread warm ganache over top of frozen pie, smoothing to the edges with a spatula.

Garnish:  Beat cream and confectioners' sugar with a handheld electric mixer to stiff peaks.  Transfer to a piping bag and pipe edges of pie with whipped cream.  Sprinkle macadamia nuts over top.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
