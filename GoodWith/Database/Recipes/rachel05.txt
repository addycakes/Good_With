                        International Foods aisle)

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     rounded teaspoons prepared Dijon style
                        mustard
  4        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  4                     dill pickle spears
                        Toothpicks or kitchen twine -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cut into pieces
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  good quality chicken stock
     1/4           cup  sour cream

Prepare dumpling mix to package directions.  See comments.

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.  Form several large balls, 2 to 3 inches thick, of dumpling mix.  Add to the boiling water then reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes.

Place bacon in a skillet over medium heat and render fat by cooking bacon about 3 minutes.  As edges just begin to crisp, remove bacon from the skillet and transfer to paper towels to drain.

Season slices of sirloin with salt and pepper.  Spread each slice of meat with a rounded spoonful of mustard.  Top mustard with a generous scatter of chopped parsley.  Top seasoned and mustard-coated meat with a slice of bacon and a dill pickle spear each.  Place the bacon and pickle off center closer to 1 edge of the meat than the other.  Roll the steaks around the filling and secure with toothpicks or kitchen twine.

Heat a deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Add oil, 2 turns of the pan, then meat rolls.  Cook meat 2 to 3 minutes, then give it a quarter turn.  Cook meat a total of 10 to 12 minutes, then transfer to a plate.

Add butter to the meat pot and melt.  Add flour to the butter and whisk together, cooking 2 minutes.  Add chicken stock to the flour and butter and scrape up pan drippings.  Season with salt and pepper.  Stir in sour cream and remove from heat.

Remove toothpicks or twine from meat.  Set meat roll and large dumpling on a dinner plate and cover with sour cream gravy.  Quick Sauteed Red Cabbage (see recipe) makes a simple side dish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "I like a denser dumpling rather than a lighter one, so I use 1/2 the amount of water that the box calls for.  I make smaller dumplings so they cook faster."  "If you like a lighter dumpling, it needs to be the first thing you start because it takes a little longer to cook."  Our dumplings took 10 minutes to cook.

                        peppers or pepperoncini
     1/2         pound  sliced Italian deli meats

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  shallot or 1/2 large shallot -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  asparagus -- thin spears
  2                     endive -- cored, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/2         small  red bell pepper -- chopped
     1/2         pound  bow tie pasta, farfalle -- cooked to
                        al dente and cooled
     1/2           cup  frozen green peas
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  3        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat shallot and oil in microwave safe covered dish for 30 seconds or in a small pan on the stovetop over medium low heat for 5 minutes.  Allow oil to cool back to room temperature.

Hold a spear of asparagus at each end and snap it.  The spear breaks where the tender tops meet the tough bottoms.  Line the broken spear up with the bundle of cleaned asparagus.  Cut the spears using the guideline of the snapped spear.

Par boil the asparagus tops in 1 inch simmering water covered for 3 to 5 minutes.  Cool under cold running water and drain.  Cut asparagus into 1-inch pieces on an angle and add to a bowl.

Combine chopped, cooked asparagus with shredded endive, red bell pepper, cooked pasta, green peas and chopped parsley.  The peas will defrost as you toss salad.

Pour vinegar into a small bowl and whisk in cooled shallot oil.  Pour dressing over salad and toss.  Season salad with salt and pepper, to your taste and toss again.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPINACH AND CHEESE CAKES ===
  2           packages  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz ea)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  Italian bread crumbs
     1/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1                     egg -- beaten
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === STEAKS ===
  4                     thin slices bacon
                        = (look for packaged bacon marked "Center
                        Cut" in packaged meats case)
  4                     beef tenderloin steaks, 1 1/2" thick
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
     1/2           cup  beef stock
                        === PLATE GARNISH ===
  4              small  Roma tomatoes
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
  2        tablespoons  chopped or snipped fresh chives

Defrost spinach in microwave.  Wring spinach dry by nesting in kitchen towel and twisting towel over garbage bowl or sink until spinach has given off all of its liquid.  Place spinach in a medium mixing bowl.

Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of the oil and onion and saute the onion until soft, 5 minutes.  Add onion to spinach in bowl and return pan to stove top.  Turn off heat.

Add remaining ingredients to spinach: bread crumbs, cheese, egg, nutmeg, salt and pepper.  Combine mixture with a fork, then form into 3-inch patties.  Set aside.

Line bacon up on meat-safe cutting board a few inches apart.  Preheat a second skillet over high heat.  Reheat the spinach cakes skillet over medium-high heat.  Season steaks with salt and pepper and set on bacon slices in the center of each slice.  Wrap bacon over steaks.  Place seam-side down in pan and cook 2 minutes on each side.

Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to spinach cakes pan and set cakes in to cook.  Work in 2 batches if necessary.  Cook cakes 3 minutes on each side.

Reduce heat to medium under steaks after the first 2 minutes on each side.  Cook meat another 6 to 10 minutes, turning occasionally, for medium-rare to medium-well doneness.

Remove meat from the pan and let it rest.  Add 1 tablespoon of the butter and flour and cook together 1 minute.  Whisk in wine and deglaze pan.  Whisk in broth and thicken sauce 1 minute.  Add remaining tablespoon butter and remove skillet from heat.

Quarter tomatoes lengthwise.

To serve, set the spinach cakes and steaks beside each other on 2/3 of serving plates and pour sauce evenly over steaks.  Scatter a quartered tomato next to spinach cakes on each plate.  Drizzle tomatoes with oil, season with salt and pepper and top with chopped chives.  Serve plates immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PORK TENDERLOINS, CUBAN STYLE ===
  1 2/3         pounds  pork tenderloin - (to 2 lbs) -- trimmed
                        = (average pkg weight for 2 pieces)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
                        = (or vegetable oil)
  1              small  onion -- minced
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2                     limes -- zested
  1              large  orange -- zested
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
                        === CUBAN SWEET ROLLS ===
  8                     crusty rolls
                        = (such as Portuguese rolls, torpedo
                        loaves or muffaletta style round rolls)
  4          teaspoons  sugar
                        === PLANTAINS ===
     1/4           cup  corn oil
  4                     black (ripe) plantains
  1           teaspoon  fine salt
                        === RELISH FOR SANDWICHES ===
  6                     dill pickles -- chopped
     1/2           cup  sweet red pepper relish
  2                     scallions -- chopped
                        === SANDWICH FIXINS ===
  1              pound  shaved ham -- from the deli
                        counter
  1              pound  shaved Swiss cheese -- from the deli
                        counter
  4        tablespoons  butter -- for toasting
                        sandwiches
                        Frozen Mohito Slushes -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Coat tenderloins with oil.  Combine onion, garlic, citrus zest, salt, pepper and dried oregano in a pile on your cutting board.  Pack this coating equally and evenly onto the tenderloins.  Heat a large skillet.  Add a drizzle of oil and sear tenderloin on all sides.  Then place in hot oven to roast 20 to 25 minutes.  Wash hands.

Brush rolls with a little warm water and sprinkle the tops of the rolls with 1/2 teaspoon sugar each.  Pile rolls on a baking sheet and place in oven with meat for 5 minutes to crust rolls and set sugar.  Authentic Cuban rolls used for this sandwich are sweet.  This sugar wash process gives a similar effect to store bought rolls.  When rolls come out of oven, split and pile on serving plate.

Preheat a stovetop griddle over medium-high heat.

Heat 1/4 cup corn oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Peel plantains and cut in half lengthwise, then slice each half into thirds on an angle.  Arrange plantains in pan in a single layer and cook until crisp, continuously flipping for even browning.  Remove from skillet to paper towel lined plate and season with fine salt.

To assemble sandwiches:  Thinly slice meat on an angle.  Place ham and Swiss cheese on a serving plate, separating and fluffing up the shaved meat and cheese.  Assemble sandwiches with desired fillings and place on a hot, buttered griddle.  Use a heavy pan to press the sandwiches together.  Toast until golden brown, then flip and toast the other side.

Combine chopped pickles, sweet red pepper relish and scallions in a small bowl.

Spread the relish on the tops of the rolls and pork slices, ham, and swiss cheese on the bottoms.  Press the sandwiches together.  Put about 1 tablespoon of butter on the hot griddle and spread to coat.  Put 2 sandwiches at a time on the griddle, and top with a heavy cast-iron skillet.  Toast sandwiches on the griddle, turning once, until golden, hot, and cheese is melted, 2 or 3 minutes per side.

Serve with a few slices of plantains per person as a side dish.  Frozen Mohitos Slushes make a great drink or dessert.

This recipe yields up to 8 servings.

Coat tenderloins with oil.  Combine onion, garlic, citrus zest, salt, pepper and dried oregano in a pile on your cutting board.  Pack this coating equally and evenly onto the tenderloins.  Heat a large skillet.  Add a drizzle of oil and sear tenderloin on all sides.  Then place in hot oven to roast 20 to 25 minutes.  Wash hands.

Brush rolls with a little warm water and sprinkle the tops of the rolls with 1/2 teaspoon sugar each.  Pile rolls on a baking sheet and place in oven with meat for 5 minutes to crust rolls and set sugar.  Authentic Cuban rolls used for this sandwich are sweet.  This sugar wash process gives a similar effect to store bought rolls.  When rolls come out of oven, split and pile on serving plate.

Preheat a stovetop griddle over medium-high heat.

Heat 1/4 cup corn oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Peel plantains and cut in half lengthwise, then slice each half into thirds on an angle.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     all-purpose potatoes -- peeled, diced
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
     1/4                onion
  3        tablespoons  prepared yellow mustard
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  sweet paprika
  1           teaspoon  hot cayenne pepper sauce

                        === GARNISH ===
  2                     scallions -- thinly sliced

Boil potatoes in water seasoned with coarse salt until they are tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain cooked potatoes and return to the warm pot to dry them out.  Let the potatoes stand 2 minutes, then spread potatoes out on to a cookie sheet to quick-cool them.

In the bottom of a medium mixing bowl, grate 1/4 onion using a hand grater.  Add mustard and mayonnaise, paprika and cayenne pepper sauce to the grated onion and stir to combine.

Add potatoes to the bowl and stir to evenly distribute dressing.  Season potato salad with salt and pepper and taste to adjust your seasonings.  Top servings of salad with chopped scallions.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  12                    fingerling potatoes -- cut in halves
                        = (1-inch baby potatoes may be

     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
  1                cup  grated Gruyere or Swiss
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  steamed broccoli florets
  1              pound  asparagus -- trimmed of stems,
                        tips reserved
  2        tablespoons  snipped or chopped fresh chives
     1/2                French baguette -- cubed
  12                    cherry tomatoes
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
                        Cornichons or baby gherkin pickles
                        Marinated mushrooms
                        Pickled onions

Cover potatoes with water and bring the water to a boil.  Salt the water and simmer potatoes 10 to 12 minutes, until just tender.  Drain potatoes and return to warm pot to dry the potatoes.  Drizzle potatoes with a little oil to keep them from discoloring and to shine them up.

Fill a second skillet or saucepan with 2 inches of water.  Cover and bring the water to a boil on the stovetop.  Salt the water, replace the cover and reduce heat to simmer.

To a heavy saucepan over moderate heat, add 1 tablespoon oil and the chopped shallots.  Saute shallots for 2 or 3 minutes, then add sherry and allow it to almost evaporate, a minute or 2.  Add half-and-half to the pan and reduce heat to low.

Cut cream cheese into 1-inch slices and add it to the pot.  Allow the cream cheese to slowly melt into the half-and-half, 5 minutes.  Add Parmesan and shredded Gruyere or Swiss to the sauce and stir until cheese is melted and fully incorporated.  Stir in lemon juice.  Season sauce with, nutmeg and black pepper.

Place a candle underneath a wire rack or warm a fondue pot.  Transfer cheese sauce to fondue pot or place saucepan over wire rack and burning candle.

To simmering, salted water, add broccoli and cook florets, covered, 3 minutes.  Remove broccoli with a slotted spoon to a plate and add asparagus tips.  Cook asparagus tips 2 minutes, then remove with tongs to a plate.

Arrange the items for dipping on a large serving platter.  Garnish the cooked potatoes with chives.  Set the cubed baguette on the opposite end of the platter, to balance color.  Between potatoes and bread, arrange cooked broccoli, asparagus and cherry tomatoes.  Set out fondue forks or bamboo skewers for dipping.  Place small dishes of cornichons, marinated mushrooms and pickled onions near dipping station for accompaniments.

  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  fennel seed

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     small bundle fresh thyme sprigs - (4 to 6) -- left whole
  2             pieces  orange peel -- 3" or 4" strips
     1/2           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1                cup  dry white wine
  4               cups  good quality chicken stock -- from soup aisle
  1                can  chunky style crushed tomatoes - (15 oz)
                        = (or diced tomatoes)
  3             pounds  fish -- cut 2" pieces
                        = (such as red snapper and tilapia)
  12                    sea scallops -- halved
  2                     baguettes -- ask for them to be
                        sliced at the bakery counter
                        === ROUILLE ===
  4                     garlic cloves -- cracked away from
                        skin
  2                     roasted red bell peppers
                        = (jarred is fine but pat them dry)
  2              small  red chile peppers -- seeded
                        = (or 1 tspn crushed red pepper flakes)
  6             slices  baguette, 1/2" thick -- crust trimmed
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  stock from above stew -- taken as it cooks
  1                cup  olive oil

Heat a wide, heavy pot over medium-high heat.  Add 3 turns of the pan, about 3 tablespoons, extra-virgin olive oil.  Add garlic, leeks, onions, celery and bay.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add thyme sprigs, orange peels and 2 handfuls parsley, reserving some chopped parsley for garnish.  Stir to combine seasonings with vegetables.  Saute vegetables 5 to 8 minutes, until leeks are tender, but still green.

Add wine and stir in 1 to 2 minutes.  Add chicken stock and tomatoes and stir well to combine.  Arrange cut fish and scallops around the pan.  Spoon soup stock over and around seafood.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover pan and cook 10 to 12 minutes, until fish and scallops are opaque.

Preheat oven to 250 degrees.

Spread baguette slices across a cookie sheet.  Reserve at least 6 slices for rouille.  Place sheet in oven to lightly toast sliced bread.

For rouille, in a food processor, place 4 cloves garlic, drained roasted red peppers, and chile peppers or chili flakes.  Tear the 6 pieces of the sliced baguette into pieces and arrange around the food processor bowl.  Steal a ladle of the stock, about 1/4 cup, from fish stew as it cooks and pour it over the bread to moisten it.  Pulse pepper and bread together, then turn processor on.  Stream in about 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil in a slow, steady stream.  When mixture is smooth and well combined, transfer to a small serving bowl.

When fish and scallops are cooked through, arrange cooked seafood in shallow bowls.  Stir soup and ladle it down and over seafood.  Be on the lookout for bay leaves, thyme stems or orange peels and discard as you find them, while you are serving up stew.  Garnish stew with remaining parsley.  Serve fool-i-ya-baise with toasted bread rounds, which should be spread with rouille and set afloat on top of bowls of stew.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Heat a wide, heavy pot over medium-high heat.  Add 3 turns of the pan, about 3 tablespoons, extra-virgin olive oil.  Add garlic, leeks, onions, celery and bay.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add thyme sprigs, orange peels and 2 handfuls parsley, reserving some chopped parsley for garnish.  Stir to combine seasonings with vegetables.  Saute vegetables 5 to 8 minutes, until leeks are tender, but still green.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add wine and stir in 1 to 2 minutes.  Add chicken stock and tomatoes and stir well to combine.  Arrange cut fish and scallops around the pan.  Spoon soup stock over and around seafood.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover pan and cook 10 to 12 minutes, until fish and scallops are opaque.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 250 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread baguette slices across a cookie sheet.  Reserve at least 6 slices for rouille.  Place sheet in oven to lightly toast sliced bread.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For rouille, in a food processor, place 4 cloves garlic, drained roasted red peppers, and chile peppers or chili flakes.  Tear the 6 pieces of the sliced baguette into pieces and arrange around the food processor bowl.  Steal a ladle of the stock, about 1/4 cup, from fish stew as it cooks and pour it over the bread to moisten it.  Pulse pepper and bread together, then turn processor on.  Stream in about 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil in a slow, steady stream.  When mixture is smooth and well combined, transfer to a small serving bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When fish and scallops are cooked through, arrange cooked seafood in shallow bowls.  Stir soup and ladle it down and over seafood.  Be on the lookout for bay leaves, thyme stems or orange peels and discard as you find them, while you are serving up stew.  Garnish stew with remaining parsley.  Serve fool-i-ya-baise with toasted bread rounds, which should be spread with rouille and set afloat on top of bowls of stew.

                        === TRIANGLES ===
  4                     sheets phyllo dough - (13" by 17" ea)
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
                        === BANANAS ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     bananas -- thickly sliced
  2                     bananas -- sliced on an angle
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  2              shots  spiced rum
  1               pint  French vanilla bean ice cream

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Spread a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Top with a layer of phyllo and brush the sheet with the melted butter.  Mix sugar and cinnamon.  Scatter a layer of sugar across the butter coated pastry.

Repeat with 2 more layers of pastry, then top with a final sheet of dough then cut pastry into long triangles, working from side to side of the cookie sheet, using a sharp paring knife or pizza wheel.

Cover the pastry with another sheet of parchment paper and another cookie sheet.  Place pastry in the hot oven and bake 15 minutes or until golden.  Remove pastry from oven to cool.

Begin other recipes in your menu while pastry bakes.

When you are ready to serve dessert, heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons butter.  When butter melts, add bananas and saute 3 minutes.  Sprinkle with brown sugar to coat bananas.

When sugar melts around fruit, add rum and flame it.  Pour rum from shot glass, not from the bottle, to prevent flame ups.  When flame goes out and alcohol has evaporated, spoon warm bananas into cocktail glasses.  Top with small scoops of French vanilla ice cream and garnish with phyllo triangles.  Serve extra triangles on a pretty plate for sweet snacking.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  boneless leg of lamb - (2 3/4 lbs)
                        = (ask your butcher to butterfly the leg
                        for you)
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1              bunch  fresh mint leaves -- washed
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
                        Lemon or grapefruit wedges
                        Baby Potatoes With Cumin -- (see recipe)
                        Watercress Salad With Lime Dressing -- (see recipe)

Preheat a grill or grill pan.  Place lamb on a shallow baking pan.  Season both sides of the meat with salt and coarse black pepper.

In a food processor, puree the garlic, mint, salt and pepper, then add the extra-virgin olive oil in a slow stream.  Pour marinade over the lamb and rub into the meat.  Place on grill and cook on 1 side for 10 minutes.  Flip lamb, cover with aluminum foil and grill for another 10 minutes.

Remove lamb from grill pan and let rest for 10 minutes for juices to redistribute.  Slice and serve.  Squeeze a wedge of lemon or grapefruit over the meat and enjoy.  Reserve 1 pound of the meat for the Lamb Pitas with Tomato, Scallions and Mint Yogurt Dressing recipe.  Complete this menu with Baby Potatoes With Cumin and Watercress Salad With Lime Dressing.

This recipe yields 2 to 3 servings, plus 1 pound of leftovers.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     fresh halibut steak or filets - -- (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     lime -- juiced
  3              small  to medium ripe Haas avocados -- pitted, and
                        scooped from skins with a large spoon
  1                     lemon -- juiced
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1                cup  plain yogurt
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt
  2                     plum tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  2                     scallions -- thinly sliced
                        on an angle
  1                     heart Romaine lettuce
  12                    soft flour tortillas - (6" dia)

Preheat a grill pan or indoor grill to high heat or, prepare outdoor grill.  Drizzle halibut with extra-virgin olive oil to keep fish from sticking to the grill pan or grill.  Season fish with salt and pepper, to your taste.

Roll lime on the counter top to get juices flowing.  Also, any under ripe citrus may be placed in a microwave oven for 10 seconds at high setting to induce the juices to flow.

Grill fish 4 to 5 minutes on each side or until opaque.  Squeeze the juice of 1 lime down over the fish and remove from the grill pan or grill.  Flake fish into large chunks with a fork.

While fish is cooking, in a blender or food processor, combine avocado flesh, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, yogurt and salt.  Process guacamole sauce until smooth.  Remove guacamole sauce to a bowl and stir in diced tomatoes and chopped scallions.  Shred lettuce and reserve.

When fish comes off the grill pan or grill, blister and heat soft taco wraps.  To assemble, break up fish and pile some of the meat into soft shells and slather with guacamole sauce.  Top with shredded lettuce, fold tacos over and eat!

This recipe yields 4 servings, 3 fish tacos each.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     rounded cup white rice
  2        tablespoons  black sesame seeds
                        = (toasted white sesame seeds may be
                        substituted)
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts
  4                     boneless skinless chicken thighs
                        Vegetable oil -- for drizzling
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  chicken broth
                        = (or water)
  1              piece  ginger root - (1") -- peeled, chopped
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  teriyaki sauce
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame oil
  4                     scallions -- thinly sliced
  1                     ripe pineapple

Preheat a grill pan or large griddle over medium-high heat.

Bring water to a boil in a small covered pot.  Add butter, salt and rice to the pot.  Return the water to a boil.  Reduce heat to simmer and replace cover.  Simmer 18 minutes and remove rice from heat.  Take the lid off the pot to cool rice a bit.

Scoop rice into balls with an ice cream scoop and your hands.  Dampen hands with water to work with rice if it is very sticky.  Set rice balls on a plate and sprinkle with black sesame seeds.

While your rice is cooking, lightly coat chicken with oil, salt and pepper.  Place chicken on hot grill and cook 6 minutes on the first side.

While chicken is cooking, bring chicken broth and ginger to a boil.  Stir in honey.  When honey has dissolved into broth, add teriyaki sauce and sesame oil and reduce heat to simmer.

Turn chicken and coat liberally with honey teriyaki sauce using a basting brush.  Cook chicken 4 minutes, turn again and baste liberally again with sauce, then cook 2 minutes longer.  Remove chicken to a plate.  Garnish chicken with sliced scallions.

While chicken cooks on the second side, peel and cut a ripe pineapple into 8 spears.  Cut off top and bottom of pineapple.  Set pineapple upright and trim away skin in strips from top to bottom.  Halve pineapple lengthwise and quarter each 1/2, lengthwise.  The core is edible, but may be trimmed if you wish.  Pineapple can be very acidic.  Spears set in cold water for just 1 minute will keep the fruit from stinging your lips when it is eaten.  Serve with chicken and rice balls.

       Inside-Out Bacon Cheeseburgers With Grilled Green Onion Mayo

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             slices  bacon -- chopped
  4                     scallions -- cleaned, trimmed
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
  1 1/3         pounds  ground beef sirloin
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  steak seasoning blend
                        = (or coarse salt and black pepper)
     1/2         pound  extra sharp white cheddar cheese -- crumbled
  1                cup  mayonnaise
                        = (or reduced fat mayonnaise)
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     crusty Kaiser rolls -- split
  4                     leaves crisp romaine lettuce

Preheat grill pan over high heat.

In a medium pan brown bacon over medium high heat and drain on paper towel lined plate.

Brush scallions with a little oil and grill on hot grill pan 2 or 3 minutes on each side.  Remove from heat to cool.

Combine ground beef with Worcestershire and steak seasoning or salt and pepper.  Divide meat into 4 equal parts.  Combine cheese crumbles and cooked bacon.  Take 1/4 of the meat in your hand and make a well in the center of it.  Pile in cheese and bacon, then carefully form the burger around the cheese and bacon filling.  Make sure the fillings are completely covered with meat.

When all 4 patties are formed, drizzle burgers with oil and place on hot grill pan.  Cook 2 minutes on each side over high heat, reduce heat to medium-low and cook burgers 7 or 8 minutes longer, turning occasionally.  Do not press down on burgers as they cook.  Transfer burgers to a plate and let them rest 5 minutes before serving.

Chop cooled, grilled green onions and add to a food processor.  Add mayonnaise and cumin to the food processor and pulse the onions and mayonnaise.  Season with salt and pepper, to your taste.

Pile burgers on crusty buns and top with crisp lettuce leaves and a slather of green onion mayonnaise.  As you bite into the burgers, you will find a smoky, cheesy surprise at the center.

  2        tablespoons  light oil
                        = (such as wok oil or vegetable oil)
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame oil
  1 1/4         pounds  beef sirloin, 1 1/2" thick
                        Steak seasoning blend -- to taste
                        = (or freshly-ground black pepper)
  1            package  eight-inch bamboo skewers - (min 40 ct)
                        === TUNA ===
  3        tablespoons  sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  Chinese five-spice powder
  2        tablespoons  steak seasoning blend
                        = (preferred brand Montreal Steak
                        Seasoning by McCormick)
  2                     Ahi steaks - (8 oz ea) -- cut 1" by 3" pieces
                        Light oil -- for drizzling
                        = (such as wok oil or vegetable oil)
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame oil
                        === CONDIMENTS ===
  1                jar  pickled watermelon rind - (14 to 18 oz)
  1                jar  pickled onions - (14 to 18 oz)
  1                jar  pickled ginger - (10 to 12 oz)
                        === FRESH FRUIT SELECTION ===
  3                     kiwis
  3                     tangerines
  3                     Asian pears -- washed

Place water in sauce pan over high heat in medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add rice, stir.  Cover rice and reduce heat to low.  Cook rice 18 minutes or until tender.

Preheat coals for tabletop hibachi or preheat grill pan over medium high to high heat.

Combine sherry, sugar, dark soy and oil in a shallow dish.  Turn cut chicken and scallions in marinade and let stand 10 minutes.  Wash hands.

Combine ginger and soy, oil and sesame oil in a second shallow dish for the beef.  Cut raw meat against the grain in thin strips.  Thread strips on to skewers, reserving several skewers for chicken, set into ginger and soy mixture.  Season meat lightly with steak seasoning blend and turn in ginger and soy to coat.  Set meat aside.  Wash hands.

Toast sesame seeds in a small skillet over moderate heat until they pop and are lightly toasted.  This process will develop the flavor of the sesame fully.  Combine the sesame seeds with five-spice powder and grill seasoning blend on a piece of wax paper or on a plate.  Coat tuna with a scant drizzle of oil and sesame oil to help seeds and spices adhere to fish.  Coat fish pieces in sesame and spices.

Cook chicken pieces and scallions in a single layer over hot coals or on hot grill pan for 3 or 4 minutes on each side.  Transfer chicken and scallions to a serving plate and set several bamboo skewers on the edge of the plate for spearing meat and scallions.

Place beef skewers on hot grill surface and cook 2 to 3 minutes on each side in a single layer, turning once.  Transfer to a serving plate.

Cook fish on hot grill surface 1 to 2 minutes on each side and transfer to a serving plate.  Tuna will be rare.  Serve with several skewers on plate's edge for spearing.

Transfer pickled watermelon rind, pickled ginger and pickled onions to ramekins and place along side grilled meats and fish for condiments.  Serve with hot rice and extra soy sauce for dipping.  Kiwis, tangerines and Asian pears are a nice offering of fresh fruit to round out this light menu.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     romaine lettuce hearts -- chopped
  3                     navel oranges
     1/4           cup  sliced or slivered almonds - (2 oz) -- toasted
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon
  2          teaspoons  honey - (rounded)
  2        tablespoons  tarragon vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/3           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Arrange chopped lettuce on a platter.

Trim a thin slice of orange skin down to the flesh off the top and bottom of the orange.  Stand the orange upright and trim off strips of the remaining peel working from top to bottom around the orange.  Cut each orange then in 1/2 lengthwise.  Slice the half oranges into half-moon shapes.  Arrange the sliced oranges around the chopped romaine.

Lightly toast the almonds in a small skillet over moderate heat or in a toaster or conventional oven.  Top the romaine and oranges with toasted almonds and chopped tarragon.

In a small bowl, combine honey, vinegar, orange juice and mustard with a whisk.  Stream in the oil while continuing to whisk the dressing to combine it.  Pour the dressing evenly over the entire salad platter in a slow, thin stream.  Season the salad with salt and pepper.  The salad is pretty as is, no tossing.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Add the tuna steak, cover, and simmer until cooked through, about 4 minutes.  Remove tuna from the water and allow to cool.  Place tuna in a bowl and separate with a fork.  Add capers, red onion, artichokes.

For olives, if they're pitted, coarsely chop them.  If the olives have pits, place an olive or 2 on your cutting board.  Turn your knife sideways and place the flat of the blade on top of the olives -- just like peeling garlic -- whack the heal of your hand on knife and the pits of the olives will be exposed.  Remove pits and chop.

Add olives and parsley to tuna mixture.  Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the bowl.  Squeeze lemon halves holding cut side upright, allowing juice to spill over sides.  The seeds will stay with the lemon half, rather than falling into your salad.  Add black pepper to the bowl and drizzle salad liberally with extra virgin olive oil.  Toss tuna salad and adjust pepper and oil to your taste.

Pack the tuna salad on to baguette halves and set tops in place.  Press down to set the bread and salad together.  The bread will absorb the oil and salad juices -- YUMMY!  Cut each half baguette in half again, making 4 sandwiches, total.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The longer pan bagnat sits, the tastier it gets.  I make a whole baguette, even for just myself.  In less than 24 hours, after a late night trip or two to the fridge, I can finish the whole loaf off!  Also, This recipe is picnic-perfect!

One last tip:  wrap the sandwich in wax paper, peeling it back as you eat the bagnat.  The wrapping over the end of each sandwich will catch the juices as you eat it.

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  chopped frozen spinach -- defrosted
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves - (to 6) -- finely chopped
  2               cans  quartered artichokes in water -- drained well
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === WHITE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  vegetable or chicken stock
     1/2           cup  cream or half-and-half
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  1            package  fresh ravioli - (24 to 28 oz) -- such as Contadina
                        brand, marked "Family Size"
                        = (or choose your favorite filling, such
                        as wild mushroom or 4 cheese)
  1              pound  thin asparagus spears -- tough ends trimmed
  2               cups  grated provolone - (10 oz)
                        = (or Italian 4 Cheese Blend)

Bring a pot of water to boil for ravioli.

While water comes to a boil, drain defrosted frozen chopped spinach by wringing it dry in a kitchen towel, working over a garbage bowl or your sink.  Heat a medium skillet over medium heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 tablespoons or 2 turns of the pan, and the garlic.  Saute garlic in oil 1 minute, then sprinkle spinach into the garlic oil.  Add artichoke heart pieces to the pan and turn to combine and heat through.  Season vegetables with salt and pepper and remove from heat to a bowl.

Place skillet back on the heat and melt butter.  Whisk flour into butter and cook 1 to 2 minutes.  Whisk stock into flour and butter and let it bubble.  Whisk in cream and Parmesan.  Season sauce with nutmeg, salt and pepper and thicken 1 to 2 minutes.

Preheat broiler to high.  Set rack between middle of oven groove and top rack groove, about 8 inches from heat.

When water boils, salt water, add ravioli and cook 4 to 5 minutes.  Ravioli should be less than al dente, still a bit chewy -- it will continue cooking when combined with sauce and vegetables.  Place a colander over ravioli as it cooks and add asparagus to it.

Cut thin, trimmed asparagus into 2-inch pieces on an angle.  Steam the chopped asparagus while pasta cooks, 2 to 3 minutes, until just fork-tender, but still green.  Remove asparagus and add to bowl with spinach and artichokes.  Place colander in your sink and drain ravioli.

Drizzle a touch of extra-virgin olive oil onto the bottom of a medium oval casserole or a rectangular baking dish and brush pan to coat evenly.  Arrange a layer using 1/2 of cooked ravioli in the dish.  Layer 1/2 of the cooked vegetables over the ravioli.  Next, add a few ladles of sauce, then vegetables, then top casserole with the last of the ravioli.  Dot top of "lasagna" with any remaining sauce and cover liberally with grated provolone or 4 cheese blend.  Brown cheese 8 inches from broiler, 5 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN ===
  4             pieces  boneless skinless chicken breast - -- (6 to 8 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
                        = (just enough to coat chicken lightly)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3             sprigs  rosemary -- leaves stripped,
                        and chopped - (abt 2 tbspns)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     garlic cloves -- smashed
                        === RAVIOLI ===
  1            package  fresh any-flavor-filling ravioli - -- (12 to 16 oz)
  3        tablespoons  butter -- cut small pieces
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2                     handfuls grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Warm Spinach Salad with Pancetta -- (see recipe)

Coat chicken in balsamic vinegar, then olive oil.  Season chicken with rosemary, salt and pepper and let stand 10 minutes.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil for ravioli.  Salt water and drop ravioli in water.  Cook 8 minutes or until raviolis expand, float to top of water, and are al dente.

Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add chicken breasts and cracked garlic to the pan.  Cook chicken 12 minutes, or until juices run clear, turning occasionally.  The balsamic vinegar will produce a deep brown, sweet finish on the chicken as it cooks.

When the chicken is 2 or 3 minutes away from done, heat a second skillet over medium-low to medium heat.  To the second skillet, add butter to the pan and let it begin to brown.

Remove chicken from the first skillet and transfer to a warm platter.

When the butter for the ravioli has browned, add cooked ravioli to the pan and turn in butter to heat through.  Add balsamic vinegar to the ravioli and cook a minute or 2 longer to reduce the vinegar and glaze the ravioli.  The vinegar will become thick and syrup like.  Add cheese, parsley, salt and pepper to the pasta and remove the pan from the heat.

Serve chicken along side ravioli and Warm Spinach Salad With Pancetta And Sweet Vinaigrette, all on the same dinner plate.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     leeks -- tough tops trimmed,
                        leaving 3" to 4" of green on white of leek
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (2 tbspns for soup, 1/4 cup for salad
                        dressing, and some for drizzling)
  1                     fresh or dried bay leaf
  4                     all-purpose potatoes -- peeled, sliced
                        = (such as russet)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6               cups  good quality chicken stock
  2              large  garlic cloves -- cracked away from
                        skin
  4             slices  whole-grain French bread -- cut into
                        very small pieces, plus more for dipping
     1/3         pound  slab bacon
                        = (a 1/2" slice from butcher counter)
  1                     shallot -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  4                     eggs
  2              heads  chicory -- washed, and
                        torn into bite-sized pieces
  2              heads  endive -- quartered lengthwise
                        and leaves separated
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Cut leeks in half lengthwise and slice into 1/2-inch pieces.  Place leeks in a colander.  Separate sliced leeks under cold running water and clean them.  Drain well.

Heat a medium soup pot over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, bay leaf and leeks.  Season with salt and pepper.  Peel potatoes and thinly slice them, adding them to soup pot as you go.  Season potatoes with a little salt, add chicken stock to soup pot.  Cover soup and bring to a boil.  Uncover and simmer 12 to 15 minutes, until potatoes are very tender.  Break up potatoes to slightly thicken soup.  Remove bay leaf.

While soup simmers, rub the inside of a large mixing bowl with the cracked garlic.  Slice the bread into small cubes.  Add the bread to the bowl, drizzle generously with olive oil, and season well with salt and pepper.  Toss the bread in the bowl to completely coat with oil, and pour onto a baking sheet in 1 layer.  Place in the oven and toast until golden, about 6 or 8 minutes.

Fill a medium skillet with warm water and bring to a gentle simmer over medium low heat.

Meanwhile, cut slab bacon into 1/4-inch slices, making fat matchstick shapes.  Cook bacon in small nonstick pan over medium-high heat.  Remove rendered bacon to paper towels.

Return pan to heat and cook the shallots in the bacon dripping 3 to 5 minutes, until just tender, over medium heat.  Whisk in 2 tablespoons of vinegar and Dijon until well combined.  While whisking, slowly drizzle in the 1/4 cup olive oil until combined.  Season with salt and pepper.

Pour the remaining tablespoon of vinegar into the simmering water.  Crack an egg into a small bowl.  Gently pour the egg into the simmering water.  Repeat with the remaining 3 eggs.  Cook eggs for about 2 minutes for runny yolks, or about 4 for solid yolks.  Do not allow the water to boil!  Carefully remove the eggs with a slotted spoon to a towel-lined plate to drain.

Tear the chicory into bite-sized pieces, and julienne the endive.  Put the greens in the same bowl you tossed the bread in.  Add the dressing, and tarragon and toss well with tongs.  Divide between 4 plates, and top each with a poached egg.  Season salad with more salt and cracked pepper.

To serve soup, ladle into bowls and top with bacon, croutons, chives and cracked pepper.  Serve with crusty bread on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings each salad and soup.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut leeks in half lengthwise and slice into 1/2-inch pieces.  Place leeks in a colander.  Separate sliced leeks under cold running water and clean them.  Drain well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a medium soup pot over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, bay leaf and leeks.  Season with salt and pepper.  Peel potatoes and thinly slice them, adding them to soup pot as you go.  Season potatoes with a little salt, add chicken stock to soup pot.  Cover soup and bring to a boil.  Uncover and simmer 12 to 15 minutes, until potatoes are very tender.  Break up potatoes to slightly thicken soup.  Remove bay leaf.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While soup simmers, rub the inside of a large mixing bowl with the cracked garlic.  Slice the bread into small cubes.  Add the bread to the bowl, drizzle generously with olive oil, and season well with salt and pepper.  Toss the bread in the bowl to completely coat with oil, and pour onto a baking sheet in 1 layer.  Place in the oven and toast until golden, about 6 or 8 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill a medium skillet with warm water and bring to a gentle simmer over medium low heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, cut slab bacon into 1/4-inch slices, making fat matchstick shapes.  Cook bacon in small nonstick pan over medium-high heat.  Remove rendered bacon to paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return pan to heat and cook the shallots in the bacon dripping 3 to 5 minutes, until just tender, over medium heat.  Whisk in 2 tablespoons of vinegar and Dijon until well combined.  While whisking, slowly drizzle in the 1/4 cup olive oil until combined.  Season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the remaining tablespoon of vinegar into the simmering water.  Crack an egg into a small bowl.  Gently pour the egg into the simmering water.  Repeat with the remaining 3 eggs.  Cook eggs for about 2 minutes for runny yolks, or about 4 for solid yolks.  Do not allow the water to boil!  Carefully remove the eggs with a slotted spoon to a towel-lined plate to drain.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tear the chicory into bite-sized pieces, and julienne the endive.  Put the greens in the same bowl you tossed the bread in.  Add the dressing, and tarragon and toss well with tongs.  Divide between 4 plates, and top each with a poached egg.  Season salad with more salt and cracked pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve soup, ladle into bowls and top with bacon, croutons, chives and cracked pepper.  Serve with crusty bread on the side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings each salad and soup.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  beef stock
  1 3/4           cups  water
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2               cups  white enriched rice
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 2/3         pounds  ground sirloin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     green bell pepper -- seeded, chopped fine
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2               cups  tomato sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cloves
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Spicy Chopped Salad With Tortillas -- (see recipe)

Heat beef stock, water and butter to a full boil.  Add rice, reduce heat and cover pot.  Cook 20 minutes, until tender and liquids are absorbed.

Heat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Add oil and beef and season with salt and pepper.  Brown meat, 2 or 3 minutes.  Add onion, garlic, bell pepper, Worcestershire.  Cook together 5 to 7 minutes, until veggies are just tender.  Add tomato sauce, cloves, cumin and parsley.  Bring mixture up to a bubble and reduce heat to low.

Combine cooked rice with meat mixture and serve with Spicy Chopped Salad With Tortillas.  Reserve 1/2 of the beef and rice and freeze for Stuffed Peppers With Beef, Rice, Spinach And Cheese (see recipe) for another meal.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  You can also choose to make the stuffed peppers in their entirety, then freeze and microwave when ready to serve for 12 to 15 minutes on high.  Reheat with loose plastic over the dish to keep the peppers from splattering.  If you do not have a carousel microwave, rotate peppers once during the reheating of your peppers.

Comments:  You can also choose to make the stuffed peppers in their entirety, then freeze and microwave when ready to serve for 12 to 15 minutes on high.  Reheat with loose plastic over the dish to keep the peppers from splattering.  If you do not have a carousel microwave, rotate peppers once during the reheating of your peppers.

     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Several leaves fresh basil -- torn or chopped
  1              pound  meat loaf mix -- from butcher counter
                        = (ground beef, pork and veal combined)
  1                     egg
     1/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus
                        extra for tossing pasta and to pass at

     1/2           cup  Italian bread crumbs

Heat water for pasta to boil.  Salt and cook pasta 7 to 8 minutes, to al dente.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Heat a deep skillet or medium heavy bottomed sauce pot over medium high heat.  Season pork chops with salt and pepper.  Halve sausages.  Add 1 tablespoon, 1 turn of the pan, extra-virgin olive oil to pan or pot.  Place chops in pan or pot and brown 2 minutes on each side, remove.

Add another tablespoon oil, 1 turn of the pan, and sausages.  Brown sausages 2 minutes on each side and transfer to plate with pork.

Add pepper flakes, 3 cloves chopped garlic and onion to the pot and saute 1 minute.  Add broth to the pan and scrape up drippings.  Add tomatoes and herbs and bring sauce to a bubble.  Add meats back to the pot and reduce heat to simmer.  Simmer sauce until ready to serve, 12 to 15 minutes.

Combine ground meat, egg, remaining 2 cloves chopped garlic, 1/3 cup cheese, and bread crumbs.  Season with salt and pepper and roll into balls, 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter.  Place balls on nonstick cookie sheet.  Roast meatballs 10 minutes, then slide into Sunday sauce and turn off oven.  Add bread to oven to crisp crust.

To serve, place pork, sausages and meatballs on serving dish.  Pour 1/2 of the sauce into a serving dish to ladle over pasta and meats at the table.  Toss cooked spaghetti with remaining sauce in sauce pot, adding a few handfuls of grated cheese to the pot as you toss it.  Transfer pasta to a serving dish.

     1/2                bottled pale beer
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro leaves -- plus
                        a few sprigs for garnish
                        === MAQUE CHOUX ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2                red onion -- chopped
  1                     jalapeÒo -- seeded, chopped fine
  1              small  red bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  4               ears  fresh corn on the cob -- husked
                        A sprinkle sugar
  1               dash  cayenne pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     ripe avocado
  1                     lime -- juiced

Season fish with salt, pepper, cumin, paprika.  Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon oil, 1 turn of the pan.  Heat an ovenproof serving plate in a warm oven.  Saute fish 3 minutes on each side or until opaque.  Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lime over the fish and carefully slide the fillets onto warm platter.  Cover the fish to keep it warm.

Return pan to heat and add remaining tablespoon of oil, 1 turn of the pan.  Over medium-high heat, quickly saute the red onion, jalapeÒo and the garlic.  Saute a minute or so, add the diced tomatillos with seeds and juices.  Season mixture with coarse salt and saute the mixture of vegetables 5 minutes.

Once you get your sauce working, get a second skillet hot over moderate heat for your maque choux.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil (1 turn of the pan,) chopped onion, jalapeÒo and red bell pepper.  Saute 2 or 3 minutes.

Working on a plate to catch the milky juices, scrape corn off the cob.  Break up the kernels and pour into the skillet.  Combine corn with peppers and onions.  Season with a sprinkle of sugar, a dash of cayenne pepper and salt.

When mixture bubbles, reduce heat to simmer.  Cut butter into pieces and stir into corn mixture.  Allow mixture to simmer and cook until creamy, 5 to 7 minutes.

While corn is working, go back to your sauce for the fish.  Add the beer and the juice of 1/2 lime and cilantro to the pan.  Simmer sauce 5 minutes longer, then spoon hot sauce down over the fish filets.  Garnish platter with a few extra sprigs of the cilantro.

Cut avocados in half lengthwise and remove pits.  Squeeze lime juice over the avocados to keep them from browning and season them with a little coarse salt.  Arrange on the serving plate.

To serve, fill the avocados with maque choux, allowing the corn to spill down and over the sides of the avocado onto the serving platter.  The ripe avocado is spooned away from its skin with bites of creamy, warm corn and peppers.  Place the avocados alongside garnished fish and enjoy with lime sorbet topped with raspberries and Grand Marnier.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  8                     cremini mushrooms (baby portobellos)* -- chopped
  8                     shiitake mushrooms* -- chopped
  1                     shallot -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/3         pounds  ground turkey
                        = (the average weight of 1 package)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh sage leaves
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2           cup  Italian bread crumbs
  1                     egg -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  poultry seasoning

* Clean mushrooms with a damp cloth.  Do not run directly under water.

Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Add chopped mushrooms and shallots and season with salt and pepper.  Saute mushrooms 5 or 6 minutes until dark and tender.  Remove from heat.  Transfer mushrooms to a bowl and return pan to stove top to preheat to cook patties.

Add turkey to the mushroom mixture.  Make a well in the center of the meat.  Add sage, Worcestershire sauce, bread crumbs and beaten egg and season with salt and pepper.  Mix turkey meat loaf and make a small 1-inch patty.  Place meat in the hot pan and cook 1 minute on each side.  Taste the mini patty to help you adjust seasonings.

Divide meat loaf mixture into 4 equal parts by scoring the meat before you form patties.  Form 4 equal oval patties 1-inch thick.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, and arrange patties in the skillet.  Cook 6 minutes on each side and transfer to a serving plate or individual dinner plates.

Return pan to heat and add butter.  When butter melts, whisk in flour and cook 1 to 2 minutes.  Whisk in stock and season gravy with poultry seasoning, salt and pepper, to taste.  Simmer gravy until it reaches desired thickness, and pour over patties, reserving a little to pass at the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

* Clean mushrooms with a damp cloth.  Do not run directly under water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Add chopped mushrooms and shallots and season with salt and pepper.  Saute mushrooms 5 or 6 minutes until dark and tender.  Remove from heat.  Transfer mushrooms to a bowl and return pan to stove top to preheat to cook patties.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add turkey to the mushroom mixture.  Make a well in the center of the meat.  Add sage, Worcestershire sauce, bread crumbs and beaten egg and season with salt and pepper.  Mix turkey meat loaf and make a small 1-inch patty.  Place meat in the hot pan and cook 1 minute on each side.  Taste the mini patty to help you adjust seasonings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide meat loaf mixture into 4 equal parts by scoring the meat before you form patties.  Form 4 equal oval patties 1-inch thick.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, and arrange patties in the skillet.  Cook 6 minutes on each side and transfer to a serving plate or individual dinner plates.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return pan to heat and add butter.  When butter melts, whisk in flour and cook 1 to 2 minutes.  Whisk in stock and season gravy with poultry seasoning, salt and pepper, to taste.  Simmer gravy until it reaches desired thickness, and pour over patties, reserving a little to pass at the table.

  4              large  flour tortillas - (12" dia)
  2               cups  shredded sharp white cheddar
                        === SALSA ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, chopped
  1                can  black beans -- drained
  1                cup  frozen corn kernels
     1/2           cup  sun-dried tomatoes in oil -- chopped
     1/2           cup  smoky barbecue sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add the oil and the sliced mushrooms to the hot skillet.  Season mushrooms with black pepper, salt and thyme.  Saute the mushrooms 10 minutes or, until dark and tender, then remove from heat.  Transfer the mushrooms to a dish and return the skillet to the stove over medium heat.

Add another turn of extra-virgin olive oil to the skillet and add the onions, garlic and jalapeÒo pepper; saute for 2 or 3 minutes, then add beans and corn to the pan.  Stir in chopped tomatoes and barbecue sauce, then season salsa with salt and pepper.  Transfer warm salsa to a serving dish.

Heat a griddle pan or large nonstick skillet over medium to medium high heat.  Add a drizzle of oil to the pan and 1 flour tortilla.  Cook tortilla 1 minute, then turn it over.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup sharp cheddar over half of the flour tortilla.  Cover the cheese with 1/4 of the cooked sliced mushrooms.  Fold the plain half of the tortilla over top of the filling and gently press down with a spatula.

Cook the filled quesadilla 30 seconds to a minute longer on each side to lightly brown and crisp the quesadilla and melt the cheese.  Remove the quesadilla to a large cutting board or transfer to a warm oven to hold, then repeat with remaining quesadilla ingredients.

Cut each quesadilla into wedges and serve with warm salsa for topping.

This recipe yields 4 quesadillas.
