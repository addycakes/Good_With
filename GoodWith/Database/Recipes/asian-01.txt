                A "Hot" Yellow Fish Curry - {Gaeng Lueng}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fish fillet
  2        tablespoons  yellow curry paste - (to 3 tbspns)
  5               cups  water
  2        tablespoons  palm sugar
     1/3           cup  tamarind sauce
     1/2           cup  sliced long beans
     1/2           cup  sliced asparagus or bamboo shoots

Take about a pound of filleted fish.  If using mackerel discard the head and tail, cut the fish in half along its belly, discard the backbone.  If using catfish just chop it into chunks, and make note of the bones. 

In a large pot, add Yellow Curry Paste and water bring to a boil.  Add the fish, palm sugar, tamarind sauce, sliced long beans and sliced asparagus or bamboo shoots.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat until it is just boiling and cook until the fish is cooked (about 5 minutes). 

Serve over Thai Jasmine rice with the usual Thai table condiments, as well as Thai chili powder. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments: This dish is *meant* to be hot, but it isn't meant to eat the glaze off the plate, so be sensible the first time you try it.  Thais usually have several dishes, that complement each other. A good complement to a hot dish like this is our relatively mild gai yang Isan.

                        === NAM PLA PRIK ===
     2/3           cup  Thai chile peppers
                        Fish sauce -- as needed
                        === PRIK DONG ===

                        === KRATIEM DONG ===
     2/3           cup  sliced peeled garlic
  1           teaspoon  palm sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  MSG
                        White rice vinegar -- as needed
                        === KHING KI MAO ===
     2/3           cup  julienned fresh ginger
     1/2           cup  whiskey/ rice whiskey preferred
     1/2           cup  white rice vinegar
                        Fish sauce -- as needed

Nam Pla Prik:  Put two thirds of a cup of Thai chile peppers in a 1 pint jar, and fill with fish sauce.  Seal, and keep for 1 week before using. 

Prik Dong:  Put two thirds of a cup of Thai chile peppers in a 1 pint jar, and fill with white rice vinegar. 

Prik Si-Iew Wan:  Put two thirds of a cup of jalapeÒo peppers in a 1 pint jar, and fill with sweet dark soy sauce. 

Kratiem Dong:  Peel and slice two thirds of a cup of garlic, place it in a 1 pint jar, add 1 teaspoon of palm sugar, and 1 teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of MSG (optional but recomended); top up with white rice vinegar. 

Khing Ki Mao:  Julienne two thirds of a cup of fresh ginger.  Place in a 1 pint jar.  Add half a cup of whiskey (rice whiskey if available).  Add 1/2 cup white rice vinegar, and fill up the jar with fish sauce. 

Comments:  In Thailand the first two condiments above (Nam pla prik and Prik dong) are likely be on every household's table together with a separate small dish of plain white sugar and a separate small dish of ground chili powder.  Spoonfulls of each are added to suit individual taste. 

We suggest you make a portion of Nam pla prik and Prik dong and keep in a jar (non refrigerated) for serving as a condiment in this manner.  These condiments keep very well. 

Prik Si-iew wan, kratiem dong and Khing Ki mao are less common and usually served for particular dishes.

               Black Sticky Rice Pudding - {Kao Niow Dahm}

Recipe By     :Kasma Loha-unchit
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whole-grain black sticky rice, sweet rice
                        or glutinous rice
  2               cups  coconut milk - (or 1 can)
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame seeds and/or
                        toasted unsweetened shredded coconut -- (optional)
                        Strawberries and mint leaves -- (optional)

Measure the rice into a bowl; run your fingers through the rice and check for any pebbles or other noticeable impurities.  Rinse the rice a few times until the water clears.  Cover with at least 2 inches of water and allow to soak 4 or more hours, or overnight.  The grains will absorb water and grow in size. 

When ready to cook, drain the rice and place in a heat-proof bowl with room enough for the rice grains to expand about a third more than its uncooked bulk.  Add a small amount of boiling water, just enough to barely cover the rice grains.  Place the bowl on a steamer rack and steam over medium heat about 30 to 40 minutes.  If you do not have a steamer, use a large pot in which the bowl fits.  Place a trivet on the bottom along with 2 to 3 inches of water.  Bring to a boil.  Balance the bowl with the rice on the trivet and add hot water to the rice.  Cover and steam.  Steaming the rice with a small volume of water will leave the top layer of grains intact, retaining a chewy texture which pops in your mouth like nuts.  If you wish the rice to be softer, add more water to the rice. 

While the rice is steaming, make the coconut sauce by heating the coconut milk, sugar and salt together in a saucepan.  Stir to dissolve the sugar and salt and blend the sauce until smooth.  Keep warm. 

When the rice is cooked and while still hot out of the steamer, add about half of the sauce or enough to thoroughly coat the rice.  Stir and mix well.  The rice should be wet but not swimming in sauce.  Let stand 15 to 20 minutes to allow the flavorings to be absorbed.  Reserve the remaining sauce for spooning over the rice before serving. 

The flavored rice can be molded into a round mound on a serving plate and decorated with toasted sesame seeds and/or coconut shreds, sliced strawberries and mint leaves for color.  Or dish into individual serving bowls or custard cups, topped with the reserved sauce, toasted seeds and coconut and a mint leaf. 

For a wetter pudding like texture, the rice may alternatively be cooked by boiling, the same way as you would regular rice.  Use 2 1/2 to 3 cups of water to each cup of rice.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to simmer and cook partially covered until the grains are cooked and surrounded by a thick sauce, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking and burning.  Add sugar to sweeten to your liking.  Stir well, cover and place on lowest heat setting for another 5 to 10 minutes.  Make the sauce less sweet but more salty for contrast with the already sweetened rice.  When ready to serve, dish the rice into individual serving bowls and dribble some sauce over each serving. 

Serve warm or at room temperature. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Notes and Pointers: 

Because of its rich, nutty flavor, black sticky rice is usually eaten by itself and not served with fruits, like white sticky rice often is with mangoes.  For toppings, stronger flavors like toasted sesame seeds or toasted shredded coconut do more to accentuate the natural flavor of the rice.  Unsweetened shredded coconut is available in small packages from Asian food markets or sold in bulk in specialty food stores.

                 Catfish Coconut Soup - {Tom Kha Pladuk}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     catfish (abt 1/2 lb prepared weight)
  2               cups  fish stock
  1                cup  coconut milk
  1         tablespoon  julienned galangal
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced lemon grass
  1         tablespoon  coriander/cilantro leaves
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced Thai chile peppers
  4        tablespoons  fish sauce
  4        tablespoons  lime juice

Bring the stock to a simmer.  Add the galangal, lemon grass, coriander, chilis, fish sauce and lime juice, and bring back to the simmer. 

Clean the fish and cut it into 1-inch steaks, then divide them, removing the bones.  Add the fish to the soup, and the coconut milk and bring back to a very gentle simmer, and poach the fish for 3 to 4 minutes (until just cooked). 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  There are two staple soups in Thai cuisine: tom yam is a hot spicy clear soup with elements of sweet and sour flavors added.  Tom kha is a milder soup with coconut milk and galangal (kha) dominating rather than the fiery prik (chili) of the tom yam.  Because it is milder tom khas are often made with chicken or pork, but most common in Thailand are varieties using seafood (especially shrimp, squid, or fish such as red snapper or catfish) or vegetables (especially medleys of mushrooms, tom kha hed).  The catfish can be "crisped" by quickly, and briefly, deep frying it in very hot oil, but this variation is based on simply poaching the fish in the soup. 

In Thailand the fish is cleaned and then poached whole (with the head), then removed from the soup and cut into bite-sized pieces which are returned to the soup for serving.  The method here is a little simpler, in that it doesn't involve handling the hot fish. 

Thais eat the galangal, which is cut into thin matchstick pieces.  However it has been noticed that many Americans prefer to discard the galangal and so it may be wiser to leave the galangal in thin slices.  Similarly the lemon grass is eaten, but you may prefer to cut it into 2-inch lengths, and crush them with a mallet.  These may then be discarded by the diner.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Lettuce leaves -- for platter
                        Sliced cucumber -- for platter
     1/2         pound  beef steak
                        === SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  dark sweet soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  very thinly-sliced shallots
     1/2    tablespoon  palm sugar (or honey can be used)
     1/2    tablespoon  powdered dried red Thai chilis
  1         tablespoon  sliced spring onion/scallion/green onion -- including tops
  1           teaspoon  chopped coriander/cilantro leaf

First prepare a serving platter, lined with lettuce leaves, and decorated with sliced cucumber. 

Combine the ingredients to make the sauce.  Taste and if required add extra sugar/honey, lime juice and/or powdered dried red Thai chilis. 

Barbeque half a pound of steak to whatever "doneness" you prefer, then slice into slices 1/8-inch thick.  Then cut the slices into bite-sized pieces.  Place on the lettuce, and pour the sauce over the steak. 

Served as a one-plate dinner (for a large meal), or serve with soup and salad for an adequate meal for four.  Accompany with the usual Thai table condiments. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Yang dishes are the Thai equivalent of barbeque food.  The most common is undoubtedly gai yang (chicken) where a chicken is split open, beaten flat, and gripped in a cleft stick to grill over the brazier.  This version -- neua yang or barbequed beef -- has a more assertive sauce to go with the stronger flavor of the beef.  A bottle of strong beer is a common accompaniment.  At dinner a good Italian red wine is a good accompaniment.  And of course if you don't have a charcoal brazier, then you could just as easily prepare this dish on a griddle or broil it in the oven.  For an evening meal we suggest serving it with a fruit salad, and a soup such as tom kha gai (chicken soup with a coconut milk stock).

          Chicken And Roasted Eggplant In Red Curry Sauce - ...

Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless chicken
  2               long  Asian eggplants - (to 3)
                        (Thai, Japanese, Chinese or Filipino)
  2               cups  coconut milk - (or 1 can)
  2        tablespoons  red curry paste - (to 3 tbspns)
                        Fish sauce -- to desired
                        saltiness
  1           teaspoon  palm or coconut sugar - (to 2 tspns)
  2                     kaffir lime leaves
                        Slivered chillies -- to desired hotness
  1                cup  fresh Thai sweet basil leaves and flowers

Trim the chicken of any visible fat and, if you wish, pull off the skin.  Cut against the muscle into bite-size chunks.  Set aside. 

Eggplants may be roasted a few hours or a day ahead of time.  Poke them with a fork in a few places and roast over hot mesquite coals with a small handful of damp mesquite chips added.  Cover barbecue kettle to smoke the eggplants, turning them occasionally until they are partially softened and the skins slightly charred.  Remove from coals and place in a brown paper sack for a few minutes to sweat.  Then peel off the thin film on the surface of the skin and cut crosswise into 1 1/2- to 2-inch segments and each segment into half lengthwise. 

Alternately, eggplants may also be roasted directly on the stove by holding them with a pair of tongs through the flame of a gas burner until they are partially softened and charred.  They may also be broiled.  However, roasting over mesquite will add a wonderful smoked aroma to the curry. 

If using canned coconut milk, do not shake the can before opening, so that the cream remains on top.  Spoon 2/3 to 1 cup of this thick cream into a medium-size saucepan.  (If you are making your own coconut milk, use the cream from the first pressing of coconut pulp for this step.)  Heat over medium to high heat and reduce until the cream is smooth and bubbly and the oil begins to separate.  Add the curry paste and fry 3 to 5 minutes in the cream to release the aromas and flavors.  Then add the remaining milk. 

Bring to a boil, stirring to mix the curry paste thoroughly into the sauce to a smooth consistency.  Season with fish sauce to taste and balance with enough palm sugar to bring forth a fuller range of spice and herb flavors, with just a hint of sweetness in the back of your tongue.  Stir in the chicken pieces and return sauce mixture to a boil.  Then reduce heat and simmer uncovered about 10 minutes, or until the chicken is almost cooked through. 

Add the roasted eggplants, kaffir lime leaves and slivered chillies as desired for extra hotness.  Simmer a few minutes to warm and cook the eggplants to the tenderness of your liking.  Toss in the basil and stir until the leaves are just wilted.  Spoon chicken, eggplants and sauce into a serving dish and serve with plain steamed rice. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Trim the chicken of any visible fat and, if you wish, pull off the skin.  Cut against the muscle into bite-size chunks.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Eggplants may be roasted a few hours or a day ahead of time.  Poke them with a fork in a few places and roast over hot mesquite coals with a small handful of damp mesquite chips added.  Cover barbecue kettle to smoke the eggplants, turning them occasionally until they are partially softened and the skins slightly charred.  Remove from coals and place in a brown paper sack for a few minutes to sweat.  Then peel off the thin film on the surface of the skin and cut crosswise into 1 1/2- to 2-inch segments and each segment into half lengthwise. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Alternately, eggplants may also be roasted directly on the stove by holding them with a pair of tongs through the flame of a gas burner until they are partially softened and charred.  They may also be broiled.  However, roasting over mesquite will add a wonderful smoked aroma to the curry. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;If using canned coconut milk, do not shake the can before opening, so that the cream remains on top.  Spoon 2/3 to 1 cup of this thick cream into a medium-size saucepan.  (If you are making your own coconut milk, use the cream from the first pressing of coconut pulp for this step.)  Heat over medium to high heat and reduce until the cream is smooth and bubbly and the oil begins to separate.  Add the curry paste and fry 3 to 5 minutes in the cream to release the aromas and flavors.  Then add the remaining milk. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Bring to a boil, stirring to mix the curry paste thoroughly into the sauce to a smooth consistency.  Season with fish sauce to taste and balance with enough palm sugar to bring forth a fuller range of spice and herb flavors, with just a hint of sweetness in the back of your tongue.  Stir in the chicken pieces and return sauce mixture to a boil.  Then reduce heat and simmer uncovered about 10 minutes, or until the chicken is almost cooked through. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Add the roasted eggplants, kaffir lime leaves and slivered chillies as desired for extra hotness.  Simmer a few minutes to warm and cook the eggplants to the tenderness of your liking.  Toss in the basil and stir until the leaves are just wilted.  Spoon chicken, eggplants and sauce into a serving dish and serve with plain steamed rice.

              Chicken In Pandan Leaves - {Gai Hoh Bai Toey}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  chicken breast -- cut bite size
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  2        tablespoons  coconut milk
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame (or vegetable) oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped ginger
  1              large  pinch freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  rice flour
  1                     fresh pandan leaf -- chopped small

Mix the sauce ingredients, and cut about half a pound of chicken breast meat into largish bite sized pieces, and marinade in the sauce for about 2 to 3 hours. 

The pieces of chicken are then wrapped in the leaves.  This can be done in several "elegant" ways, but the simplest is to form a square of leaf, put the chicken in the center, pick up the corners and secure with a wooden toothpick. 

The sauce is a variation on the popular prik dong (pickled chilis): mix two tablespoons of sugar in 5 tablespoons of rice vinegar, and in a small saucepan reduce this to about half its volume.  Add a pinch of salt and a couple of tablespoons of finely sliced mixed Thai chile peppers.  Transfer to a suitable serving bowl and allow to cool. 

The wrapped chicken is steamed (in any available steamer) for about 10 minutes, after which time the leaves should be soft, and then deep fried in hot oil until the chicken is fully cooked (takes a couple of minutes). 

This is essentially Thai finger food:  You can eat it by holding the pandan leaf and taking the piece in your mouth, or use the toothpick to pick it up, or of course use chopsticks or western-style table utensils.  You can if you prefer keep the steamed parcels in the fridge until you are ready to heat and serve. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  You may be able to get fresh pandan leaves from your local asian market, if not, any large, leafy, relatively strong leaf will suffice.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  coriander seed
  1           teaspoon  cumin seed
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  freshly-grated ginger
  1              pound  chicken breasts -- skinned, boned,
                        and cut into bite sized pieces
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
  1              pinch  turmeric powder - (as only a colorant
                        so use very little!)
  8        tablespoons  coconut milk
  3        tablespoons  palm sugar
                        === PEANUT SAUCE - {NAM JIM} ===
  4             ounces  roasted (unsalted) peanuts
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4), chopped
  1              ounce  chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  red or massaman curry paste - (to 2 tbspns
  1           teaspoon  fish sauce
  8        tablespoons  coconut milk
  4          teaspoons  lime juice - (to 6 tspns) -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  palm sugar - (to 3 tspns)
                        === CUCUMBER SAUCE - {AJAD} ===
  4        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  very coarsely chopped or sliced cucumber -- (to 3 tbspns)
  2                     shallots (or any variety of purple onion) -- chopped
  3                     Thai chile peppers - (to 4) -- thinly sliced

The chicken is beaten flat, using the flat of the blade of a heavy cleaver or using a meat tenderizing mallet.  You can also use a rolling pin. 

The coriander and cumin are toasted and then crushed in a mortar and pestle or food processor (coffee grinder works well).  The ingredients are then combined to form a marinade, and the chicken is marinated overnight. 

The pieces of chicken are then threaded on the 8-inch satay sticks, lossely folding them in half and piercing through the folded meat to form a loose gather. 

The completed sticks are then grilled, broiled or barbequed on fairly high heat (they taste best done over charcoal, as they absorb the smoke).  Turn them regularly and brush them liberally with the remaining marinade.  Cooking should take between 5 and 10 minutes depending on the heat of your cooker. 

Nam Jim (Peanut Sauce), a peanut dressing accompies these snacks.  If you wish, you may use peanut butter rather than the fresh peanuts called for in the recipe. 

First grind or crush the peanuts to a fairly fine powder.  Then combine them with the remaining ingredients (except the lime juice), to form a smooth sauce.  If the sauce is too thick, you can thin it with a little chicken stock.  Now add the lime juice, tasting as you progress to check the balance of flavors is correct. 

Note use red curry paste with beef or pork satay, massaman (as above) with chicken.  If you are doing shrimp satay then use half the quantity of massaman paste. 

Ajad (Cucumber Sauce):  Combine the ingredients, and leave to stand overnight. 

Each diner should have a small bowl of nam jim and a small bowl of ajad.  However the satay themselves are normally served "communally". 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Satay of course is originally an Indonesian/Malay dish, but it has been in Southern Thailand for a very long time.  This is a Thai version.  You can of course also make the same recipe with chunks of beef or pork, or large prawns (if you can, get the very large ones [3 to 4 per pound] then they are usually deheaded and the skewer threaded lengthwise down the body).

                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  thinly-sliced chicken
  1                cup  sweet basil leaves
  4        tablespoons  coconut milk

  3        tablespoons  palm sugar
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce
  3        tablespoons  thinly-sliced Thai chile peppers

In a wok or skillet over medium heat, warm the coconut milk and add the curry paste, stirring briskly until it becomes aromatic.  Discard any oil film that forms on the surface. 

Add the chicken and stir-fry until it just begins to change color.  Add the remaining ingredients, except the basil, and continue to stir-fry until the chicken is almost cooked through. 

Finally, add half of the basil and stir briefly then transfer to a serving platter.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  thick coconut cream
  1                cup  palm or coconut sugar
  5                     eggs
     1/4                bai dteuy (pandanus leaf) essence -- (optional)
  1              small  yellow squash, such as kabocha

Heat the coconut cream and palm sugar in a saucepan just enough to dissolve the sugar and blend with the cream into a smooth mixture.  Allow to cool to room temperature. 

Beat the eggs well and mix in with the cooled, sweetened coconut cream.  If you wish, add a few drops of flavor essence.  Stir well.  Strain the mixture through a dampened muslin cloth, or through a fine wire mesh colander.  Spoon out any bubbles that may have formed over the top. 

Pour the mixture into a heat-proof dish or a hollowed out yellow squash with a small round opening cut on top.  Steam over medium-high heat until the custard is set, about 20 minutes in a dish, and up to an hour inside a squash, depending on its size and thickness.  Let cool. 

If steamed by itself, spoon the custard into serving bowls and serve at room temperature.  The sweet custard is more frequently served as a topping over coconut-flavored white sticky rice (see sticky rice recipe ).  If steamed in a yellow squash, slice the squash and custard into wedges like you would a cake.  The custard is wonderful eaten along with the golden squash. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

           Coconut Seafood Soup With Galanga - {Dtom Kah Talay}

Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              piece  fresh or frozen Thai galanga - (2" to 3")
                        (or substitute with 6 to 8 dried pieces)
  2                     lemon grass stalks
  3               cups  rich coconut milk
  3               cups  water
  8             medium  prawns
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4              whole  squid - (to 5)
  8                     mussels - (to 10) -- in the shell
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2                dungeness crab -- preferably uncooked
  8              large  sea scallops
  1              small  onion -- quartered, and
                        sliced crosswise 1/4" thick
  3                     red jalapeÒo or fresno peppers - (to 4) -- cut large slivers
  4                     fresh kaffir lime leaves -- thinly slivered
  2               cups  fresh mushrooms in 1/4" thick slices
  4        tablespoons  fish sauce (nahm bplah) - (to 6 tbspns) -- or to taste
                        Juice of 1 to 2 limes -- to desired sourness
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar - (to 2tbspns) -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1            handful  cilantro leaves or short sprigs

With a sharp knife, slice the galanga root thinly; it is not necessary to peel unless the outside has turned old and brown.  Cut and discard the bottom tip of the lemon grass and remove the loose outer leaf or leaves.  Slice at a long slanted angle, about an inch apart, all the way up the stalk to near where the grass blade starts.  Smash and bruise with the flat side of a cleaver to release the aromatic oils and flavor.  Place both galanga and lemon grass in a soup pot.  

Spoon as much of the thick cream off the top of the coconut milk as you can and reserve for later use.  Add the remaining watery part along with 3 cups of water to the herbs in the pot.  Bring to a boil, then simmer covered over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes. 

In the meantime, prepare the seafood and remaining ingredients.  Shell and butterfly the prawns.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a 2 tablespoons of water.  Mix well and set aside for about 10 minutes.  Then rinse a few times to remove all the salt.  Clean the squid, cutting the tube-like body into 3 to 4 circles about an inch apart.  Leave the tentacles whole.  Store in cold water until ready to use. 

Scrub the mussels to remove any sand and mud from the shells.  Cover with cold water with 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda added.  Pull off the crab legs and claw.  Use only the top half of the legs; disjoint the claw in two pieces.  Crack each leg and claw piece with the back of a cleaver or heavy knife.  Cut the body half into 2 to 3 pieces.  Leave the scallops whole.  Prepare the remaining ingredients as indicated above. 

When the herbs have simmered sufficiently to draw out their flavors, add the sliced onion, slivered chillies and kaffir lime leaves.  Simmer 2 to 3 more minutes.  Then add the mushrooms and reserved coconut cream.  Stir well to blend into the broth and season to taste with fish sauce.  Bring to a slow boil over medium heat.  Drain the mussels and squid.  When the soup has just reached the boiling point, add the mussels and crab pieces.  Stir.  After 15 seconds, stir in the remaining seafood.  Add half the lime juice.  Stir, then taste; if you wish the soup to be more limy, add more lime juice.  Adjust the sour and salty flavors with enough palm sugar to return the sweet, rich taste of the coconut milk. 

The seafood should be ready in about a minute or so.  Turn off heat and sprinkle with freshly-ground white pepper.  Stir well, then transfer to a soup tureen, or ladle into individual serving bowls, and garnish the top with cilantro. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Notes and Pointers: 

This recipe is written with canned coconut milk in mind.  Either the Mae Ploy or Chao Koh brand, with a rich-tasting, nutty flavor is preferred, or use an equivalent brand that you like.  If you are using freshly made coconut milk, start with the lighter milk from the second or third pressing to simmer the herbs, reserving the richer cream for the later addition. 

This recipe is rich, using one part coconut milk to one part water.  For a lighter soup, blend one part milk to two parts water.  Because it is a rich soup, Thai people eat it more like a curry -- just a few spoonfuls with some rice -- and seldom will eat an entire bowl by themselves, like Westerners, who are used to rich cream soups, will do. 

Reversed from dtom yum soup recipe where lemon grass is the main herb flavor and galanga is in a supporting capacity, this soup is accentuated with the hearty taste of galanga, hence the name dtom kah ("boiled galanga").  Use lots of galanga so that the herb's flavor comes through the rich taste of the coconut milk. 

Thai people usually do not strain herbs out of their soups, but if you find the fibrous lemon grass and strong galanga to be distracting, you may wish to remove them before adding the rest of the ingredients.  This may be a wise idea if you are having guests for dinner who have never had Thai food and may not know what to do should they bite into a piece of hard lemon grass or pungent galanga.

             Coconut-Flavored Sticky Rice With Mangoes - ...

Recipe By     :Kasma Loha-unchit
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  long-grain white sticky rice, sweet rice
                        or glutinous rice
  2               cups  creamy coconut milk - (or one 14-oz can)
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt -- more or less
                        === OPTIONAL FLAVORING ===
  2                     to 3 fresh or frozen pandanus leaves -- (bai dteuy)
                        or 4 to 5 drops jasmine (mali) essence
  1                     ripe mango - (to 2) -- peeled and sliced

Rinse the rice once or twice, cover with water 2 to 3 inches above the rice line and allow to soak at least 4 hours, or overnight.  The grains will absorb much of the water and grow in size.  They will also soften; pressing them between your fingers will easily break them into pieces. 

When ready to cook, drain the rice and steam dry (without any water) in a shallow heat-proof dish, placed on a steamer rack over a pot with 2 or more inches of water on the bottom.  If you are making a large quantity, use the special sticky rice steaming basket so that the rice grains cook more evenly.  When making a large batch, it also helps to turn the rice and sprinkle a little water over the top once or twice during the cooking time. 

When the rice is about 20 minutes into its steaming, prepare the coconut sauce by heating the coconut milk, sugar and salt together in a saucepan.  Warm the milk until the mixture is well blended and smooth.  If you wish a bai dteuy (pandanus leaf) flavor, add a few fresh or frozen bai dteuy leaves and simmer with the sauce for about 10 minutes.  Then, remove the leaves, and after they have cooled enough to handle, use your hand to squeeze out all the fragrant juice until the leaves are dry.  Add the pressed juice to the sauce.  If fresh or frozen leaves are not available, use about 1/4 teaspoon of the green bai dteuy essence.  Or, if you wish a more delicate floral scent, use a few drops of mali (jasmine) essence instead.  Keep the sauce warm. 

When the rice is done and while it is still hot out of the steamer, pour half the coconut sauce over the rice.  Stir well with a spoon to make sure all the grains are well coated.  The rice should be wet but not swimming in sauce.  Add more of the sauce if needed, reserving the remainder for dribbling over the top before serving.  Let stand for 15 to 20 minutes to allow the rice grains to absorb the flavorings. 

When ready to serve, dish the rice onto individual serving plates, spoon some of the reserved coconut sauce over each portion and arrange sliced mangoes over the top.  Serve warm or at room temperature. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Notes and Pointers: 

The coconut sauce should have a pronounced saltiness behind the sweetness.  The saltiness will help bring forth the rich flavors of coconut milk and the delicate taste of sticky rice.  Also, the salty-sweetness of the flavored rice enhances rather than distracts from the fruity sweetness of mangoes. 

When mangoes and durians are not in season, coconut-flavored sticky rice is served with a choice of toppings, ranging from a very sweet coconut-egg custard called sangkaya (see recipe) to a salty-sweet, minced dried shrimp mixture.  The kanom vendor in the market usually has several choices,something to satisfy every mood and palate.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;When ready to cook, drain the rice and steam dry (without any water) in a shallow heat-proof dish, placed on a steamer rack over a pot with 2 or more inches of water on the bottom.  If you are making a large quantity, use the special sticky rice steaming basket so that the rice grains cook more evenly.  When making a large batch, it also helps to turn the rice and sprinkle a little water over the top once or twice during the cooking time. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;When the rice is about 20 minutes into its steaming, prepare the coconut sauce by heating the coconut milk, sugar and salt together in a saucepan.  Warm the milk until the mixture is well blended and smooth.  If you wish a bai dteuy (pandanus leaf) flavor, add a few fresh or frozen bai dteuy leaves and simmer with the sauce for about 10 minutes.  Then, remove the leaves, and after they have cooled enough to handle, use your hand to squeeze out all the fragrant juice until the leaves are dry.  Add the pressed juice to the sauce.  If fresh or frozen leaves are not available, use about 1/4 teaspoon of the green bai dteuy essence.  Or, if you wish a more delicate floral scent, use a few drops of mali (jasmine) essence instead.  Keep the sauce warm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;When the rice is done and while it is still hot out of the steamer, pour half the coconut sauce over the rice.  Stir well with a spoon to make sure all the grains are well coated.  The rice should be wet but not swimming in sauce.  Add more of the sauce if needed, reserving the remainder for dribbling over the top before serving.  Let stand for 15 to 20 minutes to allow the rice grains to absorb the flavorings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;When ready to serve, dish the rice onto individual serving plates, spoon some of the reserved coconut sauce over each portion and arrange sliced mangoes over the top.  Serve warm or at room temperature. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields ?? servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Notes and Pointers: 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;The coconut sauce should have a pronounced saltiness behind the sweetness.  The saltiness will help bring forth the rich flavors of coconut milk and the delicate taste of sticky rice.  Also, the salty-sweetness of the flavored rice enhances rather than distracts from the fruity sweetness of mangoes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;When mangoes and durians are not in season, coconut-flavored sticky rice is served with a choice of toppings, ranging from a very sweet coconut-egg custard called sangkaya (see recipe) to a salty-sweet, minced dried shrimp mixture.  The kanom vendor in the market usually has several choices,something to satisfy every mood and palate.

                 Curried Crab Claws - {Bu Pad Phong Kari}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  crab meat
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced garlic
  2        tablespoons  fish stock
                        (or you may use chicken stock)
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1              pinch  sugar
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced shallots
  2                     spring onions (scallions/green onions) -- sliced thinly
  1         tablespoon  julienned green or red bell pepper

Heat some oil in a wok, and stir-fry the garlic and onions.  Add the fish stock, soy sauce and fish sauce, and stir-fry the crab until nearly cooked, then add the remaining ingredients. 

Line a serving dish with lettuce and pour the crab over it, garnish with corinader leaves, lime leaves, and slices of cucumber. 

If using crab claws, then steam the crab claws, and combine the remaining ingredients separately, and reduce them to form a dipping sauce. 

This dish is of course served with the usual Thai table condiments, and you may prefer to particularly add a spoonful of prik dong (red chilis in vinegar) to it. 

As always with this type of tropical seafood dish, you can serve it hot, at room temperature, or chilled. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is a mild curried dish, usually served as a counterpoint to a more intense curry or garlic dish.  It can be prepared with crab claws, or with a cup of crab meat, or a mixture of crab meat and shrimp.  Since it is often eaten with chop sticks, you might consider removing the meat from the claws, as this makes it easier for the spice flavors to penetrate and easier to eat the food.

Categories    : Seafood                         Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  cleaned calamari rings
  1                cup  Thai eggplants
                        (or common purple aubergine, quartered)
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  red curry paste
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1              pinch  sugar
  1         tablespoon  julienned Thai chile peppers
  4                     fresh kaffir lime leaves - (to 5)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil leaves

Heat a little oil in a wok and stir-fry the garlic, then add the curry paste, and stir until aromatic.  Add the squid, and stir-fry briefly.  This cooks very quickly and becomes rubbery if overcooked.  You may prefer to lift the wok from the stove to stir in the squid. 

Add the remaining ingredients, and stir until the flavors are combined. 

As soon as the squid is cooked transfer to a serving dish. 

Note, because the squid cooks so quickly, you might prefer to steam the squid and to combine and reduce the other ingredients to form a dipping sauce. 

In either case serve with the usual Thai table condiments, as well as sugar and fresh ground ginger. 

If you are serving it "dip style", then you could also add a mild satay sauce as a contrasting dip.  Those who prefer a hotter dip might also use nam prik narok (literally "the dipping sauce from Hell"). 

Enjoy. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This dish is supposed to be hot.  However as always you can reduce the heat in cooking it. 

Thai eggplants (makheua pro) are a yellowish green fruit the size of a golfball.  If you can't get them, then you could substitute common purple aubergine.

Categories    : Seafood                         Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  fish - (abt 1 lb)
                        === SAUCE INGREDIENTS ===
  8                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped green jalapeÒo peppers
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped red jalapeÒo peppers
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
                        (scallions/spring onions)
     1/4           cup  chopped coriander/cilantro including
                        the roots if possible
     1/3           cup  fish sauce
  3        tablespoons  palm sugar
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     fresh kaffir lime leaves - (to 5) -- shredded
     1/4           cup  chopped sweet basil leaves
  3        tablespoons  cooking oil

The fish is cleaned -- the sides slashed and the fish is either dredged in flour or coated with a light batter -- and then deep fried in fairly hot oil for about five minutes each side.  The fish is then removed to a large plate or serving platter. 

Sauce:  In a medium skillet on medium heat, heat the oil, then add the blended ingredients.  Stir continuously for about 3 minutes.  Add the lime leaves and the basil, and cook for a further 2 minutes. 

Pour the sauce over the fish to serve. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  In Thai "kimao" means drunk.  However unlike the Chinese "drunken" dishes, which are marinated in alcohol, Thai "kimao" dishes not marinated in alcohol but typically consumed with alcohol.  You can use any sort of fish.  You want one weighing about a pound.  Thais leave the head on.

       Drunkard's Noodles And Chicken With Tofu - {Gai Pad Ki Mao}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  Chantaboon rice noodles
     1/4           cup  chopped shrimp
     1/2           cup  chopped chicken
     1/4           cup  firm tofu -- cut small cubes
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallots
                        (small purple or red onions)
  1         tablespoon  yellow bean sauce -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  white rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  4        tablespoons  palm sugar
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  ground red chili
     1/4           cup  bean sprouts
  1         tablespoon  chopped mixed red and green jalapeÒo
  1                     coriander plant -- chopped
  1                cup  basil leaves
  2              bulbs  pickled garlic -- thinly sliced,
                        as a garnish (see below)
  3                     red jalapeÒos - (to 4) -- julienned for garnis
                        === PICKLED GARLIC ===
  4        tablespoons  white rice vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  4        tablespoons  garlic

Combine the pickled garlic ingredients, and leave to stand overnight. 

Soak the noodles in water for about 15 minutes; take about a third of the sen yai and cut the ribbons into short pices (about 2 inches long).  The remaining two thirds of the noodles should be plunged into boiling water, and cooked until "toothy" then removed and placed on the serving plate. 

If desired the tofu can be marinated in some dark soy to which a couple of sliced chilis are added. 

The third of the noodles that have been chopped are fried in hot oil until crispy. 

The remaining ingredients, except the pickled garlic, are stir-fried in a medium-hot wok until cooked through (if you want the sauce thickened add a little rice flour) and then poured over the boiled noodles.  The fried noodles and the pickled garlic are then added as a garnish. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Ki mao dishes in Thailand are widely served as bar snacks in much the same way that Spanish bars serve tapas (and serve to make you thirsty, when used for this purpose).

           Easy Green Curry With Pork - {Gkaeng Kiow Wahn Moo}

Recipe By     :Kasma Loha-unchit
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  coconut milk - (or 14-oz can)
  2        tablespoons  green curry paste - (to 3 tbspns)
  1              pound  pork -- cut against grain of
                        of the muscle into bite-size strips
                        abt 2" by 1" by 1/4"
     1/2         pound  small Thai eggplants (ma-keua bprawh) -- halved or quartered
                        (or substitute with 2 long Asian
                        eggplants, cut into bite-size chunks)
     1/2           cup  small pea eggplants (ma-keua puang)
                        (or substitute with shelled fresh peas)
  2                     kaffir lime leaves (bai ma-gkrood)
                        Fish sauce (nahm bplah) -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  palm sugar -- or to taste
     1/2           cup  fresh Thai sweet basil leaves and flowers -- (bai horapa) to 1 cu
                        Slivered chillies -- to desired hotness

Do not shake the can of coconut milk before opening, so that the cream remains on top.  Spoon about 2/3 cup of this thick cream into a medium-size saucepan and heat over medium to high heat.  Reduce until smooth and bubbly and until oil begins to separate from the cream.  Add the curry paste and fry in the cream for a few minutes to release the aromas.  Then pour in the remaining milk. 

Bring to a boil and add the pork.  Return to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 5 to 10 minutes uncovered before adding the Thai eggplants and pea eggplants.  Simmer a few minutes more, then stir in the peas (if using instead of pea eggplants) and kaffir lime leaves.  Season to taste with fish sauce (may not be needed if the curry paste is already salted).  Add palm sugar to balance and enhance the spice and herb flavors to your liking.  Continue to simmer until eggplants and peas are tender.  Stir in the basil and chillies (as desired for added hotness) and cook another minute.  Serve hot over plain steamed rice. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Notes and Pointers: 

The preferred canned coconut milk for this recipe is Chao Koh, and Mae Anong is a good choice for a prepackaged paste.  It comes in plastic pouches with the picture of a young woman (Mae Anong herself) on the upper right hand corner and is also identified as "Lemon Grass Brand."  Rather than the translated name of "green curry," this brand labels the curry with the Thai name, "Kang Kiew Wan" (a different spelling from mine). 

There are many kinds of small eggplants in Thailand.  Round ones the size of tomatillas, which we call ma-keua bprawh, are very good in this curry.  Deeper green on top and graduating to a lighter bottom, these are seedy eggplants and taste nothing like the large purple aubergines.  Cooked until softened, they soak in the curry flavors and add a thickness to the sauce.  Other smaller members of the eggplant family are ma-keua puang and resemble large green peas, though their taste is entirely different.  They are bitter, but when simmered in the curry sauce they impart an extraordinary roundedness to the sauce.  Much of their bitter bite dissipates when they have completely softened with sufficient cooking.  Both these eggplants are available in Thai and Southeast Asian markets, especially during the warmer months of the year, though the latter is usually harder to find.  Specialty produce markets and gourmet supermarkets have also started to carry them. 

Using this recipe, a red curry can be easily made by substituting a red curry paste and cut-up boneless chicken.  For a fabulous roasted duck curry, buy a roasted duck the next time you visit the Chinatown near your home and use it instead of the pork.  Toward the end of cooking, skim off the fat that has cooked out of the duck and add two small, firm and still slightly green tomatoes, cut in bite-size wedges.

          Garlic Peppered Shrimp - {Gkung Tawd Gratiem Prikthai}

Recipe By     :Kasma Loha-unchit
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small- to medium-size shrimp -- rinsed, drained,
                        shells left on
  1         tablespoon  white peppercorns - (to 2 tbspns) -- coarsely ground
  10             large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  tapioca starch -- or corn starch
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce (n‰m bplah) - (to 2 tbspns)
  4               cups  peanut oil -- for deep-frying
                        Lettuce leaves -- to line serving
                        platter
  2              small  tomatoes -- sliced in rounds

Drain shrimp well after rinsing.  Do not remove shells.  Grind peppercorns in a spice mill or clean coffee grinder, and chop the garlic evenly. 

Heat the oil in a wok.  When it is hot and just before you are ready to fry, toss shrimps quickly with the coarsely ground pepper, chopped garlic, tapioca starch or corn starch and fish sauce.  Use your hand to mix so that by touch you can make sure that all the shrimps are coated with a thin layer of the flour and that the white pepper and garlic are distributed evenly.  The flour will help some of the garlic and pepper to stick to the shrimps during frying. 

Test to make sure the oil is hot enough by dropping a small piece of garlic in it.  It should sizzle and not sink to the bottom for some time before surfacing.  It also should not burn in a matter of seconds -- reduce heat if it does.  Fry half the shrimps at a time.  They should sizzle and turn golden, along with the loose garlic pieces, in a few minutes.  Use a fork or a pair of chopsticks to separate those shrimps that are sticking together because of the stickiness of the flour. 

Fry until garlic is brown and the shrimps crispy (about 3 minutes).  Remove from oil with a slotted spoon or wire spatula (like the kind used in Chinese cooking) and allow to air-drain on a wire-mesh basket or colander balanced over a bowl.  Air-cooling will allow the shrimps to stay crispy longer.  Use a fine wire-mesh spatula to remove loose garlic pieces from the oil and spread them over the shrimps.  Allow oil to reheat, testing again with a piece of garlic to make sure it is hot enough before frying the next batch. 

Cool fried shrimps a minute or two and serve while warm on a platter lined with lettuce and encircled by tomato slices.  Eat shrimps shell and all, including the crispy tails.  Good as an appetizer, or serve with other courses family-style with a hot-and-sour or sweet-and-sour sauce. 

Allow the oil to cool in the wok, then strain and store in an air-tight jar for future use.  Refrigerate to keep fresh if you will not be using it again for some time.  Because the oil picks up a shrimpy, garlicky and peppery flavor, it can be used with good results for stir-frying vegetables and seafood. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Notes and Pointers: 

Do try eating the shrimps whole, shells, tails and all.  In my ten years of teaching, I've had only two students who could not force themselves to do so, and they definitely missed out.  All who have tried crispy whole shrimps love them and make them frequently at home. 

Peanut oil is one of the best oils for deep-frying because it can be heated to high temperatures without breaking down.  The very hot oil quickly sears the outside surfaces and therefore does not penetrate into the food.  After frying the batch of shrimps, you will have almost the same amount of oil left in the wok as when you started out.  The crispy shrimps won't taste greasy as they would if you fried them in other types of oil. 

If you prefer not to have shrimp shells as a natural source of calcium, this recipe can also be made with shelled shrimp.  Fry only about thirty seconds to one minute, so that the shrimps stay juicy and tender.  Without the shells, the shrimps will tend to taste a bit oilier.  If you wish a crispy coating, roll the shrimps in bread crumbs before frying.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Drain shrimp well after rinsing.  Do not remove shells.  Grind peppercorns in a spice mill or clean coffee grinder, and chop the garlic evenly. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Heat the oil in a wok.  When it is hot and just before you are ready to fry, toss shrimps quickly with the coarsely ground pepper, chopped garlic, tapioca starch or corn starch and fish sauce.  Use your hand to mix so that by touch you can make sure that all the shrimps are coated with a thin layer of the flour and that the white pepper and garlic are distributed evenly.  The flour will help some of the garlic and pepper to stick to the shrimps during frying. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Test to make sure the oil is hot enough by dropping a small piece of garlic in it.  It should sizzle and not sink to the bottom for some time before surfacing.  It also should not burn in a matter of seconds -- reduce heat if it does.  Fry half the shrimps at a time.  They should sizzle and turn golden, along with the loose garlic pieces, in a few minutes.  Use a fork or a pair of chopsticks to separate those shrimps that are sticking together because of the stickiness of the flour. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Fry until garlic is brown and the shrimps crispy (about 3 minutes).  Remove from oil with a slotted spoon or wire spatula (like the kind used in Chinese cooking) and allow to air-drain on a wire-mesh basket or colander balanced over a bowl.  Air-cooling will allow the shrimps to stay crispy longer.  Use a fine wire-mesh spatula to remove loose garlic pieces from the oil and spread them over the shrimps.  Allow oil to reheat, testing again with a piece of garlic to make sure it is hot enough before frying the next batch. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Cool fried shrimps a minute or two and serve while warm on a platter lined with lettuce and encircled by tomato slices.  Eat shrimps shell and all, including the crispy tails.  Good as an appetizer, or serve with other courses family-style with a hot-and-sour or sweet-and-sour sauce. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Allow the oil to cool in the wok, then strain and store in an air-tight jar for future use.  Refrigerate to keep fresh if you will not be using it again for some time.  Because the oil picks up a shrimpy, garlicky and peppery flavor, it can be used with good results for stir-frying vegetables and seafood. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields ?? servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Notes and Pointers: 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Do try eating the shrimps whole, shells, tails and all.  In my ten years of teaching, I&apos;ve had only two students who could not force themselves to do so, and they definitely missed out.  All who have tried crispy whole shrimps love them and make them frequently at home. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Peanut oil is one of the best oils for deep-frying because it can be heated to high temperatures without breaking down.  The very hot oil quickly sears the outside surfaces and therefore does not penetrate into the food.  After frying the batch of shrimps, you will have almost the same amount of oil left in the wok as when you started out.  The crispy shrimps won&apos;t taste greasy as they would if you fried them in other types of oil. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;If you prefer not to have shrimp shells as a natural source of calcium, this recipe can also be made with shelled shrimp.  Fry only about thirty seconds to one minute, so that the shrimps stay juicy and tender.  Without the shells, the shrimps will tend to taste a bit oilier.  If you wish a crispy coating, roll the shrimps in bread crumbs before frying.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1                cup  chicken -- cut bite sized
  1                cup  sliced mushroom
  3        tablespoons  grated ginger
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  1              pinch  sugar
  3        tablespoons  chopped onion
  2                     Thai chile peppers - (to 3)
  3        tablespoons  scallion/green onion -- cut into 1" pieces
                        Thai pepper powder- (optionally you
                        may add a cup of jalapeÒo peppers)
                        Scallion bulbs -- for garnish
                        Cilantro/coriander leaves -- for garnish

Mix the fish sauce, soy and oyster sauce ready for use, 

Bring the oil to the smoking point in an adequately large wok, and add the chicken and garlic, and stir-fry until the chicken begins to change color (this is quite quick, so don't overcook). 

Add the sauce and stir until it returns to a bubbling consistency, then add the remaining ingredients, and stir until the chicken is cooked. 

The recipe for pork is identical; beef, if it is used, should be marinated in a mixture of 2 tablespoons of whiskey and the fish sauce, soy sauce and oyster sauce, which should be retained after marination to be added to the cooking. 

Sprinkle Thai pepper powder over the dish and serve over Thai jasmine rice, or in a serving bowl with other Thai dishes. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is a simple, quick meal that could equally be made with pork or beef, or even shrimp, or for the vegetarians, tofu marinated in a mixture of dark soy and fish sauce for flavor. 

It is cooked in a hot wok -- the peanut oil used for cooking should be at the smoking point.  However if this makes you a little nervous it doesn't suffer from being cooked a little cooler.  If you do use a lower temperature, then the garlic should be sauteed in the oil before the chicken is added, to bring out the flavor.  At high temperature this would result in burnt (and very unpalatable) garlic flakes in the food, so you add the garlic with the chicken, not before it. 

Because of the high temperatures you will need to move swiftly from step to step.  Therefore we strongly recommend that you put the ingredients on plates ready to add them -- you won't have time to measure ingredients once things start to move.

           Golden Pumpkin Coconut Soup - {Gaeng Liang Fak Tong}

Recipe By     :Kasma Loha-unchit
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  well-ripened kabocha squash, pumpkin,
                        or other sweet and golden winter squash
                        Juice of half to one lime
     1/3         pound  fresh shrimp
  2                     fresh red jalapeÒo or fresno peppers -- (to 4)
  2                     shallots - (to 3)
  1         tablespoon  shrimp paste
  1                cup  water
  4               cups  or 2 cans coconut milk
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce - (to 3 tbspns) -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar - (to 2 tbspns) -- or as needed
                        to balance flavors
  1                cup  fresh lemon basil, lemon mint, or
                        substitute with fresh Thai sweet basil
                        leave the leaves whole, use flowers also

Cut the kabocha squash in half, remove the seeds and peel.  Then cut the golden orange flesh into 1- to 1 1/2-inch cubes (should yield about 5 to 6 cups).  Sprinkle and coat the pieces with lime juice and set aside.  

Shell the shrimp and cut into small pieces.  Slice the peppers into rounds and chop the shallots into small chunks.  Do not remove the seeds from the peppers unless you do not wish your soup to be spicy.  Blend the shrimp, peppers, shallots and shrimp paste in a food processor or blender.  Add a quarter to half cup of water to help puree the mixture until smooth and until the ingredients are no longer distinguishable. 

Reserve two cups of the creamiest part from the top of the two cans of coconut milk.*  Set aside.  Pour the remaining lighter milk, along with the remaining water into a medium-size soup pot.  Stir in the pureed shrimp-chilli mixture.  Mix well with a wire whisk to blend the paste in with the liquid, smoothing out any lumps. 

Bring the soup mixture slowly to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to as smooth a consistency as possible.  Add the kabocha squash chunks.  Return to a boil and simmer over low heat until the squash is soft and just about to fall apart (15 to 30 minutes, depending on the squash).  Do not be concerned at this point with the appearance of the soup as it will change considerably with the addition of the coconut cream. 

Add the reserved coconut cream and gently bring to a simmer.  Season with fish sauce to the desired saltiness.  The squash should impart a lovely golden color to the soup.  If it is not sufficiently ripe to sweeten the soup, add palm sugar to sweeten and bring forth the nutty taste of the squash.  Simmer a few minutes to allow the flavors to blend.  Stir in the lemon basil, lemon mint or Thai basil leaves and flowers and when they have wilted, turn off heat.  Serve warm, garnishing the top of each bowl with a fresh sprig of the herb. 

*  Adding the coconut cream near the end of cooking ensures a smoother, creamier soup and minimizes the likelihood of the cream curdling.  Coconut cream, particularly from canned coconut milk, will tend to curdle if boiled with water for too long or over too high a heat. 

This recipe yields ?? recipes. 

Notes and Pointers: 

The squash I grew up knowing as "pumpkin" is a much different variety from the bright orange ones that are carved and decorated as jack-o'-lanterns for Halloween.  Smaller, flatter and more disc-shaped, its mottled dark green peel turns to a dull greyish green, tinged with spots of yellow and light orange as it ripens.  Inside, the flesh is a vibrant golden yellow, hence we call it "golden squash."  Relatives to the golden squashes of home are the kabocha and the kalabasa.  Tasty and sweet, both these varieties revive recollections of my favorite flavors from childhood.  Brought to us here by Japanese American farmers, the kabocha (meaning "little pumpkin") is now widely available not only in Asian markets, but in supermarkets and neighborhood grocery stores as well.  It is prized by Southeast Asian immigrants as can be seen by its availability in most of their markets, to the exclusion of other "pumpkins."  Kalabasa, on the other hand, is only beginning to become popular and its availability is still limited. 

Besides desserts and sweet treats, we use golden squashes in different stages of ripeness for a wide variety of dishes, including soups, salads, appetizers, pickles, vegetable courses and curries.  Try the recipe for "Golden Pumpkin Coconut Soup."  It is simple and nutritious, but because it is very rich, in the tropical heat, we usually eat only a few mouthfuls of it along with rice, much as we would eat curry and other dishes at a meal.  With the colder Northern Californian climate, however, the richness of this soup can be fully appreciated, giving warmth and comfort.  Try this soup with some of the hearty sourdough bread for which the Bay Area is known. 

For a delicious pumpkin soup, use a ripe kabocha squash - one with peel that has turned a light greyish green, splashed with splotches of yellow and orange.  But it shouldn't be so old that it has dried out.  Pick one with a good weight for its size.  If the squash is under-ripe (i.e., still deep green in color), use a natural sweetener such as palm or coconut sugar to help bring its nutty flavor through the coconut milk.  A green kabocha squash will ripen when stored in a well ventilated area for several weeks, or even a few months, so I always have one on hand.  It is pretty to look at in the hanging basket in my kitchen.  If you are not able to find kabocha, substitute with a good variety of winter squash that has a sweet and buttery flavor.

               Green Curry With Fish/Shrimp Dumplings - ...

Recipe By     :Kasma Loha-unchit
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3         pound  ground fish paste,
                        or small white fish fillets
     2/3         pound  fresh shrimp -- shelled, chopped fin
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce (nahm bplah) - (to 4 tbspns) -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  tapioca flour - (to 2 tbspns)
  4               cups  coconut milk - (abt 2 14-oz cans)
                        Homemade curry paste -- (see below)
  1         tablespoon  palm or coconut sugar - (to 2 tbspns) -- to taste
  2               long  Asian eggplants -- sliced 1/4" thick at
                        slanted angle
                        (or 12 round Thai eggplants (ma-keua
                        bproh), halved or quartered)
     1/2           cup  pea eggplants (ma-keua puang) -- if available,
                        or use fresh shelled peas
  2                     kaffir lime leaves - (to 3) -- each torn 2 to 3
                        pieces
  1                     green jalapeÒo peppers - (to 2) -- each cut 8 long
                        slivers
  1                     finger gkra-chai root - (to 2) -- thinly sliced
                        into diagonal pieces
  1                cup  Thai sweet basil leaves and flowers -- (bai horapa)
                        === GREEN CURRY PASTE ===
  4                     dark green jalapeÒo or serrano peppers -- chopped
  15                    green Thai chilies - (to 20) -- chopped
                        (prik kee noo)
  10                    white peppercorns -- finely ground
  1         tablespoon  coriander seeds -- lightly toasted
                        until aromatic, then ground
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin seeds -- ground
  1           teaspoon  course sea salt
  2        tablespoons  chopped lemon grass -- (use bottom end
                        of 1 stalk sliced thinly into rounds
                        before chopping)
  1           teaspoon  chopped Thai galanga
  1           teaspoon  grated zest of fresh kaffir lime
                        (or substitute with finely-chopped
                        reconstituted dried kaffir lime peel)
  2           teaspoon  finely-chopped cilantro roots
                        (or substitute with 1 tbspn chopped stems)
  3                     shallots -- chopped
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  gkapi shrimp paste

Prepare the paste ingredients.  If using dried kaffir lime peel, soak first to soften.  For galanga, use the fuller-flavored, reddish brown root imported from Thailand.  Grind the dry spices finely in a dry stone mortar or spice grinder.  Set aside.  Pound the herbs a little at a time, starting with the hardier ones, until each is reduced to a paste.  Combine the pounded herbs and ground dry spices and pound together with the gkapi shrimp paste to form a fine, well-blended paste.  Set aside. 

If ground fish paste is not available in Asian fish markets in your area, use small, white-flesh fish fillets and chop as finely as possible with a cleaver or in a food processor or blender.  Then pound the fish with a heavy stone mortar and pestle until it is completely reduced to paste and no longer distinguishable as fish.  Do likewise with the shrimp.  Keeping them separate, sprinkle some ground white pepper, a little fish sauce and about one tablespoon tapioca flour to each.  (You do not need to add these ingredients to ground fish paste bought from the fish market.)  Knead into the ground fish until sticky, then the shrimp.  Set aside. 

In a large pot, heat about a cup of the thick coconut cream from the top of a can of coconut milk (or the rich milk from the first pressing of coconut pulp) over medium to high heat.  Reduce until oil begins to separate or the cream looks thick and bubbly.  Add the curry paste and fry in the cream for a few minutes until aromatic.  Pour in the remaining coconut milk and bring to a boil.  Season to taste with fish sauce and balance with palm sugar.  If using pea-eggplants, add them next and simmer about 10 minutes over low heat, uncovered, before adding the other eggplants and kaffir lime leaves.  If substituting with peas, add them together with the sliced eggplants.  Bring sauce back up to a boil and simmer a few minutes or until the eggplants begin to soften. 

Using two teaspoons, drop the fish and shrimp paste mixtures in small, bite-size chunks into the curry sauce.  Return to a boil and add the slivered jalapeÒo peppers and gkra-chai pieces.  Continue to cook until eggplants are tender and the dumplings cooked through (they float when cooked).  Stir in the basil until it wilts.  Remove from heat and serve hot with lots of plain steamed rice. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Notes and Pointers: 

There are many kinds of small eggplants in Thailand.  Round ones the size of tomatillas, which we call ma-keua bprawh, are very good in this curry.  Deeper green on top and graduating to a lighter bottom, these are seedy eggplants and taste nothing like the large purple aubergines.  Cooked until softened, they soak in the curry flavors and add a thickness to the sauce.  Other smaller members of the eggplant family are ma-keua puang and resemble large green peas, though their taste is entirely different.  They are bitter, but when simmered in the curry sauce they impart an extraordinary roundedness to the sauce.  Much of their bitter bite dissipates when they have completely softened with sufficient cooking.  Both these eggplants are available in Thai and Southeast Asian markets, especially during the warmer months of the year, though the latter is usually harder to find.  Specialty produce markets and gourmet supermarkets have also started to carry them. 

There is a variety of long eggplants in Thailand that is green in color rather than purple like the ones you find in Chinese and Japanese markets.  They are sweet and very flavorful and are excellent in greet curry.  From time to time, I have seen them sold at farmer's markets.  If you can find them, try them in this recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     Thai bird chiles - (to 12) -- each cut into 3
                        to 4 segments
  8                     garlic cloves -- peeled, and each
                        cut into 2 to 3 pieces
  2        tablespoons  small dried shrimp
  4               cups  julienned peeled unripe papaya in 2"
                        to 3" long and 1/8" thick strips
  1                cup  cut long beans in 1 1/2"-long segments
  1                     julienned carrot
     1/4           cup  tamarind juice the thickness of fruit
                        concentrate
                        Juice of 2 to 3 limes -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce - (to 3 tbspns) -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  palm sugar - (to 3 tbspns) -- melted with
  1         tablespoon  water -- into a thick syrup,
                        use as needed
  2              small  tomatoes -- cut bite-size wedges

Prepare the ingredients as indicated.  Make tamarind juice by starting with 1 tablespoon of compressed tamarind in 1/3 cup of warm water.  Work the tamarind with your fingers to dissolve the soft fruit; gather up remaining undissolvable pulp, squeeze to extract juice and discard.  Add more tamarind or water as necessary to make 1/4 cup of concentrate. 

Divide the ingredients into two batches and make each batch as follows:  Using a large clay mortar with a wooden pestle, pound the garlic and chiles to a paste.  Add the dried shrimp and long beans and pound to bruise.  Follow with the green papaya and carrot.  Stir well with a spoon and pound to bruise the vegetables so that they absorb the heat and flavor of the chiles and garlic. 

Add the tamarind and lime juice, fish sauce and palm sugar.  Stir and pound a bit more to blend the vegetables with the flavorings and seasonings.  Taste and adjust flavors to the desired hot-sour-sweet-and-salty combination.  Then add the tomato pieces, stir and bruise lightly to blend in with the rest of the salad.  Transfer to a serving plate and sprinkle with peanuts. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 

Notes and Pointers: 

Green papaya has a very mild, almost bland, taste, but it is the medium through which robust flavor ingredients take body and form.  It picks up the hot, sour, sweet and salty flavors, giving them a unique crisp and chewy texture unlike that of any other vegetable.  When made into salad, you wouldn't know that it was mild and timid; you remember it only as bold and spicy. 

Unripe papayas are readily available in various sizes and shapes during the summer at many Asian markets.  Select one that is very firm with shiny green peel suggesting that it is as freshly picked as possible.  Even green fruits will eventually ripen and turn soft if allowed to sit around for some time. 

There are many ways to make green papaya salads, with varying degrees of hotness, sourness and sweetness.  The hottest salads are probably made in northeastern Thailand and Laos where they are eaten with barbecued chicken and sticky rice as a staple food of the populace.  There, the salads are made by bruising julienned green papaya with garlic and very hot bird peppers in a large clay mortar with a wooden pestle, then seasoning with lime juice, fish sauce and other flavorings.

                  Grilled Coconut Cake - {Kanom Bah Bin}

Recipe By     :Kasma Loha-unchit
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  glutinous rice flour
     1/2           cup  rice flour
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              large  egg
  2               cups  finely-shredded fresh coconut
  1                cup  limestone water -- scented with
     1/4      teaspoon  bai dteuy (pandanus leaf) essence
                        (or substitute with 1 tspn vanilla)
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil - (to 3 tbspns)

Mix the two kinds of rice flour, sugar and salt together and knead with the egg and shredded coconut.  Slowly add the limestone water, which has been scented with bai dteuy essence or vanilla, and continue to knead until the mixture is wet and the cream from the coconut meat is pressed out and blended in with all the other ingredients. 

Grease the heated surface of a griddle with the peanut oil.  Drop the coconut mixture in spoonfuls onto the hot griddle, molding them into small, flat rounds.  Grill over low to medium heat until golden brown.  Flip over and grill the other side until also browned.  Best when served warm. 

The coconut mixture can also be baked in a well-greased pan in the oven, at about 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the cake.  Brush a beaten egg yolk over the top after the cake is cooked through and bake another five minutes at 400 degrees.  Cut into small squares. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Notes and Pointers: 

I prefer the cakes grilled in flat pancakes.  They brown and pick up a light crispiness which is lacking when baked.  The baked cake will tend to be more gooey in texture. 

For a different twist, use 1/2 cup granulated sugar, and 1/2 cup palm sugar. 

For information about bai dteuy or pandanus leaf essence, see pp 96 to 97 of "It Rains Fishes."  Instead of bai dteuy flavoring, the coconut mixture can also be "smoked" with a special incense candle (tien ohb) made of organic matter including herbs and flower petals.  Such a candle is commonly used in the making of sweetmeats and desserts to add a spicy fragrance and smokiness.  Brown in color, it has a curved shape and can be lit on both ends.  This exotic item may not be easy to find in Western countries; ask for it in specialty Thai markets in cities with sizable Thai populations.  If you travel to Thailand, look in stores that carry incense and merit-making supplies.  There are several different kinds from which to choose.  Sniff and discover which fragrance you like.  One candle will last a long time; it will burn very slowly and produce a lot of scented smoke. 

To smoke with an incense candle, put the uncooked coconut mixture loosely in a bowl and place the bowl inside a large pot.  Light the candle on both ends and position alongside the bowl.  Close the lid tightly, adding extra weight over the top if necessary -- such as an inverted stone mortar -- to prevent smoke from escaping.  Allow to smoke 30 minutes to one hour.  For a stronger smoky flavor, relight the candle after 30 minutes to produce more smoke.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  prawns or medium- to large-size shrimps -- shells removed
                        and butterflied (save shells for stock)
  2                     fresh lemon grass stalks - (to 3)
  1              quart  water or mild soup stock -- salted with
                        Fish sauce (nahm bplah) -- to taste
  6        thin slices  fresh galanga (kah) -- or 2 dried pieces
  3                     kaffir lime leaves (bai ma-gkrood) -- fresh or dried
  8              whole  Thai chillies (prik kee noo) - (to 10) -- stems removed,
                        bruised with the back of a cleaver,
                        and sliced crosswise 1/4" thick
                        (or substitute with 2 to 3 sliced jalapeÒo
  1         tablespoon  to 2 roasted chilli paste (nahm prik pow)
  3        tablespoons  to 4 tamarind water - (a chunk of wet
                        tamarind about the size of 1 tablespoon
                        with the soft parts dissolved in 1/4 cup
                        water, pulp removed)
  1                cup  fresh brown mushrooms -- sliced 1/4" pieces
                        (or substitute with 1 can whole straw
                        mushrooms, drained)
  1              small  tomato -- cut bite-size
                        wedges, (optional)
  2                     green onions -- cut in thin rounds
                        Juice of 1 to 2 limes -- to desired sourness
     1/2           cup  cilantro leaves or short cilantro sprigs

Cut the bottom tip off the lemon grass stalks and discard the loose outer layer(s).  Then cut each stalk into 1-inch sections at a slanted diagonal all the way up to the greener end, near the start of the grass blades, exposing the inner core.  Smash each piece with the side of a cleaver or the end of a large knife handle to bruise, releasing the aromatic oils.  Place the cut lemon grass along with the prawn or shrimp shells and the water or stock in a soup pot.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer with a lid on for 15 to 20 minutes to draw out the flavors.  Strain out the shrimp shells and some of the lemon grass.  

Add the sliced galanga, kaffir lime leaves, bruised Thai chillies (or substitute) and sliced onion.  Simmer a couple of minutes, then add the roasted chilli paste (nahmm prik pow), tamarind water and fresh brown or straw mushrooms.  Heat stock to a boil and simmer for a couple of minutes.  Stir in the tomato wedges (if using), green onions and prawns or shrimps.  After 20 to 30 seconds, turn off heat, add lime juice to the desired sourness and the cilantro.  Do not let the prawns or shrimps overcook.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Notes and Pointers: 

Dtom yum is a light soup with practically no oil, and it contains the four main flavors -- hot, sour, sweet and salty -- accentuated with fresh aromatic herbs.  It is the most popular soup in Thailand and can be found in the tiniest mom-and-pop village rice shop to the fanciest restaurant in Bangkok.  No menu is without it, even in Thai restaurants overseas, and if there is no menu, as is the case in Thailand's rural areas, just speaking the magic words"dtom yum" is enough to procure a steaming bowl of the fragrant and stimulating soup. 

Dtom yum can be made with just about any type of seafood or meat, or vegetables for vegetarians.  You can have a dtom yum gai (gai = chicken), dtom yum bplah (fish), dtom yum talay (mixed seafood), dtom yum hed (mushrooms), and so on.  There are numerous ways of blending flavors, as you will notice from eating Dtom yum in various restaurants here or in Thailand.  Flavors vary from place to place, from chef to chef and from pot to pot.  But basically, dtom yum is hot and sour -- hot from some kind of chilli pepper and sour primarily from lime juice -- and has lemon grass as the leading herb flavor. 

Most Dtom yum in Thailand is made, of course, with Thai people's favorite chillies, prik kee noo, known now in the western world as "Thai chillies."  In this recipe, the chillies are kept whole, so you and your guests can spot them easily and not bite into one unless you choose to.  Simmering the chillies in the broth will flavor the soup with its special spicy flavor.  If you can find red ones, they make the soup prettier and are even easier to spot, but if you want to insure a zero chance of a fiery accident, you may wish to simmer the chillies in the soup stock a few minutes and then strain them out entirely.  Remember, the longer you cook chillies, the more their heat will cook out into the surrounding broth. 

Alternatively, for a stronger roasted flavor, you may wish to use dried red chillie peppers.  Roast them on a dry pan directly over a burner until the pods are dark red, turning frequently so they do not burn.  Cut each roasted pepper into two or three segments and add to the soup.  Keep in mind, however, that the nahm prik pow in the recipe already provides some roasted flavor.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Notes and Pointers: 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Dtom yum is a light soup with practically no oil, and it contains the four main flavors -- hot, sour, sweet and salty -- accentuated with fresh aromatic herbs.  It is the most popular soup in Thailand and can be found in the tiniest mom-and-pop village rice shop to the fanciest restaurant in Bangkok.  No menu is without it, even in Thai restaurants overseas, and if there is no menu, as is the case in Thailand&apos;s rural areas, just speaking the magic words&quot;dtom yum&quot; is enough to procure a steaming bowl of the fragrant and stimulating soup.

         Hot-And-Sour Dry Rice Noodles - {Sen Lek Dom Yum Haeng}

Recipe By     :Kasma Loha-unchit
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  ground dried red chiles
  6                     fresh Thai chiles (prik kee noo) -- chopped (6 to 10)
                        Juice of 2 fresh limes
  1         tablespoon  vinegar
  2        tablespoons  roasted chilli paste (nahm prik pow)
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce (nahm bplah) - (to 3 tbspns) -- to taste
     1/2           cup  ground pork
     1/2         pound  fresh thin rice noodles (gkuay dtiow
                        sen lek)
  3               cups  bite-size lettuce leaf pieces
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced boiled pork,
                        or barbecued pork
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced cooked pork liver
     1/2           cup  chopped unsalted roasted peanuts
  1                     green onion, white and green parts -- cut thin rounds
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro

Mix the two kinds of chiles, lime juice, vinegar, roasted chilli paste and fish sauce together.  Set aside. 

Spread the ground pork loosely over a wire-mesh strainer with handle and dip in hot boiling water until cooked through, stirring to break into bits.  Drain and set aside. 

Cook the noodles quickly by blanching in hot water for a few seconds.  Drain and toss with the hot-and-sour sauce.  Dish into individual serving bowls lined on the bottom with lettuce pieces.  Arrange the sliced pork, pork liver slices and ground pork over the top of each serving.  Sprinkle with chopped peanuts and garnish with green onions and cilantro. 

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings as a breakfast food or for lunch. 

Notes and Pointers: 

This "dry" noodle dish can easily be converted into soup noodles by adding a broth made by simmering pork bones with some crushed garlic, cilantro roots and ground white pepper, and lightly salted with light soy sauce, sea salt or fish sauce.  For added flavor and sweetness, cook the pork meat, liver and ground pork in this broth.  Adjustment in the amount of fish sauce, lime juice, vinegar and nahm prik pow in the chili sauce may be needed as the broth will likely dilute the intensity of the sauce. 

If you are not able to find fresh, thin rice noodles, substitute with a 1/4 pound of dried rice noodles.  Soak first to soften, then cook in boiling water to the firmness you like.  This may take a few minutes. 

This recipe makes a very spicy batch of noodles.  For milder palates, simply cut back on the amount of both dried and fresh chiles, or strain out the chiles and use only the liquid part of the sauce. 

For a change, use chicken, shrimp or a combination of seafoods in the place of pork.

          Isan Style Sausages (Thai Hamburgers) - {Sai Grog Tod}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork                            Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUSAGES - {SAI GROG} ===
  1              pound  minced pork
     1/4           cup  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  steamed sticky rice
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  MSG -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
                        === SAUSAGE MEAL - {SAI GROG TOD} ===
                        Sausages -- (see above)
     1/4           cup  roasted peanuts
     1/4           cup  very thinly-sliced ginger
     1/4           cup  very thinly-sliced shallots
     1/4           cup  bruised/ very thinly-sliced lemon grass
     1/4           cup  julienned Thai chile peppers

For the Sausages:  Combine the ingredients and place in a covered dish in a cool place overnight. 

Stuff your sausage casings, or form patties or meat balls from the mixture.  Steam for 30 minutes. 

For the Sausage Meal:  Place the sausages on a grating over a charcoal brazier and cover with an upturned wok or other metal cover to trap smoke, and cook, turning occasionally, for 5 to 6 minutes (until cooked to a golden brown).  If you have formed sausages, they should be sliced on the diagonal into quarter-inch thick slices. 

Arrange on a platter with the accompaniments.  Try serving with Sriracha Thai chili sauce and/or satay sauce. 

If you've made patties of the sausage meat, then serve as "Thai hamburgers" and add your favorite relish. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is the local isan (Northeaster Thailand) variety of sausage.  If you have sausage casing you can of course make this in conventional sausage form, however as this is a messy job you can also do as we do and form the sausage meat into patties the size of small hamburgers and eat them that way. 

Thai sausages use rice as the filler/binder to extend the meat.

                    Lao Style Beef Salad - {Pra Nuea}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  ground beef
                        lime juice -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  2        tablespoons  ground dried red chilis - (to 3 tbspns)
  1           teaspoon  Thai pepper powder - (to 2 tspns)
     1/2           cup  shallots -- very thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  lemon grass -- bruised and sliced
                        paper thin
  4                     fresh kaffir lime leaves - (to 5) -- shredded
  1         tablespoon  Khao Koor -- see * Note
                        Chopped spring onions -- for garnish
                        Coriander/cilantro leaves -- for garnish
                        Lettuce leaf -- for serving plate
                        A selection of sliced vegetable crudites -- for accompaniment

* Note:  For Khao Koor, get a medium-sized wok fairly hot, and add a couple of tablespoons of uncooked rice.  Keep in movement until the rice starts to turn golden brown.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool.  Grind to a fairly coarse powder in a spice mill, or a mortar and pestle, or a pepper mill or a good clean coffee grinder (all of these work well but keep in mind that a coffee grinder tends to grind too fine -- the powder should retain some "texture"). 

Place the ground meat in a mixing bowl, and thoroughly mix with fresh lime juice, and leave to marinade for an hour.  Take the marinaded meat and knead it, much as you would if making pizza dough, squeezing thoroughly to drive out as much blood and other juice as possible, either in a muslin bag or a very fine seive such as a chinois.  Drain thoroughly, and return to the mixing bowl, marinade again in fresh lime juice. 

Repeat this process 3 or 4 times, then set aside, covered in a cool place to marinade a final time (it is not kneaded after the final marination -- to underline the point it should be kneaded and drained 3 or 4 times, then marinated once more). 

At this stage you may, if you wish, stir-fry the meat very briefly (it should still be very rare). 

Finally combine the meat with the other ingredients; it should be hot and spicy, but not inedibly so, so add the chili powder in stages, tasting as you go. 

Allow to stand for an hour before serving.  To serve turn it onto a lettuce leaf on a serving platter. 

This dish goes best with sticky rice, which can be used as an eating utensil; form a ball of rice and use it to pick up a little of the spiced meat.  The rice and vegetable crudites will ameliorate the heat.  Serve with the usual Thai table condiments. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This dish is similar to the common laab dishes, except that the meat is not cooked (or only very lightly cooked).  It originated in Laos (hence the alternative name of laab lao), and is the common form found in rural parts of the Isan (North East Thailand).  It could also be made with pork or chicken, and we have succesfully made it with [jumbo] shrimp, crayfish, crab and lobster.

  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  2        tablespoons  chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground dried red Thai chilis -- (1 to 2)

  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced garlic
  2        tablespoons  sliced lemon grass
  2        tablespoons  diced spanish onion
  1         tablespoon  spring onion (scallion/green onion) -- thinly sliced

Comments:  This dish has a nice poetic name, as the three words of the name rhyme.  Those who don't like chili can always leave it out.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  beef -- cut bite size
  2               cups  coconut milk
                        === CURRY PASTE ===
  3        tablespoons  very thinly-sliced lemon grass
  3        tablespoons  palm sugar
  1         tablespoon  thick soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  dried red Thai chile peppers -- crumbled
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced shallots
  1         tablespoon  grated ginger
  1         tablespoon  shrimp paste
  1         tablespoon  coriander seed
  1         tablespoon  cumin seed
  1              pinch  turmeric powder
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
     1/4           cup  tamarind sauce

Simmer the beef in the coconut milk for 30 minutes in a covered saucepan. 

Toast the coriander and cumin seeds until fragrant, and grate.  Combine all the curry paste ingredients and process to a fine paste. 

After the beef is cooked until tender, add the curry paste, stir to combine, and continue to simmer, covered for 10 minutes. 

Since the beef is simmered it is possible to use cheaper (tougher) cuts of meat.  If necesary extend the cooking process until the meat is tender. 

Serve with Thai Jasmine rice, and the usual Thai table condiments. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is a curry in the northern style.  It could also be made with pork or chicken, in which case the cooking time must be shortened.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Serve with Thai Jasmine rice, and the usual Thai table condiments. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields ?? servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  This is a curry in the northern style.  It could also be made with pork or chicken, in which case the cooking time must be shortened.

                    Northern Thai Sausage - {Sai Oua}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork                            Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground pork
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  chopped coriander/cilantro leaves
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  very finely-chopped lemon grass
  1           teaspoon  galangal powder
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallot
  1         tablespoon  shrimp paste
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped Thai chile peppers

Make sure the lemon grass is very finely chopped (put it through a food processor or grind in a mortar and pestle).  Combine all the ingredients and stuff a sausage casing and form 4-inch sausages, or form into patties or meatballs.  Fry or broil until cooked to your taste. 

Traditionally this is served with sticky rice.  These sausages are also sold spiked on wooden skewers as popular "hawker food" throughout Thailand. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This sausage comes from the Chiang Mai region of northern Thailand.  It can be formed into sausages about 4 inches long, or into hamburger style patties or meatballs (delicious in guaitiao (noodle soup).

                   Penang Chicken Curry - {Penang Gai}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  chicken -- cut bite size
     1/2           cup  coconut milk
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  Penang curry paste - (to 3 tbspns)
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
                        Sugar -- to taste
  3                     fresh kaffir lime leaves -- shredded
  10                    basil leaves - (to 15) -- finely shredded

Place a wok over medium-high heat, and warm the coconut milk, but don't let it boil.  Add the curry paste, and stir it until the oil begins to separate out and form a thin film, to bring out the maximum flavor. 

Add the remaining ingredients except the lime leaves and basil leaves, and simmer until the sauce is absorbed and thickened.  Add the lime leaves and basil leaves and stir-fry briefly before serving. 

Garnish with julienned red chili, with Thai jasmine rice, and the usual Thai table condiments. 

Note, if you particularly like your curries hot, then replace the fish sauce in the cooking with nam pla prik (chillies marinated in fish sauce), that has had at least a week to mature. 

Nam pla prik:  Put two thirds of a cup of Thai chile peppers or jalapeÒo peppers in a 1 pint jar, and fill with fish sauce.  Seal and keep for a week before using. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Penang is a dry curry, probably originally "imported" from Malaysia.  It can be prepared with any meat, and many fishes.  This variety uses chicken.

                      Pork With Galangal - {Kha Mu}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork                            Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  pork hocks
  4                     tablepoons chopped garlic - (to 5 tbspns)
  4        tablespoons  fresh galangal - (to 5 tbspns) -- julienned
  4        tablespoons  chopped coriander/cilantro -- (to 5 tbspns)
                        (use both leaves and stems)
                        Sweet soy sauce -- (see directions)
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar - (to 2 tbspns)
                        Light soy sauce -- to taste
  2             pieces  star anise - (to 3)

Cut the hocks into chunks the size of a small fist.  Grill or barbeque or braise them to seal the meat and crisp the outsides. 

Finely chop the garlic, and other ingredients (except the star anise and soy sauces) in a mortar and pestle or food processor, so they are easily integrated into the gravy. 

Put the other ingredients in a large pot, add the pork, then add enough pork stock to cover the meat, and then add enough dark soy to produce a rich coloration.  Bring to a boil, and boil for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to a light simmer, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. 

Taste and add sugar or light soy to adjust the flavor.  Continue to simmer until the meat is tender enough to fall apart when probed with a chop stick (about 45 minutes).  Add additional stock if the pot begins to dry out, but allow the sauce to reduce to a thickish gravy.  Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. 

Transfer to a large serving dish and serve with Thai jasmine rice (warn the unwary not to eat the star anise!). 

Note, the pot should be large enough that when the ingredients and stock are assembled at the start of boiling the pot is about half full to prevent it boiling over. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is a popular "snack", but it can form a course in Thai style dinner.  It could be made from any fairly fatty cut of pork, but is normally made from the hocks and shanks of pork.

Cut the kabocha in half, scoop out the seeds and pith.  Placing the cut ends flat on a surface for balance, peel and discard the greenish skin.  Then cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch chunks.  

Do not shake the cans of coconut milk before opening.  Spoon 2/3 cup of the thickest cream off the top of a can into a large pot placed over medium-high heat.  Reduce cream until thick and bubbly (about 3 minutes), then add the curry paste.  Stir and mush the paste into the coconut cream and fry for a few minutes until it is very aromatic and darkened in color.  Then pour in the remaining milk from both cans, stirring well to dissolve the paste to make a smooth rich sauce. 

Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of palm or coconut sugar, stirring well to blend into the curry sauce.  Taste and add fish sauce only as necessary to salt to the desired saltiness (may not be necessary with some brands of curry paste which are already highly salted). 

Add the kabocha chunks and duck pieces.  Stir well into the sauce.  If there is not enough curry sauce to cover most of the duck and squash pieces, add more coconut milk; or if the sauce already looks plenty rich, add 1/2 cup of water instead, as the squash and duck will thicken and enrich the sauce even more when they are cooked. 

Return to a boil, then lower heat to medium, or just enough to boil the sauce gently.  Cook partially covered, stirring occasionally, until the squash is tender, or cooked to your liking (15 to 20 minutes or more).  Taste the sauce and adjust as needed with fish sauce and palm sugar to the desired salty-sweet combination.  If more hotness is desired, stir in the slivered chillies. 

If a lot of fat has cooked out from the duck, skim out the oil floating on top of the curry sauce.  Then stir in the basil until it wilts to a bright green color.  Turn off heat and spoon curry into a serving dish.  Garnish top with basil sprig(s). 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  sour curry paste - (to 3 tbspns)
  1              pound  fish -- diced
  2             pounds  vegetables (your choice)

Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless chicken thighs -- coarsely chopped,
                        or cut into small bite-size pieces
  4                     garlic cloves - (to 6) -- finely chopped
  2                     shallots - (to 3) -- thinly sliced
                        (or substitute with 1/2 cup sliced onion)
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil - (to 3 tbspns) -- for stir-frying
  2          teaspoons  black soy sauce (the semi-sweet kind)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fish sauce (nam bplah) -- or to taste
  1                cup  fresh Thai holy basil (bai gka-prow)
                        (or substitute with 1/4 cup dried holy
                        basil/ soaked to soften plus 1/2 to 1 cup
                        fresh Thai sweet basil (bai horapa))
  2              small  kaffir lime leaves (bai ma-gkrood) -- very finely
                        slivered, (optional)
  2                     fresh jalapeÒo or fresno peppers - (to 3) -- cut large slivers
                        (or 5 to 10 Thai chillies (prik kee noo),
                        chopped, pounded with a mortar and pestle)
  1               dash  freshly-ground white pepper

Prepare the ingredients as indicated.  Leave the fresh basil leaves whole; the flowers may also be used.  The dried holy basil will soften when soaked in tap water for 10 to 15 minutes.  Pull off and discard the hard stems.  Drain. 

Heat a wok until the surface is smoking hot.  Swirl in the oil to coat the wok surface.  Wait a few seconds for the oil to heat, then stir in the garlic, followed a few seconds later with shallots.  Stir another few seconds before adding the chicken.  Stir-fry a minute or two, or until most of the chicken has started to change color on the outside and is no longer pink.  Toss in the chillies, slivered kaffir lime leaves and reconstituted dried holy basil (if using).  Sprinkle black soy sauce over the mixture and stir-fry another 15 to 20 seconds.  Then add fresh basil leaves and fish sauce to taste.  Stir and mix well.  Stir-fry another half a minute, or until the basil is wilted and the chicken is cooked through.  Sprinkle with white pepper.  Stir and transfer to a serving dish, or spoon directly over individual plates of plain steamed rice. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Notes and Pointers: 

This is a good and easy stir-fried dish and one of the favorites among Thai people.  It is served over rice as a one-dish meal -- for breakfast or for lunch, often topped with a crispy fried egg.  Of course, it also appears frequently as one of the courses in a shared family-style meal. 

If you are not able to find fresh holy basil, this recipe can be substituted with any fresh basil.  I have also tried it with a mixture of fresh Thai sweet basil (bai horapa) and fresh mint leaves with good results. 

The smaller the chicken is cut, the greater the surface area to coat with the flavors of the aromatic herbs and sauces, and the more flavorful the stir-fry will be.  Some of my students have reported good results using ground turkey.  In Thailand, this dish is often made with chopped pork, or bird meat, especially in fast-food, curry-rice shops (rahn kao gkaeng), where an enormous variety of dishes are prepared ahead of time and served over steaming white rice to order.  When I travel in the rural areas, I often stop at such rice shops in small towns for lunch.  Some of the best pad gka-prow can be had at these inconspicuous, no-frills, open-air places.  They are made particularly spicy to help preserve the meat, as the dishes are prepared early in the morning and served throughout the day until they are sold out. 

Try the above recipe also with fresh seafood (in this case, no need to chop) -- shrimps, scallops, mussels, clams, crab and firm-flesh fish, such as fresh halibut and salmon.

Slice the chilli peppers into half circles or short slivers; do not remove the seeds if you wish a spicier fried rice (skip if you don't want your fried rice to be spicy). 

Crumble and break up the cold leftover rice so that the grains are no longer stuck together in big chunks.  (If you do not have leftover rice, cook rice earlier in the day and cool completely before frying.  Freshly cooked rice makes mushy fried rice if used when it is still warm.)  Set aside. 

Heat a wok over high heat until hot.  Swirl in the oil to coat its surface and wait a few seconds for the oil to heat.  Add the chopped garlic, followed a few seconds later with the chicken.  Stir-fry half a minute, or until the chicken begins to lose its raw pink color.  Toss in the sliced shallots and chiles.  Stir and follow 15 seconds later with the broccoli stems.  Stir-fry another 20 seconds before adding the leaves.  Toss until leaves are partially wilted, then add the rice and toss well with all the ingredients in the wok. 

Continue to stir-fry until the rice is well coated with the oil and has softened and begun to brown.  Sprinkle evenly with some black soy sauce, enough to lightly color the grains.  Stir some more, then sprinkle with fish sauce to the desired saltiness.  Stir-fry until the broccoli is cooked to your liking, preferably still crisp and a vibrant green color.  Toss in the basil and stir quickly for a few seconds to wilt and mix in with the rice.  Sprinkle with white pepper.  Stir well and transfer to serving plate(s). 

Serve with a wedge of fresh lime for each serving.  Squeeze the juice over the rice, as desired, before eating. 

This recipe yields 2 to 3 servings as a one-dish meal. 

Notes and Pointers: 

Use this recipe as a starting point for you to experiment.  The important thing though is to become familiar with all the Thai ingredients and sauces so that you can use them to duplicate the flavors you remember tasting in Thailand.  Branch out from here by using pork or seafood instead of chicken, and substitute other kinds of firm, crisp vegetable you prefer.  Add tomato wedges if you like. 

Remember that Thai cooking is an art and not a science, and just as Thai people are easy going in their mannerisms, so are they in their cooking.  They do not stick to recipes, they like variety, and most important of all, what they make depends on what looks fresh at the market and what they have on hand.  Most of the best fried rice are made from leftover rice and ingredients from the day before thrown together with seasonings in the wok. 

There is no such thing as a single recipe for fried rice.  In fact, an entire volume can be written about the many types of fried rice just in Thailand, and I have actually seen such a cookbook (written in the Thai language) that contains only recipes for fried rice!  Fried Rice in Thailand depends on the rice shop or restaurant where you ate it at and what kind they made for you -- as one can order many types of fried rice from the same place by specifying what kind you would like at a particular moment, such as chicken fried rice, vegetarian fried rice, basil fried rice, seafood fried rice, etc, each with varying ingredients that make it unique tasting from the others.

         Spicy Mesquite-Grilled Eggplant Salad - {Yum Makeua Yao}

Recipe By     :Kasma Loha-unchit
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Thai
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Mesquite charcoal and a small handful of
                        mesquite wood chips
  4               long  Asian eggplants
  4                     jalapeÒo or fresno peppers
  10                    Thai chiles (bird peppers) - (to 15) -- finely chopped
                        Juice of about 2 limes -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce - (to 3 tbspns) -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  sugar - (to 3 tspns) -- to taste
  2                     shallots -- thinly sliced
     1/4         pound  small fresh shrimp -- shelled, butterflied
  1                     hard-boiled egg -- cut 6 to 8 wedges
                        A small handful of short cilantro sprigs

Start a batch of mesquite charcoal in a barbecue kettle and soak the wood chips.  While waiting for the coals, trim the tops off the eggplants and the peppers.  Make a hot-and-sour sauce by mixing together the chopped Thai chiles, lime juice, fish sauce and sugar.  Let sit for the flavors to blend and mingle. 

Prepare the remaining ingredients.  Blanch shrimp in boiling water for 30 seconds to cook.  Drain well and set aside. 

Grill the eggplants and peppers whole over the hot mesquite, turning occasionally until they are slightly charred on the outside and have softened.  For a stronger smoked flavor, add damp wood chips to the red coals and cover the barbecue kettle after each turning. 

Place the grilled eggplants and peppers in a paper sack for a few minutes to steam.  When cool enough to handle, peel off the charred skin and thin outer membrane.  Cut each eggplant crosswise into segments about 1 1/2 inches long, each segment in half lengthwise, and each half in 2 to 3 strips, depending on the size of the eggplant.  Arrange on a serving platter and spread the sliced shallots over the top. 

Cut the skinned peppers into long, thin strips.  Do not remove the seeds if you want an extra spicy salad.  Arrange in an attractive design over the eggplants and shallots and top with the cooked shrimp. 

Taste and adjust the spicy lime sauce so that it is equally sour and salty with a hint of sweetness.  Spoon evenly over the salad.  Garnish with egg wedges and cilantro.  Serve at room temperature. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 

Comments:  Grilling Over Mesquite Adds a Rich Smoked Flavor to Spicy Eggplant Salad. 

The hot tropical climate of Thailand lends itself to outdoor cooking.  In fact, the kitchens of most traditional homes are in open shacks behind the main house.  In the countryside, farmers still live in airy wooden houses on stilts, their kitchens in the open area beneath, or on the verandah.  Besides making cooking more bearable in the heat of day, the openness of the kitchens and their separation from the main living quarters keep the fumes from charcoal stoves from smoking up the house. 

Charcoal was the primary source of cooking fuel while I was growing up in Thailand.  I remember the heaving call of the "charcoal man" as he pushed his heavy cart of black logs through our neighborhood each week.  Mother would buy her load for the week, keeping the charcoal in a wooden bin in our kitchen behind the house and breaking the logs into smaller chunks when needed to fit into the different size burners.  She trained me to be the fire starter, a duty I most enjoyed and learned to do with great proficiency.  When we eventually converted to natural gas, our family enjoyed the cleanliness of the new convenience but missed the wonderful flavors that charcoal cooking added to food -- whether grilled, boiled, or stir-fried. 

Modernization has brought cleaner gas and electric cooking to urban areas, but country folk and the poorer of the urban population still rely on less expensive charcoal for their cooking.  The charcoal is not highly processed and does not come in uniformly square briquettes as most Americans know charcoal to be; rather, they are irregular charred logs that, like mesquite, impart a delightful smoked flavor to food.  Because of this, grilling and roasting over hot coals continue to be popular cooking techniques in Thai cuisine.  Fine restaurants around the country know well to keep a section of their kitchens fueled on charcoal, and along city streets, sidewalk food vendors grill all kinds of food over wood coals -- from chicken, pork, meatballs, squid on skewers, fish and sausages to bananas, corn, sweet potatoes and yams, coconuts and even whole eggs. 

One of my vivid memories from childhood is helping Mother skewer and sizzle large green chiles over hot coals.  These were followed by succulent eggplants, roasted and charred to perfection.  Both were then skinned, cut up into bite-size strips, arranged beautifully on a serving plate and dressed with a limy hot sauce. 

As you fire up your barbecue kettle or hibachi on hot days this summer, grill up some eggplants and chiles along with your chicken and meat for a spicy, lip-smacking dinner.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless chicken -- chopped or ground
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     lemon grass stalk -- (optional), trimmed,
                        and sliced into thin rounds or chopped
  1                     shallot -- finely chopped
  2                     green onions, white part only -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh mint leaves
  2       small pieces  dried galanga -- toasted, and
                        finely ground
  2          teaspoons  ground roasted dried Thai chiles -- (to 4 tspns)
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce (nahm bplah) -- or more to taste
                        Juice of 2 to 3 limes -- to desired sourness
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar - (to 1 tspn) -- to balance flavors
  2        tablespoons  ground toasted rice
                        An assortment of raw or lightly steamed
                        vegetables and aromatic herbs, such as:
                        sprigs of various tropical basils and
                        mints, green beans/long beans, Thai
                        eggplant, cabbage/morning glory/watercress
                        cucumber/squash/zucchini, lettuce/ etc.

Cook the chopped or ground chicken in a little bit of oil in a wok until thoroughly cooked, breaking into small bits.  Set aside. 

Prepare the garlic, lemon grass (if using), shallot, green onions and mint.  Toast the galanga in a small dry pan over medium heat until the pieces are darkened and slightly charred.  Let cool before grinding in a clean coffee grinder to a fine powder.  Then roast a handful of whole dried Thai chiles in the pan, turning frequently until they are darkened and slightly charred.  Grind into a fine powder. 

Toss the cooked chicken with the garlic, lemon grass, shallot, green onion, mint, ground toasted galanga and chiles, fish sauce and lime juice.  Mix well.  Taste and adjust flavors to desired sourness, hotness and saltiness.  Add sugar only as needed to pull the flavors together.  Toss the toasted rice powder into the mixture and serve salad at room temperature with a tray of assorted vegetables and herbs. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  If you are not able to find ground toasted rice in Southeast Asian markets, it can be made by browning uncooked glutinous rice in a dry skillet (preferably cast iron), stirring frequently until the grains are evenly a rich brown color and fragrant.  Allow to cool to room temperature before grinding in a clean coffee grinder.  Adds a wonderful toasted aroma.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  If you are not able to find ground toasted rice in Southeast Asian markets, it can be made by browning uncooked glutinous rice in a dry skillet (preferably cast iron), stirring frequently until the grains are evenly a rich brown color and fragrant.  Allow to cool to room temperature before grinding in a clean coffee grinder.  Adds a wonderful toasted aroma.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     garlic cloves
  2                     shallots
                        Bottom half of a lemon grass stalk
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh or frozen galangal ginger
                        (or substitute with 1/2 tspn ground
                        dried galangal)
  2          teaspoons  minced cilantro roots
                        (or substitute with bottom stems)
  2          teaspoons  coriander seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin seeds
  5                     dried red chiles
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground mace
     1/2      teaspoon  shrimp paste - (to 1 tspn)
     1/2           cup  unsalted roasted peanuts
  1 1/2           cups  coconut milk - (to 2 cups)
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce - (to 2 tbspns) -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  palm or coconut sugar - (to 2 tbspns) -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  tamarind water - (dissolve 1 tspn
                        wet tamarind in 1 to 2 tbspns water)

Cut and discard the root tip of the garlic cloves but leave the skin on.  Do likewise with the shallots.  Place both on a tray in a toaster oven (or oven) and roast at 400 to 450 degrees until softened (about 10 to 15 minutes for garlic and 20 to 30 minutes for shallots, depending on the size of the cloves and heads). 

In the meantime, trim and discard the bottom tip and loose outer layer(s) of the lemon grass.  Cut the stalk into very thin rounds, then chop.  Mince the galangal ginger and cilantro roots (or stems). 

In a small dry pan, toast the coriander seeds over medium heat until they are aromatic and dark brown, stirring frequently.  Do likewise with the cumin seeds.  Follow with the dried red chilies, stirring constantly until they turn a dark red color and are slightly charred.  Grind the toasted ingredients in a clean coffee grinder to a fine powder. 

Using a heavy mortar and pestle, pound the lemon grass, galangal and cilantro roots (stems) until they are reduced to a paste.  Peel the roasted garlic and shallots and mash in with the mixture until well blended.  Then add the ground toasted ingredients, plus the nutmeg, cinnamon, mace and shrimp paste.  Pound to make a well-blended paste. 

Grind the peanuts in a clean coffee grinder or blender as finely as possible.  Heat 2/3 cup of the thickest cream from the top of a can of coconut milk in a saucepan over medium-high heat.  Reduce a few minutes until thick and bubbly.  Fry the spice mixture in the cream, stirring frequently, until it is well mixed with the cream and has fully released its aromas and flavors (3 to 5 minutes). 

Add half the remaining milk and the ground peanuts.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer 10 to 12 minutes, stirring well to blend the ingredients.  Add more coconut milk as needed to constitute a creamy sauce the consistency of pancake batter.  Season to taste with fish sauce, palm sugar and tamarind water to the desired combination of salty and sweet, with a subtle tangy flavor in the background. 

Simmer a few minutes more, then transfer to a sauce dish and cool to room temperature before serving with your favorite grilled meats, fish, tofu and vegetables. 

Notes and Pointers: 

I would like to share with you my favorite recipe for a full-flavored peanut sauce, combining a host of dry spices common in Indian and Indonesian cooking with herbs associated with Southeast Asian cooking.  The spices and herbs are cooked with ground roasted peanuts in coconut milk, seasoned with fish sauce, shrimp paste, palm sugar and tamarind.  My preferred brand of canned coconut milk for this recipe is Chao Koh.  Shrimp paste is a fermented greyish brown concentrate available in small plastic containers from Southeast Asian markets.  A small amount of the odiferous paste goes a long way to adding a whole lot of delicious flavor. 

To me, a peanut sauce made from peanut butter always will taste like peanut butter.  Back in Southeast Asia, when we make a peanut sauce, we always start with whole, freshly roasted peanuts, which we grind and then simmer with other ingredients to give the sauce a fresh taste of roasted peanuts.  A peanut sauce made this way tastes lighter than when peanut butter is used and the flavor of the peanuts blends in more intricately with the spice flavors. 

If the multitude of ingredients in the recipe makes it seem too complicated, please feel free to simplify the sauce to suit your schedule and taste, by omitting some of the ingredients you may not readily have on hand. 

But if you are like me and appreciate a full range of flavors, you will do as I do and make a large batch of the sauce, freezing it in small containers for those afternoons when you feel like grilling some chicken or pork, or even tofu and vegetables.  With such a tasty sauce, you won't need to marinate the meat in much of anything, but maybe a sprinkling of salt (or fish sauce) and pepper, and perhaps some curry powder and minced garlic.

       Steamed Sea Bass Fillet With Ginger, Garlic, Sesame-Soy Sauc

Recipe By     :Kasma Loha-unchit
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  sea bass fillet - (abt 1" to 1 1/2" thick)
  1              piece  ginger - (1" long)
  4                     garlic cloves - (to 6)
  1                     green onion
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  powdered dried red chilli
     1/2      teaspoon  rice vinegar
  2          teaspoons  sugar

Place the fish in a 2- to 3-inch deep heat-proof serving dish that fits inside the rack of a stacked steamer.  If you do not have a steamer, use a pot large enough and deep enough to accommodate the dish for steaming. 

Peel the ginger and slice into thin pieces.  Stack several pieces at a time and cut into fine slivers.  Peel the garlic cloves and slice into thin oval pieces.  Arrange both evenly over the fish. 

Cut the green onion into 2-inch segments, using both the white and most of the green parts.  Then cut each segment lengthwise into fine slivers.  Set aside. 

In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, powdered chili, vinegar and sugar.  Stir well to blend.  Spoon over the fish without dislodging the garlic and ginger. 

Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in a steamer pot before placing the dish holding the fish on a rack above it.  Or, if substituting with a large pot, fill with 1 to 1 1/2 inches of water, place a trivet, inverted bowl, or a vegetable steamer rack with the handle removed, inside the pot to lift the dish holding the fish from the bottom of the pot.  Bring to a boil, then cover and steam over medium heat for about 10 minutes.  (Steaming time will depend on the thickness of the fillet.) 

Then reduce heat to low, lift the cover and wait for the hot burst of steam to dissipate before sprinkling the slivered green onion over the top of the fish.  Replace cover, return heat to medium and steam 1 to 2 minutes longer, or until the fish is cooked through. 

This recipe yields 4 servings with plain steamed rice and other dishes in a shared family-style meal. 

Notes and Pointers: 

My family loves fish, and every year there seems to be a particular fish and way of preparing it that emerges as our favorite of the year.  In 1997 our fish of the year has been none other than the absolutely divine, yet simple, steamed sea bass with ginger, garlic and a tasty sesame and soy sauce.  We have made it countless times not only for ourselves, but also for numerous friends who came to our home for dinner. 

An adaptation of a common Chinese recipe with an added punch, this delicious fish is very easy to make, healthy to eat, and at the same time, can make an impressive presentation.  Prep time takes a mere ten minutes or less, cooking time not much longer and without the need for doting attention. 

I usually have the fish all ready to go before dinner guests arrive -- sitting on a lovely serving dish with a little bit of depth to hold the sauce and to catch juices that steam out from the fish, with the aromatics arranged prettily on top.  About fifteen minutes before dinner, I merely need to turn on the burner under the steamer pot, spoon the pre-mixed sauce over the fish, gently lower the dish into the steamer, cover and set the timer for ten minutes (or longer if it is a very thick fillet). 

When the buzzer sounds, green onions slivers are sprinkled on the fish and it is steamed another minute longer.  Then, with mitts on, the hot dish is carefully lifted out of the steamer and brought to the table.  The white, succulent flesh of the sea bass contrasts beautifully with the dark sauce it swims in, further textured and colored with the aromatics. 

Of course, freshness is the key to the success of this simple dish.  The sea bass should be of top quality and freshness and always use fresh garlic and ginger.  The type of soy sauce and sesame oil matters, too, and a little sugar is important as a harmonizing agent to pull the flavors of all the ingredients together.  My favorite soy sauce to use for this dish is a naturally brewed, premium dark soy imported from Taiwan under the label "Kimlan."  There are a few different grades with differing sodium levels and prices -- the best being their "super special" at a hefty $4 or more for a small 20 oz. bottle.  It is worth the price, especially when you will be using it on a fish that can cost you close to $10 a pound. 

Use pure sesame oil that has not been mixed with other oils (check label for ingredients).  I am partial to the more pronounced aroma of black sesame oil. 

Instead of rice vinegar, I sometimes prefer to use a little more of the milder Chinese black vinegar, whose musky flavor mixes wonderfully with the dark soy sauce.  Skip or cut back on the powdered dried chili if you wish the fish to be mild tasting. 

Try this recipe with other kinds of fish.  In Chinese cuisine, fish is more often steamed whole.  Use rock cod, sea perch, snapper or striped bass.  With whole fish, first pan sear in hot oil a minute or two on each side before arranging on the platter on which it will be steamed and served.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;An adaptation of a common Chinese recipe with an added punch, this delicious fish is very easy to make, healthy to eat, and at the same time, can make an impressive presentation.  Prep time takes a mere ten minutes or less, cooking time not much longer and without the need for doting attention. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;I usually have the fish all ready to go before dinner guests arrive -- sitting on a lovely serving dish with a little bit of depth to hold the sauce and to catch juices that steam out from the fish, with the aromatics arranged prettily on top.  About fifteen minutes before dinner, I merely need to turn on the burner under the steamer pot, spoon the pre-mixed sauce over the fish, gently lower the dish into the steamer, cover and set the timer for ten minutes (or longer if it is a very thick fillet). 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;When the buzzer sounds, green onions slivers are sprinkled on the fish and it is steamed another minute longer.  Then, with mitts on, the hot dish is carefully lifted out of the steamer and brought to the table.  The white, succulent flesh of the sea bass contrasts beautifully with the dark sauce it swims in, further textured and colored with the aromatics. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Of course, freshness is the key to the success of this simple dish.  The sea bass should be of top quality and freshness and always use fresh garlic and ginger.  The type of soy sauce and sesame oil matters, too, and a little sugar is important as a harmonizing agent to pull the flavors of all the ingredients together.  My favorite soy sauce to use for this dish is a naturally brewed, premium dark soy imported from Taiwan under the label &quot;Kimlan.&quot;  There are a few different grades with differing sodium levels and prices -- the best being their &quot;super special&quot; at a hefty $4 or more for a small 20 oz. bottle.  It is worth the price, especially when you will be using it on a fish that can cost you close to $10 a pound. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Use pure sesame oil that has not been mixed with other oils (check label for ingredients).  I am partial to the more pronounced aroma of black sesame oil. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Instead of rice vinegar, I sometimes prefer to use a little more of the milder Chinese black vinegar, whose musky flavor mixes wonderfully with the dark soy sauce.  Skip or cut back on the powdered dried chili if you wish the fish to be mild tasting. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Try this recipe with other kinds of fish.  In Chinese cuisine, fish is more often steamed whole.  Use rock cod, sea perch, snapper or striped bass.  With whole fish, first pan sear in hot oil a minute or two on each side before arranging on the platter on which it will be steamed and served.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  fresh rice noodles - (32 oz)
     1/2         pound  tender cut of steak -- thinly sliced
                        into bite-size strips (optional)
  8                     beef meat balls - (to 10) -- cut in half
                        or leave whole (optional)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  4               cups  fresh bean sprouts
  4               cups  green-leaf lettuce pieces
  1                cup  short cilantro sprigs
  4                     green onions, white and green parts -- cut thin rounds
                        Fried garlic oil - (8 cloves of chopped
                        garlic fried in 1/4 cup of peanut oil)
                        === STEWED BEEF SOUP ===
  1              whole  beef shank - (1 1/2 to 2 lbs)
                        (or other cut with tendon)
  8               cups  water
  2                     star anise
  2                     lemon grass stalks -- cut in 2" segments,
                        and crushed
  1              piece  fresh or frozen galangal - (2" long) -- crushed
                        (or use 6 dried pieces)
  4                     kaffir lime leaves - (to 5)
  1               head  garlic cloves -- crushed whole
  20                    white peppercorns -- cracked
     1/2           cup  cilantro roots and stem sections -- crushed
  5                     green onions including roots -- leave whole
  2        tablespoons  black soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  palm or brown sugar -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
  4        tablespoons  fish sauce or light soy sauce -- or more to taste
                        === HOT CHILE SAUCE ===
  10                    red and green Thai chiles -- chopped
  2                     red serrano or jalapeÒo peppers -- chopped
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/3           cup  white vinegar
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce - (to 3 tbspns) -- to taste
  2           teaspoon  sugar - (to 3 tspns) -- to taste

Place the whole beef shank and all the herbs, spices and flavor ingredients in a large pot.  Add water and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer covered until the shank is tender (3+ hours).  Remove shank and strain the broth.  Slice into bite-size chunks and return to strained broth. 

While the beef is stewing, prepare the hot sauce.  Pound the chopped chiles and garlic to a paste with a mortar and pestle.  Combine with the remaining sauce ingredients and let sit to allow the flavors to blend and mingle.  Sauce should be equally sour and salty with a hint of sweetness. 

Separate the noodles as much as possible into single strands.  Make the fried garlic oil and prepare the remaining ingredients. 

When the soup is ready, bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Toss the beef meat balls into the pot and while it is cooking, use a Chinese wire-mesh basket with a bamboo handle to blanch the noodles, bean sprouts and lettuce for just a few seconds -- a handful at a time, enough for one serving.  Lift basket to drain quickly.  Place in an individual serving-size bowl and spoon a few pieces of stewed beef and broth over the noodles. 

Next, blanch a few pieces of the sliced steak in the hot water using the wire-mesh basket, just enough to cook to medium-rare.  Arrange beef slices over the noodles and spoon one or more pieces of meat balls into the bowl.  Sprinkle with green onions, dust with white pepper and top with fried garlic oil (both garlic pieces and a little oil) and cilantro.  Repeat to make more bowls of noodles. 

Serve immediately with the chile sauce. 

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings. 

Notes and Pointers: 

Now that cold weather has descended upon us, devouring a steaming bowl of fragrant, stewed beef noodle soup is especially satisfying.  Not that I stay away from such delicious comfort food other times of year, it is a favorite one-dish meal and snack even in the tropical heat of Asia. 

Each Southeast Asian culture has its favorite noodle dishes.  The Vietnamese are fond of their "pho," the Thai of their "kuay tiow reua" ("boat noodles"), and the Malaysians their "laksa."  These noodle dishes share similar roots -- they are Chinese in origin, introduced by immigrants from different parts of China who settled in the region several generations ago.  Their descendants continue to run the noodle shops that abound in many Southeast Asian cities, or hawk countless bowls from push-cart stalls and paddle boats, adding color and aroma to the sidewalks and canals of the Orient. 

The common origin explains why many noodle dishes of different Southeast Asian cultures are suspiciously similar in look and taste.  This certainly is true of beef noodle soup.  The Vietnamese "pho" is not much different from the Thai "kuay tiow reua," or the Cantonese beef noodles you get in Chinatown noodle shops. 

There are essentially two kinds of beef noodle soup -- one with clearer broth and a cleaner taste and the other with a darker, richer and heartier broth.  The latter is what I prefer for the colder seasons of the year because of its warming qualities. 

I like to stew the beef for my noodle soup with a multitude of herbs and spices, adding a fragrant aroma that is not only inviting to the appetite but turns the concoction into something of a preventative medicinal broth.  And because a good, hearty broth is produced by simmering the beef over very low heat for a number of hours, the making of it warms and perfumes the home just as much as the finished soup is warming to the tummy and the soul. 

Asians like a variety of textures in their food and prefer to stew beef that is laced with tendons.  Well-tenderized tendons give a contrasting gelatinous texture to the chewier meat.  Many westerners are leery about eating tendon; they often mistake it for fat and think it is bad for their health.  Yet, they do not realize that this same tendon is the basic stuff that jello is made out of, and it certainly is not fatty. 

For my stewed beef soup, I like to use a whole shank because it is attached by large tendons to the muscles and bone.  It is readily available from Asian markets with a meat counter.  I simmer it whole until the entire shank is tender.  This takes about three to four hours.  The slower the cooking, the sweeter and more flavorful the broth. 

For further contrast of texture and flavor, tripe may be added to the stewing pot.  Fresh steak slices, lightly cooked to medium rare, and beef meat balls also frequently accompany the stewed beef on the noodles.  The latter is available in the refrigerated compartments of Asian markets.  They have a similar elastic texture to fish balls, but are a darker grayish color. 

The favorite noodles served in beef soup is fresh rice noodles -- the same kind used for Chinese "chow fun."  Available in most Asian markets, they come in dense two-pound packages.  Be sure to separate the noodles into individual strands before using, or else you will have one big lump in your soup. 

The soup is served with bean sprouts and lettuce either already wilted in the broth, or separately on a side dish for dunking into the soup as each person wishes.  The Vietnamese like to add sprigs of mint and basil to the side dish for bites of refreshing herbal flavors. 

Finally, each partaker at a noodle meal can spice the soup any way he or she wishes with chile sauces, fish sauce and other condiments laid out on the table.  Bottled sauces, such as Chinese chile sauce with garlic or Sriracha hot sauce, are available from most Asian stores.  I prefer to make my own with fresh chiles as in the recipe above.

           Stir-Fried Eggplant With Chiles And Thai Basil - ...

Recipe By     :Kasma Loha-unchit
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Thai
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     young long Asian eggplants
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2                     jalapeÒo, fresno or serrano peppers -- cut lengthwise
                        into thin slivers
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil - (to 3 tbspns)
  2        tablespoons  Thai oyster sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce -- or to taste
     1/2           cup  whole Thai sweet basil leaves and flowers -- (to 1 cup)

Trim off the stem end of the eggplants and cut crosswise into segments about 2 inches long.  Then halve each segment lengthwise and further cut each half into 2 to 3 strips.  Arrange the eggplant strips on a steamer rack and steam 5 to 7 minutes over medium heat, or until they have partially softened.  Set aside. 

Prepare the garlic, chiles and basil.  When ready to stir-fry, heat a wok or skillet over high heat until the surface is hot.  Swirl in the oil to coat the surface evenly and wait a few seconds for the oil to heat up.  Add the chopped garlic.  Stir and follow a few seconds later with the slivered chiles.  Saute a few more seconds, then add the steamed eggplant strips.  Toss well with the garlic and chiles for about half a minute. 

Spoon oyster sauce over the mixture, stir and mix well.  Then sprinkle in a teaspoon of sugar and a little bit of fish sauce to the desired saltiness.  If needed, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to help cook the eggplants to the tenderness of your liking.  Add the basil, stir till wilted and mixed in with the eggplants.  Transfer to a serving platter and serve hot with steamed rice. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Notes and Pointers: 

The eggplants may be steamed in advance and need not be hot out of the steamer for stir-frying.  However, if they had been refrigerated after they were steamed, bring them up to room temperature, or warm them slightly before stir-frying. 

For a smoky flavor, instead of steaming the eggplants, smoke them over coals in a barbeque kettle.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Trim off the stem end of the eggplants and cut crosswise into segments about 2 inches long.  Then halve each segment lengthwise and further cut each half into 2 to 3 strips.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Prepare the garlic, chiles and basil.  When ready to stir-fry, heat a wok or skillet over high heat until the surface is hot.

Saute a few more seconds, then add the steamed eggplant strips.  Toss well with the garlic and chiles for about half a minute. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Spoon oyster sauce over the mixture, stir and mix well.  Then sprinkle in a teaspoon of sugar and a little bit of fish sauce to the desired saltiness.  If needed, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to help cook the eggplants to the tenderness of your liking.  Add the basil, stir till wilted and mixed in with the eggplants.  Transfer to a serving platter and serve hot with steamed rice.

</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Notes and Pointers: 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;The eggplants may be steamed in advance and need not be hot out of the steamer for stir-frying.  However, if they had been refrigerated after they were steamed, bring them up to room temperature, or warm them slightly before stir-frying. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;For a smoky flavor, instead of steaming the eggplants, smoke them over coals in a barbeque kettle.

       Stir-Fried Wide Rice Noodles With Broccoli And Black Soy - .

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh gkuay dtiow rice noodles
                        ("sen yai" - wide strand)
     1/2         pound  chicken or pork meat
  2          teaspoons  light soy sauce - (to 3 tspns)
  6             stalks  ka-nah or Chinese broccoli
                        (4 to 5 cups cut up)
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil - (to 4 tbspns)
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  black soy sauce - (to 3 tbspns)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fish sauce (nahm bplah ) -- or to taste
                        (or substitute with light soy sauce)
  2          teaspoons  sugar - (to 3 tspns) -- to taste
  3              large  eggs -- room temperature
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Pickled chillies - (sliced serrano or
                        jalapeÒo peppers pickled in white vinegar)

Rinse the ka-nah or Chinese broccoli.  Peel the bottom part of the thicker stems and cut at a slanted diagonal into segments about two inches long.  Cut the leaves two to three inches long and keep separate from the stems. 

Slice the chicken or pork against the muscle into thin pieces about 1 1/2 inches long and half an inch wide.  Sprinkle 2 to 3 teaspoons of light soy sauce and a couple of dashes of white pepper over the pieces and coat them evenly.  Set aside. 

Take the noodles and, as much as possible, separate them into individual strands so that they do not lump up in stir-frying.  Place in a bowl.  (Do not rinse the noodles as this may make them soggy.)  Just before cooking, sprinkle the black soy sauce over the noodles and toss to evenly coat the strands. 

Swirl about four tablespoons of oil over the surface of a well-heated wok until the oil is hot and smoking.  Saute the chopped garlic in the oil for a few seconds, then add the chicken or pork.  Stir-fry until the chicken or pork pieces start to change color and are no longer so raw and pink on the outside. 

Toss in the noodles along with the remaining drops of black soy in the bowl.  Stir and spread out over heated surface of the wok.  Let noodles pan-fry about half a minute, then add the broccoli stems.  Stir and let fry another half to one minute before adding the broccoli leaves.  Stir and spread mixture over wok surface and allow to pan-fry 1 to 2 minutes more.  If you do not have a very hot stove, avoid stirring too much so that the noodles can brown and blister. 

Sprinkle the mixture with some sugar and fish sauce.  Stir and mix well.  Push the noodles up along the sides of the wok to make an empty space on the bottom.  Crack in the eggs, break the yolks with the edge of the spatula and allow them to fry and set in large chunks, flipping the noodles over gently as necessary.  When the eggs are cooked through, break into smaller chunks and toss in with noodles.  Sprinkle liberally with white pepper.  Toss well.  Transfer to a serving dish and serve warm with a pickled chillie sauce. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    chicken wings
                        === MARINADE ===
  1           teaspoon  fish sauce
     1/4           cup  very finely-sliced lemon grass
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  Thai pepper powder
     1/4           cup  chopped coriander/cilantro plant
                        === STUFFING ===
                        Drained sweet chili sauce -- (see directions)
                        Drained picked ginger -- (see directions)
  1                cup  pureed or finely-chopped shrimp
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped Thai chile peppers
  1         tablespoon  chili paste in oil
  1         tablespoon  red curry paste

Chop the chicken wings in half.  Combine the marinade ingredients and marinate the wings overnight. 

Now you must seperate the meat from the bones by gripping one end of each piece and jerking the meat and skin from the other end back to your hold (alternatively you can insert the stuffing using a cake icing bag). 

Drain about one tablespoon of the ginger from a bottle of pickled ginger. Similarly drain a tablespoon of the chili/garlic mixture for a bottle of sweet chili sauce. 

Combine all the ingredients of the stuffing to form a fine paste, making sure that the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated to avoid "hot spots" in the mixture, and then stuff the wing portions with it. 

The mini drumsticks can now be barbequed or deep fried until golden brown. 

Serve with picked ginger and sweet chili sauce. 

Footnote, if you choose to make some wings hotter than others, then you can dip the hot ones in a little red food coloring diluted in water to turn them red... as a warning to the unwary! 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Can be eaten as a starter or as a snack on their own.  They are also served as a side dish with a larger Thai dinner.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  spareribs
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  fish sauce
  1           teaspoon  Thai pepper powder
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch/cornflour
  1         tablespoon  rice wine
                        === SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  tomato catsup
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated ginger
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar
  1           teaspoon  fish sauce
  1           teaspoon  Thai pepper powder
  3               cups  beef stock
                        === ALSO NEED ===
     1/4           cup  sliced Thai chile peppers
                        (or jalapeÒo if you prefer less heat)
     1/2           cup  fresh pineapple chunks
     1/2           cup  sliced onion or shallots
     1/4           cup  shredded pickled ginger
     1/2           cup  tomato "meat"

Mix the marinade ingredients and marinate the ribs for 4 to 6 hours in a cool place.  Drop the tomatoes in boiling water to lossen the skins, and peel and quarter them, then discard the seed pulp and chop the "meat" to yield half a cup. 

Fry, broil, or barbeque the ribs until golden brown.  In a small saucepan or wok mix the sweet and sour sauce ingredients, and bring to a boil.  Simmer for about 15 minutes until slightly thickened.  Strain out any lumps that have formed. 

Heat some oil in the wok or a frying pan/skillet until very hot (smoking) and add the chili, pineapple, tomato, onion and ginger, and stir-fry until aromatic.  Add 1 cup of the sweet and sour sauce mix. 

In a small bowl combine 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 3 tablespoons water, and add this to the mixture to thicken it, then add the remaining sauce. 

Transfer the sauce to a sauce jug, and place the ribs on a serving platter.  Drizzle a little sauce over the ribs, and serve the ribs and the jug of sauce together. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  large spinach leaves - (to 2 bunches)
                        or 1 head of leafy lettuce -- leaves torn into 3"
                        to 4" round or square pieces
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  unsalted roasted peanuts
     1/4           cup  small dried shrimp
     1/2           cup  roasted unsweetened shredded coconut
     1/3           cup  diced ginger (size of a pea)
     1/3           cup  pea-size diced shallots or onion
  1                     lime -- cut into
                        peanut-size wedges, each with
                        both peel and juice sacs
  4              heads  pickled garlic -- stem removed
                        and bulb cut into peanut-size pieces
  6                     serrano peppers -- cut thin half
                        circles
                        (or use Thai chiles (prik kee noo) cut
                        into thin rounds)
     1/3           cup  cilantro leaves
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  finely-ground dried shrimp
     1/2           cup  roasted shredded coconut
     1/4           cup  unsalted roasted peanuts
     1/4           cup  palm or coconut sugar
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce (nahm bplah) -- or to taste
     1/2           cup  water

To roast coconut, place unsweetened fresh or dried shredded coconut in a dry cast-iron pan over medium heat.  Stir frequently until the coconut shreds are evenly a golden brown and very fragrant.  Pickled garlic is available in jars from Southeast Asian markets. 

Arrange the spinach or lettuce leaves and filling ingredients on a large serving platter, piling each separately and aesthetically for a pleasing presentation. 

To make the sauce, grind the dried shrimp, roasted coconut and peanuts separately and as finely as possible in a clean coffee grinder.  (For the dried shrimp, measure out 1/4 cup after the shrimp is ground.)  Place in a small saucepan together with the palm sugar, fish sauce and water.  Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer, stirring frequently to make sure all the ingredients are well blended and the sauce as smooth as possible.  Cook about 10 to 15 minutes, or until the mixture has thickened to the consistency of light batter.  Transfer to a sauce bowl and allow to cool to room temperature before using.  The sauce will thicken more as it cools. 

To eat, take a spinach or lettuce leaf, fill it with a little bit of everything, top with a dab of sauce, roll or wrap up, stuff the entire leaf packet into your mouth and chew everything all at once.  Enjoy the explosion of flavors! 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Another delightful street food is miang kam -- a very tasty snack that involves wrapping little tidbits of several items in a leaf, along with a sweet-and-salty sauce.  Chewing all the myriad ingredients together gives taste receptacles on the tongue and mouth a thrilling experience -- from the rich, roasted flavors of coconut and peanut, to the tanginess of lime with zest and the pungent bursts of diced ginger and chiles.  My students have found that it makes a great party food!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              small  chickens or Cornish hens
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  fish sauce
     1/2           cup  sweet dark soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  crushed garlic
  2        tablespoons  freshly ground ginger root
  1         tablespoon  freshly ground black pepper.
                        === STUFFING ===
     1/2           cup  freshly-ground ginger
     1/2           cup  freshly-ground galangal
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced bruised lemon grass stalk
     1/2           cup  chopped coriander/cilantro - (use all
                        of the plant, including the roots,
                        if you can get it)
     1/2           cup  sliced fresh mushrooms

Combine marinade ingredients and marinate the poultry overnight. 

For the stuffing:  Mix ginger, galangal, lemon grass, coriander, and mushrooms.  Add the marinade left over from the night before, and heat in a small saucepan to bring out the flavor; if you are doing the mock kai yang (see below).  Stuff the body of the bird[s]. 

Bake or broil until cooked, and the skin is crispy brown. 

This is served with Thai sticky rice, and E-san sauce.  You should also put some more fresh ground ginger on the table and the usual Thai condiments (we particularly like chilis marinated in sweet dark soy sauce with this one).  You can also serve it with a simple green salad. 

Mock gai yang:  Wondering what to do with the left over meat?  Try this: shred some pre-cooked poultry, to make about 4 cups of shredded meat.  Add about half a cup of the marinade (above) and mix well, and leave for the meat to absorb the marinade. 

Make up about a cup of stuffing, moistening it with a tablespoon of the marinade mix, and heat it in a saucepan to bring out the aroma, then mix thoroughly with the marinated meat.  Serve cold with a salad and the other ingredients... (If you prefer you can mix the meat in with the stuffing and heat the whole thing, then eat it hot or cold to suit yourself). 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Gai yang is literally "barbequed (or grilled) chicken", and is peasant food.  As such there are as many recipes as there are cooks in Thailand.  There are however two main styles: kai yang khrung thep ("Bangkok Style") which is slightly more elaborate, and the basic kai yang Isaan ("North East style"), which this is.  Originally the chicken was cut open along the belly, and opened out, then knocked flat with a couple of judicious blows from the back of a cleaver, marinated, pegged in a split stick to hold it and then grilled over a charcoal brazier. 

We've adapted the classic recipe for an industrial rotisserie by adding a stuffing.  You can do this in a broiler oven or rotisserie.  If you want a barbeque version, take two flattened chickens, place them face to face with the stuffing between them, and hold them in a pair of barbeque tongues, or one of those wire frame things, and barbeque the sandwich. 

Thai chickens tend to be quite small.  You can use a 2 pound bird, or a couple of cornish game hens, or other small poultry.

          Thai Barbeque Pork With Lemon Grass - {Mu Yang Takrai}

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork                            Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  pork -- cut bite size
                        === MARINADE ===
  10       tablespoons  palm sugar
  10       tablespoons  fish sauce
  10       tablespoons  thick soy sauce
  10       tablespoons  very thinly-sliced lemon grass
  5        tablespoons  whiskey
  5        tablespoons  very thinly-sliced shallots
  5        tablespoons  minced garlic
  5        tablespoons  coconut milk
  3        tablespoons  sesame oil
     1/2    tablespoon  Thai pepper powder - (to 1 tbspn)

Mix the marinade ingredients, except the coconut milk and in a saucepan or wok, simmer until reduced to about half the original volume.  Allow to cool, and add the coconut milk, stirring until combined. 

Marinate the meat for 1 to 3 hours in a cool place, then drain well, and thread onto skewers.  Barbeque the meat until cooked. 

Heat the marinade until simmering, stirring for 1 to 2 minutes (to cook any blood that has dripped from the marinating meat, and hence sterilize it), and serve as a dipping sauce for the meat. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is essentially a hawker food: meat (usually pork) is threaded on skewers or satay sticks and cooked over a charcoal braziere then served along with a dipping sauce in a small plastic bag.  It makes an easy recipe for a summer afternoon's barbeque.  Alternatively you can make it with pork chops or even with spareribs or chicken pieces.  It even makes a barbeque sauce for hamburgers and hot dogs.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  This is essentially a hawker food: meat (usually pork) is threaded on skewers or satay sticks and cooked over a charcoal braziere then served along with a dipping sauce in a small plastic bag.  It makes an easy recipe for a summer afternoon&apos;s barbeque.  Alternatively you can make it with pork chops or even with spareribs or chicken pieces.  It even makes a barbeque sauce for hamburgers and hot dogs.

                  Thai Barbequed Beef - {Seua Rong Hai}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  beef steak
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce
  3        tablespoons  dark sweet soy saoce
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  Thai chili powder - (not to be substitued
                        with the mild chili pepper found in US
                        supermarkets)
  1         tablespoon  chopped coriander/cilantro leaf
  1         tablespoon  chopped spring onion/green onion
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
  5        tablespoons  lime juice

Combine the Dipping Sauce ingredients the day before required for use. 

Take a one pound steak, and cut it into strips diagonally across the natural grain, about 1/2-inch wide, then cut the strips into bite sized pieces.  Marinate the meat in 3 tablespoons of fish sauce and 3 tablespoons of dark, sweet soy sauce for about an hour. 

Place the meat on a fine metal mesh (typically a 1 centimeter chicken wire is used in Thailand but you can just as easily use a suitable rack) over a barbeque and cook, turning the pieces occasionally, until done to your taste. 

Note, it is usual to serve barbequed dishes of this sort with a platter of vegetables.  A typical mixture would include cucumber slices, basil and mint, spinach, and spring onions.  However any mixture you have on hand would be fine. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  The title of this dish means "tiger's tears" -- not because it was original made from tiger meat, nor from other felines (as it so often does when "tiger" is used in the name of an oriental dish).  In this case the name comes from the noise of the fat dripping from the meat into the barbeque fire.  The dish is also called neua yang (barbequed beef).

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  beef -- thinly sliced
                        diagonally across the grain
  1                cup  whiskey -- warmed for flambe
                        (any whiskey, brandy or rum)
  3        tablespoons  thinly-sliced Thai chile peppers
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced garlic
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced galangal
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced shallots
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  tamarind sauce
  4                     fresh kaffir lime leaves - (to 5) -- shredded
  1           teaspoon  palm sugar

Place a wok over very high heat and stir-fry the ingredients quickly, stirring or shaking the wok vigorously to prevent the meat burning.  Add 1 cup of warmed whiskey to the wok and tip it to cause it to ignite.  After about 30 seconds if it is still burning place the lid on the wok to kill the flames. 

Serve with the usual Thai table condiments and Thai jasmine rice.  On a cold night the best "wine" to go with this is whiskey (good sippin' whiskey), warmed in the style of sake.  On a hot summer night, accompany it with a robust, and well chilled beer. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This meal needs to be cooked in very hot oil, and it is deliberately flamed at the end.  Because of this we recommend using a wok, not a skillet, at least 16 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep, or a saute pan, at least 16 inches in diameter and 4 inches deep.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOUP STOCK - {NAM KAENG JUED} ===
  10              cups  water
  4               cups  beef bones
  2                     onions -- with skin, quartered
  2                     coriander roots -- chopped
  7                     fresh kaffir lime leaves - (to 8) -- shredded
  1         tablespoon  grated ginger
                        === SOUP ===
  4               cups  Soup Stock -- (above)
  1                cup  red wine (Bull's Blood or similar)
  2               cups  cubed beef (any cut)
  1                cup  sliced celery
  1                cup  mushrooms (any variety)
     1/2           cup  sliced shallots
                        (or small red or purple onions)
  1         tablespoon  sliced Thai chile peppers
  2         tablespoon  fish sauce
  2        tablespoons  dark sweet soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1                cup  rice noodles -- soaked
                        === NAM JIM ROD DEDT ===
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  fish sauce
  3               cups  white rice vinegar
  3        tablespoons  palm sugar
  6               cups  sliced Thai chile peppers
  6        tablespoons  minced garlic
  6        tablespoons  grated ginger
  6        tablespoons  chopped coriander/cilantro/ including
                        roots

Break the bones with a hammer, and roast them for 15 minutes in a hot oven.  Bring the water to a boil, and add the vegetables and the bones to the pot.  Boil gently for an hour.  Boil vigorously to reduce to about half the volume you started with.  Allow to cool, skim off the fat, filter through a fine seive. 

Soak the noodles for 15 minutes, and then chop them into 2- to 3-inch long pieces for ease of eating.  Heat the stock to a gentle simmer, and add the wine, and all the other ingredients except the beef, mushrooms and noodles.  When the stock is again boiling add the beef and simmer until the beef is tender.  Add the mushrooms and noodles, and cook for a further 1 to 2 minutes.  Garnish with a few coriander leaves and serve with the nam jim described below. 

For the Nam Jim Rod Dedt:  Heat the water, fish sauce and vinegar, and dissolve the sugar.  Allow to cool, and then add all the ingredients to a food processor and process to a smooth paste.  If you prefer a thinner consistency you can increase the amounts of water, fish sauce and vinegar.  This sauce will keep indefinitely. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This soup is a popular light meal in Thailand, and often sold by "stop me and buy one" hawkers who pedal tricycles around the streets.  The traditional form is made from beef offal, and contains cow's blood.  However the dish can be made quite well from any cut of beef, and the blood can be omitted, or replaced as in this version, by red wine. 

The noodles should be cut into handleable pieces so that they can be eaten with a spoon.

Categories    : Beef                            Salads/Dressings
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  tender beef - steak is good
                        but any beef can be used
                        === SALAD ===
     1/4           cup  sliced onions -- separated
  2                     tomatoes -- cut wedges
     1/4           cup  sliced cucumber
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced Thai chile peppers
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
     1/4           cup  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  sweet dark soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
  3        tablespoons  minced ginger
  3        tablespoons  chopped coriander/cilantro including the
                        roots
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions (spring onions)
     1/4           cup  chopped shallots (small red or purple
                        onions)
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  chili oil

Barbeque the beef, cut into 1/8-inch thick slices, and then into bite sized pieces. 

Combine with the salad ingredients, and mix the sauce and toss the whole. 

Serve with sticky rice, lettuce, condiments and dipping sauce. 

Condiments:  Serve with the usual Thai condiments.  You can also add fish sauce, dark sweet soy, and hot chili sauce if you wish. 

Dipping Sauces:  A useful "auxiliary dipping sauce" is made by mixing one part dark soy with one part Worcestershire sauce, one part fish sauce and one part hot mustard. 

Another dipping sauce is "Hell Fire Sauce - {Nam Prik Narok}" (see recipe). 

Variants:  This can also be made with pork (yum moo), or even with shrimp (yum khoong).  An interesting variant is to use thinly sliced luncheon meat or even Spam.  Vegetarians can experiment with using a julienned vegetable mix in place of the meat. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Yam nuea literally means "tossed beef".  This is a simple beef "salad", and can be eaten hot or cold.  This should be on the hot side of neutral, but really is more spicy than "hot".  It is normal to add substantial amounts of hot condiments to it to suit yourself (see the section on condiments above).

           Thai Cashew Chicken - {Gai Pad Med Mamuang Himaphan}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  chicken -- cut thin slices,
                        and into bite-sized pieces.
  1         tablespoon  thinly sliced garlic
  1         tablespoon  thinly sliced Thai chile peppers
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  Maggi's Seasoning Sauce
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1         tablespoon  chili paste
  1           teaspoon  Thai pepper powder
  3        tablespoons  soup stock
  2        tablespoons  rice wine
     1/2           cup  cashew nuts
                        === GARNISH ===
  2        tablespoons  shredded mango -- (optional)
  3        tablespoons  chopped spring onions/green onions
  3        tablespoons  julienned green bell pepper

Add the chicken and all the ingredients except the cashews, stock and wine to the pan and stir-fry until the chicken just begins to cook.  Add the stock and continue over low heat until the chicken is cooked, then using a slotted spoon remove the chicken from the sauce and set aside. 

Add the rice wine, and reduce the sauce until a slight glaze appears (if necessary add 1 teaspoon of arrowroot powder, dissolved in a little tepid water).  Return the chicken, chilies and garlic to the sauce, and add the cashews.  Make sure they are heated through. 

Serve with Thai jasmine rice.  Tease 2 tablespoons of mango into shreds with the tines of a fork (or julienne finely), cut the whites from 4 to 5 spring onions, and thinly slice about 3 tablespoons of the green tops.  Julienne the bell peppers, and garnish the dish with the mango, onions bulbs and sliced tops. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  There is a little confusion in the name of the dish: mamuang is mango, but in the full formal Thai language mamuang himaphan is a cashew nut; the logic is as follows: himaphan refers to the Brahministic equivalent of the Garden of Eden, and the bean in which the cashew nut grows is similar to a small mango, hence the cashew is the "mango of paradise".  However this leads to one of those delightful double recipes, which is a sort of culinary pun, which the Thais seem to be particularly fond of. 

To add an element of piquancy to the dish you can include a small amount of shredded mango -- it is however quite optional if you prefer to leave it out.  The sauce includes honey as a sweetener, again the connotation is of the land of the dawn paradise -- but if you prefer you can use sugar (preferably palm sugar), though the sauce won't have quite the same flavor.

Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1                cup  chicken in bite sized pieces
  1                cup  veggies (either cabbage, long beans
                        or broccolli, or a mixture of beans
                        and broccolli)
  3        tablespoons  red curry paste
  4        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  sugar

Stir-fry the curry paste for a short while, until the mixture becomes aromatic, and a little oil is driven out of the paste by the cooking process.  Add the chicken and stir-fry briefly, until it just begins to turn whitish. 

Add the remaining ingredients, stir until it is heated through, and taste for flavor balance. 

Serve with steamed Thai jasmine rice, and garnish with lime and basil leaves. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Unlike gai pad khing, which is cooked at smoking point, this dish is cooked at medium-high -- any more heat and the vegetables will be destroyed. 

As with gai pad khing this dish can also be made with pork or beef. 

This is a good dish for those who don't like really hot food, as it can easily be prepared with less curry paste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  chicken in bite sized pieces
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  crushed garlic
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh root ginger
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced shallots
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
  1              pinch  turmeric
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SAUCE ===
  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds
  1           teaspoon  coriander seeds
  1           teaspoon  cardamom pods
  1         tablespoon  fermented shrimp paste
  1                cup  finely-sliced shallots
                        (or use red onions)
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced Thai chile peppers
  1                cup  coconut milk

Mix the ingredients of the marinade, and marinate the chicken in a cool place for about 3 hours.  Toast the cumin, coriander, and cardamom in a dry heavy skillet or wok, until aromatic, and grind to a fine powder.  Blend the ingredients of the sauce together.  Transfer the chicken and marinade to a wok or saute pan and stir-fry until the chicken just starts to change color. 

Transfer to a slow-crock cooker, and add the sauce, and then simmer, covered on low heat for one to one and a half hours (until the chicken is cooked, tender, and the pieces fall apart at the pressure of a chopstick). 

Serve with Thai jasmine rice. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is a "Thai-ised" version of a recipe from Delia Smith's cooking course, called Chicken with Whole Spice, which is a mild pastiche on Indian food.  This version is set up for a slow-crock cooker, but it could be prepared as a conventional casserole by simmering it on the stove top for about 30 minutes or in an oven at about 350 degrees for 30 minutes or so.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-chopped fresh garlic
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-chopped fresh ginger
  1               pint  chicken stock - (appoximately)
  1           teaspoon  preserved cabbage
     1/4         pound  chicken -- cut bite size
  2             ounces  wunsen (vermicelli)
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce - (to 2 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce - (to 2 tbspns)
                        Palm sugar -- to taste,
                        (abt 1/2 tspn should be sufficient)
     1/2           cup  sliced mushrooms - (shitake is traditional
                        but western button mushrooms are fine)
  1              small  onion -- coarsely chopped
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === GARNISH ===
  3                     spring onions/green onions/scallions -- sliced lengthwise
  1           teaspoon  chopped coriander leaves

Soak the wunsen in water at room temperature for about 10 minutes to soften it, then drain it thoroughly.  Heat a little oil in a wok and stir-fry the onion, garlic and ginger briefly. 

In a saucepan add the preserved cabbage to a pint of stock and bring it to a gentle boil.  Briefly stir-fry the chicken to seal it, then transfer the chicken and onion, garlic and ginger to the stock. 

Add the remaining ingredients, except the garnish and the wunsen, and simmer until the chicken is just about cooked through.  Increase the heat to bring the pan to a rolling boil, add the noodles, and immediately turn the heat off. 

Pour the soup into a serving turine, sprinkle with the garnish.  Each diner should have a bowl with some steamed Thai jasmine rice.  Traditionally each takes a spoon of soup from the communal serving bowl, picks up a little rice and then eats it.  You may prefer to ladle portions of soup over the diner's rice bowls. 

The quantities above make about enough for 4 people for a light lunch. 

Normal table condiments would be chilies in fish sauce (prik nam pla), chili powder and sugar.  We also recommend you serve with a few drops of dark sweet soy sauce. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This uses the light semi-transparent vermicelli style noodles known as wunsen in Thai.  Note that there are two types of soup in Thai cuisine: one type the Toms (tom kha gai, tom yam etc) are designed to be eaten with a meal.  The other style, known collectively as kuiteao nam (pronounced roughly "gw-eye-tee-ow nam") or "wet noodle dishes", are a popular form of fast food in Thailand.  They form a full meal and are regularly eaten for everything from breakfast to early dinner.  This kaeng djuut is a kuiteao nam style "luncheon" dish.  In parallel with the kuiteao nam dishes there is a wide range of kuiteao haeng (dry noodles) dishes.

           Thai Chicken Soup With Coconut Milk - {Tom Kha Gai}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Soups/Stews                     Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16      fluid ounces  soup broth (chicken stock)
  4                     fresh kaffir lime leaves - (to 5) -- shredded
  1              piece  lemon grass - (2" long) -- bruised to
                        release flavor
  1                     galangal cube - (abt 1") -- sliced thinly
  4        tablespoons  fish sauce
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  4             ounces  chicken breast -- cut into smallish
                        bite-sized pieces
  5       fluid ounces  coconut milk
                        Red Thai chile peppers -- slightly crushed,
                        see * Note
                        Coriander (cilantro) leaves -- for garnish.

* Note:  The number of red peppers is a personal choice.  It can be as few as half a chilli per diner, to as many as 8 to 10 per diner, but the dish should retain a balance of flavors and not be overwhelmend by the chili peppers.  We suggest about 8 to 12 chili peppers for this recipe. 

Heat the stock, add the lime leaves, lemon grass, galangal, fish sauce, and lime juice.  Stir thoroughly, bring to a boil, and add the chicken and coconut milk.  Bring back to the boil, lower the heat to keep it simmering and cook for about 2 minutes (until the chicken is cooked through). 

Not really intended to be eaten as a separate course, you could serve it with just a serving of steamed Thai jasmine rice, or together with a Thai meal.  This quantity serves 4 with other food, but is probably only enough for two if eaten separately. 

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings. 

Comments:  This is a mild but spicy chicken soup (it can also be made with shrimp, pork, beef or mushrooms).

             Thai Chicken With Holy Basil - {Gai Pad Gaprao}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots
  2        tablespoons  chopped mixed red and green
                        jalapeÒo peppers
  1           teaspoon  green peppercorns -- whole
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
  2        tablespoons  palm sugar
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped basil leaves
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- if preferred
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- cut into rings,
                        quartered and separated (optional)
                        (or sliced green onions or a combination)
  1              pound  ground or minced chicken

The garlic, shallots, peppers and peppercorns are ground together in a mortar and pestle or a food processor.  In a hot wok, with a little cooking oil, briefly stir-fry this paste to bring out the flavor and aroma.  Add the remaining ingredients and continue to stir until the chicken is cooked through. 

Serve over Thai jasmine rice, or over a fried egg or egg crepe, placed on the rice.  For dinner it goes well with the hot and sour tom yum soups, as well as curries and other Thai food. 

Add the usual Thai table condiments as well as ground chilis and sugar.  You might add ground black pepper also. 

Variants:  It can be made with chopped pork, or even a chopped beef base, though of course the flavors are quite different.  You can also experiment with replacing the meat with hard tofu marinated in a mixture of sweet soy, fish sauce and ground ginger, soy, or a vegetable mix of your choice (we like to mix broccoli and cauliflower florets with julienned carrots and wing beans), to make a vegetarian pad bai-gaprao. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is a quick and easy dish to make.  Thai basil, "holy basil" has a "hot peppery" taste, but the standard American basil is a reasonable substitute if you add a little freshly ground black pepper to it.

Categories    : Beef                            Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  beef
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  seasoned fish sauce -- (see below)
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black peppersauce
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
     1/2           cup  finely-sliced shallots (purple onions)
     1/2           cup  sliced green jalapeÒo peppers
     1/2           cup  sliced red jalapeÒo peppers
  5        tablespoons  fish sauce
  2        tablespoons  dark sweet soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
                        === SEASONED FISH SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced Thai chile peppers

For the Seasoned Fish Sauce, take fish sauce and add Thai chile peppers.  Store in a stoppered jar for a week in the refrigerator, then it is ready to use.  The excess can be used as a condiment for this dish. 

Slice the beef, and pound the slices thin.  Mix the marinade ingredients and combine with the beef, and marinate for about 2 hours. 

In a large skillet or wok, heat some oil, and saute the beef, marinade, garlic, shallots and chilis for about 3 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients and saute for a further 2 to 3 minutes until cooked. 

Serve over Thai jasmine rice, and garnish with a fried egg. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is a quick, and fairly mild preparation for beef.  It can also be prepared with pork.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RED CURRY SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  fried garlic
  1         tablespoon  fried shallots in oil
                        (small red or purple onions)
  4        tablespoons  red curry paste
  1                cup  coconut milk
  2        tablespoons  jalapeÒo peppers
  2        tablespoons  ginger
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1              pinch  sugar
                        === CURRY WITHOUT TEARS ===
  1             recipe  Red Curry Sauce -- (above)
  1                cup  diced chicken
  1                cup  julienned bamboo shoots
  5                     fresh kaffir lime leaves - (to 6) -- shredded
                        === STEW WITHOUT TEARS ===
  1             recipe  Red Curry Sauce -- (above)
  1                cup  beef stock
  1                cup  diced beef
  1                cup  broccoli florets and sliced stems
                        === SOUP WITHOUT TEARS ===
  1             recipe  Red Curry Sauce -- (above)
  2               cups  fish stock
  1                cup  peeled and deveined shrimp
  1                cup  mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  chili paste in oil

For the Red Curry Sauce:  In a wok heat (or cook) the garlic and shallots, and add the red curry paste, and stir until combined and aromatic.  In a wok push it up the side of pan away from the heat.  If you are using a saucepan remove and set aside. 

Heat the coconut milk until nearly boiling and lower the heat.  Add the chili paste, a quarter at a time, and stir until dissolved.  Now add the remaining ingredients, and stir until heated through. 

You can increase or reduce the shallots/garlic and chili paste together by a factor of two (ie if you halve the chili paste, halve the garlic and shallots also.  If you double them, double them all).  Similarly the jalapeÒos, ginger and fish sauce can be adjusted by up to a factor of two to give the flavor balance you want. 

Ginger gives the dish an afterburn. 

Curry Without Tears:  You can of course make the curry with any meat, poultry, fish or vegetables you wish.  This is for a simple kaeng phet gai (chicken curry). 

Heat the sauce.  Add the bamboo shoots and cook for three or four minutes, then add the chicken and lime leaves and cook until the chicken is cooked through.  If you choose to make this with beef instead you will need to cook the meat for longer, so add it first, and cook until it just begins to be tender, then add the bamboo. 

Stew Without Tears:  In a medium pan bring the sauce and stock to a boil then turn down the heat as low as it can go.  In a wok quickly stir-fry the beef to seal it, and add it to the sauce.  Poach it for 30 minutes to an hour until it is tender, then add the vegetables, turn up the heat and stir until the vegetables are barely cooked. 

Soup Without Tears:  Heat the sauce, add the stock and chili paste in oil, and stir to combine.  Add the shrimp and mushrooms, and cook until the shrimp are pink.  Taste and adjust the flavor by adding fish sauce (salt), sugar, and possibly more chili paste. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  white fish (cod) -- cut bite sized
  5        tablespoons  finely-chopped cabbage or spinach
  6        tablespoons  red curry paste
  6        tablespoons  finely-chopped freshly toasted peanuts
  5                     fresh kaffir lime leaves - (to 6) -- shredded
  2                     eggs
  6        tablespoons  thick coconut milk
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  2        tablespoons  corn starch
  2        tablespoons  julienned Thai chile peppers

In Thailand this is steamed in little cups made from banana leaves, pinned together with tooth picks, but you could just as well use ramekin bowls. 

Mix all the ingredients but the peanuts, julienned chilis, cabbage and fish in a food processor. 

Line the bowls with the cabbage, then put the fish in the bowls.  Stir the peanuts and chilis into the sauce mixture and pour over the fish.  Leave a little expansion space at the top of the dish. 

Place the filled bowls in a steamer, and steam for 15 to 20 minutes (until the fish is cooked and the sauce has set into a custard like consistency). 

Either serve the dishes "as is" with the usual Thai table condiments, or for a more formal occasion, whip some thick coconut milk, and garnish each bowl with a couple of teaspoons of the whipped coconut milk and a slivered red chili. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Haw Mukh is a rarity; a dish intended as an appetizer or snack.  It is essentially a custard made from curried steamed fish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  fish - (abt 1 lb)
                        Rice wine (white wine will do fine)
                        Plain flour
                        Oil -- for deep frying
                        === SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  finely slivered garlic
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green jalapeÒo peppers
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced red jalapeÒo peppers
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced shallots or other onions
     1/4           cup  chopped coriander/cilantro leaves
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves

Cut three or four slashes in the sides of the cleaned fish, and sprinkle with the rice wine.  Dust liberally with the flour, and deep fry in hot oil until crispy. 

Meanwhile, in a saucepan or second wok, add a little oil to the hot pan and stir-fry the chilis and onions until fragrant.  Add the fish sauce, and bring to a gentle boil.  Stir in the sugar and continue stirring until the sugar is dissolved.  Add the coriander leaves, and stir occasionally until the sauce is slightly reduced (about 5 minutes).  Remove from the heat, and transfer to a sauce jug.  Add the basil leaves when cool. 

The fish, on a serving platter, and accompanied with a basket of sticky rice or Thai jasmine rice, and the jug of sauce is served with the usual Thai table condiments. 

In Thailand, diners break off small pieces of the fish with chopsticks and transfer them to their plate, make the morsel into a ball with a little sticky rice and dip it into the sauce before transfering it to the mouth with the right hand. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This can be made with any fish.  We recommend catfish, sea bass or salmon.  Thai preference would be to gut and clean the fish, but leave the head on.  You may of course prefer to remove the head, even to use fish fillets.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Cut three or four slashes in the sides of the cleaned fish, and sprinkle with the rice wine.  Dust liberally with the flour, and deep fry in hot oil until crispy. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Meanwhile, in a saucepan or second wok, add a little oil to the hot pan and stir-fry the chilis and onions until fragrant.  Add the fish sauce, and bring to a gentle boil.  Stir in the sugar and continue stirring until the sugar is dissolved.  Add the coriander leaves, and stir occasionally until the sauce is slightly reduced (about 5 minutes).  Remove from the heat, and transfer to a sauce jug.  Add the basil leaves when cool.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;The fish, on a serving platter, and accompanied with a basket of sticky rice or Thai jasmine rice, and the jug of sauce is served with the usual Thai table condiments. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;In Thailand, diners break off small pieces of the fish with chopsticks and transfer them to their plate, make the morsel into a ball with a little sticky rice and dip it into the sauce before transfering it to the mouth with the right hand. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields ?? servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  This can be made with any fish.  We recommend catfish, sea bass or salmon.  Thai preference would be to gut and clean the fish, but leave the head on.  You may of course prefer to remove the head, even to use fish fillets.

                  Thai Fish Sour Soup - {Gaeng Som Pla}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  fish fillets
  4               cups  fish stock
  2        tablespoons  sour curry paste - (to 3 tbspns)
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
     1/4           cup  tamarind sauce
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar - (to 2 tbspns) -- or to taste
  2               cups  very coarsely-chopped green vegetables

If you are using fresh fish then dehead, detail, and gut your fish and fillet it to produce four fillets of fish. 

Heat the stock to simmering point, and add all the ingredients except the fish and return it to the boil.  Add the fish and simmer until the fish is cooked through. 

This dish can be eaten as a soup course, but in Thailand soups are normally eaten with the other dishes of the dinner, rather than before them.  Therefore you should use a slotted spoon to remove the fish and serve it in individual bowls to the diners.  The soup liquid is then placed in a large serving bowl, from where they can help themselves (you can use a fire pot of fondue cooker to keep it hot if you wish). 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This is a popular fish soup that is quite common in Thailand, where it is usually prepared using a local fish known as pla chon.  However, for the purpose of this recipe we suggest using tinned herrings packed in brine.  It can also be prepared just as succesfully using chicken and chicken stock (when it is known as gaeng som kai).

--------  ------------  --------------------------------

  2        tablespoons  fish sauce - (to 3 tbspns)
  2         tablespoon  thinly-sliced shallots
                        (or small red or purple onions)

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  sea bass
                        === STUFFING ===
  4        tablespoons  chopped coriander including
                        the roots if possible
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  sliced jalapeÒo chili peppers
  2          teaspoons  sugar

Any sort of fish could be used, but we like it done with a sea bass.  Mackerel and whiting are also good. 

While your grill is getting warm, prepare the stuffing for your fish:  In a food processor, mix ingredients to a coarse paste.  Rub this into the fish, and pack any that is left inside the fish.  Then wrap it securely and grill/broil for about 5 to 6 minutes per side. 

While it is cooking, prepare the dipping sauce:  This is mixed and served by giving each diner a small bowl of sauce. 

The fish is served with a simple green salad. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is about as simple a treatment for fish as you could wish.  Traditionally the fish is wrapped in banana leaves, and then the bundle is placed in the embers of a charcoal brazier and allowed to cook slowly (for example if you have prepared some other dishes, then without adding extra charcoal, you place the bundle on the embers, cover with ash, and simply leave until experience tells you its cooked). 

Unless you have banana leaves available, simply wrap it in aluminum foil and barbeque or braze it -- it won't quite have the flavor it acquires from the charcoal smoke and the wrapping leaves but we find that it tastes "almost" as good.

Recipe By     :Kasma Loha-unchit
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages                       Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  Thai Style Spiced Tea - (16 oz)
                        (or Thai Seasoning Mix packed by
                        Pantainorasingh Manufacturer)

I make it using a traditional Thai tea steeper: it is a tubular filter made of white muslin or cotton attached around the top to a metal ring that has a handle. 

Balance filter ring above a tea or coffee pot.  Fill filter with the desired amount of tea.  Pour in boiling water and steep to desired strength.  Make the tea strong because it will be diluted later with milk and ice. 

You may also use a coffee filter, but you'll need to use more tea mix to get the strength you wish. 

Sweeten the tea partially with sugar and finish off by adding sweetened condensed milk to taste.  Pour over a glass of ice.  Top with evaporated milk. 

Take note that the rich orange color of the tea is from food coloring.  The tea mix is made of black tea roasted with anise or licorice flavorings.

                Thai Masaman Chicken - {Gaeng Masaman Gai}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  chicken -- cut bite size
                        (you can also use pork or beef)
  3               cups  coconut milk
  2        tablespoons  roasted unsalted peanuts
  5              small  onions -- peeled, but whole
  5              small  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        partly boiled
  3                     bay leaves
  5                     roasted cardamom fruits (substitute as
                        desired)
  1        small piece  roasted cinnamon stick
  3        tablespoons  palm sugar
  3        tablespoons  tamarind sauce
  3         tablespoon  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  Masaman curry paste - (to 3 tbspns)
  1           teaspoon  crushed garlic - (to 3 tspns) -- (optional)
                        === CUCUMBER SAUCE - {AJAD} ===
  4        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  very coarsely chopped or sliced cucumber -- (to 3 tbspns)
  2                     shallots (or any variety of purple onion) -- chopped
  3                     Thai chile peppers - (to 4) -- thinly sliced

Allow the coconut milk to separate and you will have about 1 cup of thick "cream" and two cups of thin "milk".  In a small saucepan bring the milk to a simmer and add the chicken or pork.  If you are using beef you will need another two cups of milk.  Simmer the meat until it begins to become tender (beef takes longer, hence the additional milk). 

Put the coconut cream in a wok and bring to a boil, add the massaman paste and "stir-fry" until the flavor is brought out and maximized.  The coconut oil will separate out and can be skimmed off with a spoon or ladle (this removes much of the vegetable cholesterol or whatever it is called, and makes the dish much less trouble for those watching their weight or heart). 

Add the remaining cream and curry paste to the meat. 

Add the peanuts.  Taste and adjust the flavor until it is (just) sweet (by adding sugar), sour and salty (by adding tamarind juice, lime juice and fish sauce). 

Add the remaining ingredients and cook until cooked. 

Note, the potatoes used in Thailand for this dish are a yellow fleshed sweet potato of the type sometimes called a yam in the US.  Western style potatoes can be used, but absorb less of the sauce and flavor.  The potatoes act as a "moderator" to reduce the heat of the curry, and should not be left out. 

You can either serve it on a bed of Thai jasmine rice, or double the amount of potato and serve it alone. 

Accompany it with a dressed green salad and a bowl of "ajad" (pickled cucumbers).  The traditional Thai table also offers chilis in fish sauce (Phrik nam pla -- see below) chilis in vinegar (prik dong -- see below), and powdered chilli (not to be confused with the powedered chilli mix sold as chilli powder in the US), sugar, and often MSG.  You can if you wish add about a teaspoon of MSG to the above recipe to bring out the flavors, but we don't think it is necesary. 

Ajad:  Combine the listed ingredients, and leave to stand overnight. 

Nam pla prik:  Put two thirds of a cup of Thai chile peppers or jalapeÒo peppers in a 1 pint jar, and fill with fish sauce.  Seal and keep for a week before using. 

Prik dong:  Put two thirds of a cup of sliced Thai chile peppers in a 1 pint jar, and fill with white rice vinegar. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  The "massaman" indicates that the recipe is of a "musselman" or islamic origin.  It probably owes something to early Portuguese influences, and is similar in concept to the "sour and hot" Goan-style vindaloo dishes.  By Thai standards this is usually a fairly mild curry, so I find it is a good starting point.

                    Thai Papaya Salad - {Som Tam Isan}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     papaya -- julienned
  8                     Thai chile peppers - (to 10) -- de-stalked, cut into
                        four lengthwise, then in half crosswise
  8                     garlic cloves - (to 10) -- chopped coarsely
  2                     tomatoes -- sliced thinly
     1/2           cup  long beans (green beans) in 1" pieces
  1              pinch  salt
  2          teaspoons  fish sauce
     1/4           cup  tamarind sauce
                        Juice from 2 tablespoons of pickled
                        mud-fish

Sprinkle the julienned papaya with salt and let stand for half an hour or so, then squeeze and discard any fluid.  Add the chili, and pound in a mortar and pestle.  Add the remaining ingredients except the tomato, and pound until mixed and tender.  Add the tomato, and serve with a bowl of sticky rice. 

You can increase the proportion of chilis until this is a bowl of red fire, and it will still be authentic.  On the other hand you can reduce the chilis to just a hint and it will also still be authentic.  It all depends on your taste preference.  The above 50:50 mix is about typical of the region. 

If you wish you can decorate the salad with chopped roast peanuts, sliced green onions, and mint leaves.  You can also include [raw] bean sprouts and sliced cucumber as side dishes.  Thais generally eat lettuce or some cabbage related vegetable as a side dish also.  The normal way to eat it is to rip a piece of lettuce leaf, and take a mouthful of som tam in the leaf and eat it without knife, fork or spoon.  If you want to be a bit more western use a standard salad, or even an exotic such as a Waldorf Salad as a side dish. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is a typical isan (Northeast Thailand) dish.  It can be made with or without the plara (pickled mud fish).  Potential cooks are warned: this ingredient smells foul but it does taste nice.  Som tam is a basic "salad" style dish, eaten as a snack.

Categories    : Beef                            Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  steak
  8                     garlic cloves -- whole
     1/4           cup  sliced shallots
     1/4           cup  diced green bell peppers
     1/4           cup  diced red bell peppers
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  Maggi seasoning
  2        tablespoons  palm sugar
  1         tablespoon  Thai pepper powder
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  arrowroot powder
     1/2      teaspoon  Thai pepper powder

Cut the steak diagonally across the grain into thin strips (this may be easier if you chill the steak in the freezer first).  Mix the marinade ingredients and combine with the steak, and leave for about an hour. 

In a wok or skillet over medium-high heat, combine the sesame oil with two tablespoons of peanut oil and then stir-fry the garlic and pepper powder until the whole is aromatic and the garlic turns slightly crisp.  Add the beef, onions and sweet chilis, and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes (until the beef begins to show signs of being cooked).  Add the remaining ingredients, and increase the heat to high and stir-fry until the beef is cooked to your taste. 

Serve over steamed white Thai jasmine rice, and if desired garnish with a fried egg. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  In essence this is a Thai version of the popular western dish "pepper steak", but prepared in a typically Thai way.

  2                     fresh kaffir lime leaves - (to 3) -- shredded
  1         tablespoon  Thai chile peppers -- slivered
  15                    fresh basil leaves

Peel, devein, and behead the shrimp, leaving only the small tail shells on. 

Drop two tomatoes into boiling water for about a minute, then remove to cold water, peel, quarter, discard the seed pulp, and chop the flesh.  You want 2 tablespoons of chopped tomatoes. 

In a little oil in a medium-hot wok, briefly saute the garlic and basil, removing it and reserving it when the aroma is fully developed.  Cook the curry paste briefly to develop the aroma, then add half the coconut milk, the fish sauce, tomatoes, pineapple, lime juice and sugar.  Stir to combine fully.  Add the prawns and cook until they turn slightly pink and opaque.  Add the remainder of the coconut milk, the lime leaves and slivered chili, at the same time returning the sauted garlic and basil to the pan. 

Transfer to a serving dish and serve with steamed Thai jasmine rice. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  The pineapple adds a touch of tart sweetness to this dish.  It has a rich creamy texture, and a red coloration that is an attractive complement to the shrimp.  If you want to be a little fancy you can serve it in pineapple skin bowls.

            Thai Prawn Soup With Lemon Grass - {Tom Yum Goong}

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20                    prawns (shrimp) of medium size
  4               cups  water - (to 5 cups)
  3                     shallots (or small red or purple onions) -- finely chopped
  2                     lemon grass stalks -- lightly pounded,
                        and cut into 1" long segments
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  2             slices  fresh galanga
  20             small  mushrooms -- halved or whole
  6                     fresh kaffir lime leaves - (to 8) -- shredded
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
  2                     Thai chile peppers - (to 3) -- or more to taste
  5                     coriander leaves
  5                     spring onions

Wash the prawns and shell them without removing the tails.  Pour the water into a pan.  Add the shallots, lemon grass, fish sauce and galanga root.  Boil for 3 minutes.  Add the prawns and mushrooms, and cook until the prawns turn pink. 

Add the lime leaves, lime juice and chili peppers.  Cover and remove from the heat.  Sprinkle with coriander leaves and chopped spring onion and serve hot. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Note that a rather simple and effective way to make this dish is with a ready-made tom yum paste.  ImportFood.com has two options for you.  We recommend you order our Instant Tom Yum Paste, imported from Thailand and a very good quality product.  Add two tablespoons Tom Yum Paste to three cups boiling water, add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, add mushrooms and prawns, add 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, add 5 to 7 Thai chile peppers and  onions, and serve garnished with cilantro. 

An alternative to Tom Yum Paste is our Tom Yum Cubes which you can use to make the above soup.  Both alternatives also add fragrant, delicious Tom Yum flavor to just about any kind of noodles, and both are quite popular in creating "fusion" type Pan-Asian foods blending Thai and western foods.

              Thai Rice Soup With Shrimp - {Khao Tom Goong}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
  1                cup  cooked Thai jasmine rice
  1                cup  thinly-sliced Chinese celery,
                        including the leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  preserved cabbage
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  Maggi seasoning
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced garlic
  1           teaspoon  Thai pepper powder
                        Fried garlic -- to taste
  4              large  shrimp - (8 per lb) -- shelled, deveined,
                        and butterflied - (or 1/2 lb smaller ones
                        or 1/2 lb of other flavor ingredient)

In a very small amount of oil saute the garlic until golden brown and beginning to crisp up.  Pour in the water, and bring to the boil.  Next add the celery, Maggi sauce, and fish sauce and pepper powder, and stir until it boils again. 

Now add the rice, preserved cabbage and return to the boil, continuing to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the rice begins to "fall" and the water turns a milky white.  Now add the shrimp, and cook until they turn pink. 

Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle fried garlic over each serving, and garnish with chopped coriander/cilantro leaves. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Khao tom is a staple in Thailand, being widely eaten as a breakfast dish as well as an accompaniment to lunch and dinner.  It can be cooked plain (without the shrimp), or as here with shrimp.  It can also be made by simple substitution with chicken, pork, or any combination of seafood that you have on hand.  It can be made with cooked left over chicken/shrimp etc, or as here with fresh ingredients.  It is however almost always made from pre-cooked rice from a day before (though not always left-overs: the cook will often simply ladle enough rice from the electric rice pot to make the soup shortly before serving).  Made with chicken it is a popular meal for recovering patients who still feel a little queasy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Lettuce or kale leaves -- as needed
  4                     fish balls
  4              large  shrimp (abt 10 per lb size) -- shelled, deveined

  2        tablespoons  chopped Spanish onion
  1         tablespoon  chopped coriander leaf

Pour onto the bed of lettuce, and garnish with shredded lettuce, coriander leaves, and slices of cucumber. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This variation of yam talay could of course be made with any combination of seafood you have to hand.  It is a popular "pre-drink" food in Thai bars. 

Fish and shrimp balls are sold in Asian supermarkets.  If you can't find them use a little extra shrimp and crab.

     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar
                        A few sliced Thai chile peppers -- (optional)

You need about a pound of catfish, cut through the body into "steaks" about 1/2- to 1-inch thick. 

Combine the sauce ingredients.  In a wok (see caveat below) get enough oil to shallow-fry the fish smoking hot.  Add the fish and stir until thoroughly coated with oil, then add the prepared sauce (caution, it can splash -- you may want to wear eye-protection, or make judicious use of a splatter guard).  stir-fry for about 2 to 3 minutes, ensuring the fish doesn't stick to the pan and the pieces are all thoroughly sauced. 

Remove to a serving dish and serve with steamed Thai jasmine rice and the usual Thai table condiments as well as Thai chili powder and sugar. 

Final caution:  This cooks quite quickly -- don't over cook it or the fish will become rather hard.  It is cooked when you can pry the flesh from the central bone stem of the steak using the tip of a table knife without undue effort. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Note the oil for cooking should be *HOT*.  In view of this it is a good idea to cooks this in a skillet with a lid.

         Thai Spicy Ground Chicken And Toasted Rice - {Larb Gai}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Thai

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  lime juice - (to 3 tbspns)
  2        tablespoons  chicken stock - (to 3 tbspns)
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce - (to 3 tbspns)
  4          teaspoons  ground red chilis - (to 6 tspns)
                        (not to be substituted with "chilli
                        powder" as sold in western supermarkets)
  1         tablespoon  Khao Koor -- see * Note
  3                     shallots - (to 4) -- chopped
     1/2                lemon grass stalk -- very thinly sliced
  3                     fresh kaffir lime leaves -- shredded
  1                     scallions - (to 2) -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  powdered galangal
  4             ounces  chicken
                        Lettuce leaves -- for serving platter
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Parlsey
                        Coriander leaves
                        Sliced radish
                        Sliced turnip

* Note:  For Khao Koor, get a medium-sized wok fairly hot, and add a couple of tablespoons of uncooked rice.  Keep in movement until the rice starts to turn golden brown.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool.  Grind to a fairly coarse powder in a spice mill, or a mortar and pestle, or a blender or a good clean coffee grinder (all of these work well but keep in mind that a coffee grinder tends to grind too fine -- the powder should retain some "texture"). 

Line a serving dish with the lettuce leaves.  Chop the chicken to make it similar consistency as ground beef (can be done in a food processor or with two cleavers). 

In a fairly high wok, with a very small amount of oil, stir-fry the chicken until it just starts to turn whitish, then add all the remaining ingredients (if using precooked meat, simply add everything to a hot wok together), and stir until heated through and the chicken is cooked. 

Serve on the bed of lettuce leaves and garnish to taste.  Serve with steamed sticky rice (if you prefer you can use Thai jasmine rice and a dish of mixed [raw] fresh vegetables, and the usual Thai table condiments. 

The usual way to eat this is to take a small ball of sticky rice in the fingers and use it to pick up a little lawb, then eat it with the raw veggies.  You can also use a fork and spoon as a lot of Thais do. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is one of our all-time favorite Thai dishes, and it is a very common dish served throughout Thailand as well as Laos.  Lawb is an easy, quick to make "spicy" dish (it can be, and often is fierily hot).  It can be found on Thai restaurant menus in America as "chicken salad Thai style", which might be the best description for this dish.  It can be made with beef (lawb nuea) or pork (lawb muu) instead of chicken.  In Thailand it is almost always a chicken recipe.

                       Thai Steamed Crab - {Bu Ja}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  chopped coriander including
                        the root if possible
  4             ounces  crabmeat
  4             ounces  ground pork
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1              pinch  sugar

Note: If you want the dish to be a little more spicy, add a little grated ginger and sliced jalapeÒo pepper. 

Combine all the ingredients in a food processor, and then spoon a quarter of the mixture into each of four crab shells or ramekin dishes, and steam for about 15 minutes until cooked. 

Garnish with slivered red and green chillis and coriander leaves. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This is traditionally made from whole fresh crabs cooked in boiling water.  This recipe can easily be made with crab meat that you purchase, however. 

The food should be steamed in a bamboo steamer to avoid condensation dripping onto the cooking food.  Alternatively if you use a metal steamer cover the food with a paper towel which is not in contact with the food, or simply steam the crab in a microwave on medium or low heat.  If you use a microwave let the dish stand for one minute after each three minutes cooking, and check for "doneness" by probing it with a fork. 

If you prefer to omit the pork, use extra crabmeat or chopped shrimp.

            Thai Steamed Fish With Ginger And Mushrooms - ...

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  flat fish (pomfret, flounder, ...)
                        === MARINADE ===
  1              large  field mushroom -- thinly sliced,
  2        tablespoons  grated ginger
  1         tablespoon  sliced jalapeÒo pepper
  2                     scallions/spring onions/green onions -- finely sliced
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  shrimp paste
  1           teaspoon  pepper powder
  1         tablespoon  whiskey -- (optional, but
                        if omitted, add 1 tbspn fish sauce)

Clean the fish and score the sides with several cuts to allow the marinade to penetrate. 

Mix the marinade ingredients and rub them into the fish, leaving it to marinate for about an hour in a cool place. 

Transfer the fish, and the marinade, on a dish large enough to hold it, to a bamboo steamer (see note below), and steam for about 20 to 25 minutes (if microwaving, cook until the flesh adjacent to the bones is cooked, allowing it to rest for 1 minute after each 3 minutes cooking before testing). 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Traditionally this is prepared with the fish known in the West as a pomfret, but any similar (flat) fish will do. 

This is steamed, and as such is best done in a bamboo steamer, because in a metal steamer condensation on the lid drips onto the food and marks it, spoiling the appearance and also possibly affecting the cooking process (fish is best steamed in "dry" steam).  If you use a metal steamer you should cover the fish with a paper towel which is not in direct (or limited) contact with the steamer.  Alternatively you can cook this dish in a microwave, using low to medium power.

                   Thai Stir Fried Pork - {Pad Ped Mu}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork                            Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  belly pork -- cut small dice.
  2               cups  long green beans in 1" pieces
     1/2           cup  sliced green bell peppers
     1/2           cup  sliced red Thai bell peppers
  3        tablespoons  red curry paste
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  Thai chili in oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced Thai chile peppers
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Heat a wok (see below), and then add the belly pork and stir-fry until it turns brown, and the fat crispens and reduces.  If it becomes too dry add a very small amount of peanut oil. 

Add the curry paste, and stir-fry to combine, then add the fish sauce, chili oil, garlic, sugar, chilis and pepper, and stir-fry for about two minutes stirring continuously to combine the flavors and mix well. 

Add the bell peppers and stir-fry until they just begin to soften, then add the long beans and stir-fry until heated through (about 30 seconds). 

Serve with steamed Thai jasmine rice. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This dish is made with belly pork.  There are a number of reasons for this: on the pragmatic level the Thais tend to use all of an animal, and this is a way of using the rather fatty belly pork.  Secondly the style of cooking means that the dish is cooked in the pork fat itself, which enhances the flavor.  Thirdly, the fatty meat absorbs the additional flavors and so tastes better. 

We suggest that you use a non-stick stir-fry pan or saute pan for this dish if available (the pork sticks to the pan quite easily).  The wok or pan should be quite hot, so as to sear the pork and render the fat quickly.  If the pan is too cold it will tend to become leathery and "chewy". 

Sliced chilis are "optional".  You can also reduce the amount of red curry paste used quite substantially without too much adverse affect on the authenticity of the dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sliced spinach leaves
  1                cup  broccoli florets
     1/2           cup  sliced carrots
     1/2           cup  cauliflower florets
     1/2           cup  julienned mixed red and green jalapeÒos
     1/4           cup  snow peas
     1/4           cup  sliced mushrooms
     1/4           cup  sliced shallots
                        (or small red or purple onions)
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar
  1         tablespoon  Thai chili in oil
  1                cup  bean sprouts

Heat a little peanut oil in a wok or skillet over medium heat, and stir in the Thai chili in oil and soy sauce.  When mixed and aromatic, add all the other ingredients except the sugar and bean sprouts. 

Stir-fry until just cooked (the vegetables should still be crispy), tasting for balance.  Add sugar to taste.  If the mixture becomes too dry, add a little water.  If it remains too wet, add a little arrowroot powder to thicken the sauce. 

Remove from the heat, stir in the bean sprouts, and serve with steamed Thai jasmine rice 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Ruam mitr means "everything in together".  Literally this refers both to the cooking style, where all the ingredients to be cooked are added together.  The selection of ingredients consists of a little of all the veggies in your store cupboard.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  crabmeat
                        (a large crab, broken up,
                        or "loose" crabmeat)
  2                     eggs
     1/2           cup  diced white onion
     1/2           cup  diced celery
     1/2           cup  spring onion/green onion -- sliced thinly
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce

Whisk the eggs with the fish sauce.  Place a wok or skillet over medium-low heat, and saute the onion and garlic in a little oil until golden and translucent.  Add the crabmeat, and stir-fry until nearly cooked through.  Drizzle in the eggs, using the spatula in a brisk chopping motion to break up the cooked eggs into filaments, then add the remaining ingedients. 

Alternatively cook the eggs to form a thin omelette, and then roll it up and slice it, adding the slices of egg to the cooking crabmeat when nearly cooked. 

This is a "one plate" dish, served on its own as a light breakfast or luncheon dish, or with other items a part of a Thai dinner. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is a simple stir-fry that shows that not all Thai dishes are laden with spices and chili!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  to medium flat fish, such as
                        pomfret, flounder, ...
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  3             ounces  minced pork -- (optional, see
                        below)
  1              small  carrot -- julienned
  1         tablespoon  grated ginger
  2        tablespoons  sliced mushroom (preferably the black,
                        dried Chinese mushroom, soaked for 15
                        minutes before slicing)
  1           teaspoon  yellow bean sauce - (to 2 tspns) -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1           teaspoon  shrimp paste
  1           teaspoon  palm sugar
  4        tablespoons  fish stock
                        (or you may use chicken stock)
  2         tablespoon  chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  sliced red jalapeÒo pepper
  1           teaspoon  Thai pepper powder

You need a small-to-medium flat fish (pomfret, flounder, ...), cleaned and with the sides slashed for the marinade to penetrate. 

Mix the marinade, rub into both sides of the fish, and leave it to stand, covered in a cool place, in the marinade for at least an hour. 

Remove the fish from the marinade, and allow it to drain.  Transfer the remaining marinade to a small saucepan and add 2 tablespoons of fish sauce, one tablespoon of sliced jalapeÒo, and one tablespoon of grated ginger.  Simmer to reduce to a sauce like consistency. 

Heat enough oil to deep fry the fish in a suitable pan over medium heat, and slide the fish into the hot oil, turn once, and cook until the fish is cooked through.  Serve on a platter, pouring the reduced sauce over the fish. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is another simple traditional treatment for fish; this time it is deep fried.  The recipe includes some minced pork; this can easily be omitted.  It is included in this case only to reproduce the traditional taste, as in the past this dish was deep fried in pork fat, which transferred the pork flavor to the fish.  Today it would more typically be fried in vegetable oil, hence the small quantity of pork. 

Equally traditionally this dish is deep fried in a wok and you should use at least a 20-inch wok. 

The fish is normally fried with the head on.

                  Thai Style Fried Mussels - {Hoi Tohd}

Categories    : Seafood                         Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  mussels
  1                cup  fresh green beans in 1" pieces -- (optional)
  1                cup  bean sprouts -- (optional)
  1                cup  thinly-sliced shallots (or small red or
                        purple onions)
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  chilis in bean oil
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced Thai chile peppers
  1           teaspoon  light brown granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  Thai pepper powder

Clean the mussels, carefully removing the beards.  In a wok or skillet over medium heat, saute the shallots and garlic until aromatic.  Add the mussels, stir-fry on high heat for 1 minute, add the remaining ingredients (except the beans and bean sprouts) and cover the pan, reducing the heat to medium, for a further 5 minutes.  Shake the pan occasionally to move the mussels around and ensure even cooking.  Check the cooking; discard any unopened mussels. 

If you want a substantial meal, add the beans and stir-fry until heated through, then remove from the heat and add the bean sprouts, stirring briefly, then transfer to the serving platter. 

For a light snack, the mussels are eaten alone using a convenient half shell as a spoon/knife.  For a more substantial meal, the mussels are transferred to a platter, and the beans, bean shoots etc to another.  Then the veggies can be eaten with rice or noodles, accompanying the mussels. 

In many cases the mussels are eaten with the fingers, as this makes it easier to dip them in the chosen, and usually fierily hot, dipping sauce, such as nam prik kiga, or nam prik narok. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Just the thing if you're in a hurry; and a tasty party food, or between meal snack as well.

         Thai Style Pork With Peanut Sauce - {Phraram Long Song}

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork                            Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  pork in small bite-sized pieces
  1                cup  shredded cabbage
                        === FLAVORED OIL ===
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1           teaspoon  slivered garlic
  4                     ginger coins - (1" dia by 1/8" thick)
  4                     Thai chile peppers
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
                        === SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  very finely-chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  massaman curry paste
  1                cup  coconut milk
  1                cup  pork stock
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
     1/2           cup  raw peanuts -- crushed

Heat a wok, and add three tablespoons of peanut oil.  Add one teaspoon of slivered garlic, and saute until the garlic is just changing color.  Remove and discard the garlic.  Add 4 "coins" of ginger, 1-inch in diameter, and an eigth of an inch thick, and saute for 1 minute.  Remove and discard.  Take 4 chilis and destalk them, cut them in half and tap them on the counter to remove loose seeds (not necessary to remove all of the seeds, but get rid of what easily falls out).  Saute for 1 minute.  Remove and discard.  Now add one teaspoon of curry powder and stir until absorbed into the flavored oil. 

For the provincial version, to the hot oil add 1 tablespoon of slivered garlic, one tablespoon of slivered ginger, and 1 tablespoon of very thinly sliced chilis, including the seeds, then remove the flavorants.  Add 1 tablespoon of curry powder and blend into the oil.  The garlic, ginger and chili is then blended to a fine paste and retained to be added later. 

Now stir-fry the meat for about 1 minute, and remove it from the oil while you prepare the sauce. 

Fry the peanuts for about 5 minutes in the oil, then remove them and blend them to a fine paste, and return the paste to the oil, adding the curry paste and stirring until aromatic.  Now slowly add the coconut milk, stirring constantly to blend, and then add the remaining sauce ingredients.  Bring to a gentle simmer. 

If preparing the provincial version, return the oil flavorants to the mix at this time. 

Add the meat, and return to the simmer, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally for about 20 minutes, until the meat is tender. 

Add the vegetables, turn the heat up and boil vigorously for 1 minute. 

Serve with Thai jasmine rice. 

Note:  We cooked this to check the recipe in a 16-inch wok that is 6 inches deep.  If your wok is smaller or shallower you may not wish to have this much sauce in a wok, and of course you can complete the recipe in a medium saucepan. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  There are a number of possible translations of the title of this dish, which is from the milder "Royal Thai" tradition.  Phraram is the name given in Thai to the God Rama, or the title of the King.  The title can be translated by those of a poetic nature to mean food so good it makes the king cry. 

Because this is a mild, Royal Thai dish, we give two methods which differ slightly.  One is mild and has complex flavors.  The other is more in line with the country tradition of not throwing away anything that can be eaten, and is a little more potent, as suits the provincial palate. 

This dish can be made with pork, beef, chicken or shrimp.  This version is made with pork.  Shrimp require less cooking and beef rather more.  This version is made with pork.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  medium shrimp
  2        tablespoons  pounded, thinly-sliced lemon grass
  2                     fresh kaffir lime leaves -- shredded
  2        tablespoons  shredded mint leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped coriander/cilantro leaves
  2        tablespoons  thinly sliced shallots
                        (or small red or purple onions)
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced spring onion/scallion
  1           teaspoon  ground dried red chili
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
     1/4           cup  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  tamarind sauce
  2        tablespoons  prik dong -- see * Note
  2        tablespoons  nam pla prik -- see * Note

* Note:  Drain the vinegar from enough prik dong (pickled red chili) to yield two tablespoons of drained, sliced Thai chile peppers, and drain the fish sauce from enough nam pla prik (green chilis in fish sauce) to yield two tablespoons of drained, sliced Thai chile peppers. 

Drop the shrimp, still with their heads and shells, into boiling water and blanche for no more than 30 seconds.  De-head and de-vein the shrimp, and discard all the shells but the tails.  Place the shrimp in a bowl and add the fish sauce, lime juice, tamarind sauce and chili powder, and leave to marinate for about an hour.  Toss with the remaining ingredients to combine. 

Garnish with cucumber slices and lime wedges and serve with sticky rice or Thai jasmine rice. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  In the Isan (Northeast Thailand), this dish is sometimes prepared with raw shrimp.  This variant is known as pla kung lao (ie shrimp prepared in the Laotian style).  In essence the shrimp are "cooked" in the lime juice, which induces chemical changes in the shrimp meat.  However the dish has a Thai variant (pla kung korat or simply pla kung) in which the shrimp are "blanched" in the manner typically used for vegetables.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless skinless chicken -- cut bite sized
  4               cups  chicken stock
  3        tablespoons  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground ginger
  2        tablespoons  sour curry paste - (to 3 tbspns)
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
     1/4           cup  tamarind sauce
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar - (to 2 tbspns) -- or to taste
  2               cups  very coarsely-chopped green vegetables
  1                cup  pineapple chunks (preferably fresh)

Prepare the chicken and then add three tablespoons of sesame oil and one tablespoon of freshly ground ginger, mix, and leave to marinate for one hour. 

Heat a wok, and then stir-fry the chicken in the marinade until it just starts to change color. 

Heat the stock to simmering point.  Add all the ingredients except the chicken and pineapple, and return it to the boil.  Add the chicken, and the marinade and simmer until the chicken is cooked through.  Add the pineapple, bring to the boil and then serve. 

Note that this can also be prepared as a stir-fry dish by simply omitting the chicken stock.  (If it is a little dry, then add a couple of tablespoons of stock to the wok). 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is a variant of kaeng som, which is a popular fish soup that is quite common in Thailand.  Keang som is quite sour, and this dish has been given a degree of sweetness in keeping with making it from chicken.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  This is a variant of kaeng som, which is a popular fish soup that is quite common in Thailand.  Keang som is quite sour, and this dish has been given a degree of sweetness in keeping with making it from chicken.

Categories    : Seafood                         Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     half-inch thick fish steaks
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  rice wine
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  wheat flour
  2        tablespoons  rice flour
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                     onion -- chopped,
  1                     green bell pepper -- chopped
     1/3           cup  sugar
     2/3           cup  tomato ketchup
     1/4           cup  white rice vinegar
  4        tablespoons  rice wine
     1/2           cup  fish stock (or water)
     1/2           cup  pineapple pieces

Dredge the fish in the marinade, and leave to stand for about an hour so that the fish is infused with the flavor. 

Heat oil for deep frying in a deep skillet or large wok over medium heat, and when it is hot, add the fish, turning once, until cooked through.  Remove the fish, drain the excess oil, and place on the serving platter. 

Sauce:  In a small pan saute the onion and sweet pepper, add the remaining ingredients, except the pineapple, and simmer until slightly reduced.  Add about a tablespoon of rice flour to thicken the sauce, then add the pineapple and heat through. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This is prepared from steaks of kraphong khao (sea bass), but you could easily use another fish (it works very well with shark steaks).  You can cook the fish in a electric deep frier if you wish (high heat is not required).

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Thai


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  mackerel or whiting
                        === SAUCE INGREDIENTS ===
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots (purple onions)
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  sliced Thai chile peppers
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  2        tablespoons  palm sugar
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  fish stock
                        (or you may use chicken stock)

First the simple part:  Deep fry about a pound of mackerel or whiting, preferably with the heads on, in smoking hot peanut oil until the skin is crisp.  Place it on a serving platter. 

In a small saucepan, saute the garlic and shallots in a little oil, then remove and set aside. 

Pour off the oil, leaving only a thin film on the pan.  Return half the shallots and garlic to the pan, and add the other ingredients.  Stir to dissolve the sugar and then simmer to thicken the sauce.  Add the remaining shallots and garlic, stir until heated through, then pour it over the cooked fish. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  A traditional treatment for fish that simply contrasts sweet, hot and sour flavor elements.  This is traditionally cooked in a large deep wok, though unlike pla jian it is cooked at very high heat.  Therefore we caution you to use a large skillet or an electric deep fryer and ensure that the peanut oil is smoking.

                   Thai Vegetable Curry - {Kaeng Phak}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Thai                            Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  aromatic brown rice
  2               cups  stock
  2               cups  water
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  8          teaspoons  thinly-sliced shallots/purple onions
  4          teaspoons  finely-sliced jalapeÒos
  4          teaspoons  freshly-grated ginger
                        === GREEN CURRY SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  green curry paste
  1                cup  coconut milk
  2        tablespoons  Maggi sauce
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar
  1         tablespoon  garlic -- minced
  1         tablespoon  finely-sliced Thai chile peppers
  1         tablespoon  grated galangal
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped coriander/cilantro
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh basil leaves
  1         tablespoon  green peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  Thai chili in oil
  2                     fresh kaffir lime leaves -- shredded
                        Thai pepper powder -- to taste
                        === VEGETABLES ===
     1/2           cup  cauliflower florets and thinly-sliced
                        cauliflower stalks
     1/2           cup  asparagus
     1/2           cup  baby corn cut lengthwise in half
     1/2           cup  bamboo shoots
     1/2           cup  Thai eggplants or standard aubergine -- cut into balls
                        with a melon baller
     1/2           cup  snow peas

First we must prepare the rice.  For this recipe we suggest a brown rice, prepared as the aromatic rice. 

If preparing the rice in an automatic rice cooker: "winnow" the rice to blow away any dust, and check that there are no stones present.  Place the rice in the cooking container of a 10 cup rice cooker (or larger). 

In a wok, heat the oil, and then briefly saute the chili, onions and ginger until aromatic.  Stir the oil and aromatics into the rice, stirring vigorously so that all the rice is coated with the mixture.  Add the stock and water, and cook to completion. 

If preparing the rice on the stove top:  Winnow the rice and check for stones. 

In a wok, saute the aromatics, then add the rice to the wok, remove it from the heat, stir until coated with oil, then add the stock and water, and return to the heat.  Once it boils, lower the heat to a gentle simmer, cover and leave undisturbed for 20 minutes. 

While the rice is cooking we can prepare the curry:  First we convert the basic curry paste into a curry sauce... nam jim kaeng khiaowan (green curry sauce). 

In a saucepan over medium heat combine the ingredients and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Taste for flavor balance and adjust as necessary.  Transfer to a sauce boat or small bowl. 

To complete the dish you need half a cup each of various vegetables to make a total of 3 cups.  We suggest cauliflower (separate the florets, and slice the stalk thinly), asparagus, baby corn (cut lengthwise in half), bamboo shoots, Thai eggplants (or standard aubergine, cut into balls with a melon baller), and snow peas. 

Place these in a bamboo steamer and steam until barely cooked (they should still be firm and snap when bent). 

Place the vegetables in separate serving bowls.  Each diner then helps themselves to rice, a selection of vegetables, and the curry sauce.  For flavor contrast the vegetables can also be eaten with any of the standard Thai dipping sauces (adjusted if necessary to vegetarian/vegan requirements). 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Truly vegetarian or vegan Thai recipes are rare (at least in Thailand).  There are a number of reasons for this, not least the fact that most people find it convenient to buy food from roadside vendors and hawkers rather than cook it themselves, and very little of such food is vegetarian. 

There are added problems: not only are fish sauce and shrimp paste signature ingredients of much Thai food, they are also present in such key ingredients as curry pastes.  Thus a dedicated vegetarian must not only cook for themselves, but nearly always cook from scratch, which is at the very least a time consuming process.  Therefore you may find the recipe above a bit more complicated than most contained in our website. 

As an alternative to the approach given here, you could thin the sauce with 2 cups of water or vegetable stock, and then simmer the vegetables in the sauce.

There are a number of reasons for this, not least the fact that most people find it convenient to buy food from roadside vendors and hawkers rather than cook it themselves, and very little of such food is vegetarian. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;There are added problems: not only are fish sauce and shrimp paste signature ingredients of much Thai food, they are also present in such key ingredients as curry pastes.  Thus a dedicated vegetarian must not only cook for themselves, but nearly always cook from scratch, which is at the very least a time consuming process.  Therefore you may find the recipe above a bit more complicated than most contained in our website. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;As an alternative to the approach given here, you could thin the sauce with 2 cups of water or vegetable stock, and then simmer the vegetables in the sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPICE MIXTURE ===
  10                    black pepper corns
  1         tablespoon  shrimp paste
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce
  10                    shallots or small red or purple onions
     1/2           cup  dried shrimp
                        === OTHER INGREDIENTS ===
  1         tablespoon  red curry paste
  2        tablespoons  chili paste in oil
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  5               cups  vegetables
  5                     fresh basil sprigs
  4               cups  vegetable stock

In a mortar and pestle or food processor, grind the spice mixture ingredients to a smooth paste.  Bring the stock to a boil and add the spice mixture, curry paste, and chili paste in oil, and stir until thoroughly mixed. 

When it is again boiling, and mixed, stir in the fish sauce.  Add the vegetables and basil, stir until cooked.  The vegetables should be minimally cooked. 

Taste and adjust the saltiness by adding more fish sauce if required. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  As opposed to tom jabchai, this *is* a vegetarian dish.  Though normally included in Thailand, the curry paste and chili beans in oil can be considered optional for those who are looking for something with a little less heat.  You can use any vegtables available, but typically in Thailand it would be made from a gourd.  If one of the gourds is used it is cut into bite-sized chunks first.

Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Thai
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  belly pork -- cut 1/2" cubes
     1/2                chicken or duck -- cut bite sized
  4               cups  white raddish in quartered 1"-thick slices
                        (or use turnip in quartered 1"-thk slices)
  1                     Chinese cabbage -- cut moderate chunks
  1                     Western cabbage -- quartered, cored,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
  1                cup  leeks in 1" rings
  2               cups  celery in 1" pieces
  4               cups  kale -- stems crushed,
                        and very roughly chopped
  10            medium  Chinese mushrooms -- soaked in water,
                        and the stems discarded
  5                     cakes hard tofu -- quartered, and
                        the pieces cut in half diagonally
  3               cups  bean noodles -- soaked, and
                        cut into short lengths
     1/2           cup  chopped coriander/cilantro leaf
  6        tablespoons  soybean paste
  3        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Maggi sauce
  2        tablespoons  palm sugar
  8               cups  pork stock
                        Thai pepper powder -- to taste

Bring the stock to a boil and add the pork, poultry, fish sauce, soy sauce, and Maggi sauce.  Boil uncovered until the meats are just cooked.  Add the vegetables, tofu, and noodles. 

In a wok, heat some oil, and fry the soybean paste until fragrant.  Saute the garlic and ginger.  Add the soybean paste, garlic and ginger to the soup.  Taste, and adjust the fish sauce and pepper to suit your preference. 

Remove from the heat and serve when the vegetables are done. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This is sometimes called "Chinese" vegetable stew in Thailand, because the chosen vegetables are usually of Chinese origin.  You can make substitutions, and some recipes for this stew call for as many as 10 different vegetables.  You do need at least 4 to get the variety of tastes and textures required, but if the produce market yields more on the day, then you can indeed use more (keep the overall quantity about the same). 

Though called a vegetable stew, this is by no means a *vegetarian* dish.  It contains a substantial amount of meat.  The essential flavor of the dish comes from the belly pork.  If you prefer you can use a pound of belly pork and omit the poultry, but you shouldn't omit the pork altogether. 

This is a "one plate" meal -- a single dish forming the entire meal (as opposed to the more usual dining style in Thailand with several contrasting dishes).

            Thai Vegetables In Coconut Milk - {Phak Tom Kati}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Thai                            Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  coconut milk
     1/2           cup  garden peas -- (see below)
     1/2           cup  long beans (green beans) in 2" pieces
     1/2           cup  sliced mushrooms
  1                cup  shredded cabbage
  2        tablespoons  finely-sliced shallots/purple onions
  1         tablespoon  light soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar
  1         tablespoon  finely-sliced red birdseye chilis
  1         tablespoon  green peppercorns
  4                     fresh kaffir lime leaves - (to 5) -- shredded

In a saucepan bring the coconut milk to a gentle simmer and mix in the sugar and soy sauce, and stir in the lime leaves.  Add the shallots and pepper, and gently simmer for 1 to 2 minutes until aromatic.  Taste for the balance of sugar and salt, and adjust if necesary. 

Add the vegetables, and return to the boil.  Simmer gently until just cooked.  If using garden peas, do not add them until the other ingredients are almost cooked, and then serve as soon as they are warmed through. 

Serve with either rice or noodles. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  The name literally means "vegetables boiled in coconut milk".  Small Thai eggplants that resemble crunchy garden peas are used, however this may not be available.  As a replacement we suggest you use tender garden peas, raw.  If you can only get frozen peas, then drop them in hot, not boiling water, until defrosted, then transfer to ice water to stop the cooking and then strain thoroughly. 

There are plenty of vegetables you can experiement with to create this dish.  Tomato, bell peppers, broccoli, and others can easily be used depending on your taste.  Green peppercorns are sold in Thailand on the stem, making them easy to discard before serving, but we suggest that if you can only get loose peppercorns, that you put them in a small muslin bag or "spice ball".

     1/4         pound  dried 1/4"-wide gkuay dtiow or rice
                        noodles
                        (also known as ban pho to the Vietnamese)

     1/2           cup  garlic chives in 1 1/2"-long segments -- (optional)
                        === GARNISH ===
     1/2           cup  fresh bean sprouts - (to 1 cup)
  1                     lime -- cut into 6 wedges
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped roasted peanuts
                        A few cilantro sprigs
  2                     green onion stems -- cut 3" segments

Soak the dried rice noodles in tap water for about 40 minutes to 1 hour, or until the noodles are limp but still firm.  While the noodles are soaking, prepare the rest of the ingredients for the stir-fry. 

When ready to make your pad thai, drain the soaked noodles and heat a wok over high heat until it begins to smoke.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the wok surface.  Allow the oil to heat up.  When hot, toss in the chopped garlic and sliced shallots (or onion) and sautÈ 10 to 15 seconds.  Add the pork (if using), stir, cook a few seconds, then add the tofu.  SautÈ another 10 to 15 seconds and follow with the shrimps.  Stir.  Then add the dried shrimps, chopped sweetened-salted radish and hot pepper flakes.  Stir and mix well. 

Toss in the noodles and stir-fry with the ingredients already in the wok.  After one to two minutes, or when the noodles begin to change texture and soften, push the mass up along the side of the wok, add a teaspoon of oil to the cleared area and allow to heat up a few seconds.  Crack the eggs into the oiled area, using the edge of the spatula to break the yolks.  Allow the eggs to set, turning them over as needed until they are cooked.  Avoid scrambling.  When the eggs are set, cut with the spatula into small chunks and toss in with the noodles. 

Sprinkle fish sauce and sugar over the noodles.  Mix well, then add the vinegar and continue to stir-fry.  If the noodles feel dry and still too firm to your liking, sprinkle a tablespoon or two of water over them.  Add the chopped roasted peanuts, stir, then toss in the bean sprouts and chives.  Stir well and cook until the vegetables are partially wilted.  Taste and adjust flavors to the desired salty-sweet combination. 

Transfer noodles onto a serving platter, or dish onto individual dinner plates.  Serve with raw bean sprouts, lime wedges, extra chopped peanuts, cilantro and green onions.  Before eating, squeeze lime juice over each serving.  Serve while still warm. 

As a one-dish meal for breakfast or lunch, this recipe makes enough for 2 to 4 servings. 

Notes and Pointers: 

Pad Thai and noodle dishes do not lie at the heart of Thai cuisine -- they are fast food like hamburgers and hot dogs in the west.  Pad Thai, in fact, is not the Thai people's favorite noodled dish. 

You might be interested to know that there are as many ways to make pad thai noodles as there are cooks, geographical regions and moods.  Instead of vinegar and granulated sugar, for one instance, other sources of sour and sweet may be used, such as tamarind and palm sugar.  In Thailand many noodle shops and restaurants use light soy sauce instead of fish sauce; sweetened black soy sauce in combination with sugar; or usually ground dried chiles made from darkly roasted whole chiles.  American restaurants frequently use ketchup in their pad Thai. 

If you prefer softer noodles, soak dried noodles in hot water.  However, with some brands of noodles, this may result in soggy pad thai.  If you prefer your noodles al dente, it is preferable to soak in cool tap water, adding liquid to the stir-fry as needed to cook to the desired texture. 

The pad thai served in many American Thai restaurants is liberally flavored with ketchup.  Use this ingredient if you wish as some cookbooks advise, though it is the exception rather than the rule in Thailand.  Some noodle shops use black soy (the semi-sweet kind) in their pad thai; others use the orange chilli sauce called prik Sriracha.  Textures and oiliness can vary, too, so play around with the recipe to get the combination of flavors and textures you prefer.  Add your own touches to create your own version.

Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (abt 2 lbs or a little more)
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  Thai pepper powder
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
     1/4           cup  whiskey
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  coconut milk
  1         tablespoon  red curry paste
  2        tablespoons  Thai chili in oil
                        === FLAMBE ===
  1                cup  whiskey

Mix the marinade ingredients, then clean and prepare the chicken, and thoroughly coat with the marinade, and leave to stand in a wok for 12 hours. 

Remove the chicken from the wok, allowing to drain thoroughly, then over medium heat reduce the marinade to form a thick sauce. 

The chicken should be stood upright on an ovenproof plate (in Thailand a metal disk with a vertical peg attached is used.  Something similar is sold as a "chicken roaster" in America and Europe), and cooked in a medium oven until the skin just begins to change color. 

Remove the chicken and place it on a flame proof but table-ready plate and bring to the table.  Pour whiskey through the interior of the bird, and then ladle it over the outside so the bird is thoroughly coated, then ignite and allow the whiskey to burn itself out. 

Carve the chicken, and serve with Thai jasmine rice, and stir fried green vegetables, and the usual Thai table condiments and the reduced sauce. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  A complicated Thai dish not very common in restaurants, but unique flavor and certainly Thai in character. 

An explanation of volcano chicken:  When the chicken is placed vertically on the plate and ignited the flames coming from the open body cavity resemble the eruption of a volcano.  Hence the name.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fairly thick-cut steak
                        === MARINADE ===
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  tamarind sauce
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  chopped Thai chile peppers
                        === REMAINING INGREDIENTS ===
     1/3           cup  fish sauce
     1/3           cup  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots - (to 3 tbspns)
  2        tablespoons  chopped coriander/cilantro including
                        the roots if possible - (to 3 tbspns)
  2        tablespoons  chopped mint leaves - (to 3 tbspns)
  2        tablespoons  Khao Koor -- (see below)
  1         tablespoon  freshly-roasted/fried sesame seeds
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground dried red chilis -- (to 3 tspns)

Khao Koor:  Get a medium sized wok fairly hot, and add a couple of tablespoons of uncooked rice.  Keep in movement until the rice starts to turn golden brown.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool.  Grind to a fairly coarse powder in a spice mill, or a mortar and pestle, or a pepper mill or a good clean coffee grinder (all of these work well but keep in mind that a coffee grinder tends to grind too fine -- the powder should retain some "texture"). 

Mix the marinade, coat the steak with it and marinade it for at least 3 hours. 

The steak is then barbequed, broiled or grilled until on the rare side of medium-rare, cut into half-inch-thick strips and the strips cut into bite sized pieces.  The meat can be kept cool until just before you want to eat. 

In a wok, bring a little oil to medium-high heat and add the strips of beef, immediately followed by all the remaining ingredients.  Stir-fry until heated through (about a minute). 

Serve with Thai sticky rice, or as part of a meal with pad Thai and a soup such as tom yum koong (hot and sour shrimp soup). 

Enjoy.  This is one of our all-time favorites. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  In Thai language, "nua" means beef, "yang" means broiled (over a charcoal burner), and nam tok is a waterfall.  This dish is best cooked using a barbeque as per instructions above.  The name comes from the sound the juices dripping from the beef onto the open charcoal brazier make.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  In Thai language, &quot;nua&quot; means beef, &quot;yang&quot; means broiled (over a charcoal burner), and nam tok is a waterfall.  This dish is best cooked using a barbeque as per instructions above.  The name comes from the sound the juices dripping from the beef onto the open charcoal brazier make.
