  4             pieces  mahi mahi - (8 oz ea)
  2               cups  olive oil
     1/2           cup  honey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  rock shrimp or any raw shrimp - (to 2 lbs) -- peeled, deveined
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1              bunch  cilantro -- chopped
     1/2         pound  jalapeÒo cheese -- grated
  1           teaspoon  crushed red chilies

  16            sheets  fillo dough

Cut the sheets of dough in half.  Spoon shrimp mixture onto each piece, folding and sealing the ends.  Bake in the oven at 350 degrees until fillo is golden brown, approximately 10 to 20 minutes depending on your oven. 
Cut squares in half-quarters and serve at a cocktail party or leave larger portions for a meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIZZA DOUGH ===
  2               cups  cool water
     1/2    tablespoon  sugar
  2 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
  1             packet  yeast - (small)
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  1              ounce  olive oil
                        === PIZZA SAUCE ===
  3              small  white onions -- chopped
     1/2           cup  garlic -- chopped
  12                    tomatoes -- chopped and seeded
  2        tablespoons  salad oil
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1              quart  burgundy
  4        tablespoons  basil
  4        tablespoons  oregano
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For dough, combine all dry ingredients and mix on medium speed with a dough hook for 5 to 7 minutes.  Add olive oil and let mix until well-incorporated.  Let dough rest in bowl, covered, until it doubles in size.  Divide the dough in half and coat with olive oil.  Place dough in refrigerator and let sit for 18 to 24 hours for best flavor.  Note: Dough will be slightly sticky. 
For sauce, heat oil in a heavy-duty saucepan over medium heat.  Add onions and garlic and sautÈ until translucent.  Add tomatoes and half of the dried herbs and let cook for 3 or 4 minutes.  Then, add burgundy.  Let sauce simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.  Add a small amount of water if necessary, but generally the tomatoes will provide enough liquid to keep it simmering.  Puree the sauce lightly with a hand blender.  It should still be slightly chunky.  Correct seasonings with the rest of herbs, salt, black pepper and tomato paste.  Add balsamic vinegar. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

                        === SALAD ===
  6              large  sea scallops -- grilled
  6             ounces  baby lettuces - (to 8)
  2                     golden beets -- cut in eighths,
                        and roasted
  2                     red beets -- cut in eighths,
                        and roasted
  2             ounces  leeks -- julienned, fried
  1             ounces  canola oil -- for frying
  1             ounces  lemon basil vinaigrette -- (see below)
                        === GRILLED LEMON-BASIL VINAIGRETTE ===
  1           teaspoon  chopped shallots
  2           teaspoon  chopped ginger
  6                     lemons -- cut in half, grilled
  2        tablespoons  orange juice
     1/2           cup  rice wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  honey
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped basil

To make salad:  Peel and slice beets.  Place them in a small roasting pan and bake for 10 to 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  Wash baby lettuces and pat dry.  Cut leeks and fry quickly in a medium saucepan over medium heat; remove and place on a paper towel to blot. 
Arrange lettuces on a plate.  Tuck 3 scallops in the lettuce.  Alternate the two colors of beets around the plate.  Lightly drizzle the dressing over the lettuce and spoon some over each scallop.  Garnish the salad with crispy leeks. 
To make dressing:  Juice the lemons into a blender cup, being careful to strain for the seeds.  Add rice wine vinegar, shallots and ginger.  Blend together.  Add balsamic vinegar, honey and orange juice; season with salt and pepper.  Remove from blender and place in a bowl.  Add basil a few minutes before you are ready to serve the salad. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  4               ears  sweet fesh corn -- in the husk
  14            ounces  whole milk
  6                     russet potatoes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick spray
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
     1/4      teaspoon  salt - (to 1/2 tspn)
  6                     eggs
     1/2    tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1               dash  Tabasco
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped ham -- coarsely chopped
  1              small  onion -- diced
  1                cup  shredded cheddar cheese
  1                cup  chopped fresh spinach
  1              bunch  whole spinach leaves
  2              small  tomatoes

Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Line a 14-inch by 10-inch by 1-inch baking pan with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick vegetable spray or wipe lightly with vegetable oil. 
In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, milk, butter, salt, eggs, Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco.  Pour onto the foiled pan and sprinkle with ham and onions. 
Bake about 10 minutes.  Eggs should be barely set; shake the pan to test.  Remove from oven, sprinkle with cheese and chopped spinach.  Lift one of the small edges of the foil and begin to roll up the omelet very tightly, like a jelly roll, removing the foil as you go.  You'll end up with a great big rolled omelet, which you can then slice into rounds about 1-inch thick. 
Arrange whole spinach leaves on a plate, serve slices of the omlet on the spinach and top with diced tomatoes.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  baby scallops - (abt 8 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  3        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  half-and-half
  1 1/2           cups  asiago cheese
  2               cups  medium peeled, shelled and
                        deveined cooked shrimp
  1                can  chopped clams - (6 oz) -- well drained
  1         tablespoon  grated Parmesan cheese - (to 2 tbspns)
                        Oil -- for deep frying
     1/2       package  won ton skins - (12 oz pkg)

In a large skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter.  Add scallops and stir-fry over high heat until just cooked through; set aside in bowl. 
In same skillet, melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat.  Whisk in flour until smooth and bubbly.  Cook and stir 1 minute.  Whisk in half-and-half and continue whisking until mixture comes to a boil.  Boil 1 minute, whisking, until bubbly.  Turn off the heat.  Add asiago cheese, stirring until melted.  Stir in the scallops, shrimp and clams. 
Spoon into a 9-inch glass pie plate.  Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes, until the top is golden brown. 
Meanwhile, heat plenty of oil in a wok or deep fryer to 375 degrees.  Fry 3 or 4 won ton skins at a time, a few seconds on each side, until just golden.  Drain on paper towels.  Use won tons as chips for dipping into baked sea-food appetizer. 
If you don't feel inclined to fry the won ton skins to make chips, the seafood appetizer is also delicious served with tortilla or pita chips or crackers of your choice. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

In a large skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter.  Add scallops and stir-fry over high heat until just cooked through; set aside in bowl. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In same skillet, melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat.  Whisk in flour until smooth and bubbly.  Cook and stir 1 minute.  Whisk in half-and-half and continue whisking until mixture comes to a boil.  Boil 1 minute, whisking, until bubbly.  Turn off the heat.  Add asiago cheese, stirring until melted.  Stir in the scallops, shrimp and clams.

Spoon into a 9-inch glass pie plate.  Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes, until the top is golden brown. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, heat plenty of oil in a wok or deep fryer to 375 degrees.  Fry 3 or 4 won ton skins at a time, a few seconds on each side, until just golden.  Drain on paper towels.  Use won tons as chips for dipping into baked sea-food appetizer.

<DirT>
If you don&apos;t feel inclined to fry the won ton skins to make chips, the seafood appetizer is also delicious served with tortilla or pita chips or crackers of your choice.

  1              pound  flour
  4                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  water

     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1              pound  ricotta cheese
  1                     egg
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh basil
     1/2    tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
                        === LEMON BUTTER SAUCE ===
  2 1/2           cups  butter - (1 1/4 lbs)
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  saffron
                        (you may substitute turmeric)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Juice from 1/2 lemon
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2         pound  cooked shrimp

Place the flour in a mound on a clean, dry surface.  Form a well or hole in the center of the flour.  Beak eggs into the center of the flour and add the oil, water, and salt.  Use your hands to mix the ingredients together and slowly mix in the flour.  Knead until well mixed.  Cover with a clean towel, and let it rest for 30 minutes.

Filling the ravioli:  Brush each sheet of pasta with beaten egg.  Place 1 tablespoon mounds of shrimp/leek mixture 3 inches apart along 1 side of pasta.  Fold the pasta over to form pockets.  Gently press an indentation into the dough between the mounds of shrimp/leek mixture.  Cut the ravoili into pieces along these lines.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Evaluating fresh fish is easy once you
                        have learned the basic methods for
                        determining its quality.

1.  Flesh -- The flesh should be firm and elastic to the touch, and should not be separating from the bone.  Fillets should have a fresh cut appearance and the color should resemble freshly dressed fish. 
2.  Appearance -- Fresh fillets, steaks, chunks, cuts, etc. should look moist, firm, and practically free of any brownish streaks throughout the meat.  If, when you press your finger into the flesh, there is an indentation that fills with liquid, or if there is excessive liquid in the package, the fish has probably been frozen and thawed. 
3. Eyes -- If present, the eyes should be bright, clear, transparent, full, and protruding.  As fresh fish ages, the eyes will become cloudy and sunken and often turn pink. 
4. Gills -- If present, the gills should be bright red and free of slime.  As the fish begins to deteriorate, the gills change color, fading to a pink, then gray.  Eventually they will become brownish and greenish. 
5. Skin -- The skin should be vibrant and bright.  Any skin markings (color, spots, stripes) should be distinct.

1.  Flesh -- The flesh should be firm and elastic to the touch, and should not be separating from the bone.  Fillets should have a fresh cut appearance and the color should resemble freshly dressed fish. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
2.  Appearance -- Fresh fillets, steaks, chunks, cuts, etc. should look moist, firm, and practically free of any brownish streaks throughout the meat.  If, when you press your finger into the flesh, there is an indentation that fills with liquid, or if there is excessive liquid in the package, the fish has probably been frozen and thawed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless sea bass fillets - (8 oz
                        ea)
  1                cup  Asian panko crumb or flake
     1/4           cup  blackened fish seasoning

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Brush both sides of fish with melted butter and place in a shallow baking dish.  Arrange so that fillets are not touching. 
In a mixing bowl place blackening seasoning, crumbs, and melted butter.  Mix well to evenly distribute butter.  Spread crust evenly over the tops of the fillets and press lightly. 
Place just enough water in the pan to cover the bottom, do not place too much so that the topping  on the fish is affected.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until fish is no longer transparent. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

NOTES : Chef's Tip - When grilling fish, the secret is in a well-cleaned and oiled grill.  To oil the grill take on old towel and fold it into a fan.  Grasp one side of the fan with a pair of tongs (preferably long ones).  Dip the other end of the fan into a shallow dish with vegetable oil and lightly saturate.  Now, still using the tongs, quickly brush the grill bars from back to front.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     halibut fillets - (8 oz ea)
  6             slices  bacon
     1/2           cup  Asian panko crumbs or flakes -- see * Note
  3        tablespoons  melted margarine or butter
                        Seasoned salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Panko is a type of light breading or coating that can be found in most Asian markets. 
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Cook the bacon, then chop or crumble and set aside. 
Brush both sides of fish with melted butter and place in a shallow baking dish.  Arrange so that fillets are not touching.  Sprinkle lightly with seasoned salt and pepper. 
In a mixing bowl place bacon pieces, crumbs, and melted butter.  Mix well to evenly distribute butter.  Spread crust evenly over the tops of the fillets and press lightly. 
Place just enough water in the pan to cover the bottom, do not place too much so that the topping on the fish is affected.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until fish is no longer transparent. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced smoked salmon
  4                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  vinegar
  2                     English muffins -- halved
                        Butter to lightly coat muffins
                        === SAUCE ===
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  lime juice
  1           teaspoon  white vinegar
  3                     egg yolks -- room temperature

                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lobster                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lobster - (or more)

Using a chef's knife or kitchen scissors -- cut lengthwise down the middle through the top of the lobster shell.  Pinch the tail together and crack the last shell section free from the meat. 
Lay the shell open so the meat is exposed -- and pull the meat from the very end of the tail.  Lightly score the underside crosswise.  Each cut should be about 1 inch apart. 
Return the shell to the closed position and lay the meat on top of the shell.  Spread the tail and break the tail muscle with your thumb to keep the tail from curling when the lobster is cooked.  Score the top of the lobster meat lengthwise down each side and the center if needed. 
For a special treat -- brush the lobster meat with melted butter and sprinkle with your favorite seafood seasoning before cooking. 
To broil:  Place lobster in a shallow pan with enough water to cover the tail, so it does not burn while cooking.  Broil until the lobster meat is opaque and firm to the touch. 
This recipe yields 1 (or more) servings.

NOTES : Chef's Tip - For a less sweet wine cooler, substitute soda for sprite and leave out the sugar.  For a more fruity taste and feel, smush up a few slices of fruit in the bottom of the glass before adding the ice.  For an original wine cooler, experiment with fruit flavors you like together; mango, papaya, raspberry, cherry, blackberry, pear, peach, etc.  I do not recommend banana or coconut.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BLACKENING FISH ===
  4                     catfish fillets
     1/4           cup  melted butter
     1/4           cup  Red Lobster's Cajun Seasoning -- (see recipe)
                        === BAY SHRIMP SAUCE ===
  1                cup  heavy whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  shallots in 1/8" dice
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  white wine
  2        tablespoons  Red Lobster's Cajun Seasoning
  2        tablespoons  fresh chopped parsley
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  6             ounces  bay shrimp -- cooked

To make Bay Shrimp Sauce:  SautÈ shallots in vegetable oil until translucent.  Add white wine and simmer until reduced by two thirds.  Add heavy cream and simmer until reduced by one third.  Add seasoning, parsley and sour cream and simmer 1 minute.  Stir in Bay Shrimp and keep hot until serving. 
To make Louisiana Lacy's Catfish:  Preheat a cast-iron skillet (the hotter, the better).  Dip or brush catfish fillets with melted butter.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of seasoning evenly on each side of fish.  Cook over high heat until a dark brown (almost black) crust is formed.  Turn over and cook other side. 
Place fish on plate and top with Bay Shrimp Sauce. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
WARNING:  BLACKENING MAY CREATE LARGE AMOUNTS OF SMOKE.  WE RECOMMEND THAT THIS METHOD OF COOKING IS DONE ONLY OUTDOORS!!

Categories    : Crab                            Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              dozen  large male blue crabs -- see * Note
  1                can  your favorite beer
     1/4           cup  sliced onion
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2           cup  white vinegar
  8        tablespoons  Old Bay Seasoning
                        Cocktail Sauce

* Note:  We suggest using male blue crab.  Although they are more costly, they are cleaner and more meaty than the female. 
Use a large stock pot with a steamer tray (if no steamer tray you can elevate a large plate or platter on top of several cups or juice glasses).  Just be sure the plate, which will hold the crabs, is above the liquid. 
Place beer, onion, garlic, bay leaves, vinegar and 2 tablespoons Old Bay Seasoning in the stock pot.  Bring to a boil.  Remove from heat.  Place crabs, belly-side down, in the steamer tray (or on the plate).  Sprinkle with remaining Old Bay Seasoning.  Cover and steam on high heat 15 minutes.  Remove from  pot and serve with extra Old Bay Seasoning and Cocktail Sauce. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  lukewarm water
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1            package  active dry yeast
     3/4           cup  lukewarm milk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  2 1/2           cups  bread flour
                        Stone-ground yellow cornmeal

In an 8 ounce measuring cup, stir together first 3 ingredients and let mixture stand until it bubbles to top of cup.  Dissolve baking soda in 1/2 tablespoons warm water. 
In medium bowl, combine warm milk, salt and soda-water mixture with 1 cup flour, beating with wire whisk until smooth.  Beat in yeast mixture and then remaining flour, switching to a sturdy spoon.  Batter should be thick and sticky but smooth, with all flour thoroughly dissolved. 
Put dough in 2 small pie pans that have been sprayed with non-stick spray and dusted with cornmeal.  Cover with wax paper or plastic wrap that has also been sprayed.  Let rise about an hour. 
Remove plastic wrap and discard.  Spray tops of buns with non-stick spray and bake on center rack at 375 degrees about 20 minutes or until golden brown. 
As rolls cool in containers on rack for 20 minutes, spray tops with more non-stick spray to keep crust soft.  Let cool 1 hour before slicing and filling with sandwich meats and cheeses. 
This recipe yields 2 rolls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  short-grain rice, such as
                        Cal Rose or Arborio rice
  4               cups  water
  9 1/2           cups  milk
  3               cups  cream
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
  4                     vanilla beans -- cut in half
                        lengthwise and seeds scraped from pod
                        (use both pod and seeds)
                        Fresh berries such as blueberries,
                        blackberries, raspberries and
                        strawberries, for garnish - (optional)
     3/4           cup  shelled pistachios -- for garnish,
                        (optional)

In a large pot, soak rice in water for 1/2 hour.  Simmer, uncovered, until water is absorbed.  Allow rice to sit off heat until the consistency of thick paste. 
Add milk, cream, sugar and vanilla; stir to combine.  Cook on medium heat until the consistency of creme anglaise (medium-thick custard sauce).  Cover with plastic wrap while still warm to prevent a skin from forming on top.  Refrigerate overnight. 
Presentation:  Zov likes to serve this pudding in a large glass bowl garnished with fresh berries and pistachios. 
This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  cracked green Greek olives
  1                     serrano chili -- seeds and veins
                        removed, minced
  1              bunch  cilantro -- chopped
  1              large  ripe tomato -- diced
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/8      teaspoon  Aleppo pepper -- (see * Note 1)
  1         tablespoon  pomegranate molasses -- (see * Note 2)
                        Toasted pita chips -- for serving
                        Lemon slices cut in half -- for garnish

* Note 1:  Aleppo pepper is a coarse powder made from Aleppo chilies grown throughout the Eastern Mediterranean.  They have an earthy, full-flavored taste.  Aleppo pepper is sold in Middle Eastern markets, but according to Zov Karamardian, if you can't find it, you can substitute a mixture of equal parts of ground cayenne and dried red chili flakes. 
* Note 2:  Pomegranate molasses is sold at Middle Eastern markets. 
Combine all ingredients except lemon garnish and pita chips in a large non-aluminum bowl.  Either serve immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. 
To make pita chips, cut pita bread in half horizontally, then cut each half into 6 triangles.  Bake on a baking sheet in a single layer in a 350 degree oven until crisp.  Or fry in olive oil until crisp and drain thoroughly on paper towels. 
Presentation:  Serve salad chilled or at room temperature.  Garnish with lemon slices and accompany with pita chips. 
This recipe yields 14 servings.

                      Zov's Olive Salad With Tahini

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Salads/Dressings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALAD ===
  4               cups  green olives -- halved and pitted
  2              large  tomatoes -- halved, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped toasted walnuts
  1              bunch  cilantro -- chopped
  1              bunch  parsley -- chopped
  1              bunch  green onions -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     jalapeÒo -- finely minced
                        Juice of 1 lemon
                        === TAHINI DRESSING ===
  1                cup  tahini
     1/2         bunch  parsley -- coarsely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
     1/2           cup  lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine all salad ingredients in a large bowl. 
To make the dressing:  Combine the tahini, parsley and garlic in a food processor; process until the parsley is almost pureed.  With the motor running, add the lemon juice and enough water ( 1/2 cup or more) to bring the mixture to the consistency of creamy salad dressing.  Season with salt and pepper. 
Add the tahini dressing to the salad (you may not need all of it).  Toss well.  Taste and adjust seasoning. 
Serve as an appetizer with pita bread.  The salad is best right after it's dressed, although you may assemble the salad components and the dressing ahead of time.  You may also halve the recipe, if desired. 
This recipe yields about 7 cups.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     skinless salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Zov's Warm Spice Mixture -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     ripe tomatoes -- diced
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro or basil
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2         large  red onion -- peeled, diced fine

Rinse salmon in cold water and pat dry.  Rub with generous amount of Zov's Warm Spice Mixture on both sides and season with salt and pepper. 
In a medium bowl, combine tomatoes and cilantro; set aside. 
Heat nonstick grill pan on high heat until very hot.  Sear salmon, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.  If salmon needs additional cooking, place in a 350 degree oven until just cooked through.

In a medium skillet, make Charmoula Sauce by heating 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium-high heat.  Add garlic and onion and cook, shaking handle of skillet to toss ingredients, until onion softens, about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in tomato mixture.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Presentation:  Place salmon on serving platter.  Top with the Charmoula Sauce and serve.

  2              large  leeks, white and light green part -- halved lengthwise,
                        then thinly sliced
  12             large  mushrooms -- quartered
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced or chopped
  4                     ripe tomatoes -- diced
  2                     yellow bell peppers -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into 1" chunks

                        into 1 1/2" chunks
  7             medium  red new potatoes -- quartered
  6             ounces  tomato paste
  1                cup  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  minced fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley
  4        tablespoons  minced fresh basil
  2              boxes  couscous - (12 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  hot water -- almost simmering,
                        but not boiling

Bring a pot of water to a boil; add asparagus and cook until just barely tender.  Drain and refresh with cold water.  Drain again; set aside. 
Bring pot of water to a boil; add haricots verts and boil until cooked tender-crisp.  Drain and refresh with cold water.  Drain again; set aside. 
In a large Dutch oven or pot, add oil.  Heat on high heat until very hot, but not smoking.  Add onion, celery, 2 thinly sliced carrots, and leeks.  Cook on medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until onions are translucent and celery is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. 
Add mushrooms and garlic; cook 1 minute.  Stir in tomatoes, bell peppers, 4 carrots, eggplant and potatoes.  Add tomato paste, 1 cup water, salt and pepper.  Stir to combine.  Bring to boil; lower heat and simmer, covered, until all vegetables are very tender and sauce thickens, about 30 to 40 minutes.  Should have a stew-like consistency. 
Stir in parsley and basil.  Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.  Place couscous in a large bowl.  Pour 1/2 cup water over top.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Toss. 
Presentation:  Place couscous on large serving platter.  Top with vegetable tagine mixture.  Allow to sit 10 minutes before serving, so that the couscous can absorb some of the liquid.  If you have excess juices, serve them in a sauce boat on the side.  Garnish with reserved asparagus and haricots verts. 
This recipe yields 12 servings.

                         Zuni Cafe's Caesar Salad

Recipe By     :Zuni Cafe
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     salt-packed anchovies -- filleted, rinsed,
                        dried, and chopped
     1/2    tablespoon  minced garlic - (generous)
     1/2    tablespoon  red wine vinegar - (scant)
  1              pinch  sea salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4         pound  chewy rustic French or Italian bread -- cut into 3/4" cubes
                        Juice of 1 lemon - (abt 2 tbspns) -- or to taste
  2             ounces  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        cheese
  2                     eggs -- well beaten
  2                     romaine lettuce hearts -- cored, leaves left
                        whole, chilled

Combine half of the anchovies and garlic in a bowl.  Add all of the vinegar, salt, pepper to taste, and the 1/3 cup olive oil.  Let stand for 20 minutes. 
Toss the bread cubes with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt.  Spread on a cookie sheet and toast in a 300 degree oven until golden, about 10 minutes. 
At serving time, add the remaining anchovies and garlic, the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of the cheese to the dressing base.  Whisk in the eggs to form an emulsion. 
Thoroughly toss the lettuce leaves with the dressing, being careful not to bruise them.  Taste for salt and add, if necessary. 
Divide the salad among chilled serving plates.  Add the croutons, dust with more freshly-ground pepper and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
PER SERVING:  385 calories;  13 g protein;  17 g carbohydrate;  30 g fat (7 g saturated);  119 mg cholesterol;  538 mg sodium;  1 g fiber. 
Comments:  Caesar is one of the trickiest salads.  The dressing is a balancing act, and despite anchovies and grated cheese, a little salt usually is needed to unite the flavors.  This is a first-rate rendition of this salad, which was created in a restaurant in Tijuana and passionately adopted by San Franciscans.
