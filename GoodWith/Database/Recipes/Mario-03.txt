--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  flour

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     skewers -- soaked in
                        water for 8 hours
  8                     quail, boneless
  4             pieces  pancetta -- cut 1" cubes
  2             ounces  balsamic vinegar
  2             ounces  virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1             medium  red onion -- cut 1/4" dice
  4               cups  water
  10                    sage leaves -- chopped
  1                cup  polenta
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Asiago cheese

Check quail for bones or feathers and place in mixing bowl.  Add pancetta, vinegar, olive oil, honey and black pepper and toss to coat.  Set aside and preheat grill.

In a 3-quart saucepan, place onion, water and sage and bring to a boil.

Thread one quail, followed by one piece of pancetta, followed by one quail on each of four skewers and place on hottest part of grill.  Cook 4 to 5 minutes on each side, until just pink at the leg bones.

Meanwhile, pour polenta slowly in a thin stream into boiling water, until all is incorporated and polenta thickens, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Switch to a wooden spoon, add Asiago and cook another minute, until as thick as paste.  Remove from heat and pour on to a service-ready cutting board.  Pile skewers on top of polenta and serve.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  polenta
                        = (finely ground or quick cooking)
  8                     anchovies, salt packed
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  capers -- rinsed, drained
                        Olive oil -- for frying
     1/2           cup  flour -- on a plate
  3                     eggs -- beaten in bowl

Brush a large cookie sheet with vegetable oil and set aside.

In a medium saucepan, heat water to boil and add salt.  Whisking vigorously, pour in polenta slowly in a thin stream and then cook until quite thick, about 1 minute, switching to a wooden stick to stir as the polenta thickens.

Pour polenta out on to cookie sheet and spread out flat until it covers the sheet, about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick.  Allow to cool 1 hour.

Rinse anchovies and remove heads, fins and bones.  In a small saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat with garlic and cook until just light brown.  Add anchovies and capers and stir until broken up into paste.  Remove from heat and set aside.

Pour 3 inches of oil into a 6-inch tall frying pan and heat to 360 degrees.  While oil is heating, cut polenta into 2-inch rounds using a grappa glass or cookie cutters, yielding about 40 pieces.

Place 1/4 teaspoon anchovy mixture on one polenta disk and make a sandwich by covering with a second polenta disk.  Dredge each sandwich in flour, then in egg and fry until golden-brown, about 3 minutes.  Continue until all the sandwiches are finished and serve hot.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  flour
  1                cup  semolina flour
  2                     eggs
     1/4           cup  dry red wine
  1             recipe  Lumache Alla Marchigiana -- (see recipe)

To Prepare Pasta:  Make a well of the flour putting the eggs and wine in the center.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and wine and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any leftover crusty bits.  Discard these bits.

Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Roll out pasta to thinnest setting on pasta machine.  Cut pasta into 1/4-inch thick noodles by hand or with machine, and set aside under a moist towel.

Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Heat snail recipe (Lumache Alla Marchigiana) to boil and set aside.

Drop pasta into water and cook until just tender.  Drain pasta and put into pan with snails, tossing well to coat.  Serve immediately in a warm serving dish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  ripe yet firm tomatoes
  1              pound  Ditalini Rigati pasta
  4        tablespoons  freshly-chopped mint leaves

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             quarts  water
  2        tablespoons  salt
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  6                     mint leaves
     1/2    tablespoon  crushed red pepper
  1 1/4         pounds  cauliflower head
  1              pound  rigatoni pasta
                        = (preferably Italian)
     1/2           cup  grated Pecorino cheese
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  finely chopped Italian parsley

Bring water to boil in a large spaghetti pot and add salt.

In a 14- to 18-inch saute pan, heat oil until just smoking and add onion, mint and red pepper.  Cook until soft, about 5 to 6 minutes.

Cut the core into 1/4-inch coins and throw all the pieces into the saute pan with the onions.  Lower the heat to medium and cook, stirring regularly for about 12 to 15 minutes, until cauliflower is softened and light brown but not mushy.

Cook the rigatoni according to package instructions until al dente, about 8 to 12 minutes, and drain in colander.  Toss hot pasta into pan with cauliflower and add grated cheese, black pepper and parsley.  Toss to coat and serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     shallots -- finely chopped
  2                     celery ribs -- finely chopped
  2             ounces  prosciutto di San Daniele -- chopped 1/8" dice
  1 1/2           cups  risotto
                        = (Vialone Nano brand)
  3             quarts  strained chicken stock -- warm
  2             pounds  fresh peas -- shelled to
                        yield 1 1/2 cups
  4        tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Place olive oil, shallots, celery and prosciutto in a 12- to 14-inch deep-sided frying pan and place over medium heat.  Cook until soft but not brown, 8 to 10 minutes.

Add rice and stir over medium heat for 2 minutes, until rice becomes almost opaque.  Add chicken stock to cover rice, turn heat up to high.  As level of stock dips below level of rice, continue to add stock, one ladle at a time, to keep rice covered.  Stir the rice constantly during this procedure.

Taste the rice after 15 minutes; it should still be hard.  Add peas and continue cooking, until rice is soft and creamy, yet still al dente.  Rice should still be quite wet, but not swimming.  Remove from heat and stir in butter and cheese.  Adjust for seasoning and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        and drained
  1                cup  fresh ricotta

                            Roasted Beet Pasta

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Roasted Beets -- (see recipe)
  4               cups  all-purpose unbleached flour
  3                     jumbo eggs

Pulse the Roasted Beets cubes in a food processor until smooth.

Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, beet puree and any other flavoring you choose.

Using a fork, beat together the eggs, puree and flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.  As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands primarily.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any left-over crusty bits.

Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Caution:  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are essential for a light pasta.  Roll out to four 7-inch by 16-inch sheets.

This recipe yields 1 pound of pasta.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     garlic clove -- whole
  4                     Italian frying peppers (banana shaped) -- whole
  2                     sweet red bell peppers -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut 1/2" strips
  2                     sweet yellow peppers -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut 1/2" strips
  2              large  jalapeÒo peppers -- cored, seeded,
                        and julienned
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh marjoram leaves
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a 10-inch to 12-inch saute pan over a medium-high flame, heat virgin olive oil until smoking.  Add onion and garlic clove until softened (about 4 to 5 minutes).  Add all the peppers and, shaking regularly, cook until quite soft yet still retaining individual texture (about 10 to 12 minutes).  Remove from heat to large mixing bowl and allow to cool.

In a small mixing bowl, combine balsamic vinegar, marjoram and extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Pour this blend over cooled pepper mixture and toss gently with hands, being careful not to break up the peppers.  Set aside for later use or serve as antipasto.

This recipe yields 4 servings as antipasto

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pound  veal loin -- cut into 4 pieces,
                        of 1/2" thickness
  4        tablespoons  virgin olive oil
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2         pound  fresh mozzarella -- cut into 8 rounds
                        of 2" thickness
  1                cup  stemmed fresh oregano leaves

In a shallow bowl, mix flour with salt and freshly-ground black pepper.  Dredge veal pieces in flour mixture and set aside.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  milk
  1                cup  cream
                        Juice and zest of 1 small blood orange
  1 1/2           cups  powdered sugar
  5                     extra-large eggs -- separated
  2        tablespoons  powdered cocoa

Bring milk and cream to boil in a 12-inch to 14-inch saute pan.  Add blood orange zest and 1/4 cup sugar.  Stir through and lower heat to medium-simmer.

Meanwhile, whisk whites to form soft peaks.  Add 1/4 cup sugar and blood orange juice and whisk to stiff peaks.

Scoop 1 large tablespoon of egg white mixture and place on to simmering milk.  Place 3 or 4 at a time on to milk and cook for 2 minutes per side, flipping carefully with a large kitchen spoon.  Remove each sciumetta and place in a shallow bowl.  DO NOT BOIL MILK.

In a heavy-bottomed enamel covered saucepan, whisk egg yolks with remaining sugar until pale ribbon stage.  Add warm poaching milk to yolk mixture and cook carefully over low heat to thicken CAREFULLY.  When as thick as heavy cream, remove to bowl over ice bath and whisk until cool.  Pour cooked custard into bowl and top with sciumette.  Dust with cocoa and serve.

         Sfincioni With Broccoli, Ricotta And Oven-Dried Tomatoes

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        recipe  Basic Bread Dough -- (see recipe)
  6        tablespoons  virgin olive oil -- divided
  1              pound  broccoli -- broken 1" florets,
                        and stems sliced 1/4" thick
                        Freshly-grated nutmeg -- to taste
  1              pound  fresh ricotta
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs
                        Sea salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat oven and baking tile to 450 degrees.

Split dough into 2 pieces, one slightly larger than the other, and roll out into 2 rounds about 12 inches in diameter, again one slightly larger than the other.  Place larger sheet on paddle and spread with coarse sea salt.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add broccoli and cook until softened and light brown, stirring constantly, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Allow to cool and season with several gratings of fresh nutmeg.

Smear the large sheet with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with half the bread crumbs.  Spread ricotta over the sheet and smear within 1-inch of the edge.  Place broccoli pieces on top of ricotta and sprinkle with remaining olive oil and then bread crumbs.

Place smaller piece of dough on top and roll edges of bottom and top together to seal.  Brush top with water and then oil and slide onto tile in oven and bake 20 to 25 minutes until golden-brown.  Remove from oven and let rest 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I recommend buying a prepared tile baking stone for all pizza and bread working at home.  They are available at gourmet shops and specialty chef supply stores.

Mr Mad's note:  The only mention of oven-dried tomatoes is in the title on this recipe.

  1                cup  quick-cooking polenta
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  2             pounds  Italian sausage -- cut 1" pieces

     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley

Bring 3 quarts water to boil with 1/2 onion, 1/2 carrot and 1 bay leaf.  Prepare ice bath.  Plunge each lobster into boiling water and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove and submerge in ice water 1 minute.  Drain and set aside.  Keep cooking liquid warm on stove.

In a 12- to 14-inch frying pan with 3-inch sides, heat olive oil and onion and tomato paste over medium heat until softened but not brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add rice and, stirring constantly, cook until opaque, about 2 minutes.  Add white wine, then lobster cooking liquid ladle by ladle until rice is covered.  Turn heat to high and, stirring constantly, continue to cook, maintaining the level of liquid just above the level of rice, for 15 minutes.

Remove lobster from its shell, chop the meat into 1-inch pieces and toss into rice.  Continue cooking until rice is soft but still al dente.  Season with salt and pepper, remove from heat and stir in butter and parsley.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Pastry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             sticks  cold butter -- divided
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3 1/2           cups  flour -- divided
     1/2           cup  ice water

In a food processor, place 1 stick of butter, 1 teaspoon salt, and 2 1/2 cups flour and blend until texture of breadcrumbs.  Slowly add ice water until dough comes together.  Remove and form into a ball, then flatten it into a 8- by 10-inch rectangle and place in refrigerator.  This is called the pasta mixture.

In a food processor, place 3 remaining sticks of butter and 1 cup four until blended and scrape out on to a board.  Working quickly, form this mixture in a 4-inch square and place in refrigerator.  This is called the burro mixture.

After 1/2 hour, when the two mixtures are similar in texture, place pasta mixture on a well-floured clean marble surface.  Place burro mixture in center and fold the pasta mixture over it, like wrapping a gift.  Flatten with a rolling pin and roll out to a 8- by 16-inch rectangle, flouring regularly.  If butter comes to surface, flour the spot heavily and continue working.  Fold bottom third up and top third down to form a small package and turn one quarter clockwise.  Pat dough with rolling pin to adhere and roll out to large 8-inch by 16-inch rectangle again.

Repeat folding process and refrigerate 30 minutes, covered in a moist cloth.  Remove and repeat the rolling-and-folding process 3 times.  Allow 30 minutes refrigeration between each maneuver.  The dough is now ready and will keep in the refrigerator 10 days, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap.

This recipe yields enough dough for 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20                    fresh sardines - (abt 1 1/2 to 2 lbs) -- scaled
     3/8           cup  extra virgin olive oil -- divided
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2                     anchovy fillets
  1                cup  bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  currants
  2        tablespoons  sliced almonds
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped flat-leaf Italian parsley
                        Zest and juice of 2 oranges
  1                     red onion -- thinly sliced
  2                     red bell peppers -- seeded, sliced thin
  1                     green bell pepper -- seeded, sliced thin
  4        tablespoons  red wine vinegar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2                     lemons -- sliced in 10 slices

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Clean the sardines, leaving head on.  Using your thumbnail, remove the spine from head to tail, careful to leave head and tail intact.  Rinse to remove small bones and set aside.

In a 12-inch to 14-inch saute pan, heat 1/4 cup oil, garlic and anchovies over medium-high heat until garlic starts to lightly brown.  Add bread crumbs and toast until golden, stirring constantly, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove and pour into large mixing bowl.  Add currants, almonds, parsley, zest and half of orange juice.  Mix well and set aside.

Lay sardines on backs, open like books and place a heaping tablespoon of stuffing in each one and pinch closed.  Finish all sardines and set in refrigerator for 20 minutes.

In a 12-inch to 14-inch saute pan, heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat, add red onion and red and green peppers and saute until just softened, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Add remaining orange juice, vinegar and sugar, stir through and remove from heat.

Pour into 12- to 14-inch oven-proof casserole.  Arrange lemon slices around perimeter of pan, on top of peppers and place 2 sardines on each slice quite close together.  Place in oven and bake 25 minutes uncovered.  Serve hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  skinless tuna fillet -- cut 8 thin steaks
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves -- divided
  8                     salt-packed anchovies -- filleted, and
                        soaked 1 hour in water
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh fennel fronds
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- chopped 1/4" dice
  2             medium  carrots -- chopped 1/4" dice
  2                     celery ribs -- chopped 1/4" dice
  3                     bay leaves

     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian parsley

Lay the tuna pieces out on a cutting board.  Place one anchovy fillet, a pinch of fresh thyme and a fennel frond on each one and roll up to form an involtino.  Secure each with two toothpicks.

Heat oil in a 12- to 14-inch pan over medium-high heat until smoking.  Cook the involtini two to three at a time until lightly browned and remove to a plate.

Add onions, carrots, celery and bay leaves to pan and cook until softened, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add Basic Tomato Sauce, vinegar and wine and bring to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer 30 minutes until thick as porridge.

Put tuna into sauce and simmer covered for 5 to 6 minutes, just to warm through.  Remove toothpicks from involtini, add parsley and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     T-bone steak at least 3" thick
                        and about 3 to 3 1/2 lbs
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh sage leaves
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  pure olive oil
     1/4           cup  virgin olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  4             pounds  spinach -- washed, spun dry,
                        and stems removed
                        Juice of 1 lemon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             ounces  Da Vero extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat barbecue to medium-high heat.  Pat steak dry.

In a small bowl, mix rosemary, sage, thyme, pepper and salt until well blended.  Coat entire steak with spice mix.  Brush with pure olive oil.  Place on grill and char well.  Cook about 12 minutes on first side, flip, and cook about 9 minutes on second side.  This is traditionally served very rare.

Meanwhile, in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat virgin olive oil until smoking.  Add garlic and cook until light brown.  Add spinach and stir quickly, cooking until just wilted.  Remove from heat, add lemon juice and salt and pepper and set aside.

When steak is done, remove and let stand 5 minutes.  Carve off fillet and strip steaks and slice.  Divide steak among 4 plates, divide spinach and drizzle each plate with Da Vero oil.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- for work surface
  8                     jumbo egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt

Use standard well technique, placing yolks only in initial well.

Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil and any other flavoring you choose.

Using a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.  As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands primarily.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits.

Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are essential for a light pasta.
