            Asparagus, Gruyere, And Tarragon Souffleed Omelet

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Omelets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  asparagus -- trimmed
  1             medium  red onion -- sliced thin
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1              pinch  sugar
     2/3           cup  coarsely-grated Gruyere
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh tarragon leaves -- or to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              large  eggs -- separated
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a 10-inch non-stick skillet simmer the asparagus in water to cover for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it is just tender.  Drain the asparagus, rinse under cold water, and pat dry with paper towels.  Cut the asparagus crosswise into 1/4-inch pieces and transfer the pieces to a bowl.

In the skillet cook the onion with salt and pepper to taste in 1/2 tablespoon of the butter over moderate heat, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes.  Add the sugar, cook the mixture, stirring, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the onion is golden, and transfer the mixture to the bowl.  Stir in the Gruyere, the tarragon, and salt and pepper, to taste.

In the skillet, cleaned, heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter over moderate heat until it is melted, tilt the skillet to coat it, and remove it from the heat.

In a bowl whisk the egg yolks with the flour and salt and pepper, to taste, until the mixture is thick and lemon-colored.  In another bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they just hold stiff peaks, fold them into the yolk mixture gently but thoroughly, and pour the egg mixture into the skillet, spreading it evenly.  (If the skillet handle is plastic, wrap it in a double thickness of foil.)

Bake the omelet in the middle of the oven for 7 minutes, or until it is puffed and almost cooked through, spoon the filling down the middle of it, and with a spatula fold the omelet in half to enclose the filling.  Bake the omelet in the middle of the oven for 1 minute more, or until the cheese is melted and the omelet is cooked through.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     sheets phyllo dough -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  4        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  4        tablespoons  chopped toasted pecans
  1                     medium-ripe banana -- quartered lengthwise
  1         tablespoon  honey
                        Whipped creme fraiche -- for serving

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Brush 1 phyllo sheet with some of the melted butter.  Sift 2 tablespoons of the confectioners' sugar evenly on top.  Sprinkle evenly with 2 tablespoons of the nuts.  Cut the phyllo sheet in half lengthwise.  Place 1/4 of the banana along a short edge of each phyllo half.  Starting with the short end, tightly roll up the banana in the phyllo.  When you get almost to the end, dab a little bit of honey along the edge to help seal the package.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Just before baking, brush the tops of the strudels with more of the melted butter and place them seam-side down on a baking sheet (preferably lined with parchment paper or a nonstick liner).  Bake until the strudels are golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped green bell pepper
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1 2/3           cups  cooked black beans
     2/3           cup  fine dry bread crumbs
     1/3           cup  fresh cilantro leaves -- chopped fine
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              large  eggs -- beaten lightly
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        === SPICY CILANTRO SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
     1/2                jalapeÒo chile -- minced

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the butter in a small skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened.  In a bowl, mash 1/3 of the beans with a fork and stir in the remaining beans, onion mixture, bread crumbs, and cilantro and season with salt and pepper.  Stir in the eggs.

Form bean mixture into 8 (4-inch) patties (mixture will be wet and soft).  Gently dredge patties in cornmeal and transfer to a large plate lined with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate the cakes for 30 minutes and up to 12 hours.

Pour enough oil into a heavy skillet to reach 1/4-inch up the side.  Heat the oil over medium heat until hot but not smoking.  Working in batches, cook the patties, turning once, until well browned, about 1 1/2 minutes per side.  Transfer the cakes to paper towels to drain.

Divide the cakes among plates and serve with the Spicy Cilantro Sauce.

Spicy Cilantro Sauce:  Stir together cilantro, vegetable oil, soy sauce, garlic, lime juice, and chile.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Makes about 1 cup)

  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter -- plus
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  minced shallot
  4                     skin-on black sea bass fillets - -- (6 oz ea)
                        = (snapper or sole may also be used)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  24                    mussels -- washed, de-bearded
     3/4           cup  dry white vermouth
     1/2           cup  water
  1              sprig  fresh tarragon -- leaves picked and
                        chopped
  1           teaspoon  finely-sliced fresh chives
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh dill

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil and season generously with salt.  Add the fava beans and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beans to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking.  Peel off the black eyelets from the bean's shells.  Squeeze and pop the beans from their shells.  Transfer the beans to a bowl.

Add the asparagus and peas to the water and cook until tender, about 4 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables to the ice water to stop the cooking and drain.  Transfer the vegetables to the bowl of beans.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.

Rub the inside of a 12- to 14-inch wide straight-sided skillet with a tight-fitting lid with the 1 teaspoon of butter and sprinkle with the shallots.  Generously season the fish all over with the salt and pepper, and arrange the fillets, skin-side up, in the skillet.  Scatter the mussels over the top and pour in the vermouth and water.  Cover the skillet and bring to a boil.  Turn the heat to low and cook until the mussels have opened (only uncover the skillet once or twice).  Remove the skillet from the heat and let rest, covered, until the fish is just cooked through, about 6 to 10 minutes.

Transfer the fish and mussels to a baking pan, leaving the broth in the skillet, and keep warm in the oven.  Meanwhile, bring the broth to a boil, add the vegetables and whisk in the 4 tablespoons of butter, little by little, until fully incorporated.  Whisk in the herbs.

Divide the fish and mussels among 4 wide, shallow soup plates or bowls.  Divide the broth and vegetables among the plates and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  thin white fish fillets
                        = (such as lemon or gray sole)
  2               cups  whole milk
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  Creole Spice mix -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  6        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish
                        Tartar Sauce III -- (see recipe)

Place the fish in a large shallow bowl and pour the milk over it.  Cover and chill for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Mix the flour, spice mix, and salt in a pie plate lined with a piece of parchment paper.  Working in batches, remove the fillets from the milk and drain off the excess.  Transfer to the flour mixture and, pulling up the sides of the parchment, turn to coat on both sides.  Flour only as many fillets as will fit in a large skillet at one time.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over high heat until just smoking.  Add the fillets and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer to a heatproof plate and keep in the oven while you cook the remaining fillets.  Repeat the procedure with the remaining fillets, flour mix, and oil.  Serve with lemon wedges and tartar sauce.

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            slices  homemade-style white bread - (abt 3/4 lb) -- crusts removed
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick)
  1 1/2           cups  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  2        tablespoons  water
  3               cups  half-and-half
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
  2              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1             recipe  Vanilla Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        = (or alternately 1 pint vanilla ice
                        cream softened in the refrigerator)
  1         tablespoon  instant espresso powder

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and butter 6 (1 1/4-cup) ramekins or a shallow 2-quart ceramic or glass baking dish.  Line the bottom of a baking pan large enough to snugly hold the ramekins or baking dish with a clean kitchen towel and bring a large saucepan of water to a boil.  (The towel will prevent the ramekins from hitting the pan as they bake.)

Spread the bread out in a single layer on a baking sheet and place in the oven until slightly dried out, about 7 minutes.  Let cool.  Cut the bread into 1/2-inch cubes and divide evenly among the ramekins.

Combine the butter, sugar, and 2 tablespoons water in a large saucepan.  Stir over low heat until smooth and bubbling at the edges, about 10 minutes.  Add 2 cups of the half-and-half and the salt.  Increase the heat to medium-high and bring almost to a boil.

Whisk the eggs and egg yolks with the remaining cup of half-and-half and the vanilla in a large bowl until well blended.  Slowly pour in the hot half-and-half mixture, whisking constantly.  Ladle the mixture evenly into the ramekins or baking dish.

Arrange the filled ramekins or baking dish on the towel in the pan.  Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven and carefully pour in enough of the boiling water to reach about halfway up the sides of the dishes.  Cook until golden and set in the middle, 35 to 40 minutes for ramekins, 40 to 45 minutes for the 2-quart dish.  Transfer to wire racks to cool.

Prepare the vanilla sauce as directed.  Stir the espresso powder into the sauce while warm.  Cool and chill before serving with the pudding.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and butter 6 (1 1/4-cup) ramekins or a shallow 2-quart ceramic or glass baking dish.  Line the bottom of a baking pan large enough to snugly hold the ramekins or baking dish with a clean kitchen towel and bring a large saucepan of water to a boil.  (The towel will prevent the ramekins from hitting the pan as they bake.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the bread out in a single layer on a baking sheet and place in the oven until slightly dried out, about 7 minutes.  Let cool.  Cut the bread into 1/2-inch cubes and divide evenly among the ramekins.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the butter, sugar, and 2 tablespoons water in a large saucepan.  Stir over low heat until smooth and bubbling at the edges, about 10 minutes.  Add 2 cups of the half-and-half and the salt.  Increase the heat to medium-high and bring almost to a boil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk the eggs and egg yolks with the remaining cup of half-and-half and the vanilla in a large bowl until well blended.  Slowly pour in the hot half-and-half mixture, whisking constantly.  Ladle the mixture evenly into the ramekins or baking dish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the filled ramekins or baking dish on the towel in the pan.  Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven and carefully pour in enough of the boiling water to reach about halfway up the sides of the dishes.  Cook until golden and set in the middle, 35 to 40 minutes for ramekins, 40 to 45 minutes for the 2-quart dish.  Transfer to wire racks to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare the vanilla sauce as directed.  Stir the espresso powder into the sauce while warm.  Cool and chill before serving with the pudding.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === OSSO BUCO ===
  4        tablespoons  pure olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     center-cut veal shanks - (ea abt 2" thk)
  3              whole  garlic cloves -- peeled
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  2               cups  good-quality red wine
                        = (preferably Chianti)
  4               cups  good-quality veal stock
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary
  1                     bay leaf
  12                    fingerling potatoes -- cut 1/2" thk rounds
  1                     fennel bulb -- cut 1/2" strips,
                        fronds removed and reserved
  1           teaspoon  ground fennel seed -- lightly toasted
  1                     shallot -- minced
  1         tablespoon  coarse sea salt
                        === PESTO ===
  1              bunch  flat-leaf parsley -- leaves only
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                     lemon -- zested
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Season the shanks with salt and pepper and brown them in the Dutch oven, turning once, until well-browned, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer the shanks to a plate.

Discard all but 1 tablespoon of the oil and return the Dutch oven to medium heat.  Add 2 garlic cloves and cook, stirring, until lightly browned.  Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until caramelized, about 2 minutes.  Raise the heat to high, pour in the wine, and reduce by 1/4.  Add the veal stock, 1 thyme sprig, rosemary, and bay leaf and bring to a boil.  Arrange the shanks in the Dutch oven, cover, and transfer to the oven.  Braise the shanks until the meat is tender and pulling away from the bone, about 2 1/2 hours.  Remove from oven and let rest for 30 minutes.

Raise the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the potatoes and cook, stirring, until golden brown.  Add the fennel strips and cook, stirring, until lightly browned.  Stir in the remaining garlic clove and thyme sprig and season with salt and pepper.  Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.

Sprinkle the fennel-potato mixture with fennel seed and shallot and cook 2 minutes more.  Turn off the oven, and leave the skillet inside to keep warm.

Meanwhile, make the Pesto:  Combine the parsley, garlic, and lemon zest in a food processor and pulse until chopped.  While the motor is running, drizzle in the oil until a smooth paste is formed.  Season with salt and pepper.

When ready to serve, divide the fennel-potato mixture among plates and sprinkle with a little of the reserved fennel fronds.  Place a veal shank on each plate, spoon over some of the sauce, and top with a little of the pesto.  Sprinkle shanks with the sea salt and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                   Chicken And Sweet-Potato Croquettes

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  chopped onion
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
     1/2           cup  additional flour -- for dredging
     1/4           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  chicken broth
  2               cups  finely-chopped cooked chicken or turkey
     1/2           cup  mashed sweet potatoes
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              large  eggs -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for egg wash
  1 1/2           cups  fine fresh bread crumbs
                        Oil -- for frying

In a small saucepan cook the onion in the butter over moderately-low heat, stirring, for 5 minutes, stir in 1/4 cup of the flour, and cook the roux mixture over low heat, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Stir in the milk and the broth, cook the mixture, stirring, until it forms a paste, and cook the paste, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the chicken, the sweet potatoes, the cayenne, and salt and black pepper, to taste, and combine the mixture well.

Chill the chicken mixture, covered, for 2 hours, or until it is firm, and roll level tablespoons of it into balls.  Dredge the balls in the additional 1/2 cup flour, shaking off the excess, coat them thoroughly with the egg wash, letting the excess drip off, and dredge them in the bread crumbs, transferring them to wax paper as they are coated.  The croquettes may be made up to this point 1 month in advance and kept wrapped well and frozen.  Thaw the croquettes for 1 hour.  If serving the croquettes immediately, let them dry at room temperature for 1 hour.

In a large saucepan heat 2 inches of the oil until a deep-fat thermometer registers 365 degrees.  Fry the croquettes in batches for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or until they are golden brown, and transfer them with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.  Serve the croquettes with mango chutney, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

In a small saucepan cook the onion in the butter over moderately-low heat, stirring, for 5 minutes, stir in 1/4 cup of the flour, and cook the roux mixture over low heat, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Stir in the milk and the broth, cook the mixture, stirring, until it forms a paste, and cook the paste, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the chicken, the sweet potatoes, the cayenne, and salt and black pepper, to taste, and combine the mixture well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Chill the chicken mixture, covered, for 2 hours, or until it is firm, and roll level tablespoons of it into balls.  Dredge the balls in the additional 1/2 cup flour, shaking off the excess, coat them thoroughly with the egg wash, letting the excess drip off, and dredge them in the bread crumbs, transferring them to wax paper as they are coated.  The croquettes may be made up to this point 1 month in advance and kept wrapped well and frozen.  Thaw the croquettes for 1 hour.  If serving the croquettes immediately, let them dry at room temperature for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large saucepan heat 2 inches of the oil until a deep-fat thermometer registers 365 degrees.  Fry the croquettes in batches for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or until they are golden brown, and transfer them with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.  Serve the croquettes with mango chutney, if desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN ===
  1              whole  boneless skinless chicken breast
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === OVEN-DRIED TOMATOES ===
  6                     plum tomatoes - (to 8) -- cored
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SANDWICHES ===
  2                     loaves ciabatta bread - (6" long) -- halved lengthwise
                        = (or your favorite long and crusty bread)
  6             slices  mozzarella, 1/4" thk
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Make the Chicken:  Using a knife, butterfly the chicken and pound thin between 2 layers of plastic wrap.  Transfer the chicken to a shallow dish, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with the rosemary.  Season the chicken with salt and pepper and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.  When ready to cook, preheat a grill.  Grill the chicken, turning once, until just cooked through.

Make the Tomatoes:  Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.

Using a small knife, score the ends of the tomatoes, drop them in a pot of boiling water, and cook briefly, about 20 seconds.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the tomatoes to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking.  Peel off the tomato skins and cut the tomatoes in 1/2 lengthwise.  In a small bowl, toss the tomatoes with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Arrange the tomatoes on a baking sheet, cut-side up, and bake until lightly browned and somewhat dried, about 3 hours.

Make the Sandwiches:  Preheat an electric sandwich press or grill.  Layer the chicken, tomato, and mozzarella between the bread, sprinkle with rosemary and season with salt and pepper.  Put the sandwiches in the press and cook until hot and crispy.

This recipe yields 2 sandwiches.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  3               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  2             medium  carrots -- cut 1/4"-thk slices
  2                     celery ribs -- halved lengthwise,
                        and cut into 1/4"-thk pieces
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4         pound  button mushrooms - (abt 8) -- sliced thin
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped shallot - (abt 2 large)
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme -- crumbled
     1/4      teaspoon  dried tarragon -- crumbled
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  1              pinch  ground nutmeg
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              whole  cooked chicken breasts -- cut 3/4" dice
  1                cup  thawed frozen pearl onions
     1/2           cup  thawed frozen peas
  1         tablespoon  medium-dry sherry
                        === MASHED POTATOES ===
  1 1/2         pounds  russet (baking) potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
     1/4           cup  low-fat sour cream
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh chives - (to 3)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Make Filling:  Bring the broth to a boil in a saucepan.  Add the carrot and celery and cook until tender, about 4 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a plate.

Pour enough of the broth into a liquid measure to make 2 1/2 cups.  Set aside.

Heat the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 6 minutes.  Add the shallot, bay leaf, thyme, and tarragon and cook, stirring, until soft.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Gradually stir the reserved broth, wine, nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper.  Bring the sauce to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes.

Add the carrot, celery, chicken, onions, and peas and return to a boil.  Stir in sherry and remove the chicken mixture from the heat.  (Filling may be made 1 day ahead, cooled, uncovered, and chilled, covered.)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Make Mashed Potatoes:  In a saucepan cover potatoes with water by 1 inch and simmer until very tender, 10 to 15 minutes.

Reserve about 1/3 cup cooking liquid and drain potatoes.  In batches, force potatoes through a ricer into a bowl.  Stir in sour cream, chives, and enough reserved cooking liquid to reach a fluffy consistency.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Transfer potatoes to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch fluted tip.  Spread filling in a 1 1/2 to 2-quart gratin dish or other shallow baking dish.  Pipe mashed potatoes decoratively in mounds on filling and bake in middle of oven until filling is bubbling and potatoes are golden on edges, about 25 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

             Chicken Soup With Egg-Lemon Sauce - {Avgolemeno}

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Cat Cora
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     free range chicken - (abt 3 lbs)
  12              cups  cold water
  3        tablespoons  kosher salt
  1                     leek -- cleaned, quartered
  1                     carrot -- peeled, quartered
  2                     bay leaves
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cups  finely-diced onion - (abt 1 medium onion)
     2/3           cup  arborio rice
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a 6 to 8-quart stockpot, combine the chicken, water, and 2 tablespoons salt.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; immediately reduce the heat to a very low simmer, and skim the foam from the surface.  Add the leek, carrot, and bay leaves and continue to simmer with the chicken until the chicken is thoroughly cooked, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside.

Remove chicken from the broth, and allow meat to cool.  Strain the broth and skim the fat.  (Place the broth in the refrigerator to make it easier to skim.)

When the chicken is cool enough to handle, pull the meat from the bones and discard the skin.  Dice the meat into large cubes; refrigerate until ready to use.

Return the broth to high heat, add the rice and onion and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the rice is almost cooked through, about 20 minutes.  Add the chicken and reduce the broth to a low simmer.

In a medium-sized bowl, beat the lemon juice, eggs, and pepper.  Ladle 2 cups of hot broth into a measuring cup with a pourable spout.  While whisking, slowly pour the 2 cups of broth into the egg mixture.  Pour the egg mixture back into the pot with the remaining 1 tablespoon of salt.  Stir well to blend.  Divide among bowls and serve immediately.

This recipe yields about 8 servings.

In a 6 to 8-quart stockpot, combine the chicken, water, and 2 tablespoons salt.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; immediately reduce the heat to a very low simmer, and skim the foam from the surface.  Add the leek, carrot, and bay leaves and continue to simmer with the chicken until the chicken is thoroughly cooked, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove chicken from the broth, and allow meat to cool.  Strain the broth and skim the fat.  (Place the broth in the refrigerator to make it easier to skim.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the chicken is cool enough to handle, pull the meat from the bones and discard the skin.  Dice the meat into large cubes; refrigerate until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the broth to high heat, add the rice and onion and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the rice is almost cooked through, about 20 minutes.  Add the chicken and reduce the broth to a low simmer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium-sized bowl, beat the lemon juice, eggs, and pepper.  Ladle 2 cups of hot broth into a measuring cup with a pourable spout.  While whisking, slowly pour the 2 cups of broth into the egg mixture.  Pour the egg mixture back into the pot with the remaining 1 tablespoon of salt.  Stir well to blend.  Divide among bowls and serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOUP ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin oil
  1              small  onion -- minced
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  1                cup  Marsala
  6                     red bell peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        seeded, and diced
  2 1/2           cups  rich chicken stock or
                        vegetable stock -- or more as needed
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === AVOCADO-CHILE SALSA ===
     1/2                onion -- minced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     Anaheim chiles -- roasted, peeled,
                        seeded, and chopped
  1                     dried ancho chile -- roasted, pulverized
  2                     avocados -- cut small dice
  2                     limes -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  creme fraiche or sour cream
                        Cilantro sprigs -- for garnish

To make the soup, heat the oil in a large saucepan over high heat until very hot.  Add the onion and garlic and saute for about 2 minutes.  Add the cumin and saute for 2 minutes longer.  Add the Marsala and reduce until about 1/2 cup remains, about 4 minutes.  Add the peppers and stock, decrease the heat to medium, and simmer for about 20 minutes.  Add the cilantro and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Carefully puree the soup in a blender.  Transfer the soup to a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate until well chilled, about 2 hours.  (If the soup is too thick after chilling, thin it down with a bit more stock.)

Meanwhile, to prepare the salsa, combine the onion, garlic, chiles, and avocados in a bowl, and mix well.  Add the lime juice, mix well, and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate until you are ready to serve.

To serve, ladle the soup into bowls, and garnish with the salsa, creme fraiche, and a cilantro sprig.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4            cup  heavy cream
  3              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
  8             ounces  bittersweet chocolate
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Cocoa powder or confectioners' sugar -- for garnish
                        Orange segments -- for garnish
                        Fresh mint leaves or sprigs -- for garnish

In a bowl, whip the heavy cream to soft peaks -- not too stiff.

In a large bowl, using a hand-held mixer, whisk the eggs until thick, about 2 minutes

Combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil for 1 minute.  Pour the sugar mixture over the yolks, and beat mixture again.

In a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (the water should not touch to bottom of the bowl), melt the chocolate and butter, stirring occasionally.  Remove the bowl from the heat and let cool until just warm.

Fold in the egg mixture and whipped cream into the chocolate mixture until just combined.  Refrigerate the chocolate mousse until set, about 2 hours.

To serve:  Set an ice cream scoop in a bowl of hot tap water for a few minutes.

Lay a stencil cut from a piece of parchment paper (heart, snowflake, Easter egg, or Santa's boot), on a plate and sprinkle cocoa powder over the top.  Remove the stencil and repeat on the remaining plates.

Using the hot ice cream scoop, smoothly scoop the chocolate mousse and center a scoop on each plate.  Decorate each plate with orange segments and mint.

This recipe yields about 6 servings.

<DirT>
In a large bowl, using a hand-held mixer, whisk the eggs until thick, about 2 minutes

In a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (the water should not touch to bottom of the bowl), melt the chocolate and butter, stirring occasionally.  Remove the bowl from the heat and let cool until just warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fold in the egg mixture and whipped cream into the chocolate mixture until just combined.  Refrigerate the chocolate mousse until set, about 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve:  Set an ice cream scoop in a bowl of hot tap water for a few minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lay a stencil cut from a piece of parchment paper (heart, snowflake, Easter egg, or Santa&apos;s boot), on a plate and sprinkle cocoa powder over the top.  Remove the stencil and repeat on the remaining plates.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using the hot ice cream scoop, smoothly scoop the chocolate mousse and center a scoop on each plate.  Decorate each plate with orange segments and mint.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4         pound  smoked slab bacon -- rind removed,
                        and cut crosswise into 1/4" pieces
  2                     medium-large onions -- sliced
  9               cups  drained sauerkraut - (abt 5 to 6 lbs) -- rinsed, and
                        squeezed dry
  1         tablespoon  juniper berries
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
     1/2      teaspoon  caraway seeds
  6             sprigs  parsley
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme
  3                     cloves
  2                     bay leaves
  1             bottle  white wine
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2             pounds  assorted smoked and precooked fresh
                        sausages
                        = (we used smoked kielbasa cut into thick
                        slices, frankfurters, and baernwurst, and
                        precooked fresh bratwurst, weisswurst,
                        and chipolata)
  1              pound  piece smoked boneless pork loin -- cut 6 slices
                        = (Canadian bacon)
  2 1/2         pounds  small waxy-style potatoes -- peeled
                        Coarse-grained mustard -- for serving

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Heat the butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat.  Add the bacon and onion and cook, stirring, until soft.  Add the sauerkraut and stir to combine.

In a swath of cheesecloth, combine the juniper berries, peppercorns, caraway seeds, parsley, thyme, cloves, and bay leaves and tie into a bundle with a piece of kitchen twine.  Add the spice bundle to the sauerkraut mixture.  Pour in the wine and add enough water to cover the sauerkraut.  Stir to combine and bring to a boil.  Cover pan tightly with foil and braise in middle of oven for 2 hours.  (The sauerkraut may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead, cooled, uncovered, and chilled, covered with plastic wrap.)

Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat and, working in batches, brown the sausages.

Uncover the casserole and nestle the sausages, pork loin, and potatoes in the sauerkraut, partially submerging them.  Recover and continue braising for 30 minutes more.

Serve the choucroute at the table in the Dutch oven or transfer to a large serving platter.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  whole blanched almonds.
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  ground turmeric

  5                     navel oranges -- juiced
                        = (abt 1 cup orange juice
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  orange liqueur -- (optional)
                        = (such as Grand Marnier)
  6                     navel oranges -- peeled, sectioned
  1                     orange -- zested
     1/2           cup  grenadine
                        === BASIC DESSERT CREPES ===
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  cake flour
  1              pinch  salt
  3                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  2               cups  milk
  1         tablespoon  rum or Grand Marnier
                        = (or 1 vanilla bean/ split lengthwise)
  1                     lemon -- zest finely grated
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

In a large skillet over high heat, bring the orange juice to a boil.  Add the sugar, reduce to medium heat and simmer for 2 minutes.

Remove from heat and add the orange liqueur and orange sections.  Set aside.

In a pot, combine the orange zest and grenadine.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 2 minutes.  Set aside.

Working in batches, gently place a crepe into the pan holding the orange juice and orange sections.  Leave for 1 minute to absorb some juice.

Using a narrow spatula, remove the crepe to a warm serving plate.  Roll the crepe into a cylinder.  Spoon on some orange sections.  Using a fork, pick some orange zest from the grenadine syrup and distribute it over the crepe.  Top with vanilla ice cream and serve immediately.

Basic Dessert Crepes:  Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat.  Cook until the butter becomes brownish; this gives it a nutty flavor.  Don't let any of the butter turn black.  Have a small bowl nearby so that you can pour off the butter as soon as it turns brown.  Let cool.

In a large mixing bowl (alternately, use a blender to mix all ingredients together), blend the sugar, cake flour, and salt.  Add the eggs and whisk well.  Whisk in the oil and the brown butter.  Pour in about 1/2 cup milk and whisk; the mixture should form a thick paste.  Pour in the remaining milk a little at a time while mixing and then add the rum (or Grand Marnier or vanilla bean), and lemon zest.

Heat the crepe pan over medium heat for about a minute.  Cover the surface of the pan with clarified butter until it gets sizzling hot.

Ladle some batter onto the middle of the 8-inch crepe pan and immediately start swirling the pan to distribute the batter over the surface.  Pour the batter so that it's very thin on the pan; and remember, move the pan, not the ladle.

Cook the crepe for about 30 to 60 seconds (heat may vary) or until it's brown around the edge and dry in the center.  Using a thin spatula (it resembles a long tongue depressor), flip the crepe quickly and cook for about 15 seconds.

Using the spatula, remove the crepe to a warm plate.  Sprinkle the crepe with sugar.  Repeat with the remaining batter.  (After the first few crepes, you shouldn't have to add more butter to the pan.)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  1                cup  cooked breakfast sausage -- (optional)
                        = (or ham or shredded meat)
  2 3/4           cups  milk
  9              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Squeeze handfuls of spinach to remove as much liquid as possible, then finely chop.

Cook onion in butter in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until soft, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and nutmeg and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Stir in spinach, then remove from heat.

In a large bowl, toss together the bread cubes, spinach mixture, 1 3/4 cups of the Gruyere, and 3/4 cup of the Parmigiano.  Transfer 1/2 of the bread mixture to another bowl and toss with sausage.

Line a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with several pieces of foil, to form 2 enclosed sides, building a "dam" of foil down the center crosswise.  Butter the foil.  Put the "vegetarian" mixture in 1 side, and the "meat-eaters" mixture in the other.

Whisk together milk, eggs, mustard, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl and pour evenly over each side.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup Gruyere, and 1/4 cup Parmigiano.  Let the strata sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Bake strata, uncovered, in middle of oven until puffed, golden brown, and cooked through, 45 to 55 minutes.  Let stand 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                          Eggs Baked In Red Wine

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  homemade-style white bread -- crusts removed
  2                     garlic cloves -- 1 halved; 1 minced
  6                     strips bacon
  2                     shallots -- minced
  2               cups  dry red wine
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock -- preferably homemade
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh herbs
                        = (such as chives, parsley, tarragon,
                        lemon thyme)

Cut each slice of bread into 2 triangles and toast lightly.  Rub with the halved clove of garlic while warm.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and crisp.  Drain on paper towels.  Crumble when cooled and set aside.

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat from the skillet and add the minced garlic and the shallots.  Cook over low heat, stirring often, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes.  Pour in the wine and increase the heat to high.  Bring to a boil and cook, stirring to scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, until reduced to 1/2 cup.  Pour in the chicken stock and bring back to a boil.

Use a fork to blend the butter and flour into a smooth paste in a small heatproof bowl.  Whisk about 1/4 cup of the boiling liquid into the bowl and blend until smooth.  Empty the bowl into the skillet and boil, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Arrange 2 bread triangles in the bottom of 4 individual 1 cup casserole dishes or ramekins.  Pour a quarter of the red wine sauce over the bread and carefully break 2 eggs on top.  Arrange the dishes on a sheet pan and bake in the middle of the oven until the eggs are just set, 18 to 20 minutes.  Sprinkle with fresh herbs and the crumbled bacon.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

       Endive And Roquefort Spirals With Creamy Walnut Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALAD ===
     3/4           cup  Roquefort
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  3             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  2              large  Belgian endives
                        === DRESSING ===
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  walnut oil
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1              small  shallot -- minced
                        === GARNISH ===
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped toasted walnuts
  4                     fresh watercress sprigs
     1/2                McIntosh apple

Combine the Roquefort, butter, and cream cheese in a food processor and blend until smooth.  You should have about 3/4 cup.

To make the salad, cut 1/4-inch from the bottom of the endives and peel away the outer leaves.  (Reserve the inner core for another use.)  Spread each leaf with a 1/4-inch-thick layer of Roquefort mixture and press the leaves back together to reconstruct the shape of the whole endive.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, about 1 1/2 hours.

To prepare the dressing, whisk the mustard with the vinegar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.  Add the oils in a slow stream, whisking constantly until thick and emulsified.  Stir in the shallots.

Spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the dressing over the bottom of each of 4 chilled salad plates.  Cut the endive into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Arrange 3 slices overlapping on each plate.  Sprinkle with walnuts and garnish with a sprig of watercress.  Cut the apple lengthwise into thin slices.  Garnish each plate with 3 of the slices.  Drizzle with a small amount of the remaining dressing just before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing
  2                     thin fish fillets, 1/3" thk - (abt 6 oz ea -- skin removed

Fold the other half of the paper over the fillets and, starting with the top, make 1/4-inch folds all around the perimeters and press to crimp and seal.  Close the final crimp with a paper clip.

Place the packet on a baking sheet and bake until puffed and lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.  Transfer to a warmed serving plate and serve at once, preferably while the packet is still puffed.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

                     Fresh Garden Pickles With Aioli

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pickles/Relishes                Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  cucumber -- cut into 16 spears
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  16                    asparagus spears
  6             medium  carrots -- peeled, halved
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- cut into 16 slices
  1             medium  red onion -- cut into 16 slices
  2        tablespoons  pressed or finely-chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  crushed black peppercorns
  1                cup  white wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds
  2                     bay leaves -- crumbled
                        === AIOLI ===
  1              slice  French bread
     1/4           cup  milk
  2              large  egg yolks
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4                     garlic cloves -- smashed and minced
  1                cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  cold water

In a mixing bowl, toss the cucumbers with salt to coat, then cover with ice cubes and refrigerate.  After 1 to 2 hours, drain, rinse thoroughly, and strain to remove excess water.  Set aside.

In a saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the asparagus, carrots, peppers, onions, and garlic and saute for 3 minutes or until the vegetables are just beginning to soften.  Transfer to a large bowl.  Add the cucumbers, oregano, thyme, and peppercorns and gently toss to combine.

Return the saute pan to medium heat, and add the vinegars, sugar, fennel seeds, and bay leaves.  Simmer until the sugar has dissolved, stirring constantly, about 3 minutes.  Pour the syrup over the vegetable mixture and toss to coat.  Cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate.  These pickles are best a few days after they have been made, but can be eaten after chilling just a few hours.

Aioli:  In a small bowl, soak the bread in the milk for 10 minutes.  Squeeze the bread and break into small pieces.

In another small bowl, beat together the yolks, salt, and garlic.  Add the soaked bread and mix until incorporated.

While beating the yolk mixture, slowly drizzle in the oil until a thick sauce is formed.  Beat in the lemon juice and water.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RED AND GREEN SALSAS ===
     1/2         pound  plum tomatoes
     1/2         pound  fresh tomatillos -- husks discarded,
                        and rinsed
  2                     fresh jalapeÒo chiles
  1                     wedge large white onion - (abt 1")
  2                     garlic cloves
  2          teaspoons  salt
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
     1/4           cup  water - (to 1/2)
                        === EGGS ===
  4        tablespoons  corn or vegetable oil - (to 8)
  8              large  eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     corn tortillas - (6" to 7" dia)

Make salsas:  Heat a comal (griddle) or a dry well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over moderate heat until a bead of water evaporates quickly, then roast tomatoes, tomatillos, jalapeÒos, and onion, turning with tongs, until charred on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes.  Core roasted tomatoes.  Discard stems from jalapeÒos.

For the red salsa:  Coarsely puree tomatoes, 1 jalapeÒo, half the onion, 1 garlic clove, and 1 teaspoon salt in a blender or food processor, then transfer to a bowl.

For the green salsa:  Coarsely puree tomatillos, remaining jalapeÒo, half the onion, remaining garlic clove, remaining teaspoon salt, cilantro, and 1/4 cup water (add more if needed for desired consistency), then transfer to a bowl.

Cook the eggs:  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a small nonstick skillet over moderately-low heat until hot.  Gently break 2 eggs into a cup, keeping yolks intact, then pour into skillet and cook, covered, 5 minutes, or to desired doneness.  Season with salt and pepper.

Fry tortillas while eggs cook.  Make more eggs in same manner, adding oil as needed.

Fry tortillas:  While each serving of eggs is cooking, heat 2 tablespoons oil in another small nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking.  Stack 2 tortillas in skillet.  Cook bottom tortilla 30 seconds on first side; then flip stack with tongs.  While second tortilla cooks on bottom, turn top tortilla over with tongs, then flip stack again.  Continue until both sides of both tortillas are cooked.  Tortillas will soften and puff slightly, then deflate (do not let them become brown or crisp).  Fry more tortillas in same manner, adding oil as needed.

Put tortillas on plate, overlapping slightly, and top with eggs.  Spoon a different salsa over each egg.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Gingery Chicken Broth With Wonton Ravioli

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     scallions
  2             quarts  chicken stock
                        = (preferably homemade)
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 4" long) -- peeled, and
                        thickly sliced
  5                     garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        smashed with the side of a knife
  6              ounce  boneless skinless chicken breast half -- cut 1/2" cubes
  1         tablespoon  crushed ice
  6        tablespoons  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated lemon zest
     3/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        Cornstarch -- as needed
  36                    round wonton skins
                        = (preferably Japanese gyoza skins)
                        Chopped fresh cilantro -- for garnish
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Trim off all but 1-inch of the scallion greens, chop the greens, and reserve for garnish.  Cut each of the scallions into 4 pieces.  Combine the stock, scallion pieces, ginger, and garlic in a large pot.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 20 minutes or longer.  Strain and discard the solids.  (The broth can be made a day ahead.  Keep refrigerated and ready to serve.)

Place the chicken in a food processor and pulse several times to grind finely.  Add the ice and process until the ice is absorbed.  With the blade in motion, add the cream.  Pulse in the lemon zest and salt to blend.  Chill for 1 hour.  Sprinkle a sheet pan with cornstarch to hold the wontons before cooking.

Working with a few wontons at a time and keeping the remaining wonton skins covered, mound 1 tablespoon of the chicken mixture in the center of each skin.  Moisten the edges with water and place another wonton on top.  Press on the edges to seal completely.  Repeat until the entire filling is used.  As they are done, transfer to the sheet pan.

Just before serving, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.  Working in 2 batches, drop the ravioli into the boiling water, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer until tender and the chicken mixture is thoroughly cooked, 3 to 5 minutes.

Bring the water back to a boil before proceeding with the final batch.  Remove the wontons with a slotted spoon and arrange 3 in the center of each serving bowl.  (The wontons are best if used just after boiling.  Place them right into the serving bowls.  If they cool, the hot broth will warm them.)

Reheat the broth almost to boiling, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and ladle over the wontons.  Garnish with the cilantro and chopped scallion greens.  Serve right away.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  shortening -- plus
                        more for the baking pan
     1/3           cup  ice water
                        Dried beans -- for pie weights
                        === SPINACH FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        additional for greasing the baking pan
  6               cups  chopped onion - (abt 3 medium onions)
     3/4           cup  uncooked long-grain white rice
  4 1/2         pounds  fresh spinach - (abt 3 bunches) -- stemmed
  2 1/4      teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh dill -- plus
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh dill
  3                     scallions (white and green) -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  crumbled feta
  1                     egg beaten -- with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for egg wash

In a food processor, pulse the flour and salt until combined.  Add the shortening and pulse until the mixture resembles cornmeal mixed with pea-sized bits, about 10 times.  While the motor is running, drizzle in the water until a dough forms.

Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking pan.  Divide the dough in half; press half the dough up and around the inside of the pan.  Set the remaining dough aside covered with plastic wrap.

Line the pan with foil and fill with dried beans.  Bake the dough for 20 minutes and remove the beans and foil.  Continue baking the crust until golden brown, about 10 minutes more.  Let the pan cool on a rack.

Meanwhile, make the Spinach Filling:  Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 6 minutes.  Add the rice and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes.  Add the spinach, little by little (adding more as the previous batch wilts), and cook, stirring, until completely wilted.  Season with the salt and pepper and stir in the parsley, dill, and scallions.

Drain the spinach mixture in a colander in the sink and let cool.

Once the spinach is cool, stir in the feta and spread the mixture into the crust.  Roll the remaining dough out on a well-floured surface, into a rectangle large enough to cover the baking pan.  Top the spinach with the dough and pinch around the sides to seal.  Score the top of the pie in the center, brush the surface of the dough with egg wash, and bake until golden brown, about 40 minutes.

Remove the pie from the oven, let cool, cut into squares and serve.

This recipe yields about 10 to 12 servings.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking pan.  Divide the dough in half; press half the dough up and around the inside of the pan.  Set the remaining dough aside covered with plastic wrap.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line the pan with foil and fill with dried beans.  Bake the dough for 20 minutes and remove the beans and foil.  Continue baking the crust until golden brown, about 10 minutes more.  Let the pan cool on a rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, make the Spinach Filling:  Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 6 minutes.  Add the rice and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes.  Add the spinach, little by little (adding more as the previous batch wilts), and cook, stirring, until completely wilted.  Season with the salt and pepper and stir in the parsley, dill, and scallions.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain the spinach mixture in a colander in the sink and let cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Once the spinach is cool, stir in the feta and spread the mixture into the crust.  Roll the remaining dough out on a well-floured surface, into a rectangle large enough to cover the baking pan.  Top the spinach with the dough and pinch around the sides to seal.  Score the top of the pie in the center, brush the surface of the dough with egg wash, and bake until golden brown, about 40 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the pie from the oven, let cool, cut into squares and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  roughly-chopped red bell pepper
     1/2                portobello mushroom cap -- sliced
     1/4        medium  red onion -- sliced
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     thin slices Black Forest ham
  1              slice  provolone cheese
  1              slice  Swiss cheese
  1              slice  Jack cheese
  2             slices  seven-grain bread
                        A bowl of tomato soup -- for serving

Preheat an electric sandwich grill or press.

Add the ham to the skillet and cook, turning once, until lightly browned, about 1 minute.

Layer the vegetable mixture, ham, and cheese between the two slices of bread.  Put the sandwich in the grill and grill until hot and crispy, about 4 minutes.  (Alternately, grill on a cast-iron grill pan, weighed-down with a foil-wrapped brick or other heavy item.)

Cut the sandwich in 1/2 and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 1 sandwich.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  eggplants -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/4"-thick slices
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             medium  red onions -- sliced 1/4" thick
  4                     flour tortillas - (10" dia)
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  1              small  garlic clove -- minced
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     3/4           cup  chilled crumbled feta cheese
     1/2           cup  fresh mint leaves

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and preheat a charcoal grill and let the coals burn down to a gray ash.  (Alternatively, preheat a broiler and lightly oil a broiling pan.)

Brush the eggplant slices with the 1/2 cup oil and season both sides with salt and pepper.  Grill or broil on a rack set 5 to 6 inches from the heat, turning once, until tender, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to a baking sheet to cool.  Brush the onions with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill or broil until brown and tender, about 5 minutes.  Wrap the tortillas in foil and heat in the oven for 5 minutes.

Whisk the mayonnaise with the garlic and lemon juice in a small bowl to make the aioli.  Spread 2 tablespoons of the aioli over each tortilla.  Cover the bottom 1/3 of each tortilla with 1/4 of the eggplant and 1/4 of the onions.  Sprinkle on 1/4 of the cheese and top with mint leaves.

To make the wrap, fold in the two sides of the tortilla.  Roll away from you, tucking in the edges to form a tight cylinder.  Wrap the cylinder in foil and cut in 1/2 diagonally right through the foil.  The foil becomes the holder to be peeled away as the wrap is consumed.  Serve the wrap hot or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
  1         tablespoon  dried mint -- crumbled
  2          teaspoons  freshly-grated lemon zest
  2          teaspoons  coarse salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  24                    prawns or jumbo shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish
                        === BEARNAISE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  dried tarragon
  1                     shallot -- minced
     1/4           cup  water
  4              large  egg yolks
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Lemon juice -- to taste

In a large bowl stir together the oil, herbs, zest, salt, and pepper.  Add the prawns, and toss them to coat them well.

Let the prawns marinate, covered and chilled, for 1 hour.  Stir in the lemon juice, let the mixture stand at room temperature for 30 minutes, and drain the prawns in a sieve.

Grill the herb-coated prawns on a rack set about 4 inches over glowing coals for 3 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked through.  (Alternatively, the prawns may be broiled on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 4 minutes on each side.)  Divide the prawns among 8 plates and serve with lemon wedges and the bearnaise sauce.

Bearnaise Sauce:  Combine the vinegar, tarragon, and shallot in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil and cook until almost evaporated.  Remove from the heat and add the water.

Transfer the tarragon mixture to a small metal bowl and whisk together with the egg yolks.  Place the bowl over a saucepan of boiling water (the water should not touch the bottom of the bowl) and whisk constantly until the mixture forms thick ribbons.

While whisking constantly, add the butter, little by little, waiting for each addition to be incorporated before adding any more, until a smooth sauce is formed.  (You may need to remove the bowl from the water, from time to time, if the sauce gets too hot.)

Whisk in salt and lemon juice, to taste.  Add water to adjust consistency, if desired.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     porterhouse steaks/ 1 1/2" thk
                        = (abt 2 to 2 1/4 lbs ea)
  3        tablespoons  mixed whole peppercorns
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarse salt
                        Horseradish-Mustard Butter -- (see recipe),
                        sliced into 6 rounds

Prepare grill.

Let steaks stand at room temperature 30 minutes.  With a mortar and pestle or bottom of a heavy skillet coarsely crush peppercorns and in a small bowl combine with salt.  Pat steaks dry and rub seasoning onto both sides of steaks, pressing to adhere.

Grill steaks on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 7 to 9 minutes on each side, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 130 degrees for medium-rare.  (Alternatively, steaks may be broiled on rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from heat.)  Transfer steaks to a platter and let stand 10 minutes.

Serve steaks sliced with the Horseradish-Mustard Butter.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRITS ===
  5 1/2           cups  water
  1                cup  white old-fashioned stone-ground grits
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4         pound  tasso (Cajun-cured smoked pork) -- cut 1/4" dice
                        = (or country ham)
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter - (1/4 cup)
                        === POACHED EGGS ===
  4               cups  cold water
     1/2           cup  distilled white vinegar
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
  8              large  eggs

To make the Grits:  Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a 4-quart heavy saucepan and stir in grits and salt.  Return to a boil, stirring frequently.

Reduce heat and simmer grits, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until very thick and most of water is absorbed, about 10 minutes.

Reduce heat further and cook grits at a bare simmer until cooked through, about 1 hour 10 minutes, stirring frequently and adding remaining 1 1/2 cups water (1/4 cup at a time) whenever grits become very thick.

Add tasso, butter, and salt and pepper to taste, stirring until butter is melted.

Meanwhile, make the Poached Eggs:  Combine the water, vinegar, and salt, to taste, in a large skillet and bring to a gentle simmer.

Crack the eggs and slide them into the skillet.  Poach the eggs, turning occasionally with a spoon, until firm and slightly cooked through, about 4 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs and transfer to a kitchen towel, to drain.

Divide the grits among plates and top with the poached eggs.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1              pound  dried red kidney beans - (abt 2 1/2 cups) -- picked over
  6              large  garlic cloves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

                        Cajun-style white rice -- cooked

In a heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) cook oil and flour over moderately-low heat, stirring constantly with a flat-edged metal or wooden spatula, until roux is the dark reddish-brown color of chestnut shells, about 45 minutes.  (The roux may be made 1 week ahead, cooled completely, and chilled, covered, in a glass or stainless-steel bowl.  Reheat roux in skillet over moderately-low heat, stirring, before proceeding.)  Stir in onions, bell pepper, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened.

In a 10- to 12-quart heavy kettle bring 4 quarts water to a boil and add carrot tops and assorted greens.  Simmer greens, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 15 minutes.  Transfer greens with tongs to a large shallow baking dish, letting excess cooking liquid drip into kettle and reserving all cooking liquid.  Cool greens until they can be handled and coarsely chop.

Stir beans and remaining 3 quarts water into reserved cooking liquid and simmer beans, covered partially, until tender, about 1 hour.  (Older beans may take longer to cook.)  Add roux mixture by large spoonfuls, stirring well after each addition, and stir in greens, garlic, and salt and pepper, to taste.  Simmer gumbo, partially covered, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes.  Add Worcestershire and hot sauce, to taste.  (Gumbo may be made 2 days ahead, cooled completely, uncovered, and chilled, covered.)

Stir in file powder, if using, and remove from the heat.

Serve gumbo ladled over rice in large soup plates.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  chopped beef chuck or round
  1                     onion
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Unsalted butter -- as needed
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

Spread the meat out on a board and grate 2 to 3 tablespoons of onion into it -- use a fairly fine grater so you get just the juice and very finely grated raw onion.  Now mix in about a tablespoon of heavy cream and some freshly ground black pepper, to taste.  Form into patties -- a 6 to 8-ounce patty for an average serving.

Using a black iron skillet or your best copper one or your pet aluminum frying pan, Teflon-coated or not (with a Teflon coating you won't need much fat, just a little bit for flavor), and cook the hamburgers in the butter and oil over fairly high heat, giving it 4 to 5 minutes a side, depending on how well done you like it.

Salt this creamy, oniony, peppery hamburger before serving it on a buttered bun or English muffin, or as a main course with sliced tomatoes and onions or some home-fried potatoes.

This recipe yields about 4 hamburgers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIE CRUST ===
  1                     frozen pie crust - (8" dia) -- thawed
                        Dried beans -- for pie weights
                        === LEMON FILLING ===
  5                     lemons -- juiced
                        = (abt 7 tbspns)
  4              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2                     lemons -- zest grated
                        === MERINGUE ===
  5              large  egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/2           cup  sugar

Make the Pie Crust:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line the pie crust with aluminum foil and fill it with dried beans.  Bake the crust for 20 minutes.  Remove the beans and foil and continue baking until golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Transfer the pie crust to rack to cool.

Raise the oven to 375 degrees.

Make the Filling:  In a heavy saucepan, combine the lemon juice, eggs, butter, and sugar and whisk over medium heat until the mixture thickens.

Strain the filling through a sieve into a bowl.  Stir in the lemon zest.  Let the filling cool slightly.

Spoon the filling (it should still be warm) into the cooled pie crust and smooth over the top with the back of a spoon.

Make the Meringue:  Place the egg whites and cream of tartar in a bowl and beat until they form soft peaks.  Gradually drizzle in the sugar while beating until the mixture reaches stiff peaks.  Spread the meringue over the top of the pie, forming occasional peaks.  (The meringue should be slightly thicker in the center than at the edges.

Bake the pie until the meringue browns slightly, about 10 minutes.  Let the pie cool on a rack.  Refrigerate the pie for at least 2 hours before serving.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

             Marinated Lamb Kebabs With A Chile-Yogurt Sauce

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  lamb shoulder -- cut 1" cubes
  1                     sweet onion -- cubed
                        = (such as a Walla Walla)
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     orange -- zested
  3                     oranges -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CHILE-YOGURT SAUCE ===
  1                cup  whole-milk yogurt
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  cumin seeds -- toasted, ground
  1         tablespoon  chili powder -- toasted
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To prepare the kebabs, skewer the lamb pieces alternating with the onions into 6 large metal skewers.  Place the kebabs in a large baking dish.  In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic, orange zest and juice, mint, and oil.  Pour the marinade over the kebabs and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours.

While the lamb is marinating, prepare the yogurt sauce.  Whisk together the yogurt, garlic, cumin, and chile powder in a bowl.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Refrigerate until you are ready to serve.

To grill the kebabs, oil the grill and prepare a hot fire.  If you are using a gas grill, preheat on high.  If you are using a charcoal grill, let the coals burn until they are covered with gray ash.  The fire is hot when you can hold your hand over the grill for no longer than 5 seconds.

Remove the lamb from the marinade and drain very well.  Place the skewers on the grill and grill, turning once or twice, for 6 to 8 minutes for medium doneness.

Place the skewers on a serving platter, and garnish with mint sprigs.  Serve warm, with the sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GLAZE ===
  1                cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cider vinegar
                        === MINI MEAT LOAVES ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2                     celery ribs -- finely chopped
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  sour cream
  1                cup  bread crumbs
  1              large  egg -- beaten
     1/4           cup  whole milk
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pound  ground chuck
     1/2         pound  ground pork
     1/2         pound  ground veal or turkey

To make the glaze, combine ketchup, brown sugar, and vinegar.  Set aside.

For the meat loaves, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Oil a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet.

Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat.  Add the celery, onion, and garlic and cook, stirring until the vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes.  Transfer to a large bowl, stir in 1/4 cup of the glaze and let cool.

Add the sour cream, bread crumbs, egg, milk, parsley, mustard, salt, thyme, and pepper and stir until combined.  Add the chuck, pork, and veal and combine well.  (To taste for seasoning, fry a pinch of the meat mixture in a small skillet over medium-high heat until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Season with additional salt and pepper, if needed.)

Scoop mixture onto baking sheet using 1/2 cup measure.  Shape into ovals.

Divide the remaining glaze over the tops of the loaves.  Bake 35 to 40 minutes.  The internal temperature should be 165 degrees when tested with an instant-read thermometer.  Serve at once, while warm.

The meat loaves can be prepared in advance and kept frozen until just before baking.  Wrap the loaves with plastic wrap, then slip into resealable plastic bags.  Increase the cooking time by about 10 minutes for frozen meat loaves.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             slices  white bread
                        Mayonnaise -- as needed
  2             slices  Gouda
  2             slices  turkey
  3              large  eggs -- beaten
     1/4           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        Strawberry slices -- for garnish
                        Orange wedges -- for garnish
                        Blackberry jam -- for serving

On a work surface, lay out 2 slices of bread and spread with mayonnaise.  Top each slice with the 1 slice of Gouda and 1 slice of turkey each.  Put the third slice of bread on top of one stack, and flip the remaining stack on top, cheese-side down, to make a triple-decker sandwich.

Using a knife, cut the crusts off the sandwich (this helps to pinch and seal the ends).  Wrap the sandwich tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours.  (Wrapping the sandwich in plastic wrap, compacts it, and prevents the egg batter from seeping in.)

Combine the eggs and milk in a bowl.  Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.  Unwrap the sandwich and dip it in the egg batter, to coat evenly.  Gently place it in the skillet, and fry, turning once, until golden brown and hot, about 5 minutes total.

Cut the Monte Cristo in 1/2, transfer it to a place, and garnish with the strawberry and orange.  Spoon some jam over each 1/2 and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 1 sandwich.

On a work surface, lay out 2 slices of bread and spread with mayonnaise.  Top each slice with the 1 slice of Gouda and 1 slice of turkey each.  Put the third slice of bread on top of one stack, and flip the remaining stack on top, cheese-side down, to make a triple-decker sandwich.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a knife, cut the crusts off the sandwich (this helps to pinch and seal the ends).  Wrap the sandwich tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours.  (Wrapping the sandwich in plastic wrap, compacts it, and prevents the egg batter from seeping in.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the eggs and milk in a bowl.  Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.  Unwrap the sandwich and dip it in the egg batter, to coat evenly.  Gently place it in the skillet, and fry, turning once, until golden brown and hot, about 5 minutes total.

<DirT>
Cut the Monte Cristo in 1/2, transfer it to a place, and garnish with the strawberry and orange.  Spoon some jam over each 1/2 and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 sandwich.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2        medium  pineapple -- peeled, quartered
                        lengthwise, and cored
     3/4         stick  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
                        === BATTER ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  ground cardamom - (to 3)
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4         stick  unsalted butter -- softened
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1         tablespoon  dark rum
     1/2           cup  unsweetened pineapple juice
  2        tablespoons  dark rum -- for sprinkling over
                        cake

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Topping:  Cut pineapple crosswise into 3/8-inch-thick pieces.  Melt butter in a well-seasoned 10-inch cast-iron skillet.  Add brown sugar and simmer over moderate heat, stirring, 4 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Arrange pineapple on top of sugar mixture in concentric circles, overlapping pieces slightly.

Batter:  Sift together flour, cardamom, baking powder, and salt.  Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, then gradually beat in granulated sugar.  Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in vanilla and rum.  Add 1/2 of the flour mixture and beat on low speed just until blended.  Beat in pineapple juice, then add remaining flour mixture, beating just until blended.  (Batter may appear slightly curdled.)

Spoon batter over pineapple topping and spread evenly.  Bake cake in middle of oven until golden and a tester comes out clean, about 45 minutes.  Let cake stand in skillet 5 minutes.  Invert a plate over skillet and invert cake onto plate (keeping plate and skillet firmly pressed together).  Replace any pineapple stuck to bottom of skillet.  Sprinkle rum over cake and cool on plate on a rack.

Serve cake just warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Cooks' Notes:  Some of the food editors found 3 teaspoons of cardamom to be too much, but others loved the intense flavor.

Cake may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring to room temperature before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  shredded cooked salmon
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated lime zest
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  1                cup  coarse-ground pistachio nuts
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        Lime wedges -- for garnish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     pork rib chops, 2" thick
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             slices  fontina, 1/2" by 3"
  8                     thin slices Canadian bacon
  2               cups  panko bread crumbs (Japanese-style)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  3              large  eggs -- beaten
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil

Using a small knife, make a pocket in the rounded side of each chop.  Spread some of the mustard into each pocket.  Season the chops with salt and pepper, inside and out.

Wrap each slice of fontina with 2 slices the bacon, forming a package.  Tuck 1 cheese package into each pocket.  Using toothpicks, pin the pockets shut.

Put the panko in a large bowl.  Place the flour and eggs in separate flat bottomed bowls or lipped plates.  Working with 1 pork chop at a time, dredge it in the flour, dip in the egg, and press all over into the panko.  Transfer the chops to a parchment paper-lined plate.  Repeat with the remaining chops.  (The pork chops can be prepared up to this point and refrigerated up to overnight.)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the breaded chops and cook, turning once, until golden brown.  Transfer to a baking sheet and bake until cooked through, about 20 to 25 minutes.

Divide the chops among plates and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  chicken - (abt 4 lbs)
  1              large  onion -- stuck with
  1                     whole clove
  1               head  garlic -- left unpeeled,
                        and halved horizontally
  1                     bay leaf
  8              small  leeks, white and pale green parts only -- root ends trimmed
  12             small  waxy-style potatoes - (1 1/2" to 2") -- halved
  12             small  carrots - (abt 1 1/4 lb) -- peeled
  8              small  parsnips - (abt 1 1/4 lb) -- peeled
                        Coarse sea salt -- as needed
                        = (preferably Fleur de Sel)
                        Cornichons or gherkins -- as needed
                        Grated Gruyere -- as needed

Put the chicken in a 7- to 8-quart heavy pot with the onion, garlic, and bay leaf.  Pour in enough water to just cover the chicken and bring to a boil.  Skim off any scum that rises to the surface.  Reduce the heat and gently simmer the chicken, covered, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, clean the leeks.  Split them lengthwise to within 1 1/2 inch of the root end, leaving the root end intact.  Submerge the leeks in a large bowl of water, let them soak to release any dirt or sand, for several minutes.  Lift the leeks out of the water and discard the water.

Add the leeks, potatoes, carrots, and parsnips to the chicken and continue to simmer, partially covered, until tender and the juices of the chicken run clear when a thigh is pierced with a skewer, about 25 minutes more.

Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest, loosely covered with foil, about 10 minutes.

Carve the chicken and arrange it on a large platter surrounded by the vegetables.  Sprinkle the chicken with the coarse salt.  Season the broth with salt and pepper and serve it on the side with the cornichons and cheese.

This recipe yields about 4 to 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Alex Goren
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- finely chopped
  2             medium  onions -- finely chopped
     1/2         pound  pancetta -- minced
  1              pound  lean ground beef
  1              pound  ground pork butt
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  8               cups  Broth For Ragu Alla Bolognese -- (see recipe)
                        = (or low-sodium beef broth)
     3/8           cup  whole milk
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Cooked tagliatelle or pappardelle
                        Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- as needed

In a large, deep saute pan, heat olive oil over high heat and add carrots, celery, onions, and pancetta and cook, stirring, until vegetables are lightly browned, about 6 minutes.  Add the beef and cook another 2 minutes.  Add pork and cook until meat is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.

Whisk together the tomato paste and 1 cup of the broth, and add it to meat.  Place pan over low heat so that sauce just barely simmers.  When broth has evaporated, add another cup.  Continue to cook, stirring occasionally and adding a cup of broth when stew becomes dry, until all the broth has been added, about 3 hours.

Add milk and butter, and continue to simmer very gently until milk has reduced and sauce is very thick, about 2 minutes.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper, and serve over tagliatelle or pappardelle with Parmigiano-Reggiano.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a large, deep saute pan, heat olive oil over high heat and add carrots, celery, onions, and pancetta and cook, stirring, until vegetables are lightly browned, about 6 minutes.  Add the beef and cook another 2 minutes.  Add pork and cook until meat is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk together the tomato paste and 1 cup of the broth, and add it to meat.  Place pan over low heat so that sauce just barely simmers.  When broth has evaporated, add another cup.  Continue to cook, stirring occasionally and adding a cup of broth when stew becomes dry, until all the broth has been added, about 3 hours.

Add milk and butter, and continue to simmer very gently until milk has reduced and sauce is very thick, about 2 minutes.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper, and serve over tagliatelle or pappardelle with Parmigiano-Reggiano.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POTATOES ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  small potatoes -- cut 1/8"-thk rounds
                        = (such as ruby crescents)
  1             medium  onion -- quartered
                        lengthwise, sliced crosswise 1/4" thk
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary

                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === SNAPPER ===
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus more as needed
  20                    garlic cloves -- roasted
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary
  4                     skin-on red snapper fillets - (7 oz ea)
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  clam broth -- plus more as needed
  2                     ripe tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/4" dice
  16                    Kalamata olives -- pitted, and
                        coarsely chopped - (abt 1/3 cup)
  2        tablespoons  roughly-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  8                     thin-sliced rounds lemon

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Make the Potatoes:  Heat the oil in an ovenproof 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-low heat.  Add the potatoes and cook, stirring, until soft, about 10 minutes.  (The potatoes shouldn't brown.)  Add the onion, rosemary, and thyme, and season with salt and pepper.  Cook, covered, until the onions soften, about 5 minutes.  Transfer the potatoes to bowl and set aside.  (The potatoes may be made up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated.)

Make the Snapper:  Heat the oil in the ovenproof skillet over medium heat.  Arrange the potatoes in 4 thick mounds in the skillet and scatter the garlic and rosemary around them.

Season the snapper with salt and pepper.  Place 1 fillet on top of each mound.  Add the wine, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.  Pour in the clam broth.  Bring to a boil, cover, and braise in the oven until the snapper is barely opaque in the center, about 7 to 8 minutes.

Using a slotted spatula, transfer the potato mounds topped with the snapper to the center of 4 warmed dinner plates.  Return the skillet to high heat and boil until lightly thickened, about 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, olives and parsley and cook for 15 seconds.  Taste for balance, adding some olive oil or more clam broth, if desired.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spoon half the sauce over the fish fillets and pour the rest into a warmed sauce boat.  Serve immediately, garnished with the lemon slices, with the sauce passed on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Make the Potatoes:  Heat the oil in an ovenproof 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-low heat.  Add the potatoes and cook, stirring, until soft, about 10 minutes.  (The potatoes shouldn&apos;t brown.)  Add the onion, rosemary, and thyme, and season with salt and pepper.  Cook, covered, until the onions soften, about 5 minutes.  Transfer the potatoes to bowl and set aside.  (The potatoes may be made up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the Snapper:  Heat the oil in the ovenproof skillet over medium heat.  Arrange the potatoes in 4 thick mounds in the skillet and scatter the garlic and rosemary around them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the snapper with salt and pepper.  Place 1 fillet on top of each mound.  Add the wine, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.  Pour in the clam broth.  Bring to a boil, cover, and braise in the oven until the snapper is barely opaque in the center, about 7 to 8 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a slotted spatula, transfer the potato mounds topped with the snapper to the center of 4 warmed dinner plates.  Return the skillet to high heat and boil until lightly thickened, about 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, olives and parsley and cook for 15 seconds.  Taste for balance, adding some olive oil or more clam broth, if desired.  Season with salt and pepper.  Spoon half the sauce over the fish fillets and pour the rest into a warmed sauce boat.  Serve immediately, garnished with the lemon slices, with the sauce passed on the side.

             Roasted Leg Of Lamb With Saffron And Olive Salsa

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Cat Cora
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALSA ===
  1                cup  Champagne vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  saffron threads
  2               cups  olive oil
  1                cup  oil-cured olives -- pitted, and
                        finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  preserved lemon -- diced small
  1         tablespoon  cracked black pepper
                        === LAMB ===
  1                     leg of lamb - (5 to 6 lbs) -- excess fat trimmed
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh oregano
  1              liter  lemon -- juiced
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8              small  rosemary sprigs
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  red wine

Make the Salsa:  In a small saucepan, bring the vinegar and saffron to a boil for 1 minute.  Pour into a bowl and whisk in the olive oil slowly allowing it to incorporate and emulsify.  Add the olives, lemon, and pepper.  Set aside.

Make the Lamb:  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Using a knife, make 8 deep slits into the meatiest parts of the lamb.  Rub the lamb all over with the oil, oregano, lemon, and salt.  Tuck the rosemary and garlic into the slits.

Place the lamb on a rack in a roasting pan and roast until well browned, about 30 minutes.  Lower heat to 350 degrees and roast about 10 to 15 minutes more per pound.  Alternatively, roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part (without touching the bone), reads 130 to 135 degrees for medium-rare, 140 to 150 for medium.  (Add about a cup water to the roasting pan to keep drippings moist, if desired.)  Remove the lamb from the oven when it's about 5 degrees shy of preferred doneness.  (The internal temperature will rise as the meat rests.)

Transfer the lamb to a cutting board, cover with foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, place the roasting pan over high heat.  Pour in the wine, and cook, scraping up the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, until reduced slightly.  Skim fat from the juices.

Thinly slice the lamb and transfer to a warmed platter.  Pour the juices over the lamb and top with the salsa.  Serve immediately with orzo or white rice.

This recipe yields about 10 to 12 servings.

                        more for brushing
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Combine the cream cheese, smoked salmon, peperoncini, shallot, lemon zest, and dill in a small bowl.  Blend well with a fork and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  You should have about 2/3 cup.

Cut each salmon fillet horizontally down the center through its thickness, almost to the other edge but not quite through.  Open each fillet like a book and flatten.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place a quarter of the cream cheese mixture in the center of one half and cover with the other side to enclose the filling.  Season the outside with salt and pepper.  Refrigerate while preparing the phyllo.

Arrange 1 sheet of the phyllo on a large work surface.  Brush with butter and top with another sheet of the dough.  Repeat the procedure with the remaining phyllo dough and butter.  Cut the stacked slices of phyllo into 4 pieces.

Arrange a piece of the filled salmon in the center of each piece.  Drizzle the salmon with equal amounts of the olive oil and lemon juice.  Fold in the sides of the phyllo to enclose the fillet.  Place the packages seam-side down on a baking sheet.  (The recipe can be prepared up to 4 hours ahead at this point.  Keep refrigerated, covered with plastic wrap, until ready to bake.)

Lightly brush the top of the packages with olive oil.  Bake until lightly browned, 18 to 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

               Sauteed Pork Loin With Mustard And Grapes II

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  boneless pork loin, 1/4" thk - -- (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  1                cup  seedless red or green grapes -- halved
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock -- preferably homemade
  1           teaspoon  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Dijon mustard
                        Additional kosher salt and freshly-ground
                        black pepper to taste

Sprinkle a small amount of water on a large sheet of plastic wrap.

Place 2 of the pork slices on top of the plastic and sprinkle again with water.  Cover with another sheet of plastic wrap and pound with a rolling pin or meat pounder until about 1/4-inch thick.  Repeat with the remaining pork.

Mix the flour with the salt and pepper in a shallow pie plate.  Heat half the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until almost smoking.  Working in 2 batches, place the pork in the flour mixture and turn to coat on all sides.  Shake off the excess flour and add to the skillet.  Cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to a plate or platter and cover loosely with foil.  Repeat with the remaining butter, oil, and pork.

Return the skillet to the heat and add the onion and grapes.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring often, until the onions are slightly softened, about 5 minutes.  Increase the heat to high, pour in the wine, and bring to a boil.  Cook rapidly, stirring to pick up any browned bits in the bottom of the skillet, until reduced to about 1 tablespoon.  Add the stock and sugar and boil until reduced by half.

Reduce the heat to medium and return the pork to the skillet with any accumulated juices.  Simmer gently until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.  Transfer the pork to a large heated platter.  Remove the skillet from heat, whisk in the mustard, and season the sauce with salt and pepper.  Pour the sauce over the pork and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                    Sauteed Spinach With Garlic Chips

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2            bunches  fresh spinach - (1 lb ea) -- large stems removed
  3              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

If the spinach wasn't pre-washed, wash the leaves in several changes of cold water.  Rinse well and drain in a colander.  Spin dry.

Use a sharp, thin-bladed paring knife or a truffle slicer to cut the garlic lengthwise into uniformly sized paper-thin slices.  Place the slices in a large skillet and add the olive oil.  Set the skillet over low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the slices start to turn golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Remove the chips with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Pile the spinach into the skillet and increase the heat to medium-high.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Cook, stirring constantly, until wilted but not soft, 2 to 3 minutes.  Season again if desired.  Serve hot with the garlic chips sprinkled on top.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BRINE ===
  4               cups  water
     1/2           cup  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  sugar
  36                    shell-on medium-large shrimp
  1                cup  ice
                        === COURT BOUILLON ===
  16              cups  water
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
  2                     bay leaves -- preferably fresh
  1                     lemon -- halved
                        Wasabi Cocktail Sauce -- (see recipe)

Make the Brine:  In a large bowl, whisk together the water, salt, and sugar until dissolved.  Add the shrimp and ice and let soak for 20 to 30 minutes.  Drain.

Meanwhile, make the Court Bouillon:  In a large saucepan, combine the water, salt, peppercorns and bay leaves.  Squeeze the lemon juice into the water, add the lemon halves, and bring to a boil

Add the shrimp to the water and cook until they just turn opaque, about 3 minutes.  Drain the shrimp, transfer to a baking sheet, and let cool.

When the shrimp are cool enough to handle, peel and de-vein them and chill in the refrigerator.

When ready to serve, divide the cocktail sauce among 4 martini glasses and hang the shrimp around the rims.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields about 6 servings.

     1/4           cup  grape seed oil
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        === SALAD ===
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4               cups  torn soft lettuces - (loosely packed)
                        = (such as red oak and lolla rossa)
     1/4           cup  finely-diced red onion

     3/4           cup  casing-removed chorizo sausage - (6 oz) -- optional
  10            ounces  dried fideo (vermicelli) noodles
                        = (preferably angel hair)
  1                cup  beef or chicken broth
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
                        = (preferably Mexican)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Salt - (abt a scant tspn)
  2             medium  zucchini -- cut 1/4" dice
     1/4           cup  thick cream - (to 1/2) -- optional
                        = (or whipping cream or creme fraiche)
     2/3           cup  finely-grated Mexican queso anejo or
                        Parmesan cheese
                        A few tablespoons roughly-chopped cilantro -- for garnish

For dried chiles, toast them on an ungreased griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat, turning regularly and pressing flat with a spatula, until very aromatic, about 30 seconds.  In a small bowl, cover the chiles with hot water and re-hydrate 30 minutes, stirring frequently to ensure even soaking.  Drain and discard the water.  (Canned chiles need only be removed from their sauce.)

Roast the unpeeled garlic on the griddle or skillet, turning occasionally, until soft, about 15 minutes; cool and peel.  Roast 1 1/2 pounds of the tomatoes on a baking sheet 4 inches below a very hot broiler until blackened on 1 side, about 6 minutes, then flip and roast the other side.  Cool, then peel, collecting all the juices with the tomatoes.

In a food processor or blender, process the roasted tomatoes, rehydrated or canned chiles, and garlic to a medium-fine puree.  Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in medium-size (4-quart) pot (such as a Dutch oven or Mexican cazuela) over medium-high.  Add the puree and stir for about 5 minutes as it sears and thickens.  Set aside.

If using chorizo, cook in a little oil over medium heat, breaking up large lumps as you go, until thoroughly cooked, about 10 minutes.  Scoop it out with a slotted spoon, draining as much oil as possible back into the skillet.

Pour 6 tablespoons of the remaining oil into the skillet and return to the heat.  When quite hot (drop a stray noodle in -- it should sizzle but not brown immediately), lay in about 1/3 of the noodle nests to fry until noticeably browned, about 1 minute, then flip and brown the other side.  Remove with a slotted spoon, draining as much oil as possible back into the skillet, and drain on paper towels.  Continue until all have been browned.

Add the broth, oregano, and pepper to the tomato sauce.  Core the remaining 1 pound of tomatoes and chop into 1/4-inch bits.  Add and simmer briskly until the sauce thickens to the consistency of a juicy tomato sauce, about 5 minutes.  Taste and season with salt.

Add the noodles.  In about 2 minutes pull the "nests" apart (they'll have softened enough to do it at this point), then add the zucchini and the chorizo (if you're using it).  Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are tender but still firm, about 2 minutes.

If using the cream, add it now, raise the heat to medium-high and boil quickly until the sauce returns to its previous consistency.  Taste again and readjust the salt, if necessary.

Stir in half of the grated cheese, scoop into a warm serving dish, sprinkle on the remaining cheese and the cilantro garnish, and it's ready to serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RICE BALLS ===
  1                cup  uncooked short-grain white rice
  1              pound  ground chicken
  1                     egg -- well beaten
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1                can  water chestnuts - (8 oz) -- finely chopped
  5                     pickled jalapeÒos -- minced
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  1         tablespoon  salt
                        Lettuce or cabbage leaves -- to prevent rice
                        balls from sticking
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
  6        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  simple syrup
                        = (equal amounts of sugar and water
                        heated until sugar melts, then cooled)

Rinse rice and soak for 2 to 3 hours.  Drain and set aside.

Mix together the chicken, egg, onion, water chestnuts, jalapeÒos, cilantro, and salt in a bowl.  Shape into 24 (1-inch) balls.

Cover a baking sheet with waxed paper.  Spread the rice onto a flat surface and roll the balls of chicken to coat with rice.  Place the rice balls on the waxed paper, cover with a second piece of waxed paper, and refrigerate or freeze for at least 1 hour.  Once chilled, you can transfer the rice balls to an airtight container, separating them with layers of waxed paper, and refrigerate or freeze for future use.

When it's almost time to serve, boil water in a pot or the bottom half of a steamer.  Line the steaming basket or top half of the steamer with the lettuce leaves, place the rice balls on top of the lettuce, cover, and steam over a rolling boil for about 30 minutes.

To make the dipping sauce, stir together the soy sauce, lime juice, and simple syrup.  Serve in a small bowl alongside the rice balls.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  green beans -- trimmed
  3                     plum tomatoes - (to 5) -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped - (1 1/2 cups)
                        = (or 1 1/2 cups chopped drained canned
                        tomatoes)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  shredded fresh mint leaves

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes longer.  Stir in the beans and tomatoes.  Add just enough cold water to come slightly below the level of the beans.

Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, season with salt and pepper, and cover.  Cook, covered, stirring from time to time, until very tender, 20 to 25 minutes.

Use tongs to transfer the beans to a plate or platter.  Place the skillet on top of the stove.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Cook, stirring often, until the cooking liquid is reduced to about 1 cup.

Return the beans to the skillet and season with salt and pepper.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.  Stir in the mint and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COBBLER ===
  1               pint  strawberries -- rinsed, quartered
     1/2         pound  rhubarb - (2 stalks) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1"-thk slices
  5        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon zest
  1              pinch  table salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  unsalted butter -- cut into slivers
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar -- plus
                        more for sprinkling
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt
  2        tablespoons  very-finely chopped crystallized ginger
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
     1/4           cup  buttermilk -- plus
                        more for brushing

To prepare the cobbler, place the strawberries and rhubarb in a large, heavy saucepan.  Add 1 tablespoon sugar.  Stir over high heat until the sugar has started to dissolve, 1 to 2 minutes.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring often, until the fruit has exuded some of its liquid, about 5 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine the fruit and all liquid with the remaining 4 tablespoons sugar, the flour, lemon zest, and salt.  Cool slightly, pour into a lightly buttered 1-quart baking dish, and dot with the slivers of butter.

To make the topping, preheat the toaster oven to 400 degrees.  Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.  Use a pastry blender or your fingertips to mix in the ginger and to cut in the butter until the mixture resembles the texture of small peas.  Quickly stir in the buttermilk to form a soft dough.

Turn out onto a well-floured work surface, knead into a ball, and roll out to a thickness of about 1/2 inch.  Use a 1 1/2-inch cookie cutter to cut out 4 biscuits.  Gather the trimmings and roll out again.  Cut out 2 more biscuits.

Arrange the biscuits snugly over the fruit.  Brush lightly with additional buttermilk, sprinkle with sugar, and bake until the cobbler is bubbly and the biscuits are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

  1                     frozen puff pastry sheet -- thawed
                        = (from a 17 1/4-oz package)
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- softened
     1/2           cup  sugar
  9                     gala apples - (3 to 4 lbs) -- peeled, quartered
                        lengthwise, and cored
                        === EQUIPMENT ===
                        A well-seasoned 10" cast-iron skillet

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Roll pastry sheet into a 10 1/2-inch square on a floured work surface with a floured rolling pin.  Brush off excess flour and cut out a 10-inch round with a sharp knife, using a plate as a guide.  Transfer round to a baking sheet and chill.

Spread butter thickly on bottom and side of skillet and pour sugar evenly over bottom.  Arrange as many apples as will fit vertically on sugar, packing them tightly in concentric circles.  Apples will stick up above rim of skillet.

Cook apples over moderately-high heat, undisturbed, until juices are deep golden and bubbling, 18 to 25 minutes.  (Don't worry if juices color unevenly.)

Put skillet in middle of oven over a piece of foil to catch any drips.  Bake 20 minutes (apples will settle slightly), then remove from oven and lay pastry round over apples.

Bake tart until pastry is browned, 20 to 25 minutes.  Transfer skillet to a rack and cool at least 10 minutes.

Just before serving, invert a platter with lip over skillet and, using potholders to hold skillet and plate tightly together, invert tart onto platter.  Replace any apples that stick to skillet.  (Don't worry if there are black spots; they won't affect the flavor of the tart.)  Brush any excess caramel from skillet over apples.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Cook's Note:  Tart can cool in skillet up to 30 minutes.  It can also stand, uncovered, up to 5 hours, then be heated over moderately-low heat 1 to 2 minutes to loosen caramel.  Shake skillet gently to loosen tart before inverting.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whole milk
  1                     vanilla bean -- halved lengthwise
  5              large  egg yolks
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt

Combine the milk and vanilla bean in a small saucepan.  Heat over medium-high heat until small bubbles form around the edge.  Remove from the heat, cover, and infuse the milk for 10 minutes.

Scrape the seeds of the bean into the milk.  Rinse and dry the bean and save for another use (such as putting it in your bag of sugar, which will turn it into vanilla sugar).

Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar and salt in a large heatproof bowl until thick and light, 3 to 4 minutes.  Stir in the hot milk.  Return the custard to the pan and stir over low heat until slightly thickened or until a finger drawn across a wooden spoon dipped in the sauce leaves a mark (about 160 degrees).  Do not boil, or the sauce will curdle.

Strain into a large bowl and cool to room temperature.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

               Vegetable Curry (With Chicken, If You Want)

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     garlic cloves
  1              piece  peeled fresh ginger - (abt 3")
  1         tablespoon  water -- plus more as needed
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  coriander seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin seeds
  6                     green cardamom pods
  4              whole  allspice
  3                     whole cloves
  1                     cinnamon stick - (3" long) -- broken in half
  1                     bay leaf -- preferably fresh
  1             medium  yellow onion -- sliced
  2          teaspoons  Madras-style curry powder
     1/2                jalapeÒo -- or more to taste
     1/2           cup  canned whole peeled tomatoes with puree -- roughly chopped
  8               cups  mixed 1"-cut vegetables
                        = (such as cauliflower, potatoes, green
                        beans, or eggplant)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                can  unsweetened coconut milk - (14 oz)
  2               cups  cubed (1") cooked chicken -- (optional)
                        = (preferably thigh or leg)
                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish
                        Basmati rice -- for serving
                        Chutney -- for serving

In a small food processor (mini-chopper), combine the garlic, ginger, and 1 tablespoon water and puree to a paste.

Heat the oil in a stew pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add the coriander, cumin, cardamom, allspice, cloves, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf and cook, stirring constantly, until toasted and fragrant and the cinnamon stick unfurls, about 30 seconds.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic ginger paste, curry powder, and jalapeÒo and cook, stirring, until lightly browned and fragrant, about 1 minute.

Add the tomato and cook, stirring, until the oil begin to separate and there is a distinctive crackling sound as the ingredients "re-fry" in the oil, about 6 minutes.

Add the vegetables, season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.

Add the coconut milk and enough water to just cover the vegetables.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, covered, until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Using a slotted spoon transfer the vegetables to a bowl.  Bring the broth to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to a sauce-like consistency.  If using the chicken, add and reheat.  Return the vegetables to the sauce and stir to combine.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer to a platter and garnish with the cilantro.

This recipe yields about 4 to 6 main course servings.

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     eggs -- separated
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  6             ounces  white chocolate -- melted
  2               cups  heavy whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  minced candied ginger
                        Fresh berries -- as accompaniment
                        Mint sprigs -- for garnish

Place the egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the whip attachment, and whip on high speed until very light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes.  Gently fold in the melted white chocolate; set aside.

Place the cream in a large bowl and whisk just until the cream starts to thicken, then gently fold in the egg yolk mixture and the candied ginger.

Place the egg whites in the clean bowl of a mixer fitted with the whip attachment, and whip on high speed until they just hold soft peaks.  Gently fold the whites into the egg yolk mixture.

Transfer the mixture to a covered container and freeze for at least 2 hours.  Scoop and serve with fresh berries and mint sprigs.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."
