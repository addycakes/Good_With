                 'Jump-In-The-Mouth' SautÈed Veal Cutlets

Recipe By     :Julia della Croce
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  tender milk-fed veal scalloppine cutlets - -- (12 small slices)
  12             large  fresh sage leaves
  12                    thin slices prosciutto - (not paper-thin)
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white or black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  water

Place a piece of waxed paper on a cutting board and place a slice of veal on it.  Cover the meat with another piece of waxed paper.  Using the blunt side of a meat mallet, pound lightly on both sides to flatten and tenderize, being sure not to break the meat.  To pound the reverse side, just flip the meat over, sandwiched between the sheets of waxed paper.  Flatten all the slices very thinly in this fashion, replacing the waxed paper when necessary.

Cut each slice into a piece no bigger than roughly 3 by 4 inches and discard the trimmed bits.  You should have 12 thin scalloppine.

Place a leaf of sage on each slice, then add a slice of prosciutto the same size as the veal.  Secure with a toothpick in the same fashion as you would place a straight pin in fabric to mark it.

In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter with half the olive oil over medium heat.  Add half the veal, increase heat to high, and sautÈ until lightly golden on the bottom, 2 or 3 minutes.  Season the meat with salt and pepper as it sautÈs.  Turn the slices quickly to brown the other side for 2 minutes.  Transfer the veal to a warmed dish.  Add 2 more tablespoons of the butter and the remaining olive oil to the skillet and repeat to cook the remaining veal.  When all the meat has cooked, add the remaining tablespoon butter and the water to the pan and stir.  As soon as the butter melts, take it off the heat and pour it over the veal.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Saltimbocca, meaning veal that "jumps in the mouth" because it is so tasty you can't wait to eat it, was invented in the city of Rome and is one of its most characteristic dishes.  Outside Italy, this simple recipe is too often overwrought.  The dish needs only tender milk-fed veal, authentic air-cured prosciutto, fresh sage, and good butter.  It is critical not to overcook the veal.

Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  almond meal
                        = (abt 12 oz whole almonds ground to a
                        powder)
  1                cup  walnut meal
                        = (about 6 oz walnut halves ground to a
                        powder)
  1 1/2           cups  sifted powdered sugar
  3              large  egg whites
  1           teaspoon  vanilla

Place 30 (1 1/2-inch) fluted paper cups on a baking sheet.  Set aside.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  In a large bowl, mix the almond meal, walnut meal, and 1 cup of the powdered sugar.  Sprinkle the remaining sugar on a large plate.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, beat the egg whites and the vanilla until stiff.  Using a spatula, gently fold the nut mixture into the egg whites.  With your fingers, knead lightly to obtain a homogeneous dough.  In between the palms of your hands, fashion balls 1-inch in diameter.  Roll each ball in the prepared powdered sugar and set it inside a paper cup.  Bake until the macaroons turn a light gold, 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool.  Store in a tightly sealed container for up to 2 weeks.

This recipe yields about 30 macaroons.

Comments:  Whether during a cozy winter afternoon or a balmy summer evening, these macaroons pair perfectly with a good cup of strong coffee.

               Apple Tart With Hazelnut Brown Sugar Topping

Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BROWN SUGAR TOPPING ===
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened, and
                        cut into small pieces
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped hazelnuts
                        === FILLING ===
  3               cups  thinly-sliced tart apples
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  flour
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === CRUST ===
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              large  egg -- room temperature
  1              large  egg yolk -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Make The Topping:  In a medium-size bowl, mix together the flour and sugar.  Using a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the hazelnuts and, using your hands, toss until all the ingredients are well combined.  Set aside.

Make The Filling:  Place all the ingredients in a large bowl and toss gently until the fruit is evenly coated.  Set aside.

Make The Crust:  In a large bowl, on the low speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until smooth.  Add the egg and egg yolk, and mix well.  Add the flour and baking powder, and beat until just combined.

Gather the dough into a ball and on a lightly floured surface, roll it out to fit a 10-inch tart pan.  Fit the dough into the pan and trim the edge flush with the rim of the pan.

Transfer the fruit filling into the crust and sprinkle the brown sugar topping evenly over the fruit.  Place the tart on a baking sheet and bake for 50 minutes.  Cool on a wire rack for 1 to 2 hours.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields one 10-inch tart.

Comments:  This tart is a nice alternative to apple pie, and it makes a great dessert for a dinner party, especially if served with vanilla ice cream and perhaps some caramel sauce.

Make The Crust:  In a large bowl, on the low speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until smooth.  Add the egg and egg yolk, and mix well.  Add the flour and baking powder, and beat until just combined.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Gather the dough into a ball and on a lightly floured surface, roll it out to fit a 10-inch tart pan.  Fit the dough into the pan and trim the edge flush with the rim of the pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the fruit filling into the crust and sprinkle the brown sugar topping evenly over the fruit.  Place the tart on a baking sheet and bake for 50 minutes.  Cool on a wire rack for 1 to 2 hours.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields one 10-inch tart.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This tart is a nice alternative to apple pie, and it makes a great dessert for a dinner party, especially if served with vanilla ice cream and perhaps some caramel sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  dried sour cherries
  2        tablespoons  kirschwasser (cherry-flavored liqueur)
                        = (or dark rum)
  3             pounds  cooking apples (such as Cortlands) -- washed, cored,
                        peeled, and quartered
  1         tablespoon  fresh orange or lemon juice
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  sea salt
  1           teaspoon  ground cardamom
  1                cup  almond meal or unflavored bread crumbs
  3          teaspoons  grated orange zest
                        === PASTRY ===
  12                    sheets filo (phyllo) dough -- defrosted, and
                        covered according to the manufacturer's
                        directions
     1/2           cup  delicate and mild olive oil
  1                cup  almond meal
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for garnish

Soak the dried cherries in the kirschwasser for 20 to 30 minutes.  If the cherries are very dry, combine them in a small saucepan and heat the two together before setting aside to soak.

Using a food processor or a hand grater, shred the apple with the orange juice to prevent browning.  Mix in the sugar, salt, cardamom, almond meal, and orange zest.  Drain the cherries and add them to the apple mixture.  Set aside while you assemble the pastry.  (Do not prepare the apple mixture ahead of time; if it sits too long, it will get too watery.  If that happens, drain the apple quarters and place them in a bowl.  Immediately sprinkle mixture in a colander before using it).

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease a cookie sheet, and line it with greased parchment paper if desired.

Lay a large sheet of parchment paper or cloth on a large work surface, such as a kitchen island or table, to cover an area 30 by 30 inches in size.  Take out the first sheet of filo from the package; reroll the rest and keep the dough covered with a tea towel, waxed paper, or plastic wrap Lay the first sheet of dough with the long edge facing you.  Using a pastry brush, paint the whole sheet with olive oil.  Lay the second sheet of filo next to the first sheet, again with the long edge facing you, with a 2-inch overlap on the short edges.  Paint this sheet with oil.  Now you have a long skinny rectangle.

Repeat with the next two sheets, placing them so that the long edges over-lap by 2 inches.  Now you have a large rectangle that's twice as long and twice as wide as a single filo sheet.

Repeat this process with the next 2 sheets, adding them to the rectangle to make a square.  Every sheet should be coated with oil, and you should be able to see 6 connected sheets in front of you, forming a 30-inch square.  Do the same thing all over again to form a second layer on top of the first, so that you end up with a two-layer 30-inch square of filo that is painted with olive oil.

Sprinkle the almond meal over the first third of the dough, leaving an empty 2-inch border on the bottom and sides.  Using a spoon, place the apple filling on the almond meal, leaving a 3-inch border along the whole long side.  Fold in the two side edges of the dough, using the parchment or cloth to help you handle the fragile dough.  Now, again using the parchment or cloth, start rolling the dough around the filling, pulling the paper away as you roll to prevent it from rolling into the strudel.  Keep rolling until all the dough is wrapped around the filling.  Paint the strudel with olive oil.  Roll the strudel on the prepared baking sheet so it is seam-side down, bending the ends to form a horseshoe shape (since the roll will be longer than the baking sheet).  Don't worry if the strudel cracks when you curve it ó once you slice it, these cracks will not be apparent.

Bake the strudel for 1 hour or until golden and crisp.  Let it cool on the pan.  Then carefully remove it from the pan, using a long spatula, and dust it well with confectioners' sugar.  Cut into slices and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 12 to 14 servings.

Comments:  My mother used to describe her grandmother's strudel as being so big and so thick that she rolled it on a huge linen tablecloth.  In this strudel, I paste 12 sheets of filo dough together to make a 30 inch square of dough to fill and roll.  Unlike my great-grandmother, I use olive oil instead of melted butter to paint the strudel leaves.  I particularly like The Fillo Factory's organic filo; they also make filo of spelt and whole wheat.  You'll need a pastry brush for painting the sheets of dough with oil

Don't be daunted by this recipe ó it's really pretty easy.  Just remember to thaw the frozen filo overnight in the refrigerator, then bring it to room temperature, still in the box, for an hour or two.

Leftover strudel can be wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated.  Before serving, bake it, uncovered, at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes to recrisp the pastry.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PISTACHIO TART SHELLS ===
     1/2           cup  finely-ground pistachio nuts
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2         sticks  unsalted butter -- chilled
                        Chopped zest of 1 lemon
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
                        === APRICOT AND GOAT CHEESE FILLING ===
  16                    ripe apricots -- pitted, quartered
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  8             ounces  goat cheese
     1/2           cup  toasted shelled pistachios -- (see Note)

Make The Tart Shells:  Lightly flour a work surface.  Place the nuts and sugar in a food processor fitted with a steel blade and process until fine.  Add the flour, salt, and butter and pulse until sandy.  Add the zest, eggs, and vanilla and pulse until it forms a shaggy mass.

Place the dough on the work surface and gather into a cohesive mass.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.  Divide into eight portions.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Dust a work surface with flour.  Gently form the dough into 8 flat disks; take care not to overwork the dough.  Beginning in the middle of the circle, and using short but firm strokes, roll up toward 12 o'clock.  Turn clockwise and repeat and continue turning and rolling until the dough is about 1/2-inch larger than the tart shell.  Place the dough in eight 4-inch tart pans, taking care to lay the dough into the "corners" of the pan, between the sides and the bottom.  Gently press into the sides to define the edges.  Using your thumb, clean off the edges by pushing the dough against the edge of the pan or mold to cut off excess.  Line the dough with aluminum foil and top with a heavy layer of rice, beans, or pie weights.

Transfer to the oven and bake until the dough is set and dry to the touch, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove the aluminum foil and bake until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Set aside to cool to room temperature.

Make The Filling:  Place the apricots, sugar, and lemon juice in a bowl and toss well.

Assemble the tarts:  Dot the pistachio tart shells with equal amounts of half of the goat cheese.

Top with pistachios, the apricots, and then dot again with the remaining half of the goat cheese.

Transfer to the oven and bake until golden and bubbly, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This is an intriguing dessert item that is more savory than sweet; the fruit is relatively unadorned and there's very little sugar.  The goat cheese heightens the clean citrus tang of the apricots, but also showcases the sweetness of the fruit.  The pistachios add an additional dimension of texture and earthy flavor without detracting from the other elements.  This can be served hot or at room temperature, for dessert or as a damn good breakfast.

Note:  To toast the nuts, preheat the oven to  degrees.  Place the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Cool before using.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2               cups  sifted cake flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  5              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest - (1 lemon)
  1           teaspoon  orange zest - (1 orange)
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1 1/3           cups  granulated sugar
                        === OPTIONAL DRIED APRICOT FILLING ===
     1/3           cup  dried apricots
     1/3           cup  water

Make The Cake:  Position rack in lower third of the oven; preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Using a paper towel, lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan with solid shortening.  Dust generously with all-purpose flour, shake to distribute, and tap out the excess.

Pour the flour and salt into a triple sifter.  Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper to distribute the salt evenly and to remove any lumps in the flour.

Crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk together just enough to combine yolks and whites.  Add the vanilla and almond extract and stir to combine.

Grate only the colored portion from the lemon and orange rind for their zests: set aside.  Place the butter in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer.

With the flat beater (paddle), cream the butter on medium speed (#5) until it is lighter in color, clings to the sides of the mixing bowl, and has a satiny appearance (this should take 30 to 45 seconds).  Maintaining the same speed, add the sugar in a steady stream.  When all the sugar is added, stop the machine and scrape the mixture clinging to the sides into the center of the bowl.  Continue to cream at the same speed for 3 to 4 minutes or until the mixture is very light in color and fluffy in appearance.

With the mixer still on medium speed, pour in eggs, cautiously at first, tablespoon by tablespoon, as if you were adding oil when making mayonnaise.  If at any time the mixture appears watery or shiny, stop the flow of eggs, and increase the speed until a smooth, silken appearance returns.  Then decrease the speed to medium, and resume adding eggs.  Continue to cream, stopping the mixer and scraping the sides of the bowl at least once.  When the mixture appears almost white and fluffy and has increased in volume (about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes), detach the beater and bowl.  Tap the beater against the edge of the bowl to free the excess.  Stir in the lemon and orange zests with a rubber spatula.

Stir in about one-third of the flour at a time.  Scrape the sides of the bowl often and mix until smooth after each addition.

Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.  With a rubber spatula, spread the batter, working from the center outward and creating a slightly raised ridge around the outside rim of the pan.  (Even though the batter is manipulated so it is higher around the edges and lower in the center, this cake will still peak and crack in the center as it bakes as a result of aeration.  This is characteristic of a heavy batter.)

Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out free of cake.  The cake, with its crust golden, should begin to contract from the pan sides.

Place the cake on a rack to cool for 5 to 10 minutes.  With mitts, tilt and rotate pan, and gently tap it on the counter to see if the cake is releasing from the metal sides.  If not, or if in doubt, run a small metal spatula or the thin blade of a table knife between the outer cake edge and the metal rim, freeing the sides and allowing air to get under the cake as it is rotated.

Cover the cake with a cooling rack, invert it onto the rack, and carefully lift pan to remove it.  Cover with another rack, invert the cake, right side up, and remove the original rack.  Cool completely.

Make The Filling:  No more than 30 minutes before filling the cake, begin the apricot filling, if desired.  Place the apricots in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan.  Pour the water over them and allow to soak for 5 minutes.  Then, over medium heat, bring the mixture to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until almost all the water is evaporated (about 5 to 7 minutes).

While the mixture is warm, spoon it into a food processor fitted with the metal blade, and process until it has a sticky paste consistency.

Fill The Cake:  Once the cake has completely cooled, place it on the counter.  With a 12-inch serrated knife, trim the top of the cake to make it level.  Then turn it upside down, making the top of the cake the base.

With the tip of a small paring knife, lightly trace a V on one short end of the cake, beginning at the corners of the seam (that is, where the sides meet the top) and ending just below the middle of the cake.  Each side or leg of the V should be about 2 1/2 inches long (depending on the size of your cake, of course).  Turn the cake around, and do the same to the other end of the loaf.

Insert the paring knife into the lines you have traced to the depth of about 1/2 inch.  Do this to every corner of the cake.  These notches will serve as a guide for cutting a deep V-shaped piece that will be lifted out of the pound cake.  Position the cake directly in front of you, with one of its short ends parallel to the edge of the counter.  Taking the right side first, insert a 12-inch serrated knife into both notches, and slowly saw diagonally down that side of the V.  Check often to ensure that the knife is staying in the notch and following the correct angle.  Turn the cake around, and repeat the procedure on the other side.  Carefully lift the triangular portion from the body of the cake, and set aside.

Using a metal spatula, spread a thin, even film of the dried apricot filling into the valley you have created in the cake.  Then replace the triangular piece, pressing down gently to fit it into place.  The filling should not be too apparent, and the cake should look almost as it did before being cut.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This luscious, buttery-flavored pound cake incorporates an easy cutting technique and a unique way to fill this delicious and attractive dessert.

Note:  If you plan to serve the cake within 24 hours, wrap it in plastic wrap and store at room temperature.  To freeze, cover the plastic-wrapped package in foil.  Label, indicating the contents and date.  Freeze for no longer than 2 weeks.

Make The Cake:  Position rack in lower third of the oven; preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Using a paper towel, lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan with solid shortening.  Dust generously with all-purpose flour, shake to distribute, and tap out the excess.

Categories    : Desserts                        Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  half-and-half
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  9                     egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  Armagnac

Fill a large bowl or sink with ice.  (The ice bath will need to accommodate the saucepan that you will use to cook the ice cream base.)

In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat the half & half.  When it comes to a boil, remove pan from heat.

Place sugar and egg yolks in a mixing bowl.  Beat with an electric mixer until smooth and pale yellow, about 3 minutes.  Whisking constantly, slowly pour the sugar and egg yolk mixture into the saucepan containing the half & half; return pan to stove over very low heat.  Stir continuously with a wooden spoon until the foam disappears and the mixture is thick enough that the moving spoon leaves a "track" that fills in slowly.

Set pan in the ice bath to stop the cooking process; stir a few times.  Add the Armagnac.  Cool to room temperature.  Transfer batter to an ice cream machine and freeze according to manufacturers instructions.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

Comments:  Ice cream is so versatile.  This flavor is very adult, and though we tend to link frozen desserts with summer, Armagnac ice cream is perfect all year round.  It's magnificent with desserts made with fall fruits like plums, prunes, pears, and figs but also adds a nice finish to summer meals.  The Armagnac is added after the creme anglaise has been cooked, which gives the final ice cream a punch of raw alcohol and the warm, woodsy note of Armagnac.  Feel free to use either cognac or brandy if that's what you have on hand.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RUM SYRUP ===
  1                cup  sugar
     2/3           cup  good dark rum
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
  2               cups  cold heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2          teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
                        === BABA ===
     1/3           cup  dried currants
  1         tablespoon  good dark rum
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  milk
  1            package  dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2                     extra-large eggs -- room temperature
  1 2/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        Rum Syrup -- (above)
     3/4           cup  apricot preserves
                        Whipped Cream (above)

Make The Rum Syrup:  Place the sugar and 1 1/2 cups water in a small saucepan and cook over high heat until the sugar dissolves.  Pour into a 4-cup heatproof measuring cup and allow to cool.  Add the rum and vanilla and set aside.

Make The Whipped Cream:  Whip the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.  When it starts to thicken, add the sugar and vanilla and continue to whip until the cream forms stiff peaks.  Don't overheat, or you'll end up with butter!

Make The Baba:  Combine the currants and rum in a small bowl and set aside.  Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter and brush a 5-cup (6 1/2 by 3 1/2-inch) tube pan or kugelhopf mold with the melted butter.  Be sure to coat every crevice of the pan.  Heat the milk to 115 degrees and then pour it into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Stir in the yeast and sugar and allow to sit for 5 minutes.

With the mixer on low speed, first add the eggs, then the flour, salt, and remaining 4 tablespoons of butter.  Raise the speed to medium-high and beat for 5 minutes.  Scrape down the bowl and beater to form the dough into a ball.  It will be very soft.  Cover the bowl with a damp towel and allow it to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Drain the currants, fold them into the dough with a spatula, and spoon into the prepared pan.  Smooth the top, cover the pan with a damp towel, and allow to rise until the dough reaches the top of the pan, 50 minutes to 1 hour.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees and make the rum syrup.  Bake the cake for about 50 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then tap it out of the cake pan onto a baking rack set over a sheet pan.

Pour all of the rum syrup very slowly onto the warm cake, allowing it all to soak in thoroughly.  Amazingly, the liquid will be absorbed into the cake, so be sure to use all of the syrup.

Heat the preserves with 1 tablespoon of water until runny, press it through a sieve, and brush it on the cake.  Serve with whipped cream piped into the middle of the cake plus an extra bowl on the side.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Baba au rhum was one of the first things I ever made for my husband when we were first married, and we still love it.  Most babas have a strong, slightly harsh rum bite, but I added a little vanilla to the syrup and it rounds out the flavor perfectly for me.

Heat the milk to 115 degrees and then pour it into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Stir in the yeast and sugar and allow to sit for 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With the mixer on low speed, first add the eggs, then the flour, salt, and remaining 4 tablespoons of butter.  Raise the speed to medium-high and beat for 5 minutes.  Scrape down the bowl and beater to form the dough into a ball.  It will be very soft.  Cover the bowl with a damp towel and allow it to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain the currants, fold them into the dough with a spatula, and spoon into the prepared pan.  Smooth the top, cover the pan with a damp towel, and allow to rise until the dough reaches the top of the pan, 50 minutes to 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees and make the rum syrup.  Bake the cake for about 50 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then tap it out of the cake pan onto a baking rack set over a sheet pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour all of the rum syrup very slowly onto the warm cake, allowing it all to soak in thoroughly.  Amazingly, the liquid will be absorbed into the cake, so be sure to use all of the syrup.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the preserves with 1 tablespoon of water until runny, press it through a sieve, and brush it on the cake.  Serve with whipped cream piped into the middle of the cake plus an extra bowl on the side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Baba au rhum was one of the first things I ever made for my husband when we were first married, and we still love it.  Most babas have a strong, slightly harsh rum bite, but I added a little vanilla to the syrup and it rounds out the flavor perfectly for me.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  toasted sliced almonds
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2                     extra-large eggs
  3                     extra-large egg yolks
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        A little softened butter -- for greasing
  12                    ripe medium apricots
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

First, grind the almonds to a very fine dust in a coffee grinder or nut mill (it is hard to grind such a small amount of nuts in a food processor).  Add the powder into a food processor and blend with the flour and salt, then add the sugar, eggs, yolks, and cream.  Blend until smooth and creamy.  Pour into a large bowl and refrigerate for 24 hours.

When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Grease six round, straight-sided tartlet molds, 4 inches in diameter, with soft butter.

Halve the apricots and remove the pits.  Cut each half in half, then divide among the prepared molds.  Sift some confectioners' sugar over.  Pour in the batter, and bake for 12 minutes or until risen and lightly firm.

Cool for a few minutes in the molds, then unmold onto a wire rack using a small metal spatula.  Serve warm, dusted with a little more sifted confectioners' sugar and scoops of ice cream or spoonfuls of crËme fraÓche.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This French favorite is normally associated with cherries, but I like to make smaller versions using fresh apricots.  These start coming into season in late spring.  We serve some almond ice cream alongside the clafoutis, but it is just as delicious served simply dusted with confectioners' sugar and topped with a trickle of cream or some crËme fraÓche.  The batter mix is best left to rest and soften for a good 24 hours beforehand.

         Baked Alaska With Coconut Sorbet And Chocolate Ice Cream

Recipe By     :Michael Lomonaco
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COCONUT SORBET ===
  8             ounces  sweetened coconut milk
     1/2           cup  toasted coconut
                        === CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM ===
  4             ounces  semisweet chocolate
  3                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                     vanilla bean -- split
                        === BAKED ALASKA ===
  3                     egg yolks
  6        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  8                     egg whites
                        = (in 2 bowls of 4 whites each)
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- sifted
                        Coconut Sorbet -- (above)
                        Chocolate Ice Cream -- (above)

Make The Coconut Sorbet:  Combine the coconut milk and 2 cups water and chill for several hours in the refrigerator.

Freeze the mixture in an ice cream freezer according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Stir the toasted coconut into the frozen coconut sorbet.  Keep frozen till ready to serve.  (Makes 3 cups)

Make The Chocolate Ice Cream:  Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler, stirring occasionally, and being careful not to scorch the bottom.

Combine the egg yolks and the sugar in a bowl and whip to a creamy and smooth yellow.

Combine the milk, cream, and vanilla bean in a pot over medium heat and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and let simmer.

Whisk one-third of the hot milk mixture into the egg-sugar mixture to temper the eggs.  Stir.  Pour the tempered mixture into the remaining hot milk mixture while whisking the milk with a wire whisk.  Stir with a wooden spoon until the hot milk-egg mixture thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon.

Add the melted chocolate to the hot milk-egg mixture by whipping it in with a wire whisk.

Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer and cool quickly in an ice bath.  Refrigerate the mixture for several hours before freezing.

Freeze the mixture in an ice cream freezer according to the manufacturer's directions.  Keep frozen till ready to serve.  (Makes 5 cups)

Make The Baked Alaska:  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

First make the sponge cake: In a bowl, whip the egg yolks with 2 tablespoons of the sugar and the vanilla until creamy and yellow.

In another bowl, whip 4 of the egg whites to soft peaks, add the remaining 4 tablespoons sugar, and continue to whip the whites to stiff peaks.

Carefully fold the beaten egg whites into the yolk-sugar mixture.  Using the same care, fold in the sifted flour.

Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper, pour the cake batter onto the sheet, and spread out the batter to evenly coat the sheet.  Bake on the oven's center rack until the top is golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool the cake quickly on a rack near an open window.

Begin to assemble the baked Alaska by cutting the sponge cake in 2 pieces to the shape of the bombe mold.  (Cut a large piece for lining the mold and a smaller piece for the top, which later will be inverted to become the bottom.)

Line the bombe mold with plastic wrap and then place the larger piece of cake on top of the plastic.

Remove the sorbet and ice cream from the freezer and allow to soften for 10 minutes.  Spoon or scoop the sorbet into the cake-lined mold, creating an even layer.  Cover the sorbet with the ice cream in the same fashion; smoothing out the ice cream into one even layer.  Place the remaining layer of cake on top of the ice cream layer to act as a seal.  Freeze the bombe for 4 to 5 hours; or up to 2 weeks.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

To finish the Alaska; whip the remaining 4 egg whites to soft peaks, add the 1/4 cup sugar, and continue to whip to stiff but not dry peaks.  (This is your meringue.)  Pour the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip.  Unmold the bombe.  Use hot towels to help loosen the bombe if necessary and invert the bombe onto a heatproof serving platter.

Remove the plastic wrap and pipe a decorative design of meringue all around the base of the bombe.  Cover the entire bombe with this meringue in as decorative a design as you can manage, being as creative as you like, but working quickly to avoid melting too much of the ice cream and sorbet.  Bake the Alaska for just 5 minutes, to lightly brown the meringue but not melt the ice cream.

Remove the baked Alaska from the oven, slice into individual servings, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Baked Alaska has been floating around as a dessert since Thomas Jefferson's day, albeit with different names.  Fannie Farmer is said to have named this masterwork of confection ó ice cream and sorbet surrounded by toasted meringue.  The ice cream and sorbet bombe can be kept frozen for weeks before being covered with meringue and toasted.  You can use a store-bought sponge cake and skip steps 1 through 5 under Make the Baked Alaska.  You can also, of course, make this with store-bought ice cream and sorbet.  In any case, you will need a 2-quart ice cream bombe mold.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SYRUP ===
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  honey
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  walnuts -- finely chopped,
                        but not pulverized
     1/2      teaspoon  powdered cinnamon
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/2         pound  fillo dough

Make The Syrup:  Combine all the ingredients in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil and simmer briskly until thickened and reduced, about 12 minutes.  Set aside at room temperature until ready to use.  (The syrup should be at room temperature and still pourable when ready to use; if cooled too much, reheat slightly.)

Make The Filling:  In a bowl, mix together the walnuts, cinnamon, and sugar.  Set aside.

Make The Baklava:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Brush the bottom and sides of a 9- by 13-inch deep baking dish with some of the butter.

Place a layer of fillo in the bottom of the dish, cover with another layer, and brush the top with butter.  Add another layer (2 sheets), brushing the top with butter, and then another layer, brushing the top with butter, until you have a stack 6 sheets high.  Spread one-third of the filling evenly over the fillo.

Layer and butter another 6 sheets in the same way.  Spread another third of the filling over it.  Layer and butter another 6 sheets in the same way and spread with the final third of the filling, so that you wind up with three nut layers.

Top the final nut layer with the remaining 6 fillo sheets, buttering every other one as above.  Finally, brush the top layer of fillo with butter.

With a sharp knife, cut through all the layers down to the bottom of the dish, making 16 to 18 diamond or 1 1/2-inch square sections.  Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.  Pour the remaining butter across the top and continue baking until pale golden and crispy, about 25 minutes.

Remove and set aside for 5 minutes, until no longer sizzling.  While still warm, tilt the pan and pour off the excess butter.  Pour the syrup in between the cuts and around the edges of the sections, taking care to avoid the top or else it will get soggy.  Set aside at room temperature until completely cool.

To serve, lift out the pieces as outlined.  Serve right away or cover and store at room temperature for up to 5 days.

This recipe yields sixteen to eighteen 1 1/2-inch pieces.

Comments:  Baklava, or paklava, is one of those few dishes, like pizza or ice cream, that has become "owned" by the whole world.  When I was young, my grandmother Victoria Jenanyan would begin cooking for family early in the morning, making the dough and rolling it out on the dining room table with a broomstick handle into transparent sheets of fillo for the baklava.  It was an awesome sight to see her well-toned arms and deft hands, so in rhythm with the rolling, turning out the most tender fillo sheets imaginable.  These days, I bow to her as I purchase ready-made fillo and carry on the tradition of making baklava at home.

Make The Syrup:  Combine all the ingredients in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil and simmer briskly until thickened and reduced, about 12 minutes.  Set aside at room temperature until ready to use.  (The syrup should be at room temperature and still pourable when ready to use; if cooled too much, reheat slightly.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Filling:  In a bowl, mix together the walnuts, cinnamon, and sugar.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Baklava:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Brush the bottom and sides of a 9- by 13-inch deep baking dish with some of the butter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a layer of fillo in the bottom of the dish, cover with another layer, and brush the top with butter.  Add another layer (2 sheets), brushing the top with butter, and then another layer, brushing the top with butter, until you have a stack 6 sheets high.  Spread one-third of the filling evenly over the fillo.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Layer and butter another 6 sheets in the same way.  Spread another third of the filling over it.  Layer and butter another 6 sheets in the same way and spread with the final third of the filling, so that you wind up with three nut layers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Top the final nut layer with the remaining 6 fillo sheets, buttering every other one as above.  Finally, brush the top layer of fillo with butter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With a sharp knife, cut through all the layers down to the bottom of the dish, making 16 to 18 diamond or 1 1/2-inch square sections.  Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.  Pour the remaining butter across the top and continue baking until pale golden and crispy, about 25 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove and set aside for 5 minutes, until no longer sizzling.  While still warm, tilt the pan and pour off the excess butter.  Pour the syrup in between the cuts and around the edges of the sections, taking care to avoid the top or else it will get soggy.  Set aside at room temperature until completely cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, lift out the pieces as outlined.  Serve right away or cover and store at room temperature for up to 5 days.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields sixteen to eighteen 1 1/2-inch pieces.
</DirT>

Comments:  Baklava, or paklava, is one of those few dishes, like pizza or ice cream, that has become &quot;owned&quot; by the whole world.  When I was young, my grandmother Victoria Jenanyan would begin cooking for family early in the morning, making the dough and rolling it out on the dining room table with a broomstick handle into transparent sheets of fillo for the baklava.  It was an awesome sight to see her well-toned arms and deft hands, so in rhythm with the rolling, turning out the most tender fillo sheets imaginable.

Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CASHEW MILK ===
  3               cups  raw cashews -- soaked 10 to 12
                        hours in filtered water, rinsed, and
                        drained
  6               cups  filtered water
                        === DATE PASTE ===
  1                cup  pitted Barhi dates
     1/2           cup  filtered water
                        === CHOCOLATE-FUDGE ALMOND ===
  1                cup  raw almond butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  maple syrup
     1/2           cup  organic cocoa powder
                        Seeds from 1/4 vanilla bean
  1 1/2       teaspoon  nama shoyu (raw soy sauce)
                        === MEXICAN-CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  Chocolate Fudge-Almond -- (above)
     1/4           cup  filtered water
  2        tablespoons  maple syrup -- plus
  1           teaspoon  maple syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground cinnamon
                        === HONEY WALNUTS ===
  1                cup  raw walnuts -- soaked for 6 to 8
                        hours in filtered water, drained, and
                        patted dry
  2        tablespoons  honey granules
  1               dash  Celtic sea salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground cinnamon
                        === TART SHELLS ===
     3/4           cup  sprouted flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sprouted flour
  1         tablespoon  maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Seeds from 1/2 vanilla bean
  1              pinch  Celtic sea salt
                        === CARAMEL SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  raw cashews - (heaping) -- soaked for 8 hours
                        in filtered water
     1/4           cup  Cashew Milk -- plus
  1           teaspoon  Cashew Milk -- (above)
  2        tablespoons  raw dark honey
  2        tablespoons  Date Paste -- (above)
  2        tablespoons  maple syrup
  4        tablespoons  Mexican Chocolate Sauce -- (above)
  8        tablespoons  Chocolate Fudge-Almond -- (above)
  28                    banana slices
  4        tablespoons  Honey Walnuts -- (above), broken

Make The Cashew Milk:  In a high-speed blender, combine the cashews and water and blend until creamy.  Line a large sieve with a double thickness of cheesecloth and place over a bowl.  Pour the cashew mixture into the sieve and let drain, then grab the corners of the cheesecloth, hold together securely, and squeeze the cheesecloth to extract all of the milk.  Transfer the milk to a covered container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.

Make The Date Paste:  In a food processor, combine the dates and water and process until completely smooth.  Use immediately, or store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Make The Chocolate-Fudge Almond:  In a food processor, combine all the ingredients and process until smooth.  Set aside 1 cup for the Mexican Chocolate Sauce.  Use immediately, or store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Make The Mexican-Chocolate Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in a bowl and whisk together vigorously.  Use immediately, or store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Make The Honey Walnuts:  Combine the walnuts, honey, salt and cinnamon in a bowl and toss to coat the nuts evenly with the other ingredients.  Spread the nuts on a nonstick drying sheet on a dehydrator shelf and dehydrate at 105 degrees for 12 hours.  Transfer the nuts to the shelf, spreading them evenly and continue to dehydrate for 24 hours longer or until crisp.  Use immediately, or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.

Make The Tart Shells:  Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and stir to mix well.  Place 2 tablespoons of the mixture in the bottom of each of 4 ring molds each 2 inches in diameter.  Pack the mixture firmly into the molds.  (You will have more dough than you need for 4 molds.  Because the tiny tart shells are fragile and time-consuming to make, it is a good idea to line additional ring molds with the remaining dough in case of breakage.)

Place the molds on a nonstick drying sheet on a dehydrator shelf and dehydrate at 105 degrees for 3 hours.  Remove the tart shells from the drying sheet and dehydrate directly on the shelf for about 10 hours longer, or until just dry.

Make The Caramel Sauce:  Drain the cashews, pat them dry, and then measure them.  You should have 1/4 cup; discard any excess.  In a high-speed blender, combine the cashews, Cashew Milk, honey, Date Paste and maple syrup and process until smooth.  Strain the puree through a fine-mesh sieve.  Set aside 4 tablespoons for the tarts; reserve the remainder for another use.

Assemble:  Spoon 1 tablespoon of the Mexican Chocolate Sauce in a circle on each plate.  Put a tart shell on top of the sauce.  Spread 2 tablespoons of the Chocolate Fudge-Almond on the tart shell.

Arrange 7 banana slices on top.  Drizzle 1 tablespoon Caramel Sauce over the bananas and on the plate.  Sprinkle with the Honey Walnuts.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  There may not be a better combination than bananas and chocolate, unless, of course, caramel and walnut are added to the mix.  This tart intoxicates through its remarkably sensual, intense flavor.  It is the sort of a dish that once you begin eating it, you are compelled to stop talking to others at the table.  The child in every adult emerges when this tart is served.

Wine Notes: This rich tart requires a wine with serious heft and sweetness because of the golden rule that says, "The wine must always be sweeter than the dessert."  Trevor Jones's Old Tokay from Australia's Barossa Valley, although not a "raw" wine because a spirit has been added, makes for too perfect a combination to be shunted aside.  Its concentrated chocolate and caramel flavors are truly unbelievable with the syrupy richness of the sauces.

                         Banana-Maple Tarte Tatin

Recipe By     :Gale Gand and Julia Moskin
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed overnight in
                        the refrigerator
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  pure maple syrup
     1/2                vanilla bean
                        = (use a whole vanilla bean, cut in half
                        lengthwise)
  2                     bananas - (to 3) -- cut 1/2"-thk coins
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

Choose a baking pan: Use a heavyweight 9- or 10-inch cake pan or a heavy ovenproof 10-inch skillet.

Unfold the pastry on a lightly floured work surface.  Lightly roll a rolling pin over it to smooth out any creases and make it a little bit thinner.  Using your pan as a guide, cut a round of dough that is about 1 inch bigger than the pan all the way around.  Transfer the circle to a sheet pan, prick it all over with a fork, and keep it refrigerated.  (See note)

Heat the oven to 425 degrees.  Meanwhile, put your pan on the stove and add the butter to it.  Turn the heat to medium and heat until the butter is melted.  Add the maple syrup and vanilla bean and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.  Turn off the heat and position the vanilla bean in the center of the pan.  Arrange the banana slices (I like to place them in a spiral or in concentric circles) to cover the whole bottom of the pan.

Lay the pastry circle over the bananas, pressing the extra pastry around the sides of the pan so that it comes up the wall of the pan (rather than down around the bananas).  The pastry will shrink during baking to fit the pan.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown.  Let cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes. (See note)

Just before serving, warm the bottom of the pan for 1 or 2 minutes on the stove, over low heat (this will melt the caramel slightly and loosen the tart from the pan).  Place a serving plate over the pan and quickly flip them over to turn the tart out, with the bananas facing up.  Serve with vanilla ice cream, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  I learned from the famous French chocolatier and pastry chef Maurice Bernachon that people love to see black specks of vanilla bean in their desserts; it's proof that real vanilla beans were used in the recipe, and that always means better flavor.  His tarte Tatin is traditional, with the exception of the whole vanilla bean baked right into the caramelized apple topping.

In this easy version of the French classic, I use maple syrup instead of making a caramel, and bananas (which don't really need cooking) instead of apples.  The effect is still one of soft fruit, rich buttery juices, and crisp pastry.  It makes an excellent year-round dessert, and happens to contain no added sugar.  You can make it in a cake pan or even in a heavy frying pan.

Note:  The pastry circle can be refrigerated overnight or frozen for up to 2 weeks.  Once baked, the tart should be served the same day it is made.

Choose a baking pan: Use a heavyweight 9- or 10-inch cake pan or a heavy ovenproof 10-inch skillet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Unfold the pastry on a lightly floured work surface.  Lightly roll a rolling pin over it to smooth out any creases and make it a little bit thinner.  Using your pan as a guide, cut a round of dough that is about 1 inch bigger than the pan all the way around.  Transfer the circle to a sheet pan, prick it all over with a fork, and keep it refrigerated.  (See note)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the oven to 425 degrees.  Meanwhile, put your pan on the stove and add the butter to it.  Turn the heat to medium and heat until the butter is melted.  Add the maple syrup and vanilla bean and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.  Turn off the heat and position the vanilla bean in the center of the pan.  Arrange the banana slices (I like to place them in a spiral or in concentric circles) to cover the whole bottom of the pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lay the pastry circle over the bananas, pressing the extra pastry around the sides of the pan so that it comes up the wall of the pan (rather than down around the bananas).  The pastry will shrink during baking to fit the pan.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown.  Let cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes. (See note)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Just before serving, warm the bottom of the pan for 1 or 2 minutes on the stove, over low heat (this will melt the caramel slightly and loosen the tart from the pan).  Place a serving plate over the pan and quickly flip them over to turn the tart out, with the bananas facing up.  Serve with vanilla ice cream, if desired.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  I learned from the famous French chocolatier and pastry chef Maurice Bernachon that people love to see black specks of vanilla bean in their desserts; it&apos;s proof that real vanilla beans were used in the recipe, and that always means better flavor.  His tarte Tatin is traditional, with the exception of the whole vanilla bean baked right into the caramelized apple topping.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  8             ounces  regular or reduced fat cream cheese -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
  1              large  egg -- room temperature
  2             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
                        === CUPCAKES ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  5        tablespoons  natural unsweetened cocoa powder
                        = (not Dutch-process)
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  water
     1/3           cup  unflavored vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  white or cider vinegar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Make The Filling:  Beat together the cream cheese, granulated sugar, and egg until smooth.  Stir in the chopped chocolate pieces.  Set aside.

Make The Cupcakes:  Adjust the rack to the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter a 12-cup muffin tin, or line the tin with paper muffin cups.

In a medium bowl sift together the flour, brown sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.  In a separate bowl, mix together the water, oil, vinegar, and vanilla.

Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and stir in the wet ingredients, stirring until just smooth.  Stir any longer and you will over mix the batter and end up with less-than-tender cupcakes.

Divide the batter among the muffin cups.  Spoon a few tablespoons of the filling into the center of each cupcake, dividing the filling evenly.  This will fill the cups almost completely, which is fine.

Bake for 25 minutes, or until the tops are slightly golden brown and the cupcakes feel springy when gently pressed.  These moist treats will keep well unrefrigerated for 2 to 3 days if stored in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 12 cupcakes.

Comments:  These yummy classics deserve a revival.  Who doesn't like individual, moist, and deep red devil's food cakes with a creamy cheesecake filling?  Children like them in lunch boxes.  And adults (like me) enjoy them for breakfast.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
  1                cup  heavy cream -- very cold
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1 1/2    tablespoons  light corn syrup
                        === BLUEBERRY BETTY ===
  3               cups  bread cubes
                        = (from a brioche or challah)
     1/2           cup  melted butter -- plus
                        extra for the pan
  4               cups  fresh or frozen blueberries
                        = (if frozen, thaw completely and drain
                        thoroughly)
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/4           cup  fine bread crumbs -- made from fresh
                        bread in a food processor
     1/2    tablespoon  cold unsalted butter -- cut small pieces

Make The Whipped Cream:  Combine the cream and vanilla and mix well.  With an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, start whipping the cream on medium speed.  Add the corn syrup slowly while beating.  Whip until the cream holds soft peaks.

Make The Blueberry Betty:  Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. Butter bottom and sides 9- by 5-inch loaf pan.

Mix the bread cubes and melted butter in a medium bowl, and spread one-third of the bread cubes evenly on the bottom loaf pan.  Scatter one-third of the blueberries over this, then one-third of the sugar, spreading each evenly.  Sprinkle one-third of the lemon juice over everything.  Repeat this process two more times, using all of the bread cubes, blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice.  Press down on the ingredients lightly to compress.  Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the top, and dot with cold butter.

Cover the pan in foil and bake it for 30 minutes.  Remove the foil and bake Betty for another 15 minutes.

Serve her warm with a dollop of whipped cream.  Store wrapped in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 1 bettiful loaf for 6 or more servings.

Recipe By     :Daniel Boulud

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split and scraped
                        = (or a few drops pure vanilla extract)
  5                     mint sprigs
                        = (1 sprig, leaves only, reserved for
                        garnish)
                        Zest of 1 lemon -- grated
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4                     gelatin sheets
                        = (or 1 packet unflavored Knox gelatin)
  8             ounces  fresh blueberries
  4             slices  brioche or challah bread -- cut 1/3" thick

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Combine the milk, cream, vanilla (bean and scrapings), 4 mint sprigs, and lemon zest in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Remove from heat, stir in the sugar and gelatin, and let set for 3 minutes.  Remove the mint and vanilla bean.

Place a baking cup 3 inches in diameter and 1 1/2 inches deep top-side down on the center of a slice of bread to cut out a disk the size of the cup.  Discard the bread trimmings and set the bread disk aside.  Repeat with the remaining 3 bread slices.

Fill 4 baking cups halfway with blueberries.  Pour the warm milk mixture over the blueberries to fill each cup 3/4 full.  Place 1 bread disk in each cup over the blueberry mixture.  Transfer to the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes (the custard should not be completely set).  Turn on the broiler and broil until the bread is nicely toasted.  Remove from oven and set aside to cool.  Refrigerate for several hours before serving.

To unmold, run a small blade around the side of each cup and invert the blueberry bread pudding onto a dessert plate.  Garnish with reserved mint leaves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This lighter version of bread pudding has a minty flavor and is bursting with deep-purple baked blueberries.  The pudding can be prepared a day in advance.

It is best when refrigerated for at least 6 hours before serving.

Transfer to the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes (the custard should not be completely set).  Turn on the broiler and broil until the bread is nicely toasted.  Remove from oven and set aside to cool.  Refrigerate for several hours before serving.

To unmold, run a small blade around the side of each cup and invert the blueberry bread pudding onto a dessert plate.  Garnish with reserved mint leaves.

Comments:  This lighter version of bread pudding has a minty flavor and is bursting with deep-purple baked blueberries.  The pudding can be prepared a day in advance.
</DirT>
<DirT>
It is best when refrigerated for at least 6 hours before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2             sticks  cold butter -- cut tiny pieces
     1/4           cup  ice water
                        === CRUMBLE ===
  1 1/2           cups  flour
  1                cup  dark brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  1 1/2         sticks  unsalted butter -- cut little pieces
                        === FILLING ===
  3              pints  blueberries
                        = (wild Maine if you can get them)
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  4          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-chopped lemon zest
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper

To make the crust, combine the flour, salt, and cold butter in a food processor by pulsing until the mixture has the consistency of sand.  Add the cold water while pulsing until the mixture comes together; don't overwork it.  (To mix the dough by hand, combine the flour, salt, and butter in a large bowl.  Add the cold water and work by hand until the mixture comes together.)  Remove the dough from the food processor or bowl and on a lightly floured counter or board, shape it into a disk about 1/2 inch thick.  Wrap with plastic film and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before rolling it out.

To make the crumble, mix the flour and brown sugar in a food processor until thoroughly combined.  Add the butter and pulse until the mixture forms a crumble (do not overwork the mixture).  Refrigerate until you are ready to use it.

To make the fruit filling, in a large bowl, mix all the ingredients well.  l crush about 20 percent of the blueberries so the juice mixes with the cornstarch and thickens the filling.

To make the pie, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Roll out the dough on a floured surface, place in a pie plate, trim, and crimp the edges.  Use a fork to poke holes around the sides and bottom of the crust.  Cover with a piece of parchment paper and fill it with dried beans.  Bake for 8 minutes, or until the crimped edges are firm.  Remove the paper and beans and bake for 3 to 5 more minutes to firm the bottom.  Fill the crust with the berry mixture, spread out the mixture, and top the pie generously with the crumble.  Bake for 1 hour, or until the filling starts to bubble.  Cool on a rack.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This recipe is best served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

                 Bread Pudding With Orange Caramel Sauce

Recipe By     :Olivier Said and James Mellgren
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BREAD PUDDING ===
  4               cups  milk
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  1                     cinnamon stick
                        Grated zest of 2 oranges
  12              cups  cubed (1/4") bread
  6                     egg yolks
  2                     eggs
                        === SAUCE ===
  2               cups  freshly-squeezed blood orange juice
                        = (or regular orange juice)
  1                cup  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  granulated sugar
                        === GARNISH ===
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- whipped
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar

Make The Pudding:  Heat the milk, granulated sugar, cinnamon stick, and orange zest in a medium saucepan over medium until the sugar dissolves.  Let cool, cover, and refrigerate overnight to steep.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Put the bread cubes in a large bowl.  Reheat the milk mixture and remove the cinnamon stick.  In a large bowl, lightly whisk together the yolks and eggs.  Pour the milk mixture into the eggs and mix thoroughly.  Pour this mixture over the bread and allow to soak for a few minutes.

Butter the insides of eight 5-ounce ramekins.  Divide the mixture among the ramekins and place them in a roasting pan or on a large, deep sheet pan.  Pour about 1 inch of water into the pan to create a water bath.  Bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 1/4 hours.

Make The Sauce:  Bring the orange juice to a simmer over medium-high heat in a medium saucepan, and reduce to 1/4 cup, about 10 minutes.  Strain through a fine sieve into a bowl, add the cream, and set aside.

In another saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the granulated sugar and continue to cook stirring frequently until the sugar is lightly caramelized, about 3 minutes.  Add the orange juice mixture, stirring constantly.  Simmer for 5 minutes and strain through a fine sieve.

Serve the pudding warm, either turned out onto individual plates or left inside the ramekins.  Top with the sauce, a dollop of whipped cream, and a dusting of confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Just about every culture that makes bread has its own version of bread pudding.  This one has a decidedly Spanish-Moorish flavor from the orange zest as well as the orange caramel sauce.  In Spain, the sauce would invariably be made with blood oranges.  They not only have a deep, lovely color, but also an intense flavor.  If you can find them, try them; otherwise, seek out the sweetest oranges in the market.  This recipe is designed for individual ramekins, but it can easily be adapted for a larger baking dish.  You will have to bake it a little longer, testing it for doneness by inserting a knife into the center, as you would a cake; it is done when the knife comes out clean.  Note that this recipe needs to be started the night before.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  thick-skinned oranges - (to 8)
  6               cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  Grand Marnier
                        = (or other orange-flavored liqueur)

Slice the ends off the oranges and discard.  Cut the oranges into quarters, then cut off all but 1/2 inch of the pulp, which keeps the peel from becoming bitter as it cooks.  Cut the quarters into thin slices.

Place the orange slices in a 6-quart saucepan and cover with cold water.  Over medium-high heat, bring the water to a boil and boil for 5 minutes.  Drain off the water and repeat this process with fresh cold water two more times.

After the third boil, drain the orange slices, rinse them in cold water, and remove any pulp that is still attached.  In the saucepan, combine the orange slices, 3 cups of the sugar, and the orange liqueur, and cook over low heat until the sugar is dissolved (about 5 minutes), stirring constantly.

Continue to cook over low heat for 1 1/2 hours, stirring frequently.  Most of the sugar will be absorbed by the peel as it cooks.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and immediately begin the next step.

Place the remaining 3 cups sugar on a sheet of waxed paper.  Roll spoonfuls of the orange slices in the sugar, separating the slices to coat them completely.

Transfer the slices onto another sheet of waxed paper and let them air-dry (20 to 30 minutes). In a tightly covered container, the peel will keep for 2 to 3 months in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 6 cups.

Comments:  A popular ingredient in many confections, candied orange peel is also delicious eaten plain or dipped in chocolate.

<DirS>
<DirT>
Slice the ends off the oranges and discard.  Cut the oranges into quarters, then cut off all but 1/2 inch of the pulp, which keeps the peel from becoming bitter as it cooks.  Cut the quarters into thin slices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the orange slices in a 6-quart saucepan and cover with cold water.  Over medium-high heat, bring the water to a boil and boil for 5 minutes.  Drain off the water and repeat this process with fresh cold water two more times.
</DirT>
<DirT>
After the third boil, drain the orange slices, rinse them in cold water, and remove any pulp that is still attached.  In the saucepan, combine the orange slices, 3 cups of the sugar, and the orange liqueur, and cook over low heat until the sugar is dissolved (about 5 minutes), stirring constantly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Continue to cook over low heat for 1 1/2 hours, stirring frequently.  Most of the sugar will be absorbed by the peel as it cooks.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and immediately begin the next step.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the remaining 3 cups sugar on a sheet of waxed paper.  Roll spoonfuls of the orange slices in the sugar, separating the slices to coat them completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the slices onto another sheet of waxed paper and let them air-dry (20 to 30 minutes). In a tightly covered container, the peel will keep for 2 to 3 months in the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 cups.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  A popular ingredient in many confections, candied orange peel is also delicious eaten plain or dipped in chocolate.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        A large baking sheet
                        A piece of flexible corrugated cardboard
                        25" to 30" long and 5" to 6" wide
                        Cellophane tape
                        A large pastry bag fitted with a medium
                        small star tip (Ateco #843 or #9824)
                        === MERINGUE ===
     2/3           cup  sugar -- divided
                        = (set aside 1/3 of the sugar)
  3              large  egg whites -- room temperature
     1/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

Make The Form:  Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Cut a piece of parchment paper to cover the baking sheet, then cut the paper crosswise in half.  Set one piece aside.

Bend the corrugated cardboard into a cylinder 7 to 8 inches in diameter and secure the overlapping edges with tape.  Stand the cardboard cylinder in the center of the parchment on the baking sheet.  Push the cylinder into an oval shape (or keep it round), taping the bottom edges securely to the parchment in several places to preserve the shape.  Cut a piece of parchment big enough to wrap around and cover the cardboard cylinder completely.  Secure the overlapping end of the parchment with tape but do not tape the parchment to the cardboard or you will not be able to slip it off later.

Make The Meringue:  In a clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt on high speed (medium speed if using a heavy-duty stand mixer) until soft peaks form when the beaters are lifted.  Gradually beat in 2/3's of the sugar (a little under 1/2 cup), taking 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.  The meringue should stand in very stiff glossy peaks when the beaters are lifted.  Fold in the reserved sugar.  (Remove the bowl if using a stand mixer.)

Scrape the meringue into the pastry bag.  Starting at the bottom of the form, pipe a line of meringue up the outside of the form.  Near the top, jerk the tip of the pastry bag upward to form a point.  Starting at the bottom again, pipe a second line of meringue parallel to and touching the first.  Repeat until the form is covered with meringue.  (If there are gaps in coverage or places where the piping barely touches, pipe some extra lines of meringue as necessary.  Don't worry, this will look beautiful and reinforces the structure!)

Slide the parchment with the form placed on it to one end of the baking sheet.  Place the reserved parchment next to it.  Pipe or spread the remaining meringue on the parchment to make a thin oval layer slight smaller than the form.

Bake for 2 hours.  Turn off the oven and leave the meringue inside for at least another hour or overnight.

Carefully detach the baked (and very fragile) meringue shell from the form as follows: Lift the meringue and attached parchment upward, sliding them off of the cardboard.  Set the meringue on a flat tray.  Carefully, without bumping the meringue, reach in and grasp the end of the parchment.  Gently pull the parchment off the meringue, pulling toward the center of the shell.  Slide a metal spatula under the meringue layer to separate it from the parchment underneath.  If necessary, trim the layer with a serrated knife so the meringue shell (lifted and set down carefully with two hands) fits completely over it.  Store the shell and the bottom layer in an airtight container for up to several weeks, until needed.

Fill as suggested in comments.

This recipe yields 12 to 14 servings.

Comments:  Meringue is irresistible to me as a sculptural medium as well as a dessert component.  Although I've gotten some big laughs (howls, actually) for attempting to make trompe líoeil meringue asparagus, I always get raves for meringue shells.  Named for the fun of it, Carmen Meringay is for show-offs: Meringue is piped straight up the sheer walls of a vertical form, baked until dry and crisp, then removed from the form.  You can fill it with chocolate mousse, whipped cream, and chocolate curls, or with layers of softened chocolate ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce and interspersed with crushed praline.  Or you can fill the shell with ripe berries or sliced stone fruit, toasted nuts, and whipped cream, custard, or vanilla ice cream.  Cubes of liquor-drenched sponge cake can be layered in, if you like.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CUSTARD ===
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1                cup  half-and-half
  1         tablespoon  loose Darjeeling or Earl Grey tea
  1              piece  cinnamon stick - (abt 1") -- broken in half
  6                     green cardamom pods -- pounded in a mortar
                        and pestle just to break open the shells
  5                     whole cloves
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 1") -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  4                     black peppercorns
  3              large  egg yolks
  1              large  egg
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
                        Zest of 1 lemon
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
  1                cup  whipping cream
  4          teaspoons  granulated sugar
                        = (or 1 tbspn, if not using garam masala)
     1/2      teaspoon  Garam Masala -- (see recipe)

Make The Custard:  Combine the cream, half-and-half, tea, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, ginger, and peppercorns in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil, remove from the heat, cover, and let steep 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Line a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish with a dishtowel.  Place six 6-ounce ramekins in the baking dish and set aside.

Combine the egg yolks, whole egg, sugars, and lemon zest in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat on high speed until the mixture has thickened and leaves a ribbon trail when you lift the beaters from the bowl, about 2 minutes.  Strain the spice-infused cream into a medium bowl.  With the mixer running on low speed, gradually pour the warm cream into the egg mixture and mix to combine.

Carefully divide the custard among the six ramekins and put the baking dish in the oven.  Use a cup to pour enough hot tap water into the baking dish to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil and punch several holes in the foil to allow the steam to escape.  Bake until the custards are just set and the centers still jiggle when shaken, about 30 minutes.

Remove the ramekins from the hot water and let cool on a rack.  (Turn off the oven and let the water in the baking dish cool before removing it from the oven.)  Then chill until completely cold.

Make The Whipped Cream:  Beat the whipping cream with the sugar and garam masala, if using, in a medium bowl to soft peaks.  Spoon a dollop of this spiced cream on top of each chilled custard and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  As a young teenager I spent many afternoons baking with our neighbor next door.  Armed with my great love for sweets and baking skills newly acquired from my mother (who had quite a reputation as a baker), we experimented with many recipes.  Some were disasters, but this recipe was one of our great successes.  Spicy, creamy, and delicate, this sweet works especially well as an ending to an Indian meal; the subtle play of its sweet spice complements highly aromatic savory dishes.

Note:  Garam Masala is a special spice blend which can be purchased premixed at Indian stores or food specialty shops.

                      Cherry-Chocolate CrËme Br˚lÈe

Recipe By     :Tina Salter
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  3             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  8              large  egg yolks
     3/4          cups  sugar
  3               cups  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                jar  sour cherries in light syrup - (16 oz) -- drained, patted dry

Place the bittersweet and semisweet chocolates in a medium bowl and rest a fine-mesh sieve over the top.

In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 1/4 cup of the sugar until a light lemon yellow, about 3 minutes.

In a medium pan, bring the cream to a boil and immediately remove from the heat.  Slowly add one-third of the hot cream, whisking constantly, to the egg yolks.  Whisk the tempered egg yolk mixture into the remaining hot cream in the pan and cook, whisking gently, over medium-low heat, taking care not to allow the mixture to boil.  The custard will thicken and should coat the back of a spoon.  Immediately pour the custard through the sieve and onto the chopped chocolate.  Stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth.  Add the vanilla.

Divide the cherries evenly among six, 8-ounce ramekins.  Pour over the chocolate custard and let cool to room temperature.  Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours.

Preheat the broiler.  Place the chilled custards on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup sugar evenly over the tops.  Set under the broiler, about 4 inches from the heat source, and broil until the sugar is caramelized and golden.  (Alternatively, you can use a kitchen butane torch to caramelize the tops.)  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This dish is a variation on the traditional crËme br˚lÈe recipe said to have originated at Trinity College in Cambridge, England.  The ultimate topping of a crackled crust of caramelized sugar covers the sensually sinful, silky custard flavored with dark chocolate to complement the sour cherries inside.  Use a best quality chocolate such as Callebaut, Valrhona, or Scharffen Berger.

Place the bittersweet and semisweet chocolates in a medium bowl and rest a fine-mesh sieve over the top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 1/4 cup of the sugar until a light lemon yellow, about 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium pan, bring the cream to a boil and immediately remove from the heat.  Slowly add one-third of the hot cream, whisking constantly, to the egg yolks.  Whisk the tempered egg yolk mixture into the remaining hot cream in the pan and cook, whisking gently, over medium-low heat, taking care not to allow the mixture to boil.  The custard will thicken and should coat the back of a spoon.  Immediately pour the custard through the sieve and onto the chopped chocolate.  Stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth.  Add the vanilla.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the cherries evenly among six, 8-ounce ramekins.  Pour over the chocolate custard and let cool to room temperature.  Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the broiler.  Place the chilled custards on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup sugar evenly over the tops.  Set under the broiler, about 4 inches from the heat source, and broil until the sugar is caramelized and golden.  (Alternatively, you can use a kitchen butane torch to caramelize the tops.)  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This dish is a variation on the traditional crËme br˚lÈe recipe said to have originated at Trinity College in Cambridge, England.  The ultimate topping of a crackled crust of caramelized sugar covers the sensually sinful, silky custard flavored with dark chocolate to complement the sour cherries inside.  Use a best quality chocolate such as Callebaut, Valrhona, or Scharffen Berger.

                      Chiffon Cake With Lemon Icing

Recipe By     :Irma S. Rombauer
Serving Size  : 14    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2 1/4           cups  sifted cake flour
  1 1/4            cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  5              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  8              large  egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/4           cup  sugar
                        === LEMON ICING ===
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter
  2               cups  powdered sugar -- sifted if lumpy
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice - (to 2)
                        Zest of 1 lemon
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  vanilla

Make The Cake:  Into a large bowl, sift together the cake flour, sugar, baking powder and salt twice.

In another bowl, beat the egg yolks, water, vegetable oil, lemon zest and vanilla on high speed until smooth.  Stir into the flour mixture until smooth.

In a third bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until soft peaks form.  Gradually add the sugar, beating on high speed until peaks are stiff but not dry.

Use a rubber spatula and fold one-quarter of the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture, then fold in the remaining whites.  Scrape the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan with a removable bottom and spread evenly.  Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven until the top springs back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes.

Let cool upside down for at least 1 1/2 hours, setting the tube over a bottleneck or resting the pan on four glasses.

To unmold, slide a thin knife around the cake to detach it from the pan, pressing the knife against the pan to avoid tearing the cake.  Using the same procedure, detach the cake from the center tube.  Pull the tube upward to remove the cake from the pan side.  Slide the knife under the cake to detach it from the bottom.  Invert and allow the cake to drop onto your hand, a rack, or a serving platter.  Invert again, right-side up, on a rack to cool complete before icing.

Make The Icing:  Melt the butter in the top of a double boiler over low heat.  Remove and stir in the powdered sugar, lemon juice, zest and salt.

Return to heat and cook over barely simmering water for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove and add the vanilla.

Beat until cool (briefly for a pourable glaze or several minutes for a spreadable icing).  You can place the pan in a larger pan of ice water to quicken the process.

Drizzle or spread over the cake.  Let set before serving.

This recipe yields 12 to 14 servings.

Comments:  Simple and classic, chiffon cake with lemon icing has been an American favorite ever since it was created for the Brown Derby Restaurant by insurance salesman Henry Baker in the late '20s.

Note:  Have all ingredients at room temperature, 68 to 70 degrees.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  8             ounces  best-quality bittersweet or
                        semisweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces,
                        and softened
  6              large  eggs -- 2 whole, 4 separated
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cognac -- (optional)
                        = (or Grand Marnier)
                        Grated zest of 1 orange -- (optional)
                        === WHIPPED CREAM TOPPING ===
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream -- well chilled
  3        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        Unsweetened cocoa powder -- for sprinkling

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line the bottom of an 8-inch springform pan with a round of wax paper; do not butter the pan.  Melt the chocolate in a bowl set over hot water.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter until melted; set aside.

In a bowl, whisk the 2 whole eggs and the 4 egg yolks with 1/2 cup of the sugar just until blended.  Whisk in the warm chocolate mixture.  Whisk in the optional cognac or Grand Marnier and the optional orange zest.

In another bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the 4 egg whites until foamy.  Gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and beat until the whites form soft mounds that hold their shape but are not quite stiff.  Stir about 1/4 of the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it; gently fold in the remaining whites.  Pour the batter into the pan; smooth the top.

Bake until the top of the cake is puffed and cracked and the center is no longer wobbly, usually 35 to 40 minutes.  Do not over bake.

Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack; the cake will sink as it cools, forming a crater with high sides.

At serving time, whip the cream with the confectioners' sugar and vanilla until not quite stiff.  With a spatula, carefully fill the crater of the cake with the whipped cream, pushing it gently to the edges.  Dust the top lightly with cocoa powder.  Run the tip of a knife around the edges of the cake; carefully remove the sides of the pan and serve.

This recipe yields one 8-inch single-layer cake; 8 to 12 servings.

Comments:  This flourless cake is crammed with chocolate (use only the best) and rich with butter and will fall slightly as it cools.  The center is filled with softly whipped cream and sprinkled with cocoa powder ó intensity, then relief, in each bite.

                             Chocolate Fondue

Recipe By     :Caprial and John Pence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  heavy whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/3           cup  hazelnut liqueur
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  5             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  5             ounces  hazelnut chocolate -- coarsely chopped
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
  1               pint  fresh strawberries -- hulled
  6             slices  pound cake -- cut large dice
  2                     bananas -- peeled, and
                        cut into large dice

Combine the cream, vanilla extract, liqueur, and butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat and bring just to a boil.

Place both chocolates in a food processor and process until finely chopped.  With the motor running, slowly pour the hot cream mixture through the feed tube and process until smooth.  Transfer the mixture to a fondue pot set over low heat, or keep warm until you are ready to serve.

Serve warm with skewered strawberries, pound cake, and bananas.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Cheese fondue may have an unsteady and spotty reputation ó just think of how many times it has gone in and out of fashion ó but the chocolate version has remained a steadfast classic.  Here the chocolate flavor is enhanced with extracts and liqueurs making for a silken, simple dessert.

Combine the cream, vanilla extract, liqueur, and butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat and bring just to a boil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place both chocolates in a food processor and process until finely chopped.  With the motor running, slowly pour the hot cream mixture through the feed tube and process until smooth.  Transfer the mixture to a fondue pot set over low heat, or keep warm until you are ready to serve.

<DirT>
Serve warm with skewered strawberries, pound cake, and bananas.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Cheese fondue may have an unsteady and spotty reputation ó just think of how many times it has gone in and out of fashion ó but the chocolate version has remained a steadfast classic.  Here the chocolate flavor is enhanced with extracts and liqueurs making for a silken, simple dessert.

            Chocolate Pound Cake - {Quatre Quarts Au Chocolat}

Recipe By     :Susan Herrmann Loomis
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1              pinch  sea salt
  4              large  eggs -- room temperature,
                        and separated
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  14       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Thoroughly butter and flour a 9-inch springform pan.  Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom of the pan, place it inside, and butter and flour it as well.

Sift the flour, cocoa powder, and salt onto a piece of parchment paper.

If using an electric mixer, use the whisk attachment if you have one.  In the bowl of the mixer, or in another large bowl, whisk the egg yolks with all but 1 tablespoon of the sugar until they are foamy and pale yellow, and have at least doubled in volume.  Whisk in the vanilla extract.  Sprinkle the flour over the egg yolk mixture and whisk it in quickly, just so it is mixed.  Don't be concerned if some flour still clings to the sides of the bowl; you'll get that later.

Add the butter in thirds, whisking continuously.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and whisk the batter once more, forcefully, so all is combined.  Finally, gently stir the batter several times in a folding motion, as a last assurance that all is mixed together.

In a medium-size bowl, whisk the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are white and foamy but still quite liquid.  Gradually sprinkle the reserved 1 tablespoon sugar into the egg whites, whisking constantly until, they are whiter and slightly firmer, but still this side of forming soft peaks.

Fold one fourth of the egg whites into the batter.  Then add the remaining whites and gently fold them in until they are fully incorporated.

Turn the batter into the prepared pan, and bake in the center of the oven until the cake springs back when touched, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes; then loosen the edge of the mold.  After 15 minutes cooling, remove the cake from the pan and let it cool thoroughly on a wire rack.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  I thought I'd found the best-ever chocolate cake, but thank goodness, a basic rule of life held true: Just when you think you've tasted the best there is, something better comes along.  And this chocolate pound cake is it.

This is moist, dense, satisfying, and very chocolatey.  I like to serve it with a simple Chocolate Cream Icing or even dusted with confectioners' sugar.  If you want to truly impress your guests, make a double batch, bake it in two layers, spread red currant jelly between the layers, and frost it with the icing.

              Chocolate Sauerkraut Cake With Chocolate Glaze

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
     2/3           cup  sauerkraut
     1/2           cup  unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4         sticks  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  3              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  low-fat milk -- cold
                        === GLAZE ===
  4             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1           teaspoon  light corn syrup

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Butter a 12-cup Bundt or tube cake pan.

Put the sauerkraut in a bowl of cold water.  Squeeze it a few times, then drain off the water and gently squeeze the sauerkraut to remove most of the water.  Chop it very fine with a chef's knife or in a food processor.

Sift together the cocoa, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, or by hand, beat the butter and sugar until light and creamy.  In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and vanilla.  While beating the butter, slowly dribble in the eggs.

Stir in one-third of the dry ingredients, then half of the milk.  Then stir in another third of the dry ingredients, then the remaining milk.  Finally, mix in the remaining dry ingredients, and the chopped sauerkraut.

Transfer the batter to the prepared Bundt pan and bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.  Cool completely then invert onto a serving plate.

To make the glaze, heat the chocolate, butter, and corn syrup together until melted and smooth.  Let stand until room temperature, then spoon the glaze over the cooled cake, allowing it to run down the sides.

This recipe yields 1 Bundt cake.

Comments:  I've never met Maida Heatter but everyone I know tells me she is absolutely the loveliest woman they've ever met.  Ask anyone who has ever baked from one of Maida's books, which are full of personal stories and flowing descriptions, and they'll say that she makes you feel as though you've just had a personal baking lesson from the grande dame of American cake making herself.  She generously seasons her recipes with superlatives.  Cakes are glorious, fabulous, towering, stunning, mile high, sinful, and over-the-top.  I've adapted the recipe from one of her recipes and once you bake it, you'll be using superlatives, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BISCOTTI ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- spooned in,
                        and leveled
     1/3           cup  strained Dutch-processed cocoa powder -- spooned in,
                        and leveled
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  3              large  eggs
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- melted, and
                        cooled to tepid
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped walnuts
  12            ounces  semisweet chocolate chips
                        === CHOCOLATE GLAZE ===
     1/3           cup  water
     1/3           cup  light corn syrup
  1                cup  sugar
  8             ounces  fine-quality bittersweet or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        = (such as Lindt Bittersweet)

Make The Biscotti:  Position the shelves in the upper and lower thirds of the oven.  Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly dab the corners of the jelly roll pans with butter and line them with baking parchment.  Set aside.

Whisk together the flour, cocoa, and baking powder.  Set aside.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment, beat the eggs and salt on medium speed until lightened in color, about 2 minutes.  Gradually add the sugar, taking about 2 minutes, then beat in the vanilla.  Pour the tepid butter down the side of the bowl and beat for 30 seconds longer.

Remove the bowl from the mixer, and using an oversize rubber spatula, stir in the walnuts and chocolate chips, then fold in the dry ingredients in three additions, mixing only until combined.  The dough will be very soft.  For ease of handling, let the dough rest for 10 minutes to thicken.

Drop the dough by heaping spoonfuls onto the pans and form four logs, measuring about 12 inches long and 2 inches wide.  Flour your hands lightly and even the sides as best you can.  It's okay if the logs are somewhat irregular.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until set on top.  To ensure even baking, rotate the pans top to bottom and front to back toward the end of baking time.  Let cool for at least 20 minutes.

Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees.  Using a serrated knife, cut the logs on the diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Turn the slices cut-side up and return to the oven for 12 minutes.  Turn the biscotti over and bake for 7 minutes longer or until crisp.

Make The Chocolate Glaze:  While the biscotti are toasting, make the glaze.  Place the water, corn syrup, and sugar in a heavy 2-quart saucepan.  Bring to a boil over low heat, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat and add the chocolate.  Let stand for 2 to 3 minutes, then whisk to smooth.  While the biscotti are still warm, dip the ends into the glaze and set on parchment-lined pans to dry.

Storage:  Store in an airtight container, layered between strips of wax paper, to up to 3 weeks.  These cookies may be frozen, but the glaze may dull.

This recipe yields 6 dozen 3 1/2-inch biscotti.

Comments:  Here is a recipe for Chocolate Biscotti from my former assistant, Judie Levenberg.  Judie, an excellent baker, was the owner of Bake My Day, and much to her clients' delight, one of her specialties was biscotti.  Her father recently told me that his favorite cookie of Judie's was Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Biscotti.  I asked him if he would give me the recipe, and when he did, there was a certain familiarity to it.  Eventually, I came to discover that Judie adapted it from a recipe by Nick Malgieri, who in turn had adapted it from my recipe for Toasted Pecan Mandelbrot!  The old adage, "What goes around, comes around," certainly did come true!

Nibbling on these rich, chocolaty bars brought back many happy memories of the hours Judie and I spent baking together.  Once you try them, I know they will create wonderful memories for you, also.

Make The Biscotti:  Position the shelves in the upper and lower thirds of the oven.  Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly dab the corners of the jelly roll pans with butter and line them with baking parchment.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk together the flour, cocoa, and baking powder.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment, beat the eggs and salt on medium speed until lightened in color, about 2 minutes.  Gradually add the sugar, taking about 2 minutes, then beat in the vanilla.  Pour the tepid butter down the side of the bowl and beat for 30 seconds longer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the bowl from the mixer, and using an oversize rubber spatula, stir in the walnuts and chocolate chips, then fold in the dry ingredients in three additions, mixing only until combined.  The dough will be very soft.  For ease of handling, let the dough rest for 10 minutes to thicken.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drop the dough by heaping spoonfuls onto the pans and form four logs, measuring about 12 inches long and 2 inches wide.  Flour your hands lightly and even the sides as best you can.  It&apos;s okay if the logs are somewhat irregular.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until set on top.  To ensure even baking, rotate the pans top to bottom and front to back toward the end of baking time.  Let cool for at least 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees.  Using a serrated knife, cut the logs on the diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Turn the slices cut-side up and return to the oven for 12 minutes.  Turn the biscotti over and bake for 7 minutes longer or until crisp.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Chocolate Glaze:  While the biscotti are toasting, make the glaze.  Place the water, corn syrup, and sugar in a heavy 2-quart saucepan.  Bring to a boil over low heat, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat and add the chocolate.  Let stand for 2 to 3 minutes, then whisk to smooth.  While the biscotti are still warm, dip the ends into the glaze and set on parchment-lined pans to dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Storage:  Store in an airtight container, layered between strips of wax paper, to up to 3 weeks.  These cookies may be frozen, but the glaze may dull.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 dozen 3 1/2-inch biscotti.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Here is a recipe for Chocolate Biscotti from my former assistant, Judie Levenberg.  Judie, an excellent baker, was the owner of Bake My Day, and much to her clients&apos; delight, one of her specialties was biscotti.  Her father recently told me that his favorite cookie of Judie&apos;s was Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Biscotti.  I asked him if he would give me the recipe, and when he did, there was a certain familiarity to it.  Eventually, I came to discover that Judie adapted it from a recipe by Nick Malgieri, who in turn had adapted it from my recipe for Toasted Pecan Mandelbrot!  The old adage, &quot;What goes around, comes around,&quot; certainly did come true!
</DirT>
<DirT>
Nibbling on these rich, chocolaty bars brought back many happy memories of the hours Judie and I spent baking together.  Once you try them, I know they will create wonderful memories for you, also.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  sugar - (heaping)
     1/2           cup  egg whites - (scant)
                        = (from about 3 large eggs)
  2 1/2           cups  sweetened flaked coconut - (scant)
                        = (such as Baker's)
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        A few toasted almonds -- chopped

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Mix the sugar, egg whites, and coconut together.  Put a spoonful into each of 24 nonstick mini-muffin cups or individual tart molds.  Press the "dough" into the molds to make little cups, with sides and a well for holding the chocolate filling.  Bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes.  Let cool completely in the pans, then gently remove. (See Note)  (You may need to run a plastic knife around the rim of the cups to loosen them.)

To make the filling, place the chocolate in a bowl.  Heat the cream in a small sauce-pan just until boiling, then pour it over the chocolate and let it sit for 1 minute.  Whisk gently to melt the chocolate completely.  Keep whisking until smooth and glossy.

Fill the tarts by pouring in the warm chocolate filling.  Sprinkle a few pieces of chopped almond in the center of each tart while they're still warm.  Let them set at room temperature for at least 1 hour before serving, and serve them the same day they are made.

This recipe yields 24 tartlets.

Comments:  The "dough" for coconut macaroons is so easy to make ó just sugar, egg whites, and coconut ó that I was tempted to see what else it could do.  It's easier to work with than a pastry dough because there is no need to roll it out, it stays wherever you press it, and it holds its shape well after baking.

These little cups of toasted coconut, full of creamy dark chocolate, are like chocolate-dipped macaroons in reverse: lots of chocolate and a little coconut.  I love the flavors together.

Note:  The coconut shells can be mads up to 2 in advance and kept at room temperature in an airtight container.  The chocolate ganache can be refrigerated for up to 5 days; re-warm it in the microwave or in a bowl set over simmering water until it is pourable.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CUPCAKES ====
  3        tablespoons  Dutch-process cocoa powder
     1/4           cup  hot water
  1 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                     orange
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  buttermilk -- room temperature
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- melted, and
                        cooled to room temperature
                        === FROSTING ===
  6             ounces  bittersweet chocolate
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  2               cups  confectioners' sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line 12 standard muffin cups with paper liners.

In a small bowl, stir the cocoa powder into the hot water until it dissolves; set aside.  Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together into a bowl.  Using the finest rasps of a handheld grater, grate the zest from the orange into the bowl.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and granulated sugar until well combined.  Whisk in the buttermilk and vanilla, then the dissolved cocoa.  Whisk in the melted butter, then the dry ingredients.

Using a tablespoon, divide the batter among the muffin cups filling each about half full.  Bake until the cupcakes are puffed and a skewer inserted into the center of one comes out clean 15 to 20 minutes.  Let cool completely on a wire rack.  Remove the cupcakes from the pan.

To make the frosting, melt the chocolate and let cool to room temperature.  Meanwhile, using a stand mixer, beat the butter and confectioners' sugar with the paddle on medium speed until creamy and smooth, about 3 minutes.  Beat in the melted chocolate until combined.  Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip with the frosting and pipe a spiral on top of each cupcake.

Refrigerate the cupcakes until 30 minutes before serving to set the frosting.

This recipe yields 12 cupcakes.

Melting Chocolate:  To melt chocolate, chop it into small pieces and put it in a stainless-steel bowl.  Set the bowl in a saucepan over, but not touching, barely simmering water.  Heat until the chocolate melts, stirring occasionally.  Do not allow any water or steam to come in contact with the chocolate, or it will become stiff and grainy.  Or, chop the chocolate in large pieces, place in a microwave-safe dish, and microwave on low for 1 minute.  Continue to microwave if necessary, checking every 20 seconds, until the chocolate looks softened, then stir until smooth and liquid.

Cocoa Powder:  Chocolate is made by crushing roasted cocoa beans into bits, or nibs, to produce what is known as chocolate liquor.  To make unsweetened cocoa powder, much of the cocoa butter (the fat of chocolate) is removed from the liquor and what remains is ground.  Dutch-process cocoa, or alkalized cocoa, has a mild flavor and a rich, dark color due to the addition of potassium carbonate, nonalkalized cocoa has a bolder taste and lighter color.

                   Coconut Kisses - {Beijinhos De Coco}

Recipe By     :Norman Van Aken
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     extra-large egg yolks
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  1                can  sweetened condensed milk - (14 oz)
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened
  1              pound  unsweetened grated coconut
  1              pound  bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  2               cups  unblanched almonds -- toasted in a dry
                        skillet until fragrant, and then chopped

In a large heatproof bowl, beat the egg yolks.  Using the back of a knife, scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean and add the seeds and bean pod to the eggs.  Add the milk and butter and stir.

Set the bowl over a large pot of simmering water (or use a double boiler); the bottom of the bowl should not touch the water.  Whisk constantly, frequently checking the temperature of the mixture with an instant-read thermometer, until it registers 140 degrees.  Remove from the heat.

Discard the vanilla bean.  Add the coconut and stir until incorporated.  (The mixture will look like the filling of a Mounds candy bar.)

To shape the kisses, use about 1 tablespoon per morsel ó I like to form them into little pyramids, but you may prefer little spheres.  Set them on a platter and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Spread the almonds on a plate.  Put the chocolate into another large heatproof bowl and melt it over simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth.  Pour a little of the melted chocolate into a shallow cup.  With a fork (a cocktail or fondue fork works great), gently skewer each kiss and dip it into the chocolate, then quickly roll it in the chopped almonds and place on a platter.  Continue this process, adding more chocolate to the cup as necessary, until all are dipped and rolled.  Let the chocolate set in a cool place before serving.  (Stored in an airtight container at room temperature, these will keep for up to a week.)

This recipe yields 45 to 50 kisses.

Comments:  You'll love these sweet, heady kisses the way you love a favorite candy bar from your childhood.  Sometimes I offer them with fruit purees for a light contrast.

Note:  To prepare the recipe, you'll need an instant-read thermometer.

With a fork (a cocktail or fondue fork works great), gently skewer each kiss and dip it into the chocolate, then quickly roll it in the chopped almonds and place on a platter.  Continue this process, adding more chocolate to the cup as necessary, until all are dipped and rolled.  Let the chocolate set in a cool place before serving.  (Stored in an airtight container at room temperature, these will keep for up to a week.)

This recipe yields 45 to 50 kisses.

Comments:  You&apos;ll love these sweet, heady kisses the way you love a favorite candy bar from your childhood.  Sometimes I offer them with fruit purees for a light contrast.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
  2               cups  sugar
  4              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  self-rising flour
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1            package  sweetened shredded coconut - (7 oz)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FROSTING ===
  3                     egg whites
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  cold water
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar -- plus
     1/8      teaspoon  cream of tartar
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Sweetened shredded coconut

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and lightly flour three 9- by 2-inch round cake pans, then line the bottoms with waxed paper.

Make The Cake:  In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter until smooth.  Add the sugar gradually and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Combine the flours and add in four parts, alternating with the milk and the vanilla extract, beating well after each addition.  Divide the batter among the cake pans.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until a cake tester inserted into center of cake comes out clean.  Let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes.  Remove from pans and cool completely on wire rack.

Make The Filling:  In a medium-size saucepan, whisk the milk with the sugar and the flour until thoroughly combined.  Cook and stir constantly over medium-high heat (about 5 minutes) until thickened and bubbly.  Remove from heat and add the coconut.  Stir in the vanilla extract.  Cover and cool to room temperature.

When cake has cooled, spread half the filling between the first two layers of cake, then the other half between the second and third layers.  The cake should be assembled so it can be iced as soon as the frosting is completed.

Make The Frosting:  In an electric mixer bowl, combine the egg whites and the vanilla extract and set aside.  In a medium-size saucepan over high heat, combine the water with the sugar and the cream of tartar.  As mixture begins to bubble at edges, stir once to make sure the sugar is dissolved completely, then let come to a rolling boll (about 2 to 3 minutes) and remove immediately from heat.

Now, in a medium-size bowl, on the medium-high speed of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites and the vanilla extract with the whisk attachment until foamy, about 1 minute.

Without turning off mixer, pour the sugar syrup into the beaten egg whites in a thin, steady stream.  Continue beating constantly, on medium-high speed, for about 5 minutes or until stiff peaks form but frosting is still creamy.  Frost top and sides of cake immediately.  Generously sprinkle top with shredded coconut.

This recipe yields 1 three-layer 9-inch cake.

Comments:  Allysa has had this recipe in her cookbook for years.  It's originally from a woman named Kathy who lives in the Midwest.  It's a wonderful cake and has become one of the all-time favorites among customers at the Magnolia Bakery.  This cake is best served the day it is filled and frosted.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    Cortland, McCoun, McIntosh, Greening, or
                        Granny Smith apples - (about 12 cups)
                        Rind and juice of 1 lemon
     1/2           cup  white sugar or to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon - (about)
  2               cups  all-purpose flour - (about)
  1                cup  dark brown sugar
  1 1/2         sticks  unsalted butter
  1                cup  orange juice

Peel, core, and slice the apples.  Place in a greased 9- by 13-inch or equivalent rectangle baking dish.  Grate the lemon rind and then squeeze the juice over the apples.  Sprinkle with the white sugar and about 1/4 teaspoon of the cinnamon.

In a mixing bowl pinch together the flour, brown sugar, and butter or margarine.  Scatter over the apples and then sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon.

Pour the orange juice over the crumb topping.  It will seep through to the apples.

Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven, approximately 30 minutes or until the apples are soft and the top is brown and crusty.  Serve warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings (pareve) or (dairy).

Comments:  One recipe from the Temple Israel cookbook was a crustless apple crumb cake.  An Americanized apple streusel, also known as apple crisp, it was a favorite Friday evening dessert during my childhood.  "Fill any size pie plate with apples, depending upon the size of cake desired," were the vague directions.

Tip: I often add fresh mint or fresh cranberries to my apples ó delicious.

         Crustless Cheesecake From Cyclades - {Myzithropita Hyti}

Recipe By     :Diane Kochilas
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  unsalted fresh anthotyro, fresh myzithra,
                        or whole-milk ricotta cheese
  5               cups  sugar
  12             large  eggs -- lightly beaten
                        Grated zest of 1 orange
  2        tablespoons  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  fine semolina - (to 1/3) -- as needed
     1/2           cup  sesame seeds

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Mash the cheese with a fork in a large bowl.  Add the sugar and combine well.  Add the eggs, orange zest, cinnamon, and vanilla (if desired) and mix with a wire whisk until smooth.  Add 1/4 cup of the semolina and stir.  The mixture should be dense like a porridge.  If it seems too loose, mix in the remaining semolina.

Butter a 9- by 13-inch baking pan.  Sprinkle half the sesame seeds over the bottom of the pan and pour in the cheese mixture.  Sprinkle the remaining sesame seeds over the top.  Bake until set, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Test for doneness by inserting a knife in the center.  It should come out clean.  The pie should be dense.  Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.  While still warm, cut into 3-inch squares and serve.

This recipe yields about twelve 3-inch squares.

Comments:  This recipe appears in various renditions throughout several of the Cyclades.  In Syros, it is baked without the addition of flour.  Elsewhere, as in Tinos, for example, where the cake is called tyropita hyti "poured" ó semolina is added to help bind the cheese and the pie is garnished with sesame seeds.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  hazelnuts
  1                cup  whipping (heavy) cream
     2/3           cup  plus
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1                     extra-large egg
  1                     extra-large egg yolk
     3/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa -- sifted
  6                     butter cookies -- crumbled

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Spread out the hazelnuts on an 11- by 17-inch baking sheet; toast in the preheated oven 12 minutes, or until fragrant and golden.  Rub in a kitchen towel to remove skins, then chop coarsely.

With an electric mixer, beat the cream with a whisk attachment until soft peaks form; add 1/4 cup of the sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.  Transfer to a bowl.

Clean the mixer bowl and the whisk.  Beat the egg, egg yolk, and the remaining 2/3 cup of sugar for 5 minutes, or until thick and pale.  Beat in the cocoa; the mixture will be very thick.  Using a rubber spatula, fold in the chopped hazelnuts, crumbled cookies, and all but 1/2 cup of the whipped cream.  Spoon into six 6-ounce ramekins.  Refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours.

Top the ramekins with the remaining 1/2 cup of whipped cream, piping it through a pastry bag fitted with a fluted tip, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The hills surrounding the town of Alba are known as the Langhe, and their outstanding crop of hazelnuts forms the basis for Turin's gianduja, a delicious hazelnut chocolate, and numerous hazelnut desserts.  The rich hazelnut-chocolate pudding above calls for raw eggs; if you are concerned about salmonella in raw eggs, separate the whole egg, then heat the 2 egg yolks to 140 degrees and maintain them at that temperature for 5 minutes, and heat the egg white to 160 degrees to instant-kill bacteria.

          Devil's Food Cake With Seven-Minute Icing And Coconut

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  2               cups  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  3              large  eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature (see notes)
  9             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- melted (see notes)
  2               cups  milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === ICING ===
  3                     egg whites
  2 1/4           cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  cold water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  light corn syrup
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Sweetened shredded coconut

Make The Cake:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and lightly flour three 9- by 2-inch round cake pans, then line the bottoms with waxed paper.

In a small bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter until smooth.  Add the sugar and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes.

In a separate small bowl, beat the egg yolks until thick and lemon-colored, about 2 minutes.  Add the beaten yolks to the butter mixture and beat well.  Add the chocolate, mixing until well incorporated.  Add the dry ingredients in three parts, alternating with the milk and vanilla.  With each addition, beat until the ingredients are incorporated, but do not overbeat.  Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the batter in the bowl, making sure the ingredients are well blended and the batter is smooth.

In a separate small bowl, beat the egg whites on the high speed of an electric mixer until soft peaks form.  Gently fold into the batter.  Divide the batter among the prepared pans and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.

Let the layers cool in the pans for 1 hour.  Remove from the pans and cool completely on a wire rack.

Make The Icing:  Combine the egg whites, sugar, water, syrup, and salt in the top of a double boiler and place over rapidly boiling water.  On the high speed of an electric mixer, beat constantly for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the icing stands up in soft peaks.

Remove from the heat, add the vanilla, and beat about 1 minute more, or until the icing has the desired spreading consistency.  Use immediately.

When the cake has cooled, ice between the layers, then ice the top and sides of the cake with Seven-Minute Icing.  Sprinkle the top of the cake generously with the coconut.

This recipe yields one 3-layer 9-inch cake.

Comments:  This is the same recipe we've made in my family for every birthday since the beginning of time, and the same cake we serve at the bakery, but a different icing and the coconut garnish give it a whole new taste.

Notes:  It is best to separate the eggs when cold and then allow them to come to room temperature before proceeding with the recipe.  To melt the chocolate, place in a double boiler over simmering water on low heat for approximately 5 to 10 minutes.  Stir occasionally until completely smooth and no pieces of chocolate remain.  Remove from the heat and let cool to lukewarm, 5 to 10 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
     3/4           cup  milk
  1 1/2           cups  fresh ripe blackberries
  6        tablespoons  sugar
                        === SLICED-LEMON SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1                     vanilla bean -- split and scraped
                        = (or 1 tspn vanilla extract)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     lemon - (to 2), preferably Meyer lemons -- peeled, halved
                        lengthwise, seeded, and cut into
                        paper-thin crosswise slices on a
                        mandoline or by hand

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter two 12-inch loaf pans.  Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together into a medium bowl.  Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in the 4 tablespoons of cold butter until the mixture resembles crumbs.  Add the milk and mix with a fork until the dough comes together.

Turn out onto a floured board and knead 4 or 5 times, or until smooth.  Cut the dough in half.  On a floured board, roll out half of the dough into a rectangle 8 inches wide and 1/4-inch thick.  Brush with half of the melted butter.  Top with 3/4 cup of the blackberries and sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of the sugar.  Roll up jelly-roll style, forming an 8-inch-long roll.  Place, seam-side down, in one of the prepared pans.  Repeat the process, using the remaining half of the dough and filling.  Bake in the pans for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the crust is firm and beginning to brown.

While the roly-poly is cooking, make the sauce:  In a medium saucepan, blend together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt.  Add the water, lemon juice, vanilla bean and scrapings, and stir until smooth.  (If using vanilla extract, wait to add until the syrup is removed from the heat.)  Cook over medium heat, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is thick and clear.  Remove from heat, add the butter, and continue to stir until melted and blended.  Let cool slightly and stir in the lemon slices.  Take out the vanilla bean, if using.

Remove the roly-poly from the oven and let cool in the pans for 10 minutes.  Turn out onto a wire rack.  Cut into 2-inch slices and serve with lemon sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  One of the recipes in Elizabeth's box had a name that intrigued me.  The words roly-poly, written in her elegant hand, jumped out at me like a secret that had been kept hidden inside the box for too long.

Chefs Note:  The lemon sauce will keep for 3 to 4 days but is best served the day it is made.  It will thicken when refrigerated; simply stir to loosen the sauce.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter two 12-inch loaf pans.  Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together into a medium bowl.  Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in the 4 tablespoons of cold butter until the mixture resembles crumbs.  Add the milk and mix with a fork until the dough comes together.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn out onto a floured board and knead 4 or 5 times, or until smooth.  Cut the dough in half.  On a floured board, roll out half of the dough into a rectangle 8 inches wide and 1/4-inch thick.  Brush with half of the melted butter.  Top with 3/4 cup of the blackberries and sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of the sugar.  Roll up jelly-roll style, forming an 8-inch-long roll.  Place, seam-side down, in one of the prepared pans.  Repeat the process, using the remaining half of the dough and filling.  Bake in the pans for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the crust is firm and beginning to brown.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the roly-poly is cooking, make the sauce:  In a medium saucepan, blend together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt.  Add the water, lemon juice, vanilla bean and scrapings, and stir until smooth.  (If using vanilla extract, wait to add until the syrup is removed from the heat.)  Cook over medium heat, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is thick and clear.  Remove from heat, add the butter, and continue to stir until melted and blended.  Let cool slightly and stir in the lemon slices.  Take out the vanilla bean, if using.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the roly-poly from the oven and let cool in the pans for 10 minutes.  Turn out onto a wire rack.  Cut into 2-inch slices and serve with lemon sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  One of the recipes in Elizabeth&apos;s box had a name that intrigued me.  The words roly-poly, written in her elegant hand, jumped out at me like a secret that had been kept hidden inside the box for too long.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Chefs Note:  The lemon sauce will keep for 3 to 4 days but is best served the day it is made.  It will thicken when refrigerated; simply stir to loosen the sauce.

            Lamb Curry With Pear Chutney, Brown Rice, And Okra

Recipe By     :Jacques PÈpin

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CURRY SEASONING MIXTURE ===
  1         tablespoon  whole coriander seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  hot red-pepper flakes
  2          teaspoons  black peppercorns
     1/2      teaspoon  whole cloves
  1           teaspoon  mustard seeds
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  2          teaspoons  ground turmeric
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        === STEW ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3             pounds  lamb leg meat, as lean as possible -- cut 2" pieces
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  curry seasoning mixture -- (see above)
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  diced (1/4") onions
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  water
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped tomato flesh -- seeds and skin
                        removed (from 2 large tomatoes) see Note
  1              pound  apples - (abt 3) -- unpeeled, stems and
                        cores removed, cut 1/2" dice (2 1/2 cups)
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled, crushed,
                        and chopped fine (1 tbspn)
  2                     bananas -- peeled, and
                        sliced (1 1/2 cups)
                        Mint leaves -- for garnish
                        Pear Chutney -- (see recipe)
                        Brown Rice -- (see recipe)
                        Okra -- (see recipe)

Grind the seasoning ingredients to a powder in a mini-chop or spice-grinder.

Heat the butter in a large saucepan.  When hot, add the meat in one layer.  Sprinkle with the salt, and brown on all sides over medium to high heat for about 10 minutes.  Mix the curry seasoning with the flour in a bowl, then stir it and the onions into the pan containing the meat.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then add the wine, water, and remaining stew ingredients, and mix them in.

Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat to low, and boil gently for 45 minutes.  At this point, the meat should be tender when pierced with the point of a knife; if still tough, cook a little longer.  If an excessive amount of liquid remains, continue boiling the stew, uncovered, to reduce the sauce further.

To serve, spoon the stew onto a large serving platter.  Scatter the warm okra and a few mint leaves on top, and serve with the pear chutney and rice on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Lamb leg is ideal for stewing or braising because it is moist and tender when well cooked.  The amount of curry powder used and the hotness of the curry seasoning mixture can be varied to suit your own taste.  Some of the spices in the curry powder come whole and some are already ground; when possible, buy the whole seeds and grind them yourself for a fresher and better flavor.  If you decide not to make your own curry powder, it is widely available in most markets.

The pear chutney is easy to make and can be prepared weeks ahead, as it keeps well refrigerated.  Many commercial chutneys are available, if you don't have the time to make the one here.

Note: To Peel And Seed A Tomato:

ï There are several ways to peel a tomato:  Holding it over the flame of a gas stove not only chars the skin, which then will peel off, but also gives the tomato a mildly smoky taste.  If the tomato is a bit firm, you can peel it with a good vegetable peeler or a knife.  If, however, you have a lot of tomatoes to peel, the easiest way is first to remove their stems with the point of a knife, and then to drop the tomatoes into boiling water to cover.  Leave them in the water from 10 to 30 seconds, depending on their ripeness, with the ripest ones needing the least time.  Remove with a skimmer, and cool for a few minutes at room temperature.

ï To seed a tomato:  Cut the tomato crosswise (not through the stem) into halves, which will expose all the little pockets of seeds.  Holding a tomato upside down over a bowl, squeeze it gently to extrude the seeds.  Repeat with the other tomato half.  You now have pure tomato flesh; the seeds and skin can be used in stock, and the flesh can be diced, julienned, or chopped for sautÈing or for use in a fresh tomato sauce, salad, or as a garnish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MEAT STOCK REDUCTION ===
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions
  1                cup  chopped carrots
  1                cup  chopped celery
  2        tablespoons  grapeseed oil
  1                cup  red wine
  2             quarts  beef stock
  4             sprigs  thyme
                        === ARTICHOKES ===
  2                     raw artichoke bottoms -- with stems attached
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil
  3             sprigs  thyme
  2                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === LAMB AND SAUCE ===
  2             pounds  lamb loin with extra fat slab attached
  2        tablespoons  pureed Kalamata olives
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  grapeseed oil
  1                cup  red wine
  1                cup  julienned red onion
     1/2           cup  julienned red bell pepper
     1/2           cup  sliced Kalamata olives
     1/2           cup  Meat Stock Reduction -- (above)
  2        tablespoons  capers -- rinsed, chopped
     1/2    tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
                        === GARNISH ===
  1                cup  freshly-cooked French green lentils -- hot
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4          teaspoons  micro parsley or chervil leaves
                        = (or chopped fresh parsley or chervil)
  4          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Make The Meat Stock Reduction:  SautÈ the onions, carrots, and celery in the grapeseed oil in a medium saucepan over high heat for 10 minutes, or until golden brown and caramelized.  Deglaze the pan with the wine and cook until most of the wine has been absorbed.  Add the stock and simmer over low heat for 1 hour.

Strain and return the liquid to the saucepan.  Add the thyme and simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove the thyme and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until reduced to 1 1/2 cups.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve.  Store in the refrigerator up to 4 days, or freeze up to 2 months.

Make The Artichokes:  Slice the artichokes into 1/3-inch-thick wedges.  Place the artichokes in a small saucepan with the olive oil, thyme, garlic, bay leaves, and lemon juice; cook over low heat for 15 minutes, or until the artichokes are cooked al dente.  Remove the artichokes from the pan to prevent overcooking.  The artichokes can be prepared several hours ahead of time.  Reheat them in the oil just prior to serving.  Drain the artichokes and season to taste with salt and pepper at the last minute.

Make The Lamb And Sauce:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Rub the lamb loin with the olive puree and roll up in the attached fat slab, covering the whole loin.  Secure with butcher's twine.

Season the outside of the loin with salt and pepper.  Heat the grapeseed oil in a roasting pan over high heat.  Add the loin and sear on all sides until golden brown and crispy.

Roast in the oven for 30 minutes, or until cooked to medium-rare.  Transfer the lamb to a cutting board and let rest.  Drain off any excess fat from the pan.

Deglaze the pan on the stove top with the wine, then add the onion and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the onion is tender.  Add the bell pepper, sliced olives, stock reduction, capers, vinegar and chives; cook for 3 minutes longer to bring the flavors together.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Remove the cooking twine from the lamb and cut into 1 1/2-inch-thick medallions.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Assemble The Dish:  Spoon some of the lentils and artichokes in the center of each plate.  Place a slice of the lamb atop the lentils and spoon the sauce around the plate.  Top with pepper and sprinkle with the micro parsley.  Drizzle the olive oil around the plate.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Of all the harmonious pairings of foodstuffs, artichokes and lamb certainly rank in the upper echelon.  Here, with lentils for body and olives, capers, and red onion for zest, we have the makings of a heavenly dish.  And while the sheer earthiness of this preparation may satisfy on a very basic level, the flavors are actually quite delicate.  Coarse sea salt and a few leaves of chervil are all that are needed to round things out.

Wine Notes:  The brightness of the Red Wine-Kalamata Olive Sauce and the earthiness of the lamb direct the match to a Rioja from San Vicente.  The brown spice notes of cumin and coriander from the San Vicente enhance the roasted flavors of the lamb.  Another characteristic of wines from the Rioja region of Spain is their elevated level of acidity, which ties in precisely with the olive sauce.

<DirT>
Make The Meat Stock Reduction:  SautÈ the onions, carrots, and celery in the grapeseed oil in a medium saucepan over high heat for 10 minutes, or until golden brown and caramelized.  Deglaze the pan with the wine and cook until most of the wine has been absorbed.  Add the stock and simmer over low heat for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain and return the liquid to the saucepan.  Add the thyme and simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove the thyme and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until reduced to 1 1/2 cups.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve.  Store in the refrigerator up to 4 days, or freeze up to 2 months.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Artichokes:  Slice the artichokes into 1/3-inch-thick wedges.  Place the artichokes in a small saucepan with the olive oil, thyme, garlic, bay leaves, and lemon juice; cook over low heat for 15 minutes, or until the artichokes are cooked al dente.  Remove the artichokes from the pan to prevent overcooking.  The artichokes can be prepared several hours ahead of time.  Reheat them in the oil just prior to serving.  Drain the artichokes and season to taste with salt and pepper at the last minute.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Lamb And Sauce:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Rub the lamb loin with the olive puree and roll up in the attached fat slab, covering the whole loin.  Secure with butcher&apos;s twine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the outside of the loin with salt and pepper.  Heat the grapeseed oil in a roasting pan over high heat.  Add the loin and sear on all sides until golden brown and crispy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast in the oven for 30 minutes, or until cooked to medium-rare.  Transfer the lamb to a cutting board and let rest.  Drain off any excess fat from the pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Deglaze the pan on the stove top with the wine, then add the onion and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the onion is tender.  Add the bell pepper, sliced olives, stock reduction, capers, vinegar and chives; cook for 3 minutes longer to bring the flavors together.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Remove the cooking twine from the lamb and cut into 1 1/2-inch-thick medallions.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Assemble The Dish:  Spoon some of the lentils and artichokes in the center of each plate.  Place a slice of the lamb atop the lentils and spoon the sauce around the plate.  Top with pepper and sprinkle with the micro parsley.  Drizzle the olive oil around the plate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Of all the harmonious pairings of foodstuffs, artichokes and lamb certainly rank in the upper echelon.  Here, with lentils for body and olives, capers, and red onion for zest, we have the makings of a heavenly dish.  And while the sheer earthiness of this preparation may satisfy on a very basic level, the flavors are actually quite delicate.  Coarse sea salt and a few leaves of chervil are all that are needed to round things out.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Notes:  The brightness of the Red Wine-Kalamata Olive Sauce and the earthiness of the lamb direct the match to a Rioja from San Vicente.  The brown spice notes of cumin and coriander from the San Vicente enhance the roasted flavors of the lamb.  Another characteristic of wines from the Rioja region of Spain is their elevated level of acidity, which ties in precisely with the olive sauce.

                          Lamb With Garlic Mash

Recipe By     :Donna Hay
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     double lamb chops -- trimmed
  1           teaspoon  cracked black pepper
  3        tablespoons  chopped mint
     1/2           cup  red wine
  1         tablespoon  grainy mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        === GARLIC MASH ===
  6                     garlic cloves -- unpeeled
  6                     mashing (starchy) potatoes -- peeled, chopped
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1               cups  hot milk - (to 1 1/4)
  1              pinch  sea salt

Place lamb chops in a shallow dish.  Combine pepper, mint, wine, mustard and cumin, and pour over the lamb.  Allow chops to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, preferably 2 hours.

To make garlic mash, place unpeeled garlic in a dry frying pan over medium heat.  Allow to cook, turning occasionally, for 10 minutes or until garlic skins are golden brown, then cool.  Squeeze garlic from skins and mash with a fork.

Place potatoes in a saucepan of boiling water, bring back to a simmer and cook for 6 minutes or until tender.  While potatoes are cooking, drain marinade from lamb and place in a small saucepan.  Allow marinade to simmer over low heat until syrupy.

Heat a frying pan over high heat.  (You can add a tablespoon of olive oil, if you prefer).  Add lamb to pan and cook 2 to 3 minutes on each side or until cooked to your liking.

To finish mash, drain potatoes, return them to the warm pan, add butter, and mash while slowly adding milk until thick and creamy.  Stir through salt and mashed garlic.

To serve, place a pile of mash on plates, top with lamb and spoon over the sauce.  Serve with a salad of arugula and balsamic vinegar or baby spinach leaves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This classic combination of lamb and mashed potatoes is a must on cold winter nights.  Having a double chop gives a heftier quality to the dish and allows for easier rare and medium-rare cooking.

        Langoustines With Green Curry Sauce, Roasted Pearl Onions

Recipe By     :Charlie Trotter
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHELLFISH OIL ===
  4                     raw lobster heads
  1           teaspoon  tomato paste
  1                cup  grapeseed oil

  12                    purple pearl onions -- unpeeled
  3             sprigs  thyme
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  12                    scallions -- trimmed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GREEN CURRY SAUCE ===
  6                     scallions -- chopped
  6                     jalapeÒo chiles -- seeded and chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  coriander seeds -- toasted, crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     fresh kaffir lime leaves -- torn
  2             stalks  lemongrass -- trimmed of its
                        outer sheath, chopped
  2               cups  chopped fresh basil leaves - -- (loosely packed)
  1              bunch  cilantro with stems -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     limes -- zested, juiced
     1/4           cup  unsweetened coconut milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === LANGOUSTINES ===
  2                     shallots -- minced
  2        tablespoons  Shellfish Oil -- (above)
  8                     langoustines -- shells removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  baby lettuce leaves - (firmly packed)
                        === GARNISH ===
  4          teaspoons  Shellfish Oil -- (above)
  4          teaspoons  thinly-sliced fresh basil
                        Freshly-ground black pepper

Make The Shellfish Oil:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the lobster heads in a roasting pan and roast for 40 minutes or until they are bright red.  Break up the heads into small pieces and place in a small saucepan with the tomato paste and grapeseed oil.  Heat the mixture over medium-low heat for 10 minutes, then cool and refrigerate for 2 days.

Strain the oil through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth and discard the solids.  Refrigerate until ready to use, or up to 2 weeks.

Make The Vegetables:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place the beets, onions, thyme, and olive oil in an ovenproof pan.  Cover the vegetables and roast for 30 minutes.  Add the scallions and replace the cover.  Continue to roast for 20 more minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.  Peel the onions and beets and cut the beets in half.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Make The Sauce:  In a blender, puree the scallions, chiles, garlic, ginger, coriander, black pepper, lime leaves, lemongrass, basil, cilantro, olive oil, and lime zest and juice; pass through a fine-mesh sieve.  Add the coconut milk and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Warm just prior to use.

Make The Langoustines:  Heat a sautÈ pan over medium heat.  Add the shallots and Shellfish Oil and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the langoustines.  Increase the heat to high and continue to cook the langoustines for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through.  Remove the langoustines from the pan and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Add the lettuce to the same pan and quickly wilt it in the hot pan; transfer to a bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Slice each langoustine into 4 pieces.

Assembly The Dish:  Cover the center of each plate with a generous amount of the green curry sauce.  Arrange some of the wilted lettuce, langoustines, and vegetables on top of the sauce.  Drizzle the Shellfish Oil around the plate and top with the sliced basil and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Langoustines (or, if you choose, lobster or shrimp) and scallions come off as superstars when paired with this green curry sauce.  The aromas and flavors meld into something both exotic and ethereal.  Small pearl onions, while slightly sweet, provide just the right bit to cut into the shellfish and the intoxicating curry sauce.  Baby lettuces are just wilted, and golden beets nicely round out this glorious combination of tastes.

Wine Notes:  This dish is a sommelier's dream!  Nearly every white wine is successful with it; the only differences are the ingredients highlighted.  A Meursault from Arnaud Ente accentuates the citrus qualities of the sauce without masking the tantalizing flavor of the langoustines.  The mineral flavors are emphasized by Domaine Louis Michel's unoaked version of Chablis.  Riesling Kabinett from Zilliken in the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer has a hint of sweetness that contrasts well with the spiciness in the curry sauce.

Make The Shellfish Oil:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the lobster heads in a roasting pan and roast for 40 minutes or until they are bright red.

Make The Vegetables:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place the beets, onions, thyme, and olive oil in an ovenproof pan.  Cover the vegetables and roast for 30 minutes.  Add the scallions and replace the cover.  Continue to roast for 20 more minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.  Peel the onions and beets and cut the beets in half.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Sauce:  In a blender, puree the scallions, chiles, garlic, ginger, coriander, black pepper, lime leaves, lemongrass, basil, cilantro, olive oil, and lime zest and juice; pass through a fine-mesh sieve.  Add the coconut milk and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Warm just prior to use.

<DirT>
Make The Langoustines:  Heat a sautÈ pan over medium heat.  Add the shallots and Shellfish Oil and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the langoustines.  Increase the heat to high and continue to cook the langoustines for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through.  Remove the langoustines from the pan and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Assembly The Dish:  Cover the center of each plate with a generous amount of the green curry sauce.  Arrange some of the wilted lettuce, langoustines, and vegetables on top of the sauce.  Drizzle the Shellfish Oil around the plate and top with the sliced basil and pepper.

Comments:  Langoustines (or, if you choose, lobster or shrimp) and scallions come off as superstars when paired with this green curry sauce.  The aromas and flavors meld into something both exotic and ethereal.  Small pearl onions, while slightly sweet, provide just the right bit to cut into the shellfish and the intoxicating curry sauce.  Baby lettuces are just wilted, and golden beets nicely round out this glorious combination of tastes.

Wine Notes:  This dish is a sommelier&apos;s dream!  Nearly every white wine is successful with it; the only differences are the ingredients highlighted.  A Meursault from Arnaud Ente accentuates the citrus qualities of the sauce without masking the tantalizing flavor of the langoustines.  The mineral flavors are emphasized by Domaine Louis Michel&apos;s unoaked version of Chablis.  Riesling Kabinett from Zilliken in the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer has a hint of sweetness that contrasts well with the spiciness in the curry sauce.

        Linguine With Mixed Seafood - {Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare}

Recipe By     :Rick Stein

                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4         pounds  prepared mixed shellfish
                        = (such as small hard-shell or soft-shell
                        clams, mussels, raw langoustines, and raw
                        small or medium shrimp in shell)
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1              pound  cherry tomatoes
                        = (or small vine-ripened tomatoes)
  1              pound  linguine
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  5                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1              pinch  dried red pepper flakes
  3        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Put the clams and mussels in a large pan with the wine, cover, and cook over a high heat for 3 to 4 minutes, until they have opened (discard any that remain closed).  Tip into a colander placed over a bowl and set aside.

Squeeze the tomatoes to remove most of the seeds and juice, then coarsely chop them.

Bring a large pan of well-salted water (1 teaspoon salt to each 2 1/2 cups water) to a boil.  Add the linguine and bring back to a boil, then cook for about 8 minutes or until al dente.

Meanwhile, put the olive oil and garlic into a large pan and heat slowly until the garlic begins to sizzle.  Add the pepper flakes and tomatoes, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Stir in all but the last 1 to 2 tablespoons of the cooking liquid from the clams and mussels.  Bring back to a boil and simmer until reduced to a sauce-like consistency.

Stir the langoustines into the sauce and turn them over until they turn pink.  Add the shrimp and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes longer, until the langoustines and shrimp are both cooked.  Stir in the cooked clams and mussels, along with the chopped parsley, and turn them over a few times until heated through.  Season, if necessary, with a little salt and some pepper.

Drain the pasta well and tip it into a large, warmed serving dish.  Pour the seafood sauce over the pasta and toss together well.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The good thing about this dish is that depending on your guests, you can mix and match shellfish to suit their preferences.  One word of caution: Make plenty, it always goes quickly.

Alternative Fish:  Any mixture of shellfish, plus maybe some prepared and sliced bay scallops or squid.

Categories    : Duck                            Entree
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     duck - (3 1/2 to 5 lbs) with the liver -- wing tips trimmed
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  fresh bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  rendered duck fat or olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, minced
  1              large  shallot -- peeled, minced
     1/2           cup  flat-leaf parsley leaves - -- (loosely packed)
  1              large  egg
     1/4           cup  crËme fraÓche
                        = (or heavy [or whipping] cream)

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.  Measure out a piece of aluminum foil large enough to wrap around the duck, and set it aside.

Trim away any excess fat from the duck.  Season the cavity of the duck with salt and pepper.

While the oven is preheating, place the bread crumbs on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven until golden, about 10 minutes, stirring them once or twice so they are evenly toasted.  Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature.

Melt the fat in a medium-size heavy saucepan and over medium heat.  Add the garlic and shallot and cook, stirring, until they are softened and beginning to turn translucent, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Mince the parsley.  Mince the duck liver.

In a medium-size bowl, whisk together the egg and the crËme fraÓche.  Add the liver, the garlic and shallot, and the parsley.  Using your hands, add the bread crumbs, breaking up any clumps as you do; mix well.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Place the stuffing in the cavity of the duck, gently pressing if necessary to fit it all in.  Close the duck, skewering the flaps of skin over the opening.  You may truss the duck if you like, though it is not necessary.

Place the duck, breast-side down, in a roasting pan and roast just until golden on top, 10 to 12 minutes.  Turn it on one side and roast for 10 minutes; then remove and discard any fat that has melted from the duck, using a bulb baster or a large spoon.  Repeat on the other side for 10 minutes, and then turn the duck on its back (breast-side up) and continue roasting until the duck is cooked to your liking, an additional 20 to 35 minutes.  You can test the duck by pressing on the breast meat ó if it is firm with just a bit of spring, it is cooked through.  If it is still rather springy, it will be quite rare.  If you like the breast meat rare, remove it from the oven immediately.  If you like the meat more cooked but still pink, roast it an additional 10 minutes.  The duck will take 1 to 1 1/4 hours to roast (a thermometer inserted into the fleshy part of the thigh should register 180 degrees).

Transfer the duck to the reserved aluminum foil, back-side down, and season it generously with salt and pepper.  Turn it over and season the other side.  Then enclose it loosely in the aluminum foil and let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.

To serve, carve the duck and transfer the pieces to a warmed serving platter.  Scoop the stuffing from the cavity, and arrange it nicely on the platter.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Marie-Claude Gracia is the chef and owner of La Belle Gasconne, a sybaritic auberge in the tiny Gascon village of Poudenas.  Mme. Gracia is considered by many to be one of the best chefs in France, an honor she regards with a certain insouciance.  "I cook what I learned from my grandmother, changing things here and there, and I do it because I love it - it's that simple," she says with a smile.

I spent several days with her in the kitchen at La Belle Gasconne and came away with this method of roasting duck, which is unique to Gascony.  It fits with Gascon cuisine, however, which is based on the notion that fat gives flavor to food, but shouldn't be a part of it.  That is why, throughout the roasting, Mme. Gracia removes the fat that comes from the duck so that the roasting pan is nearly dry by the time the duck is cooked.  The duck itself is tender and succulent.

The stuffing here is based on the one used by Mme. Gracia, though I have adapted it slightly.

If you can find only a 3- to 4-pound duck, roast it for 10 minutes per side as described in step 8; then test it to see if it is cooked to your liking.  Though ducks may differ in size by as much as a pound, surprisingly, the cooking time is often not that much different.

To test for doneness, press gently on the breast meat; it should spring back when touched.  Also, pierce the leg and thigh joint with a sharp knife or skewer; the juices should run clear and golden (a thermometer inserted into the fleshy part of the thigh should register 180 degrees).  Try an excellent quality red Burgundy with this dish.

Make The Avocado Butter:  In a food processor, puree the avocado with the lime juice, cayenne, sour cream, and salt and pepper until smooth.  Cover and refrigerate.

Make The Vinaigrette:  Whisk together the garlic oil, grapefruit juice, vinegar, honey, and salt and pepper in a bowl.  Set aside while you finish preparing the dish.

Make The Spice Rub:  In a dry skillet, toast the cumin and peppercorns over medium heat until fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds.  Cool the spices, then finely grind them in a spice mill or with a mortar and pestle.  Pour into an airtight container, add the sugar and salt, and mix well.

Make The Chicken:  Bring out three bowls.  Put 1 cup of the flour in one and season with 1 tablespoon of the spice rub.  In the second, beat the eggs and sour cream until smooth.  Season with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the spice rub.  In the third bowl, combine the masa harina with the remaining half cup flour and 1 tablespoon spice rub.

Coat the chicken strips in the flour, shaking off any excess, then dip them into the egg-and sour-cream mixture.  Finally, coat them in the masa harina mixture.  In a large skillet, heat the oil to 325 degrees, and cook the chicken strips, in batches, turning once or twice, until golden brown.  Drain them on paper towels.

To assemble the dish, toss the greens with just enough dressing to coat.  Arrange the pepper slices around the greens on six salad plates.  Cut each chicken strip crosswise in half and place them atop the peppers.  Place the dressed salad greens in the center of the plates.  Drop 1/2 tablespoon of avocado butter, followed by 1/2 teaspoon sour cream, on top of each piece of chicken.  Drizzle a little of the remaining vinaigrette over each plate and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  You are going to fall in love with this gorgeous little dish.  Furthermore, I'm sure you'll want to use the Avocado Butter and the Grapefruit-Honey Vinaigrette in other dishes you make.

Recommended Wines:  A white wine from Crozes-Hermitage or a young Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground lamb or beef
  1              small  onion -- grated
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin
  2            pinches  cayenne
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  2             pounds  tomatoes -- chopped,
                        = (or one 2-lb can organic chopped
                        tomatoes)
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              bunch  parsley -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1           teaspoon  finely-ground black pepper
  6             medium  eggs

Combine the ground meat, grated onion, parsley, cilantro, cumin, cayenne, and salt and pepper.  Wet your hands and form the mixture into 1-inch balls.

Heat the olive oil in a tagine, cazuela, or black iron skillet set over a flame tamer over medium heat.  SautÈ the meatballs in the oil until well browned on all sides.  Remove the meatballs from the pan to a dish.

To the same pan add the chopped onions, tomatoes, garlic, parsley, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, and pepper.  Cook uncovered for 30 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced to a thick gravy.

Add the meatballs back to sauce and simmer for 10 minutes.  Carefully, break the eggs into the sauce and poach them for 5 minutes, or until set.  Serve at once, directly from the pan with chunks of dense, crusty bread.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  One of my favorite comfort dishes in Morocco is this stew of kefta (meat) balls served in a rich cinnamon-flavored tomato sauce, in which eggs are poached in the final few minutes of cooking.  The meat, eggs, and sauce should be served together in a shallow pan such as a tagine, cazuela, or iron skillet.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     2/3           cup  Madeira
  2        tablespoons  minced shallot
  1                     thyme sprig
     1/2                bay leaf
  2               cups  veal or beef stock
  1 1/2      teaspoons  arrowroot -- mixed with
  1 1/2      teaspoons  water -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  cold unsalted butter - (to 2)
     3/4      teaspoon  kosher salt -- plus salt to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  red wine vinegar
     1/2         ounce  fresh or preserved black winter truffle - -- (to 1 oz)
                        === MEDALLIONS ===
  4                     filet of beef (tenderloin) medallions -- room temperature
                        = (4 oz ea; abt 1 1/2" thick)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4                     grade-A or -B duck foie gras medallions - -- (1 oz ea)

Make The Sauce:  In a saucepan, combine the Madeira, shallot, thyme, and bay leaf.  Bring to a gentle simmer and cook until the wine is reduced to a light syrup coating the shallots.  (The wine may flame briefly.)

Pour the stock into the wine reduction and simmer until reduced by half.  Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.  If the sauce is not thick enough to nap the meat, whisk the arrowroot mixture into the sauce and bring to a full boil to thicken.  Lower heat and whisk in the butter.  Season with the 3/4 teaspoon salt, the pepper, and vinegar.  Slice the truffle paper-thin with a truffle slicer, mandoline, or very sharp knife and add to the sauce.  Set aside and keep warm in a double boiler over hot water for up to 1 hour.  (You may need to adjust the consistency with a bit of water if the sauce thickens.)

Make The Medallions:  Meanwhile, pat the beef medallions dry with paper towels and season one side of the meat with salt and pepper.  Heat a heavy skillet over low heat.  Add the oil to the pan, increase the heat to high, and place the meat, seasoned-side down, in the pan.  SautÈ until the steaks are a rich burnished brown on the bottom, about 4 minutes.  Season the remaining side with salt and pepper to taste, turn, reduce the heat slightly, and brown the other side, 3 to 4 minutes.  Brown the sides of the medallions by standing them on their sides.  Transfer the meat to a plate while you sear the foie gras.

Wipe out the skillet and heat it over high heat.  Season the foie gras medallions with salt and pepper to taste.  Add the medallions to the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until a deep brown on the bottom.  Drain off any excess fat.  Turn the foie gras with a metal spatula and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the foie gras softens but still has some resilience.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.

To serve, remove any strings from the medallions and place the medallions on warmed plates or a platter.  Top with the foie gras and nap with the sauce, making sure that a couple of slices of truffles rest on each serving of foie gras.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This winning combination is known in the classic French repertoire as tournedos Rossini.  The story is that the composer Rossini, a devoted fan of truffles, asked a chef to prepare this dish.  The chef balked, suggesting that it was ill-conceived.  The maestro said that if the chef was offended, the maestro himself could prepare the dish quickly while the chef's back was turned.  The word tournedos thus supposedly comes from the French phrase tourner le dos, to turn one's back.  Prepare this when you are pouring a prodigious red wine, and you surely won't be vexed.

Season the remaining side with salt and pepper to taste, turn, reduce the heat slightly, and brown the other side, 3 to 4 minutes.  Brown the sides of the medallions by standing them on their sides.  Transfer the meat to a plate while you sear the foie gras.

Wipe out the skillet and heat it over high heat.  Season the foie gras medallions with salt and pepper to taste.  Add the medallions to the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until a deep brown on the bottom.  Drain off any excess fat.  Turn the foie gras with a metal spatula and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the foie gras softens but still has some resilience.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, remove any strings from the medallions and place the medallions on warmed plates or a platter.  Top with the foie gras and nap with the sauce, making sure that a couple of slices of truffles rest on each serving of foie gras.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This winning combination is known in the classic French repertoire as tournedos Rossini.  The story is that the composer Rossini, a devoted fan of truffles, asked a chef to prepare this dish.  The chef balked, suggesting that it was ill-conceived.  The maestro said that if the chef was offended, the maestro himself could prepare the dish quickly while the chef&apos;s back was turned.  The word tournedos thus supposedly comes from the French phrase tourner le dos, to turn one&apos;s back.  Prepare this when you are pouring a prodigious red wine, and you surely won&apos;t be vexed.

                  Mini-Burgers With Waffled White Bread

Recipe By     :Rebecca Bent
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Entree
                Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pieces  sliced white sandwich bread -- crusts removed
  9             ounces  ground beef - (a little over 1/2 lb)
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley -- plus
  12                    parsley sprigs -- for garnish
  2        tablespoons  olive oil to season skillet -- (optional)
  12                    thin slices Cheddar cheese, abt 2" square -- (optional)

Heat an electric nonstick waffle iron to medium.

Place a slice of trimmed bread in the center of the hot waffle iron and press down hard to toast and perforate the bread for 1 minute, or until the bread's waffle design has browned nicely.  When toasted, cut each slice into square pieces about 1 inch by 1 inch.  You should have enough bread for about 12 mini-burgers.

In a medium bowl, combine the beef, salt, and chopped parsley, and mix well with your hands.  Remove a heaping tablespoon of the mixture, a little less than 1 ounce, and roll it into a ball.  Flatten it slightly into a patty no thicker than 1 inch.  The 9 ounces of beef should make about 12 mini-burgers.

Warm a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.  Slick the skillet with the olive oil.  Or, if using a grill, cook the mini-burgers on a sheet of aluminum foil perforated several times with a fork to allow the juices to drip away.  Cook the burgers no longer than 1 minute per side for medium-rare.  Top each burger with the optional cheese as soon as you flip the burger.  Serve each burger between 2 slices of waffled bread, with a sprig of parsley on top (see Note).

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Mini-burgers make perfect party food: Guests can hold them in one hand.  Because mini-burger buns are not easily purchased, I place a piece of white bread, crusts trimmed, in heated nonstick waffle iron, then press down long enough to toast it and leave waffle indentations in the bread.

One slice of bread provides buns for about four mini-burgers.

Note:  Try topping with other flavors such as fresh herbs, a dab of ketchup, a sliver of roasted bell pepper, or a pinch of ground spice.  There are endless possibilities to add more flavor and color to these versatile minis.

           Mini-Crusted Roast Leg Of Lamb With Tart Plum Sauce

Recipe By     :Anya von Bremzen
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PLUM SAUCE ===
  3               cups  pitted chopped unripe fresh prunes,
                        unripe black or red plums, or sliced
                        rhubarb (abt 2 lbs)
  1                cup  water
  1           teaspoon  sugar - (to 2) -- optional
  2              large  garlic cloves -- crushed through
                        press
  1           teaspoon  crushed or ground coriander seeds
                        A large pinch of fenugreek
                        = (available at Indian and Middle Eastern
                        groceries)
  1           teaspoon  dried savory or mint
     1/2      teaspoon  Aleppo pepper
                        = (or 1/4 tspn red pepper flakes, use
                        more for spicier sauce)
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped cilantro leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped tarragon leaves - (to 2) -- if available
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === LAMB ===
  12                    garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/3           cup  dried mint -- crumbled
  1 1/2    tablespoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  coarse salt
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- or more as needed
  1                     shank-end leg of lamb - (abt 6 lbs)

Make The Tart Plum Sauce:  Place the plums and water in a medium non-reactive pan and bring to a boil.  Cover and simmer the plums over low heat until soft, 15 to 20 minutes.  The plums and their cooking liquid should be very tart; however, if you would like the sauce a little sweeter, add sugar to taste.  Cool the plums for 30 minutes.

In a blender or a food processor, process the plums with their cooking liquid to a coarse puree.  Add the rest of the ingredients and process just to combine.  Transfer to a bowl and let stand for at least 2 hours before serving.  (The sauce will keep in the refrigerator for several days.)

Make The Lamb:  Crush 6 garlic cloves through a press.  In a small bowl, combine the mint, garlic, pepper, and salt with enough oil to make a medium-coarse paste.

Sliver the 6 remaining garlic cloves.  With a tip of a small knife, make 1/2-inch-deep slits in the lamb.  Insert the garlic slivers into the lamb, coating them first with a little of the mint mixture.  Rub the remaining mint paste evenly over the lamb.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Place the lamb on a rack set over a roasting pan and roast for 25 minutes.  Turn the lamb over and continue roasting until the meat thermometer inserted in the fleshiest part registers 130 degrees for medium-rare meat, 30 to 35 minutes longer.  Turn the lamb once more during roasting.  Remove the lamb to a carving board, cover loosely with foil, and let stand for 10 minutes.

Carve the lamb into thin slices and serve with the plum sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  If you like, scatter some parboiled halved small red potatoes in the pan, tossing them with a bit of olive oil and some of the mint-crust mixture.  My favorite sauce for roast lamb (as well as for grills) is this tart, lavishly spiced condiment from the Republic of Georgia.  Its name, tkemali, comes from the deliciously sour Caucasian plum, which is unavailable in this country.  The best substitutes are under-ripe fresh prunes (Italian plums), but you can also use unripe black or red plums.  Georgians also improvise with rhubarb or unripe blackberries.

                  Moghlai Lamb With Spinach Paalag Gosht

Recipe By     :Madjur Jaffrey
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  boneless lamb shoulder -- cut into 1" cubes
  4          teaspoons  finely-grated peeled fresh ginger
  7                     garlic cloves -- crushed to a pulp
  2        tablespoons  ground coriander
  5        tablespoons  corn or peanut oil
  1                cup  onion -- sliced into
                        fine half-rings
     1/2      teaspoon  ground turmeric
     3/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper - (to 1 1/2)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  plain yogurt
  1              pound  fresh spinach -- washed, and
                        cut into fine ribbons (see comments)

Put the meat in a bowl, add the ginger, garlic, and coriander, mix well, and set aside for 30 minutes.

Pour the oil into a wide, nonstick, lidded pan and set over medium heat.  When hot, stir in the onions, and fry them, turning the heat down as needed, until they are golden red and crisp.  Remove the onions with a slotted spoon and spread them out on a paper towel, leaving as much of the oil behind as possible.

Reduce the heat to medium, and put in all the meat, together with its marinade.  Add the turmeric, cayenne pepper, and salt, and stir for 1 minute.  Cover and cook for 10 minutes, removing the lid occasionally to stir the contents.

Remove the lid and add 1 tablespoon of the yogurt.  Cook, stirring, until the yogurt is absorbed.  Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of the yogurt in this way, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Then stir in the spinach.

Chop the fried onions and add these as well.  Continue to stir until the spinach has wilted.  Then cover the pan and cook over very low heat for 50 minutes, or until the meat is tender, lifting the lid to stir now and then.  If the liquid seems to have dried up completely, add a few tablespoons of water at a time and cover again.  The spinach should cling to the meat.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is the classic Moghul recipe for lamb with spinach.  The only new ingredient that has been added over the centuries is probably cayenne pepper.  The dish is also known as saag gosht.  "Saag" could mean any green, whereas "paalag" is very specifically spinach.  The spinach needs to be cut fairly small.  To do this, hold a handful at a time in a tight wad and slice, crosswise, into thin strips.  Serve with Indian breads (or rice), and a yogurt dish.

Pour the oil into a wide, nonstick, lidded pan and set over medium heat.  When hot, stir in the onions, and fry them, turning the heat down as needed, until they are golden red and crisp.  Remove the onions with a slotted spoon and spread them out on a paper towel, leaving as much of the oil behind as possible.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reduce the heat to medium, and put in all the meat, together with its marinade.  Add the turmeric, cayenne pepper, and salt, and stir for 1 minute.  Cover and cook for 10 minutes, removing the lid occasionally to stir the contents.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the lid and add 1 tablespoon of the yogurt.  Cook, stirring, until the yogurt is absorbed.  Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of the yogurt in this way, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Then stir in the spinach.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Chop the fried onions and add these as well.  Continue to stir until the spinach has wilted.  Then cover the pan and cook over very low heat for 50 minutes, or until the meat is tender, lifting the lid to stir now and then.  If the liquid seems to have dried up completely, add a few tablespoons of water at a time and cover again.  The spinach should cling to the meat.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is the classic Moghul recipe for lamb with spinach.  The only new ingredient that has been added over the centuries is probably cayenne pepper.  The dish is also known as saag gosht.  &quot;Saag&quot; could mean any green, whereas &quot;paalag&quot; is very specifically spinach.  The spinach needs to be cut fairly small.  To do this, hold a handful at a time in a tight wad and slice, crosswise, into thin strips.  Serve with Indian breads (or rice), and a yogurt dish.

              Monkfish "Osso Buco" With Pancetta And Carrots

Recipe By     :Michael Lomonaco
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Fish (Ocean)
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     monkfish 1 1/2"-thk tails on the bone - -- (8 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  oil
     1/2         pound  pancetta -- minced
  2             medium  onions -- cut small dice
  1             medium  carrot -- cut small dice
     1/2                fennel bulb -- cut small dice,
                        fronds reserved
  2                     garlic cloves
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  chopped plum tomatoes
  1                cup  flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  grated orange zest

Coat the monkfish with flour and season with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

Heat the oil in a 2-inch-high, heavy-bottomed sautÈ pan with a cover over medium-high heat.  Set the monkfish tails in the pan without crowding and sear on one side until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Turn them over, add the pancetta to the pan, and sear the tails on the other side for 2 minutes.  Use a spatula to remove the fish and pancetta to a plate and cover with foil to keep them warm.

Add the onions, carrots, fennel, and garlic to the pan and sautÈ over high heat, stirring, to begin caramelizing the vegetables, 5 to 8 minutes.  Spread the vegetables over the surface of the pan and set the fish and pancetta over them.  Pour the wine and tomatoes into the pan, raise the heat, and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat so the liquid is simmering, cover the pan, and simmer for 12 minutes.

Meanwhile, put the parsley and orange zest in a food processor fitted with the steel blade.  Pulse until finely chopped.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and set aside.

Transfer 1 monkfish tail to the center of each of 4 dinner plates.  Top with some of the vegetables and sauce and finish with the orange-parsley mixture and some fennel fronds.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  There are few more surefire ways of pleasing a crowd than with a playful variation on a classic dish.  This is a seafood variation of osso buco (the name means "hole In the bone"), an Italian classic, in which a veal shank is braised for hours.  The orange zestñparsley mixture that tops each serving is a play on gremolata, the chopped parsley, garlic, and lemon zest that tops a traditional osso buco.  Monkfish has an unusual shape, to say the least.  Its tail is enormous and seems to flow right into the head.  Monkfish are always sold sans heads which are used for bait.  Consequently, monkfish are sold by the "tail."  For this recipe, ask your fishmonger for smaller tails with the skin removed but have the fish cut like a steak, directly through the bone, leaving a center bone with two "fillets" of fish on either side.  A 3- to 4-inch piece with two fillets on each side of the bone is a good size.

This dish is so special with monkfish that I hesitate to offer any alternatives.  But you can make it with mahi mahi steaks, yellowtail steaks, or salmon fillets.

              My Favorite Brisket (Not Too Gedempte Fleysch)

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Entree
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5             pounds  brisket of beef, shoulder roast of beef,
                        chuck roast, or end of steak
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3                     onions -- peeled, diced
  1                can  tomatoes - (10 oz)
  2               cups  red wine
  2                     celery stalks with the leaves -- chopped
  1                     bay leaf
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
  6                     carrots - (to 8) -- peeled, and
                        sliced on the diagonal

Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the brisket and rub with the garlic.  Sear the brisket in the oil and then place, fat-side up, on top of the onions in a large casserole.  Cover with the tomatoes, red wine, celery, bay leaf, thyme, and rosemary.

Cover and bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for about 3 hours, basting often with pan juices.

Add the parsley and carrots and bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes more or until the carrots are cooked.  To test for doneness, stick a fork in the flat (thinner or leaner end of the brisket).  When there is a light pull on the fork as it is removed from the meat, it is "fork tender."

This dish is best prepared in advance and refrigerated so that the fat can be easily skimmed from the surface of the gravy.  Trim off all the visible fat from the cold brisket.  Then place the brisket, on what was the fat side down, on a cutting board.  Look for the grain - that is, the muscle lines of the brisket - and with a sharp knife, cut across the grain.

When ready to serve, reheat the gravy.

Put the sliced brisket in a roasting pan.  Pour the hot gravy on the meat, cover, and reheat in a preheated 350 degree oven for 45 minutes.  Some people like to strain the gravy, but I prefer to keep the onions because they are so delicious.  Serve with farfel (boiled egg barley noodles), noodle kugel, or potato pancakes.  A colorful winter salad goes well with this.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Gedempte Fleysch ó well-stewed ó that's how Eastern European Jews prefer their meat.  Slow cooking, of course, became a practical necessity with grainy cuts of forequarter meat.

Because a brisket stretched into many meals, it was an economical cut for large families in Europe.  Leftovers were ground up to stuff knishes or kreplach.  The meaty gravy became the base for a midweek cabbage or potato soup or a sauce to cover pompushki, Ukrainian baked dumplings, which resemble Pepperidge Farms rolls.  In this country it became particularly popular.

Brisket comes from the front quarters of the steer, the chest area.  The whole piece of meat, from three to ten pounds, is potted (hence the term pot roast) and cooked slowly by braising in liquid.  It should be covered and simmered in a 325 degree oven for several hours.  Brisket needs to be simmered slowly to transform it into the succulent morsels I remember as a child.  It is a dish I serve frequently on Friday night, at holidays, and at dinner parties.

Tip:  Try adding a jar of sun-dried tomatoes to the canned tomatoes.  They add a more intense flavor to the brisket.

        My Mother's Chicken And Potatoes (With My Special Touches)

Recipe By     :Lidia Matticchio Bastianich
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Entree
                Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  bone-in chicken legs
                        = (or assorted pieces)
     1/2           cup  canola oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or more to taste
  1              pound  red bliss potatoes
                        = (preferably no bigger than 2" across)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- or more
  2                     medium-small onions -- peeled, and
                        quartered lengthwise
  2                     short branches fresh rosemary with plenty 
                        needles
                        FOR MY SPECIAL TOUCHESóTRY EITHER OR BOTH
  4             ounces  sliced bacon - (to 6) -- 5 or 6 slices
  1                     pickled sweet or hot cherry pepper -- halved, seeded
                        = (or two - or none ó or more!)

Rinse the chicken pieces and pat dry with paper towels.  Trim off excess skin and all visible fat.  Cut the drumsticks from the thighs.  If using breast halves, cut into two small pieces.

Make the bacon roll-ups:  Cut the bacon slices in half crosswise and roll each strip into a neat, tight cylinder.  Stick a toothpick through the roll to secure it; cut or break the toothpick so only a tiny bit sticks out (allowing the bacon to roll around and cook evenly).

Pour the canola oil into the skillet and set over high heat.  Sprinkle the chicken with 1/4 teaspoon salt on all sides.  When the oil is very hot, lay the pieces in it, skin-side down, an inch or so apart ó watch out for oil spatters.  Don't crowd the chicken: if necessary, fry it in batches, with similar pieces (like drumsticks) together.

Drop the bacon rolls into the oil around the chicken, turning and shifting them often.  Let the chicken pieces fry in place for several minutes to brown on the underside, then turn and continue frying until they're golden brown on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes or more.  Fry breast pieces only for 5 minutes or so, taking them out of the oil as soon as they are golden.  Let the bacon rolls cook and get lightly crisp, but not dark.  Adjust the heat to maintain steady sizzling and coloring; remove the crisped chicken pieces with tongs to a bowl.

Meanwhile, rinse and dry the potatoes; slice each one through the middle on the axis that gives the largest cut surface, then toss them with the olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  When all the chicken and bacon is cooked and out of the skillet, pour off the frying oil.  Return the skillet to medium heat and put in all the potatoes, cut-side down in a single layer, into the hot pan.  With a spatula, scrape all the olive oil out of the mixing bowl into the skillet; drizzle in a bit more oil if the pan seems dry.  Fry and crisp the potatoes for about 4 minutes to form a crust, then move them around the pan, still cut-side down, until they're all brown and crisp, 7 minutes or more.  Turn them over, and fry another 2 minutes to cook and crisp on their rounded skin sides.

Still over medium heat, toss the onion wedges and rosemary branches around the pan, in with the potatoes.  If using cherry peppers (either hot or sweet), cut the seeded halves into 1/2-inch-wide pieces and scatter them in the pan too.

Return the chicken pieces, except breast pieces, to the pan, along with the bacon rolls; pour in any chicken juices that have accumulated.  Raise the heat slightly, and carefully turn and tumble the chicken, potatoes, and onion (and bacon and/or pepper pieces), so they're heating and getting coated with pan juices ó but take care not to break the potato pieces.  Spread everything out in the pan ó potatoes on the bottom as much as possible, to keep crisping up ó and cover.

Return the heat to medium, and cook for about 7 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, then uncover, and tumble the pieces and potatoes (and bacon rolls) again.  Cover, and cook another 7 minutes or so, adding the breast pieces at this point.  Give everything another tumble.  Now cook covered for 10 minutes more.

Remove the cover, turn the pieces again, and cook in the open skillet for about 10 minutes, to evaporate the moisture and caramelize everything.  Taste a bit of potato (or chicken) for salt, and sprinkle on more as needed.  Turn the pieces now and then; when they are all glistening and golden, and the potatoes are cooked through, remove the skillet from the stove and ó as I do at home ó bring it right to the table.  Serve portions of chicken and potatoes, or let people help themselves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In my family, favorite dishes are always being altered according to what is available and what is best ó especially when I'm cooking.  Here's a perfect example: chicken and potatoes, fried together in a big skillet so they're crisp and moist at the same time, is my mother's specialty.  Growing up, my brother and I demanded it every week; our kids, Tanya and Joe and Eric, Paul and Estelle, clamored for it too.  And now the next generation of little ones are asking their great-grandmother to make chicken and potatoes for them.

When I am at the stove ó and though I follow my mother's basic procedures ó I can't resist playing around.  Some days I add sausage to Grandma's recipe, or capers or olives; I might douse the chicken with a splash of vinegar; sometimes I cut up a whole chicken, other times I'll split little poussins or Cornish hens.  If I'm in a hurry, I quickly cook small pieces of chicken breast with the potatoes.  (You can see what experiments have worked well if you look through my previous books.)

This recipe gives you Erminia's classic formula ó chicken, small potatoes, a bit of onion, and fresh rosemary ó with two of my latest twists: pickled cherry peppers and bacon strips, in bite-sized rolls.  Cherry peppers are plump golf-ball-sized antipasto peppers in vinegar that you'll find in jars on the pickle shelves of the supermarket.  They come in sweet and hot varieties ó and the latter are explosive, if you take just a bite.  But when they're seeded, sliced, and added sparingly to the chicken, they imbue the dish with a mellow heat that I love.  If you and your family are hot heads, cut up two or more peppers; otherwise slice only one, or use the sweet cherry peppers and see how you like that.

My latest spin on our chicken-and-potato tradition is one everybody loves, especially the kids: we roll bacon slices into little bundles, pin each one closed with a toothpick, and caramelize them along with the chicken.  The bacon fat slowly renders and lends the meat a layer of flavor that's picked up by the potatoes and onions too.  By the end of cooking, the rolls have turned into crisp morsels that are a treat to eat with the juicy chicken and tender potatoes.  (But be sure to remove all the toothpicks!)

Rinse the chicken pieces and pat dry with paper towels.  Trim off excess skin and all visible fat.  Cut the drumsticks from the thighs.  If using breast halves, cut into two small pieces.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the bacon roll-ups:  Cut the bacon slices in half crosswise and roll each strip into a neat, tight cylinder.  Stick a toothpick through the roll to secure it; cut or break the toothpick so only a tiny bit sticks out (allowing the bacon to roll around and cook evenly).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the canola oil into the skillet and set over high heat.  Sprinkle the chicken with 1/4 teaspoon salt on all sides.  When the oil is very hot, lay the pieces in it, skin-side down, an inch or so apart ó watch out for oil spatters.  Don&apos;t crowd the chicken: if necessary, fry it in batches, with similar pieces (like drumsticks) together.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drop the bacon rolls into the oil around the chicken, turning and shifting them often.  Let the chicken pieces fry in place for several minutes to brown on the underside, then turn and continue frying until they&apos;re golden brown on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes or more.  Fry breast pieces only for 5 minutes or so, taking them out of the oil as soon as they are golden.  Let the bacon rolls cook and get lightly crisp, but not dark.  Adjust the heat to maintain steady sizzling and coloring; remove the crisped chicken pieces with tongs to a bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, rinse and dry the potatoes; slice each one through the middle on the axis that gives the largest cut surface, then toss them with the olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  When all the chicken and bacon is cooked and out of the skillet, pour off the frying oil.  Return the skillet to medium heat and put in all the potatoes, cut-side down in a single layer, into the hot pan.  With a spatula, scrape all the olive oil out of the mixing bowl into the skillet; drizzle in a bit more oil if the pan seems dry.  Fry and crisp the potatoes for about 4 minutes to form a crust, then move them around the pan, still cut-side down, until they&apos;re all brown and crisp, 7 minutes or more.  Turn them over, and fry another 2 minutes to cook and crisp on their rounded skin sides.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Still over medium heat, toss the onion wedges and rosemary branches around the pan, in with the potatoes.  If using cherry peppers (either hot or sweet), cut the seeded halves into 1/2-inch-wide pieces and scatter them in the pan too.

     1/2         pound  okra
  1                cup  distilled white vinegar
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter

Okra is often used in stews (such as gumbo in New Orleans and lamb stews in Africa), because the viscous juice it exudes helps thicken sauces.  Remove and discard the stem ends of the okra, and slice it lengthwise into halves and then quarters.  To eliminate some of the vegetable's sliminess, mix it with the vinegar in a plastic bag.  Leave for 30 minutes.  Drain in a colander, and rinse well under cold tap water.

Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil, drop in the okra, and return to the boil.  Strain in a colander, and refresh under cold water.  At serving time, heat the butter in a skillet, mix in the okra, and sautÈ gently until heated through.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SEAFOOD SEASONING ===
  2        tablespoons  ground coriander
  1         tablespoon  Old Bay seasoning
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === IBERIAN STEW ===
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  4             ounces  Spanish-style chorizo sausage -- bias cut 1/4" slices
                        = (preferably Goya or Quixote brand)
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  diced onion
     1/2           cup  finely-diced peeled carrot
     1/8      teaspoon  dried oregano
  1                cup  shredded cabbage
  1                     large can chickpeas - (19 oz) -- drained, rinsed
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  minced fresh cilantro (leaves and stems)
                        === HALIBUT ===
  4                     halibut fillets - (abt 6 oz ea)
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  julienned scallions -- green and white part
     1/4           cup  fresh cilantro leaves

To prepare the seasoning, combine the coriander, Old Bay seasoning, salt, and pepper in a bowl and set aside (if not using immediately, transfer to an airtight container and store in a cool, dry space).

To prepare the stew, pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into a sautÈ pan and set over medium-high heat.  Add the chorizo and sautÈ for 2 to 3 minutes, until it begins to brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a mixing bowl.  Using a fine-mesh strainer, strain and reserve the colored and well-flavored oil for finishing the dish.

Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a saucepan and set over medium heat.  Add the garlic and sautÈ for about 1 minute, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until golden brown; the garlic should be caramelized but not burned.  Add the onion, carrot, and oregano, and continue to cook for about 3 minutes, until the onion is translucent.  Turn down the heat to low and add the cabbage.  Cook for 3 minutes longer, stirring occasionally.

Add the chickpeas and chicken broth, and season with salt and pepper.  Bring to a simmer and continue to cook over low heat, uncovered, for 10 to 15 minutes, so that some of the broth evaporates and the flavors come together.  Add the cooked chorizo and the cilantro and keep warm.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the halibut fillets on a large plate and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, brushing the oil to completely cover the fish.  Evenly coat each fillet with about 1 tablespoon of the reserved seafood seasoning.  Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil into an oven-proof sautÈ pan or skillet and set over medium-high heat.  Carefully place the fillets in the pan and sautÈ for 2 to 3 minutes, letting the fillets brown and form a crust on the first side.  Turn the fillets over with a spatula and transfer the pan to the oven.  Roast for about 10 minutes, until the fillets are firm and flake easily when gently pierced with a fork.  Meanwhile, gently warm the reserved chorizo oil in a small saucepan or skillet.

To serve, spoon equal amounts of the stew into the middle of warm pasta bowls or serving plates.  Arrange a halibut fillet on top and garnish with the scallions and cilantro.  Drizzle 1 teaspoon of the flavored chorizo oil around each fillet.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Pairing fish and meat for main courses has become a popular restaurant trend over the least few years, and not just in the traditional surf-and-turf sense.  In cooking the two in the same pan, chefs use this technique to give fish a more robust, meaty flavor, and although it may sound strange if you've not tried it, the results can be spectacular.  The pan stew in this recipe is based on a Spanish dish; chorizo, the Spanish hard sausage, and chickpeas (garbanzo beans) are often paired in the cuisine of that country.  They make a great accompaniment for the halibut, which is a fish that stands up well to other flavors.  The next time you get your hands on some very fresh halibut, remember this dish.

Chef's Note:  Spanish chorizo is available at good grocery stores or specialty food markets.  The beautiful red coloring it gives to the oil in which it is cooked comes from its large quantity of paprika.  This stew also makes a great appetizer or an accompaniment for grilled shrimp.  You can substitute sea bass or grouper for the halibut.

To prepare the stew, pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into a sautÈ pan and set over medium-high heat.  Add the chorizo and sautÈ for 2 to 3 minutes, until it begins to brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a mixing bowl.  Using a fine-mesh strainer, strain and reserve the colored and well-flavored oil for finishing the dish.

Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a saucepan and set over medium heat.  Add the garlic and sautÈ for about 1 minute, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until golden brown; the garlic should be caramelized but not burned.

                Pan-Roasted Halibut With Caper Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Sondra Bernstein
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Fish (Ocean)
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BLENDED OIL ===
  1                     part olive oil
                        = (such as Critelli)
  3                     parts canola oil
                        === CAPER VINAIGRETTE ===
  2                     egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  Champagne vinegar
     1/2           cup  blended oil
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained
  1         tablespoon  whole-grain mustard
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh tarragon
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === HALIBUT ===
  6                     halibut fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil

Make The Blended Oil:  Simply blend.

Make The Caper Vinaigrette:  In a food processor or in a blender, combine the egg yolks, lemon juice, garlic, and vinegar.  Slowly whisk in the oil.  Remove the mixture from the blender to a bowl and fold in the capers, mustard, and herbs.  Season with salt and pepper.

Make The Halibut:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Gently season the halibut on both sides with salt and white pepper.  Heat the oil in an ovenproof sautÈ pan and sear the halibut on one side until lightly brown.  Flip the fish over and sear the other side.  Flip over again and place the pan in the oven to cook for 6 to 8 minutes.

Drizzle with the Caper Vinaigrette.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  For this dish, we like our halibut to have a very crispy skin, which we achieve only by using an extremely hot pan that burns the seasonings into the skin and locks in the juices.  When you achieve this crispiness, the texture is exquisite.

We use blended oil for just about every recipe.  Even plain olive oil, which we use here, can be very strong and in many recipes will overpower the dish, so we dilute the flavor with canola oil.  This blend will be subtle and not overwhelm the other flavors in the dish.

                Pappardelle With Amazing Slow-Cooked Meat

Recipe By     :Jamie Oliver
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              piece  braising meat - (1 lb, 12 oz) -- seasoned
                        = (see comments)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     handful fresh rosemary -- leaves picked,
                        and finely chopped
  1                     handful fresh thyme -- leaves picked,
                        and finely chopped
  1              small  red onion -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  1                     carrot -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  1                     celery stick -- finely chopped
  2                     wine-glasses Chianti
  2               cans  plum tomatoes - (14 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  pearl barley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  14            ounces  fresh or dried pappardelle
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     handfuls grated Parmesan cheese

In a hot casserole-type pan, fry your meat in a little olive oil ó it doesn't matter if it's cut into large 2-inch chunks if it's venison, beef, or wild boar, or left whole if it's a squab (pigeon), or cut into 5 or 6 pieces if you're using a rabbit.  Fry the meat until golden brown then add your herbs, onions, garlic, carrot and celery.  Turn the heat down and continue to fry for 5 minutes, until the vegetables have softened.

Add your red wine and continue to simmer until the liquid has almost cooked away but left you with a fantastic color and fragrance.

Add the plum tomatoes, the pearl barley, and just enough water to cover the meat by 1/2-inch.  Make yourself a cartouche of parchment or wax paper (see note).  Wet it under the tap, rub it with a little olive oil and place it over the pan.  Put a lid on the pan as well, as this will retain as much moisture as possible while cooking.  Cook over really low heat for about 2 to 3 hours, depending on the tenderness and type of meat.  It's ready when you can literally push the meat off the bone and it flakes away in tender strands.

At this point season carefully with salt and pepper to taste and allow to cool slightly before removing the meat from the pan.  Using 2 forks pull apart all the lovely pieces of meat, throwing away any skin and bones.  Put the meat back in the pan over low heat.

It's now ready to serve, so cook your pappardelle in a pan of boiling, salted water for 3 minutes, if using fresh pasta, or according to the package instructions if using dried.  Once it's cooked, drain it in a colander, saving some of the cooking liquid in case the sauce needs a little loosening.  Remove the stewed meat from the heat and stir in the butter and Parmesan with a little of the cooking water ó this will make it juicy and shiny.  Toss together with your pasta and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  For this recipe you can use beef, venison, wild boar, and even squab or rabbit.  In Italy, if a family had to feed eight people out of this, then they would cook more pasta and add a little more water ó as always, a little meat can go a long way.

Try This:  Serve sprinkled with a little finely chopped fresh rosemary and some grated Parmesan.

Note:  Cartouche is a French term which basically means "scroll" or "packet."  It's a paper lid that is used to slow down the reduction of moisture in cooking.  A lid only lets a little moisture escape, whereas using no lid lets lots of moisture escape.  Using a cartouche is a halfway house between the two and also stops things from coloring too much.  Take a square piece of parchment or wax paper slightly larger than your pan.  Fold the square in half, and in half again.  Keep folding the same way so that the tip becomes the center.  When it's pretty pointy you're ready to measure up.  Hold the tip of the cartouche to the center of the pan, tear or cut off any paper that extends beyond the edge of the pan.  Open out to a circle ó the cartouche is ready.  You can get away with the cartouche being a bit larger than the pan so don't worry if you make it too big.

Add your red wine and continue to simmer until the liquid has almost cooked away but left you with a fantastic color and fragrance.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the plum tomatoes, the pearl barley, and just enough water to cover the meat by 1/2-inch.  Make yourself a cartouche of parchment or wax paper (see note).  Wet it under the tap, rub it with a little olive oil and place it over the pan.  Put a lid on the pan as well, as this will retain as much moisture as possible while cooking.  Cook over really low heat for about 2 to 3 hours, depending on the tenderness and type of meat.  It&apos;s ready when you can literally push the meat off the bone and it flakes away in tender strands.
</DirT>
<DirT>
At this point season carefully with salt and pepper to taste and allow to cool slightly before removing the meat from the pan.  Using 2 forks pull apart all the lovely pieces of meat, throwing away any skin and bones.  Put the meat back in the pan over low heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
It&apos;s now ready to serve, so cook your pappardelle in a pan of boiling, salted water for 3 minutes, if using fresh pasta, or according to the package instructions if using dried.  Once it&apos;s cooked, drain it in a colander, saving some of the cooking liquid in case the sauce needs a little loosening.  Remove the stewed meat from the heat and stir in the butter and Parmesan with a little of the cooking water ó this will make it juicy and shiny.  Toss together with your pasta and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  For this recipe you can use beef, venison, wild boar, and even squab or rabbit.  In Italy, if a family had to feed eight people out of this, then they would cook more pasta and add a little more water ó as always, a little meat can go a long way.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Try This:  Serve sprinkled with a little finely chopped fresh rosemary and some grated Parmesan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Cartouche is a French term which basically means &quot;scroll&quot; or &quot;packet.&quot;  It&apos;s a paper lid that is used to slow down the reduction of moisture in cooking.  A lid only lets a little moisture escape, whereas using no lid lets lots of moisture escape.  Using a cartouche is a halfway house between the two and also stops things from coloring too much.  Take a square piece of parchment or wax paper slightly larger than your pan.  Fold the square in half, and in half again.  Keep folding the same way so that the tip becomes the center.  When it&apos;s pretty pointy you&apos;re ready to measure up.  Hold the tip of the cartouche to the center of the pan, tear or cut off any paper that extends beyond the edge of the pan.  Open out to a circle ó the cartouche is ready.  You can get away with the cartouche being a bit larger than the pan so don&apos;t worry if you make it too big.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTA DOUGH (full recipe) ===
  2               cups  type 00 semolina flour
  8                     egg yolks -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  water
                        === FILLING ===
  1                     pie pumpkin - (abt 2 lbs)
                        = (abt 2 cups puree after roasting)
     1/3           cup  coarsely-chopped mostarda -- (see Notes)
  1 1/4           cups  dried bread crumbs
  1 1/4           cups  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or
                        Parmesan cheese
  1                cup  amaretti cookies -- finely ground
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2        recipe  Basic Pasta Dough -- (above)
  2               cups  unsalted butter
  16                    fresh sage leaves
                        Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or
                        Parmesan cheese -- for serving

Make The Pasta:  Mound the flour on a pastry board or other wood or plastic work surface.  Make a well in the center and add the salt and egg yolks.  Using a fork, gradually fold the flour into the eggs, adding the water little by little until you have a soft dough.  Knead a few times until smooth, then form the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 1 hour.

To roll and cut pasta, cut the dough into 6 pieces.  Working with one piece at a time (cover the remaining dough with a moist cloth until ready to use), dust the dough with flour and place between the rollers of a manual or motorized pasta machine at the widest setting.  Pass the dough through.  Fold the dough in half, sprinkle with flour, and roll again.  Dust again with flour if the dough becomes sticky.  Continue this process, reducing the space between the rollers one setting at a time, until the dough is a thin, smooth sheet.  Generally, you can roll the dough 6 times on the first setting before tightening the rollers; then reduce the times you roll by one with each new setting until you reach the last setting (No. 6), when rolling once will be enough.

The finished pasta sheets should be about 6 inches wide and 12 inches long.  Let the pasta sheets dry on a lightly floured board or parchment paper for 5 minutes before cutting.

(The basic pasta dough can be refrigerated, wrapped in plastic, for up to 2 days.)

Make The Filling:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut the pumpkin in half and remove the seeds.  Arrange, cut-sides down, on an aluminum foil-lined or nonstick baking sheet and roast until very tender, 20 to 30 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh and place in a blender or food processor.  Add the mostarda and process to a puree.

Transfer to a bowl and add the bread crumbs, cheese, cookie crumbs, and nutmeg.  Stir to combine.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside.

Assemble The Hats:  Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets.  Working with one sheet at a time, cut the pasta into 3-inch squares.  Place each square on a lightly floured board or cloth and let dry for 5 minutes.

To fill, place a dough square in front of you on the diagonal, so you are facing a diamond shape.  Place a teaspoon of filling in the middle of the diamond.  Lightly spray the pasta with water and bring the bottom point of the diamond to the top point.  Press the pasta together to form a triangle, working out from the filling.

Trim the 2 unfolded sides of the pasta triangle with a crimped pastry wheel, and then fold the side points of the pasta forward and press to join them together in a "bishop's hat" shape.  Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.  Stand the finished cappellacci to dry for about 5 minutes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and dusted with flour.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

Meanwhile, in a large sautÈ pan, melt the butter over medium heat; do not let the butter brown.  Stir in the sage leaves.  Set aside and keep warm over very low heat.

Add the cappellacci to the boiling water and cook until al dente (tender but firm to the bite), 3 to 5 minutes after they rise to the top.  Remove with a slotted spoon and carefully transfer to the warm butter and sage sauce.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the pasta to marry with the sauce and absorb some of it.

To serve, divide the cappellacci among 8 warmed plates and top with Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This dish may well become a family favorite, especially during the fall, when pumpkins are in season.  The filling has a sweet-and-savory flavor that pairs well with turkey, goose, or duck.  Whenever we serve this dish to customers and friends who have never tried it, the raves are loud and clear.  This stuffed pasta yields hearty portions, and we suggest serving with a robust red wine.

Notes:  Mostarda is candied fruit, such as pears, apricots, and cherries, mixed with white mustard and sugar syrup.  More sweet than piquant, mostarda adds dimension to the pumpkin filling.  It is also used with boiled meats and in confections.  You can find mostarda in Italian specialty stores or on-line.

The cappellacci can be assembled in advance and frozen.  Arrange them, not touching, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and dusted with flour.  Freeze until hard, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to zippered plastic bags and freeze for up to 1 month.

          Plank-Roasted Salmon With Rosemary-Mustard Vinaigrette

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  whole-grain mustard
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped rosemary leaves
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        === SALMON ===
  1                     cedar board large enough to hold 6 salmon
                        fillets (see comments)
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  6                     skinless salmon fillets - (6 to 7 oz ea)
  6                     rosemary sprigs
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Make The Vinaigrette:  In a medium bowl mix together the Worcestershire, vinegar, soy sauce, mustard sugar, rosemary, salt, and pepper.  Gradually whisk in the olive oil.  The vinaigrette will keep covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

Prepare The Salmon:  Brush one side of the board with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and let it sit overnight.

Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Place a large rimmed baking sheet underneath the center rack to catch the salmon drippings.

Lay the salmon fillets skinned-side down on the plank.  Tuck a sprig of rosemary under each fillet.  Lightly brush the salmon with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Place the board in the oven for 10 minutes.  To make sure the fish is cooked properly, lightly squeeze the fillet with your finger; it should feel firm and just start to give way.  Carefully remove the board from the oven.  With a metal spatula, transfer the salmon fillets to warm plates.

Whisk the vinaigrette briefly to recombine and spoon some of it over each fillet.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Plank-roasting is an ancient method of cooking among the Indians of the Pacific Northwest.  For important feasts known as potlatches, whole salmon fillets were suspended on cedar planks and placed around a fire to cook.

Plank-roasting in your home oven is simple and infuses the salmon with a complex woody flavor, similar to the way oak barrels add flavor to wine.  At your local lumberyard or home center, select a piece of 1- by 8-inch or 1- by 6-inch cedar just long enough to fit inside your oven.  (The salmon fillets will be laid out in a row on this board.)  About 20 inches long should work, but measure your oven to be sure.  Pine or fir can be substituted, with a little less aromatic flavor; it's better to spend a few dollars more for the real thing.  Make sure that the wood has not been primed or treated with any chemicals.

At Arrows we often use fresh herbs or dry seasonings to add another level of flavor to the plank-roasted fish.  Rosemary, with its robust character, is a perfect match for salmon.

              Portuguese-Style Pork Roast With Steamed Clams

Categories    : Entree                          Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     plum tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Sugar -- to taste
  4 1/2         pounds  bone-in pork loin - (abt 4 or 5 chops)
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        cut into thin slivers, plus
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled, halved
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1              large  Spanish onion -- peeled, halved,
                        and thinly sliced
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  fresh marjoram leaves
                        = (or oregano leaves)
  1              pinch  crushed red pepper
  1 1/4           cups  bottled clam juice
  1 1/2         pounds  small clams - (abt 24 clams) -- rinsed, scrubbed
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves

About 30 minutes before you want to cook, put the tomatoes in a bowl and season them with salt, pepper, and sugar.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Using a sharp, thin-bladed knife, make small 1/2-inch-deep slits all over the pork loin.  Slide a garlic sliver into each slit using the edge of the knife.  Season the pork all over with salt and pepper.

Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed ovenproof pot over medium-high heat.  Add the pork and brown on all sides, about 4 minutes per side.  Remove the pork from the pot and set aside.

Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the pot.  Add the onion and halved garlic cloves and cook slowly, stirring often, until caramelized, 12 to 15 minutes.  Add the wine, bring to a boil over high heat, and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the reserved tomatoes, thyme, marjoram, and crushed red pepper.  Stir in the clam juice and cook over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes.

Spread the vegetables evenly over the bottom of the pot and rest the pork loin on top of the vegetables.  Transfer it to the oven and roast, basting every 10 to 15 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the loin reads between 145 and 150 degrees, about 45 minutes, for medium; or 160 degrees for more well done.  Transfer the pork to a cutting board, cover with aluminum foil, and set aside.

Put the pot over medium heat.  Add the clams, cover, and cook until the clams pop open, 5 to 6 minutes.

While the clams are cooking, carve the loin into individual chops and arrange decoratively on a platter.  When the clams are done, arrange them over and around the chops.

To serve, spoon some sauce around the platter and scatter the chopped parsley over the pork and vegetables.  Serve family style from the center of the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  One of my all-time favorite combinations of pork and shellfish is the Portuguese pairing of pork and clams, which are united in a number of that country's favorite dishes, including several stews featuring crumbled sausage or marinated pork cubes (e.g., cataplana, stoccafisso, alentejana).  This recipe borrows inspiration from those classics, adapting them to my personal affection for roasted pork loin on the bone and cooking the clams in its tangy, slightly spicy sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PORK ROAST ===
     1/4           cup  sea salt or kosher salt -- dissolved in
  1                cup  hot water
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  cracked black peppercorns
  2                     bay leaves -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1                     boneless pork loin - (4 lbs) -- with a thin layer
                        of fat left intact, preferably center cut
  6                     garlic cloves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange zest
                        Flour -- for dusting
  12                    green grapes -- preferably Muscat
                        Fall Fruit Compote -- (below)
  1         tablespoon  fruit-flavored vinegar
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        === FRUIT COMPOTE ===
  2               cups  mixed dried fruits
                        = (yellow raisins, figs, apricots, and
                        prunes)
  1                cup  shelled walnuts
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
  1                     star anise
  1                     cinnamon stick
     1/4      teaspoon  bruised peppercorns
  1                cup  sweet white wine
                        = (such as orange Muscat or sauternes)
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon

Make The Pork Roast:  In large glass or plastic container, combine the dissolved salt, sugar, peppercorns, bay leaves, thyme, and 3 cups cold water.  Add the pork, cover or seal, and let marinate in the brine for up to 2 days in the refrigerator.

About 4 hours before serving, drain the pork loin; discard the brine.  Wipe the meat to remove excess moisture.  Crush the garlic with a pinch each salt and pepper.  Mix with 1 tablespoon of the orange zest and 1 teaspoon water to make a paste.  Make deep slits all over the pork; press the garlic paste into the slits.  Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat the oil in a shallow enameled cast-iron roasting pan or gratin dish over medium-high heat.  Dust the pork with flour, shaking off excess.  When the oil starts to sizzle lightly, add the pork and cook, turning, until the roast is brown all over, about 5 minutes.  Remove to a plate.

Add 1/4 cup water and scrape up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Scatter the green grapes on the bottom.  Set the pork, fat-side up, on top.  Place in the oven to cook for 45 minutes.

Turn the pork over and continue to roast, uncovered, until the internal temperature registers 145 degrees, about 15 minutes.  Remove the pork, cover with foil, and let rest at room temperature for up to 2 hours.

Skim the fat from the liquid in the pan.  Set over medium-high heat, add the juices from the fruit compote, and boil until they start to thicken and shine, about 10 minutes.  Add the vinegar and season with additional salt and pepper to taste.  Pour all but 2 tablespoons sauce into a bowl.  Add the fruits from the compote to the pan and cook over medium-high heat until they lightly caramelize.  Return the pork to the pan, turn to coat with the syrupy juices, and cook over medium-low heat until completely reheated, about 15 minutes.  The internal temperature should be 150 to 155 degrees.

Lift the pork out of the pan, allowing excess sauce to drip back into the pan.  Thinly slice and arrange the pork over the fruits.  Dribble the sauce over the pork and scatter the remaining 1/2 teaspoon orange zest and the parsley on top.  Serve at once.

Make The Compote:  In a small bowl, mix the dried fruits, walnuts, orange zest, star anise, cinnamon stick, and peppercorns.  Add the wine and lemon juice, cover, and let soak for up to 2 days in a cool place or in the refrigerator.

Transfer the fruits in the soaking liquid to a non-reactive saucepan set over low heat and cook for 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and drain the fruits, reserving the liquid for use in step above.  Discard the whole spices.  Cut the fruits into 1/2-inch dice.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Greek food charms us by its simplicity, but there are exceptions.  Here's a rich-tasting yet modern northern Greek pork dish, hrino langada, filled with wonderful warm, sweet tones of caramelized yellow raisins, figs, and walnuts, served under a sauce highlighted with a last minute splash of glyko, a syrupy sweet vinegar.  You can substitute balsamic or sherry vinegar, or any of the new stylish vinegars, such as currant or fig.

Brining a boneless pork loin guarantees a juicy flavorful roast.  The meat is browned, oven-roasted at a medium-low temperature, then left to rest before a final glazing in the syrupy sauce.  Begin two to three days in advance by brining the pork and making the fruit compote.

Make The Pork Roast:  In large glass or plastic container, combine the dissolved salt, sugar, peppercorns, bay leaves, thyme, and 3 cups cold water.  Add the pork, cover or seal, and let marinate in the brine for up to 2 days in the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
About 4 hours before serving, drain the pork loin; discard the brine.  Wipe the meat to remove excess moisture.  Crush the garlic with a pinch each salt and pepper.  Mix with 1 tablespoon of the orange zest and 1 teaspoon water to make a paste.  Make deep slits all over the pork; press the garlic paste into the slits.  Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the oil in a shallow enameled cast-iron roasting pan or gratin dish over medium-high heat.  Dust the pork with flour, shaking off excess.  When the oil starts to sizzle lightly, add the pork and cook, turning, until the roast is brown all over, about 5 minutes.  Remove to a plate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add 1/4 cup water and scrape up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Scatter the green grapes on the bottom.  Set the pork, fat-side up, on top.  Place in the oven to cook for 45 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn the pork over and continue to roast, uncovered, until the internal temperature registers 145 degrees, about 15 minutes.  Remove the pork, cover with foil, and let rest at room temperature for up to 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Skim the fat from the liquid in the pan.  Set over medium-high heat, add the juices from the fruit compote, and boil until they start to thicken and shine, about 10 minutes.  Add the vinegar and season with additional salt and pepper to taste.  Pour all but 2 tablespoons sauce into a bowl.  Add the fruits from the compote to the pan and cook over medium-high heat until they lightly caramelize.  Return the pork to the pan, turn to coat with the syrupy juices, and cook over medium-low heat until completely reheated, about 15 minutes.  The internal temperature should be 150 to 155 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lift the pork out of the pan, allowing excess sauce to drip back into the pan.  Thinly slice and arrange the pork over the fruits.  Dribble the sauce over the pork and scatter the remaining 1/2 teaspoon orange zest and the parsley on top.  Serve at once.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make The Compote:  In a small bowl, mix the dried fruits, walnuts, orange zest, star anise, cinnamon stick, and peppercorns.  Add the wine and lemon juice, cover, and let soak for up to 2 days in a cool place or in the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the fruits in the soaking liquid to a non-reactive saucepan set over low heat and cook for 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and drain the fruits, reserving the liquid for use in step above.  Discard the whole spices.  Cut the fruits into 1/2-inch dice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Greek food charms us by its simplicity, but there are exceptions.  Here&apos;s a rich-tasting yet modern northern Greek pork dish, hrino langada, filled with wonderful warm, sweet tones of caramelized yellow raisins, figs, and walnuts, served under a sauce highlighted with a last minute splash of glyko, a syrupy sweet vinegar.  You can substitute balsamic or sherry vinegar, or any of the new stylish vinegars, such as currant or fig.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brining a boneless pork loin guarantees a juicy flavorful roast.  The meat is browned, oven-roasted at a medium-low temperature, then left to rest before a final glazing in the syrupy sauce.  Begin two to three days in advance by brining the pork and making the fruit compote.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12                    jumbo raw head-on shrimp -- shelled, deveined
                        = (if unavailable, use 15 jumbo shrimp
                        with heads removed)
  1                cup  sweet white wine
                        = (such as Riesling)
  2        tablespoons  ground coriander seed
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh garlic
  1              large  onion -- peeled, chopped fine
  1                can  plum tomatoes - (14 oz)
                        Juice of 1/2 large lime
  11                    sheets lasagna -- each sheet
                        broken by hand into 3 squares
  10            ounces  fresh spinach -- washed

Warm a wide, high-sided saute pan over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Season both sides of shrimp with salt and pepper.  When oil is hot, add as many shrimp to the pan as will fit and cook just until shrimp turn bright pink and opaque.  Remove shrimp from pan immediately; do not overcook.  Repeat with remaining shrimp.  Remove shrimp heads and reserve bodies and heads.  Do not rinse pan.

In a blender, combine shrimp heads (substitute 3 shrimp if you've used headless shrimp) with wine.  Pass puree through a fine mesh strainer.  Discard solids and reserve liquid.

Over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil in the same saute pan in which cooked the shrimp.  Add coriander and, stirring continuously to prevent burning, saute until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, garlic, and onions, cover, and cook until translucent and soft, about 5 minutes.  Add reserved shrimp-flavored wine, bring to a simmer, and uncovered, for 2 minutes.  Add tomatoes with their juices and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently and breaking up tomatoes with a wooden spoon.  Stir in lime juice and remaining 2 spoons oil.  Taste, and season with salt and pepper.  Keep over lowest heat.

Add lasagna squares to boiling water and cook until al dente, following manufacturer's timing guidelines.  Remove pot from heat, add spinach, and steep for 30 seconds.  Drain and add to pan along with shrimp.  Gently toss all ingredients together and warm through, about 2 minutes.

Divide contents of pan among 4 plates; each serving will consist of about 8 handkerchiefs and 3 jumbo shrimp.  You may also present everything in a large bowl and let your guests serve themselves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  For all the variety of pasta shapes stocked by the average American grocery store, one type I've never been able to find here is the square-shaped fazzoletti, Italian for "handkerchiefs."  A simple solution: break lasagna sheets into thirds.  What I love about squares is the way they drape over and envelop the other ingredients in the bowl.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CURRY SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/3           cup  unsweetened coconut milk
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  grated peeled gingerroot
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
                        = (preferably Madras)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1               dash  Tabasco sauce
  2               cups  chicken stock
                        About 1 teaspoon coarse or kosher salt -- (optional)
                        === PRAWNS ===
  2             pounds  prawns or large shrimp - (abt 36 shrimp) -- peeled, deveined,
                        and cleaned with salt (see below)
  2        tablespoons  vodka
  1              large  egg white -- lightly beaten
  2              large  firm ripe pears -- (any kind)
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/3           cup  corn oil
  3                     shallots -- minced
  1         tablespoon  julienned peeled gingerroot
  1         tablespoon  julienned lemon zest
  1                cup  Curry Sauce -- (above)
                        Coarse or kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  toasted almond slices*

* To toast the almonds:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the almonds on a dry baking sheet and toast, stirring occasionally, for about 4 to 5 minutes, until they have turned light brown and smell fragrant.

Make The Curry Sauce:  Mix the cornstarch and coconut milk in a small bowl; set aside.

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan.  Add the onion, garlic and gingerroot.  Cook over high heat until the onion is golden, about 4 minutes.  Add the curry powder, white pepper, and Tabasco.  Cook over high heat, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the stock and the coconut milk mixture.  Mix well and cook over low heat for 20 minutes, or until the cornstarch no longer has a raw taste and the sauce is lightly thickened.  Remove from the heat and cool.  When cool, puree the sauce in a blender or a food processor.  Taste to correct the seasonings, adding the salt if needed.  The sauce can be prepared 3 to 4 days in advance, covered and refrigerated.

Prepare The Prawns:  Pat the shrimp dry.  Mix the vodka and the beaten egg white in a large bowl, add the shrimp and toss to combine.  Marinate for 20 minutes at room temperature, turning occasionally; drain.  Set aside.

Peel the pears, cut in half lengthwise and remove the cores.  Cut each pear half into 6 to 8 thin slices and place in a small bowl.

Mix the water and lemon juice and pour over the pears; let steep for 5 minutes.  Transfer the pears and all the liquid to a large saucepan.  Bring the liquid to a boll.  Cover and poach the pears for about 3 minutes, or until they are just tender.  Remove from the heat, drain and set aside.

Heat the oil in a large skillet until it is hot but not smoking.  Add the shrimp and cook in 2 batches, stirring occasionally, until they just turn pink, about 3 minutes.

Remove from the skillet with a slotted spoon and set aside.  Repeat with the remaining shrimp.  Remove and discard all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the pan.  Add the shallots, gingerroot and lemon zest to the skillet.  Cook for 2 minutes, stirring, until the shallots are golden.

Add the curry sauce and the poached pear slices.  Bring the sauce to a boil over high heat.  Add the shrimp and cook for 2 minutes, tossing in the sauce until they are hot and well coated.  Remove from the heat and add salt and pepper to taste.

Remove the shrimp and pears with a slotted spoon and divide among 6 plates.  Top with any sauce remaining in the skillet.  Sprinkle with the toasted almonds and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Marinating shrimp in a little vodka adds sweetness to the shrimp and improves their flavor.  The following recipe has been influenced by the cuisines of Southeast Asia, where curry powder is often mixed with coconut milk to give richness to a finished dish.  Serve with white rice.

On Cleaning Shrimp:  In order to make frozen shrimp taste better, I refresh them by cleaning them with salt and washing them in lots of water before cooking.  Peel and devein the raw shrimp.  Place them in a bowl and sprinkle generously with salt.  Toss them well in the salt and quickly rub it in with your fingers so that it coats the shrimp.  Place the bowl under a faucet and immediately rinse them well, running cold water over them until the water becomes clear and all the salt has been washed away.

Remove the shrimp and pears with a slotted spoon and divide among 6 plates.  Top with any sauce remaining in the skillet.  Sprinkle with the toasted almonds and serve.

Comments:  Marinating shrimp in a little vodka adds sweetness to the shrimp and improves their flavor.  The following recipe has been influenced by the cuisines of Southeast Asia, where curry powder is often mixed with coconut milk to give richness to a finished dish.  Serve with white rice.

<DirT>
On Cleaning Shrimp:  In order to make frozen shrimp taste better, I refresh them by cleaning them with salt and washing them in lots of water before cooking.  Peel and devein the raw shrimp.  Place them in a bowl and sprinkle generously with salt.  Toss them well in the salt and quickly rub it in with your fingers so that it coats the shrimp.  Place the bowl under a faucet and immediately rinse them well, running cold water over them until the water becomes clear and all the salt has been washed away.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PORK ===
  1                     pork loin roast - (abt 3 lbs)
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh marjoram
  2             pieces  ginger - (3" ea) -- peeled, chopped fine
  5                     garlic cloves -- peeled, halved
  5                     pitted prunes -- quartered
  1         tablespoon  caraway seeds
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        === SAUCE ===
  1 1/4           cups  dry white wine
                        = (or chicken stock or water)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2                     shallots -- finely chopped
  1              piece  ginger - (abt 3") -- peeled, chopped fine
  5                     pitted prunes -- quartered
  2               cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Make The Pork:  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Use a sharp knife to cut away most of the excess fat from the pork roast, leaving a thin layer of fat on top.

Mix the marjoram and ginger together in a small bowl.  Use a sharp knife to poke holes about 1 1/2 inches deep all over the pork roast, then use a sharpening steel or the handle of a wooden spoon to make the holes a bit wider.  Stuff 1 or 2 prune quarters, half a garlic clove, and a large pinch of the marjoram mixture into each hole.

Combine the remaining marjoram mixture with the caraway seeds, the salt, and pepper to taste.  Rub the roast all over with the olive oil, then rub the seasoning mixture over the roast.

Put the roast in a roasting pan and roast for 20 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 35O degrees and roast for 40 minutes to 1 hour longer, until the center of the roast reaches 150 to 155 degrees on an instant-read thermometer.  Transfer the roast to a cutting board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest while you make the sauce.

Make The Sauce:  Set the roasting pan over medium-high heat and deglaze the pan with the wine or other liquid, scraping up the browned bits in the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Remove from the heat and set aside.

Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Add the shallots and ginger and sautÈ for about 2 minutes, until the shallots start to soften.  Add the prunes, stock, vinegar, and the deglazing liquid, bring to a simmer, and simmer gently for 10 minutes, until slightly reduced.  Whisk in the butter, season with salt and pepper to taste, and remove from the heat,

To serve, cut the roast into thick slices and arrange them on a platter.  Spoon some of the sauce over the meat, and pass the remaining sauce at the table.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  We used to eat this dish all the time at home, with red cabbage and roasted potatoes.  Prunes, both in the meat itself and in the sauce, complement the flavors of the roast pork.  At Aquavit, we like to accompany this with lingonberry preserves; you could also serve it with fresh cranberry relish.

At Aquavit, we use veal stock to make the sauce, but we've substituted the more common chicken version in the recipe.  However, many gourmet markets sell good-quality fresh or frozen veal stock, which you could use instead for a richer flavor.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  apple cider vinegar
  3        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2        tablespoons  crushed yellow mustard seeds
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh sage
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                     bone-in pork shoulder - (4 to 5 lbs)

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Whisk together the vinegar, shallots, mustard seeds, black pepper, cayenne, sage, and garlic.  Rub the mixture into the pork, coating it evenly.

Place the pork in a large roasting pan and cover with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil.  Cook until the meat is very tender, about 6 hours.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  We love pork shoulder.  During one of our drives through the South, we happened upon a Sunday-morning all-you-can-eat buffet that offered fried chicken, ham, collard greens, yams, biscuits, and most important, a huge side of pork.  As other guests helped themselves to piles of fried chicken, we dug into the pork and pulled.  The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender.  We spent a good part of the morning there, going back for seconds and thirds.  It wasn't long before we were having pork pulls at home.

Because of the girth of half a pig, we cook the more manageable shoulder instead.  We set the whole shoulder in the center of the table and invite friends over to pull along with us.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FISH ===
  4                     red mullet - (8 to 10 oz ea) -- cleaned, trimmed
  1                     small bunch thyme
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
                        Juice of 1 lemon - (abt 8 tspns)
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SALAD ===
  1              pound  small vine-ripened tomatoes -- cut into wedges
     1/2                medium-hot red chile pepper -- seeded, minced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/4           cup  good-quality black olives -- pitted
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped flat-leaf parsley

Make The Fish:  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Season the whole fish inside and out with salt and pepper and put 2 sprigs of thyme in the cavity of each one.

Brush four 12-inch squares of foil with a little of the olive oil and put a fish diagonally across the center of each piece.  Bring the sides of the foil up around the fish and crimp it together tightly at each end, leaving the top open.

Mix the wine with 1/4 cup of water.  Pour 2 tablespoons of the wine and water mixture, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice into each parcel.  Add the remaining sprigs of thyme and season with a little more salt and pepper.  Seal the parcels well and place on a large baking sheet.  Bake the fish for 10 minutes.

Make The Salad:  Meanwhile, for the salad, scatter the tomato wedges, red chile, garlic, and olives on four small plates.  Drizzle the olive oil over the salad.  Season with some salt and pepper and sprinkle with the parsley.

To Serve:  Put the unopened parcels of fish on four warmed plates.  Take them to the table with a bowl of fries cooked in olive oil and the plates of tomato salad.  Let each person open up their own parcel.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  When most people hear mullet, they scrunch up their faces in confusion.  And understandably so.  Mullet is a misnomer in many cases.  Red mullet actually belongs to the goatfish family and isn't a mullet at all.  Regardless of origin, though, this fish and its simple presentation are sure to please.

Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Entree
                Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     Cornish hens - (1 to 1 1/2 lbs ea) -- halved
  7        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1                cup  toasted coarse bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  1                     scallion, white and green parts -- thinly sliced
  2                     anchovy fillets -- soaked in cold
                        water for 2 minutes, patted dry, and
                        chopped
  1         tablespoon  capers -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Arrange the hen halves in a single layer, skin-side up, on a baking sheet.  Brush the skin with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Roast the hens until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 170 degrees, 30 to 35 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk the vinegar and remaining 6 tablespoons olive oil together.  Add the bread crumbs, parsley, scallion, anchovies, capers, lemon zest, garlic thyme, and rosemary and toss together.  Season with salt and pepper.

Remove the hens to a platter, top with the toasted bread crumb mixture, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  We used to do a salsa just like this at Chez Panisse and serve it with everything from grilled rib eye steaks to salmon to roasted pork loin.  The success of the dish depends upon the best-quality homemade French or Italian coarse-textured bread crumbs; you simply can't use store-bought bread crumbs.  To toast the crumbs, place them on a baking sheet in a 350 degree oven, turning occasionally, until done, 10 to 15 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STUFFING ===
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  5             ounces  cÏpes mushrooms
  4             ounces  chanterelles mushrooms
  2             ounces  craterellus (black chanterelles) mushrooms
  1 1/2         ounces  ground pork sausage
  1 1/2         ounces  Corsican figatelli sausage
                        = (or other smoked cured pork sausage)
  3             ounces  chestnuts -- chopped
                        === PARTRIDGES ===
  4                     partridges
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1                     garlic clove
     1/2           cup  brandy
  4             slices  bacon
     1/2           cup  white wine
  2             sprigs  fresh myrtle
  1                     bouquet garni
                        = (a few sprigs of parsley, thyme, and a
                        bay leaf tied together with string)
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CHESTNUT POLENTA ===
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  chestnut flour
                        = (available in gourmet stores)
  1              pinch  ground nutmeg
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

Prepare The Stuffing:  Heat a thin film of olive oil in large skillet.  Wash and chop the mushrooms, and sautÈ them until lightly browned.  Add the the sausage meat, figatelli, and chestnuts and cook until no longer pink.

Prepare The Partridges:  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Season the partridges with salt and pepper.  Heat some olive oil in a cast-iron casserole, add the garlic, and brown the partridges on all sides.  Add the brandy, stand back and ignite the liquor.  Let the flame die out and the pan remove from the heat.

Drain the browned partridges on a large plate, fill them with the mushroom stuffing, and wrap a slice of bacon around each one.  Place the partridges in an earthenware baking dish and roast for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, reheat the casserole, deglaze with the white wine, add the sprigs of myrtle and the bouquet garni.  Reduce the liquid in the casserole by one-half, then add the chicken stock.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  When the sauce is smooth and thickened, strain and keep warm.

Prepare The Chestnut Polenta:  In a medium saucepan, scald the heavy cream and then whisk it into the chestnut flour.  Season to taste with salt, pepper, and the nutmeg.  Continue stirring until thickened and smooth.  Stir in the olive oil.

Remove the partridges from the oven, arrange them on a large platter.  Add the juices from the baking dish to the reserved sauce and serve separately with the chestnut polenta.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  We admit that this recipe is a bit challenging, and it's probably best suited to advanced and adventurous cooks who don't have the pressure of a herd of Thanksgiving guests breathing down their necks.  Figatelli may be hard to find, but any good cured smoked French sausage will do.  Myrtle can be found at most gourmet stores that have a sizable herb section.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  10             large  eggs
  1              pound  best-quality bittersweet chocolate -- chopped small pieces
  1              pound  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  strong brewed espresso
     1/4           cup  hazelnut liqueur -- such as Frangelico
  1                cup  skinned -- lightly toasted
                        ground hazelnuts (optional)
                        === GLAZE ===
  5             ounces  bittersweet chocolate - (to 6) -- grated
                        = (same chocolate as for cake)
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
                        Unsweetened cocoa powder -- for dusting
                        Unsweetened whipped cream

Make The Cake:  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Line a 3-quart metal or stainless mixing bowl with foil.  The bowl should be completely covered, with a couple of inches overhang.  Make the foil as smooth as possible.

Break the eggs into a large bowl and whisk until frothy.

In a large double boiler or a stainless bowl set over barely simmering water, melt the chocolate with the butter until smooth, stirring, about 8 minutes.  Stir in the sugar, espresso, and liqueur and continue to cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes.

Gradually, whisk the chocolate into the beaten eggs, whisking constantly, until the mixture is homogenous.  Fold in the hazelnuts, if using.

Scrape the batter into the prepared bowl.  Bake the cake in the middle of the oven until the top is slightly puffy and crisp but the center is still moist, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.  A cake tester inserted in the center won't come out clean, but it shouldn't have visible liquid on it.  Let the cake cool on a rack, then refrigerate, covered loosely with plastic, for at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.  (It will continue to firm as it chills.)  The cake can be made up to two days ahead.

Make The Glaze:  In the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, melt the chocolate in the cream until completely smooth, about 6 minutes.  Whisk in the butter until glossy.

Invert the cake onto a large cake plate and carefully peel off the foil.  With a rubber spatula, coat the cake with the chocolate glaze, wiping the sides of the plate clean with a piece of damp paper towel.  Let stand until the glaze is set, about 10 minutes, then refrigerate for another hour.  Before serving, dust the cake lightly with cocoa powder using a sifter.  Cut into slices and serve with whipped cream and an acidic sorbet or fruit salad, if desired.

This recipe yields 14 to 16 servings.

Comments:  The original recipe, published in Heron's Rose Pistola Cookbook, comprises several elements and requires not insignificant baking skills.  Realizing that this might be daunting for some, Heron invites less ambitious cooks to make the cake part alone (he calls it budino, or pudding, but it's more like a flourless cake).

Even in this simplified form, the cake is a thing of beauty.  Not wanting to lose the lovely nut flavor of the original, I added some hazelnuts and hazelnut liqueur to the cake batter.  I love the hazelnuts but if you like your chocolate cakes silky-smooth, omit them.  The cake is gigantic, easily enough for sixteen.  For a more intimate occasion, halve the recipe and bake in a smaller mixing bowl.  For optimum results, use Scharfen Berger dark chocolate.  Valrhona or Callebaut are good, too, though the latter tends to be smoky Lindt "75% Cacao" bars are a fine inexpensive option.

A cake tester inserted in the center won&apos;t come out clean, but it shouldn&apos;t have visible liquid on it.  Let the cake cool on a rack, then refrigerate, covered loosely with plastic, for at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.  (It will continue to firm as it chills.)  The cake can be made up to two days ahead.

<DirT>
Make The Glaze:  In the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, melt the chocolate in the cream until completely smooth, about 6 minutes.  Whisk in the butter until glossy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Invert the cake onto a large cake plate and carefully peel off the foil.  With a rubber spatula, coat the cake with the chocolate glaze, wiping the sides of the plate clean with a piece of damp paper towel.  Let stand until the glaze is set, about 10 minutes, then refrigerate for another hour.  Before serving, dust the cake lightly with cocoa powder using a sifter.  Cut into slices and serve with whipped cream and an acidic sorbet or fruit salad, if desired.

This recipe yields 14 to 16 servings.

Comments:  The original recipe, published in Heron&apos;s Rose Pistola Cookbook, comprises several elements and requires not insignificant baking skills.  Realizing that this might be daunting for some, Heron invites less ambitious cooks to make the cake part alone (he calls it budino, or pudding, but it&apos;s more like a flourless cake).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Even in this simplified form, the cake is a thing of beauty.  Not wanting to lose the lovely nut flavor of the original, I added some hazelnuts and hazelnut liqueur to the cake batter.  I love the hazelnuts but if you like your chocolate cakes silky-smooth, omit them.  The cake is gigantic, easily enough for sixteen.  For a more intimate occasion, halve the recipe and bake in a smaller mixing bowl.  For optimum results, use Scharfen Berger dark chocolate.  Valrhona or Callebaut are good, too, though the latter tends to be smoky Lindt &quot;75% Cacao&quot; bars are a fine inexpensive option.

            Rosemary Cod With Vanilla-Scented Mashed Rutabaga

Recipe By     :Andreas Viestad
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Fish (Ocean)
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     cod fillets - (8 oz ea) -- skin on
  2             pounds  rutabaga -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" dice
  1                     vanilla bean
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
                        Fine sea salt -- as needed
  4                     small sprigs fresh rosemary
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

Soak the fish in ice water for 15 to 20 minutes, or place it in a colander in the sink under cold running water for 15 to 20 minutes.  Pat dry with paper towels.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add the rutabaga and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, until soft.  Drain well.  Return the rutabaga to the pan to dry completely over low heat, 1 to 2 minutes.  Puree the rutabaga in a food processor or pass it through a food mill, and return it to the pan.

Cut the vanilla bean lengthwise in half.  Scrape out the seeds and add to the mashed rutabaga.  (Discard the bean or add it to a canister of sugar to make aromatic vanilla sugar.)  Gently stir the butter into the mashed rutabaga until it melts.  Season with a little salt.  Keep warm.

Meanwhile, make a small incision through the skin of each cod fillet and gently insert a rosemary sprig.  Season well with salt and pepper and rub with the olive oil.  Place the fish in a roasting pan.  Roast for about 15 minutes, until the fish flakes easily.  Place a large scoop of mashed rutabaga on each plate.  Top with the fish and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Because its skin is thin and almost without scales, cod is perfect for infusing with herbs.  Just make a small slit with a knife and insert some rosemary or thyme, and when the cod is cooked, you will find a wonderfully herb-flavored, flaky fish under crisp skin.

Scandinavians love the turnip-like rutabaga (whose American name is derived from the Swedish word for rutabaga).  One of the few vegetables to last through the winter, it was long the food of the poor, cherished as an important source of vitamins more than for its taste.  When I was growing up, our old neighbor, the ascetic and ever-worried Mrs. Krigel, lived on rutabaga and boiled water for weeks at a time.  "It is pure, good food," she insisted.  "It will make you strong."  Every time I visited her, she would insist that I eat a slice of raw rutabaga.  She was sure that the sweet taste would take my mind off the chocolate and chewing gum she suspected me of devouring.  Of course it didn't, and it was not until recently that I realized how wonderful this cheap, slightly sweet vegetable can be.  Infused with the flavor of vanilla, it makes the most interesting contrast to lightly salted fresh cod.

                 Rotolo Of Chicken Smothered In Tomatoes

Recipe By     :Paul Bertolli
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Entree
                Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     chicken legs, thigh included -- boned
  8             slices  prosciutto di Parma
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  1              quart  diced ripe tomatoes - (6 to 8)
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  8                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme - (to 4)
  1                     Handful fresh flat-leaf parsley

Salt and pepper the cut side of the chicken, and lay a thin slice of prosciutto over the meat.  Roll the leg lengthwise and tie it with kitchen twine so that it maintains a roughly uniform cylinder.  Salt and pepper the skin side of the chicken.

Warm a little olive oil in a skillet large enough to contain the chicken, and brown it fully on all sides.  Remove the chicken from the pan and transfer it to a baking dish large enough to hold all 8 pieces comfortably.

Core the tomatoes, then plunge them in boiling water for 15 seconds to loosen the skin.  Seed the tomatoes over a sieve to catch and retain any of the flavorful gel and liquid.  Push the gel and liquid through the sieve mesh, then dice them coarsely.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Pour off any excess fat from the pan used to brown the chicken, leaving just enough to coat the pan bottom.  Combine the onion, garlic, and herbs in the pan and cook until softened without browning.  Add the tomatoes and the reserved juices to the pan, bring to a boil, then pour the tomato mixture over the chicken.  Bake the chicken for 50 minutes or until tender in the center.

Remove the chicken from the dish, allow it to cool somewhat, and remove the strings.

In the meantime, transfer the tomato mixture to a wide sautÈ pan and reduce it to just about half its volume.  It should have a slightly coarse texture and a deep, savory flavor, and it should be sufficiently reduced so that the sauce does not bleed any clear liquid at the edges.

Return the chicken to the sauce and warm it gently.  To serve, place one chicken bundle on each of 8 warm plates.  Make a final correction to the sauce: Taste it for salt, reduce it further, or add a little water if it appears overly thick.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Serve these chicken bundles with soft polenta, smashed potatoes, or your favorite root purÈe.

Note:  Tomatoes also act to mollify the pungent aromas of certain foods.  My mother used to cook sauerkraut with tomatoes; her version was meltingly soft, appealingly tinted, and more savory/sweet than purely sour, and it had none of the gassy cabbage fumes of less sensitive treatments.  Similarly, tomatoes tame the visceral aromas of beef and pork tripe.

        Sage-Roasted Chicken With Sweet Potatoes, Cipollini Onions

Recipe By     :Maria Helm Sinskey
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Entree
                Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  sweet potatoes - (abt 3 lbs)
  16                    cipollini onions
                        = (or small white onions)
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     roasting chickens - (4 to 6 lbs ea)
  16                    sage leaves -- with stems reserved
                        for stuffing cavity

Peel the sweet potatoes and cut into four pieces each.  Peel the onions and if they are large cut in half to form half moons.

In a large bowl, toss the onions and the sweet potatoes with the brown sugar, 2 teaspoons of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper, and just enough olive oil to moisten.  Place the vegetables in a large roasting pan.

Preheat oven to 475 degrees.

Cut off the tail and the excess skin and fat on the chickens.  Separate the skin from the meat by gently working from the front and back of the breasts with your fingers.  Move down the breasts and over the tops of the thighs and legs.  Separate the skin as far as your fingers can reach.  Slide the sage leaves between the skin and the meat.  Position one on top of each of the legs, one on each of the thighs, and two on each breast.  Season the cavity of the chickens well with salt and pepper; stuff the sage stems into the cavity.

Tie the birds with kitchen twine: Cut a string measuring 24 inches long or measure a piece of string three times the length of the bird.  Loop the center of the string over the neck bone and under the shoulders.  Run the string over the wings and along the bottom of the breast so that it is tucked in between the breast and the thigh.  Cross the string at the point of the breast and tie once, pulling the string tightly.  Loop each end of the string around the end of each drumstick and tie once to pull the legs snugly against the point of the breast.  Tie a second time to form a knot.  Trim the ends of the string.

To do a quick truss, make a slit on either side of the breast just above the thigh/leg joint, parallel to the breast meat in the space where the breast meat ends and the thigh meat begins.  It should be wide enough to stick the ends of the legs in.  The slit should be about 2 inches from the edge of the cavity.  Turn the bird so that the cavity is facing toward you.  Grab the end of the drumstick and push the leg thigh joint back toward the wing.  Tuck the end of the drumstick into the slit and pat the leg back into position, repeat with the other leg.

Rub the chickens with olive oil and season their skin well with salt and pepper.  Place the birds on top of the prepared vegetables in the roasting pan.

Oven-sear the chickens in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.  Turn the oven down to 400 degrees and add 1 cup of water to the roasting pan.  The water will mix with the caramelized juices of the chicken and vegetables and produce a wonderful pan juice.  Roast for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours; add more water if the pan juices become dry.  The chickens are done when a thermometer reads 145 degrees when inserted into the thigh or when the juices run clear from the thigh and leg when pierced.  Remove the chickens and place them on a cutting board or platter.

Let the chickens rest covered lightly with a foil tent for 15 minutes before carving.  They will continue to cook as they rest.  Cut the chickens into eight pieces each (cut the large breasts in half).  Serve with onions and potatoes on the side and the degreased pan juices spooned over.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Sage is a wise and beautiful herb.  For centuries, people have consumed it for medicinal as well as culinary purposes.  The shimmery green leaves with delicate silver fur are powerfully flavored.  When used in proper combinations sage is a showcased beauty.  Stuffing would be amiss without it.  Butter mellows its intensity and fries it to a crunch for topping gnocchi, soups, and risotto.  Here it perfumes the meat of the chicken while roasting in the fat of the skin.  It blends seamlessly with the golden caramelized cipollini and the roasted sweet potatoes.  The flavors smolder in every earthy bite.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 475 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut off the tail and the excess skin and fat on the chickens.  Separate the skin from the meat by gently working from the front and back of the breasts with your fingers.  Move down the breasts and over the tops of the thighs and legs.  Separate the skin as far as your fingers can reach.  Slide the sage leaves between the skin and the meat.  Position one on top of each of the legs, one on each of the thighs, and two on each breast.  Season the cavity of the chickens well with salt and pepper; stuff the sage stems into the cavity.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tie the birds with kitchen twine: Cut a string measuring 24 inches long or measure a piece of string three times the length of the bird.  Loop the center of the string over the neck bone and under the shoulders.  Run the string over the wings and along the bottom of the breast so that it is tucked in between the breast and the thigh.  Cross the string at the point of the breast and tie once, pulling the string tightly.  Loop each end of the string around the end of each drumstick and tie once to pull the legs snugly against the point of the breast.  Tie a second time to form a knot.  Trim the ends of the string.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To do a quick truss, make a slit on either side of the breast just above the thigh/leg joint, parallel to the breast meat in the space where the breast meat ends and the thigh meat begins.  It should be wide enough to stick the ends of the legs in.  The slit should be about 2 inches from the edge of the cavity.  Turn the bird so that the cavity is facing toward you.  Grab the end of the drumstick and push the leg thigh joint back toward the wing.  Tuck the end of the drumstick into the slit and pat the leg back into position, repeat with the other leg.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rub the chickens with olive oil and season their skin well with salt and pepper.  Place the birds on top of the prepared vegetables in the roasting pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Oven-sear the chickens in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.  Turn the oven down to 400 degrees and add 1 cup of water to the roasting pan.  The water will mix with the caramelized juices of the chicken and vegetables and produce a wonderful pan juice.  Roast for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours; add more water if the pan juices become dry.  The chickens are done when a thermometer reads 145 degrees when inserted into the thigh or when the juices run clear from the thigh and leg when pierced.  Remove the chickens and place them on a cutting board or platter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Let the chickens rest covered lightly with a foil tent for 15 minutes before carving.  They will continue to cook as they rest.  Cut the chickens into eight pieces each (cut the large breasts in half).  Serve with onions and potatoes on the side and the degreased pan juices spooned over.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Sage is a wise and beautiful herb.  For centuries, people have consumed it for medicinal as well as culinary purposes.  The shimmery green leaves with delicate silver fur are powerfully flavored.  When used in proper combinations sage is a showcased beauty.  Stuffing would be amiss without it.  Butter mellows its intensity and fries it to a crunch for topping gnocchi, soups, and risotto.  Here it perfumes the meat of the chicken while roasting in the fat of the skin.  It blends seamlessly with the golden caramelized cipollini and the roasted sweet potatoes.  The flavors smolder in every earthy bite.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CARTA DI MUSICA DOUGH ===
  5               cups  unbleached bread flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar or honey
  2          teaspoons  table salt
                        = (or 3 1/2 tspns kosher salt)
  1 3/4      teaspoons  instant yeast
     1/4           cup  olive or vegetable oil
                        = (or solid vegetable shortening)
  1 2/3           cups  room-temperature water -- (70 degrees)
                        Unbleached bread flour, cornmeal, or

                        === CRUSHED TOMATO SAUCE ===
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried basil -- (optional)
                        = (or 2 tbspns minced fresh basil)
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano -- (optional)
                        = (or 1 tbspn minced fresh oregano)
  1         tablespoon  granulated garlic powder

                        pressed)
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
                        = (or freshly squeezed lemon juice, or a
                        combination)
  1           teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
                        === PIZZA ===
  2                     Carta Di Musica crusts -- either soft or crisp
     1/2           cup  Crushed Tomato Sauce
  4                     high-quality sardines
  6             ounces  fresh mozzarella -- cut thin strips
                        = (either mozzarella di bufala or fior di
                        latte, or full-fat low moisture
                        mozzarella cheese)
  12                    caramelized garlic cloves
  16                    Kalamata or favorite brine- or salt-cured
                        black olives
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  8                     fresh basil leaves

Make The Carta Di Musica Dough:  With a large metal spoon, stir together all the ingredients in a 4-quart bowl or the bowl of an electric stand mixer until combined.  If mixing with an electric mixer, fit it with the dough hook and mix on low speed for about 4 minutes, or until the dough forms a coarse ball and clears the sides and the bottom of the bowl.  Add more flour or water by the tablespoonful as needed.  Let the dough rest for 15 minutes, then mix again on low-speed for an additional 2 to 4 minutes, or until the dough is smooth, stretchy, and tacky but not sticky.  The dough should pass the windowpane test.

If mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the spoon into room temperature water and use it much like a dough hook, working the dough vigorously as you rotate the bowl with your other hand.  Continue mixing for about 4 minutes, or until the dough forms a coarse ball, adding more flour or water by the tablespoonful as needed.  Let the dough rest for 15 minutes, then transfer it to a lightly floured counter.  Dust the top with flour to absorb the surface moisture, then knead the dough by hand for 2 to 4 minutes, or until it is smooth, stretchy, and tacky but not sticky.  The dough should pass the windowpane test.

Form the dough into a ball and place it in a bowl brushed with olive oil.  Roll the dough in the oil to coat the entire surface and cover the bowl with plastic wrap.  Let the dough sit at room temperature for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size.

Place a baking stone on the middle shelf of the oven (unless you know your oven well enough to place it on a different shelf) and preheat on the highest setting for at least 1 hour.

While the oven is heating, sprinkle some flour on the counter and transfer the dough from the bowl to the floured counter.  Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces.  Round each piece into a ball, flatten each ball with the palm of your hand into a disk, and lay the disks on a clean counter lightly dusted again with flour.  Lightly dust the tops of the disks with more flour, cover them loosely with plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes.

With a rolling pin, evenly roll out each disk into a rectangle or oblong about 10 by 7 inches.  If the dough resists extending to the full size, cover it with a kitchen towel and let it rest for at least 5 minutes.  Move on to another dough disk and then return to the first piece.  When it is fully rolled, it should be a scant 1/4-inch thick.  If it is slightly longer or shorter than 10 inches or is not a perfect rectangle, yet appears to be the proper thickness, stop rolling.  Let the rolled-out dough rest uncovered on the counter for about 3 minutes, then gently lift one (you may need to use a metal or plastic scraper) onto a wooden or metal peel that has been lightly dusted with flour.

Slide the dough from the peel onto the stone, close the oven door, and wait for 2 minutes before opening the door.  The dough should begin separating horizontally into 2 thin halves, puffing up into a large pita-like bread.  When this occurs, count to 20 and then remove the bread, placing it on a wire rack to cool; do not wait for it to brown or crisp.  While the first piece is baking, prepare the next piece and continue in this manner until all 4 pieces are baked.  If any do not begin to puff and separate within 4 minutes, remove them from the oven and use them as soft flatbreads.

When the puffed breads have cooled, they will release their air and flatten.  Separate the halves with a sharp, serrated knife into 2 very thin disks (one side may be thinner than the other, but unless it is too thin to hold together it will be okay).  These halved breads may be used in this soft form for pizza crusts or they can be crisped in the same preheated oven and used either as ultra crisp pizza crusts or cracker bread (carta di musica).

To make crisp crusts, place as many halved pieces as will fit on the baking stone or inverted sheet pan in the still-hot oven and bake for about 5 minutes or until the disks begin to brown and curl.  Remove them from the oven to a wire rack to cool.  (Makes 8 soft or crisp 10- by 7-inch crusts)

Make The Crushed Tomato Sauce:  In a bowl, stir together all the ingredients, starting with 1/2 teaspoon salt and adding more to taste.  Store in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Make The Pizza:  Place a baking stone on the middle shelf of the oven (unless you know your oven well enough to place it on a different shelf) and preheat to 450 degrees for at least 1 hour.  Make 1 pizza at a time unless your peel and oven can accommodate both pizzas.  Set 1 crust, rough surface up, on a peel or inverted sheet pan.  (You do not need to dust the peel with flour because the baked crust will not stick.)

Spread 1/4 cup of the tomato sauce over the surface of the crust, leaving a 1/4-inch border uncovered.  Cut 2 sardines crosswise to yield 4 pieces each and distribute the pieces evenly over the crust.  Arrange half of the cheese strips evenly over the surface, and then top with 6 garlic cloves and 8 olives.  Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over the surface, spiraling it out from the center.

Carefully slide the pizza onto the baking stone and bake for about 6 minutes, or until the cheese melts.  While the pizza is baking, stack the basil leaves, roll them up lengthwise, and cut thinly crosswise to create shreds (known as a chiffonade cut).  Remove the finished pizza from the oven and place on a serving platter.  Immediately sprinkle half of the basil over the top.  Let the pizza cool for 3 minutes before serving.  To eat, break off sections by hand.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make the second pizza.

This recipe yields two 10- by 7-inch pizzas.

Comments:  Sardines may rise and fall in popularity, but they never completely disappear from the culinary landscape.  If you are not a sardine person, you may substitute 8 anchovy fillets, or 8 shrimp, peeled and deveined and lightly sautÈed in garlic and olive oil.  The Carta di Musica dough makes the crispiest, thinnest pizza crusts you'll ever eat.  It calls for a two-step process, but it does not take a long time to accomplish, and the crusts can double as soft or crisp flatbreads.  Once crisped, the crusts will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.  This recipe is written for the cook using a baking stone in a conventional home oven.

Add the vinegar, raise the heat to medium-high, and boil for 3 minutes, or until the mixture is thickened to a glaze.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the cloves, mace and scallops, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until the scallops are opaque and cooked through.  Remove the whole cloves and season with salt and pepper.

Combine the parsley and mint and sprinkle around the edges of the scallop shells.  Spoon the scallops into the shells and top with the berry glaze.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  The Elizabethans enjoyed sweet and tart sauces and made use of various flavored vinegars in their cooking.  The natural sweetness of scallops is perfectly offset here by the light tartness of fruit vinegar.  This recipe is exceptionally delicious and very simple to prepare.

                 Seared Scallops With Cider Brown Butter

Recipe By     :Cory Schreiber
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  apple cider
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              pound  sea scallops -- patted dry with
                        paper towels
  1                     Granny Smith apple -- cored, julienned
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  16             small  fresh sage leaves
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice

In a large skillet, bring the cider to a boil over medium-high heat.  Boil for 6 to 8 minutes, or until reduced to about 3 tablespoons.  Pour into a bowl and set aside.

In another large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat.  Season the scallops with the salt and pepper.  Cook the scallops until lightly browned on the outside and opaque throughout, about 2 minutes on each side (do not overcook).  Remove from the pan and keep warm.

Add the remaining 4 tablespoons butter to the skillet.  Brown the butter over medium heat, being careful not to burn.  Stir in the reduced cider, half of the julienned apple, the sage, and lemon juice.  Simmer until the apple is tender and the sauce is slightly thickened, about 1 minute.  Taste and adjust the seasoning.

To serve, put the scallops in a serving dish and spoon on the sauce.  Garnish with the remaining julienned apple.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Until recently, most store-bought scallops came from the East Coast, including Atlantic varieties of sea scallops, bay scallops, and calico scallops.  Fortunately, sea scallops are returning to the Oregon Coast in small quantities after not being available for many years.

Scallops found in stores are often treated with tripolyphosphate, a preservative that affects their sweet flavor.  This treatment also causes the scallops to retain water and to weigh a little more on the store scales.  For this reason, you may hear them referred to as "wet scallops," because they release a lot of excess water into the pan during cooking.  The water is problematic when sautÈing because it prevents the scallops from achieving a nice caramelized color and texture.  I prefer to use nontreated, dry-packed scallops.  They are more difficult to find but well worth the hunt.

I generally don't pair fish and fruit, yet I find that the apple flavor blends well with the meaty quality of the scallops.  Among Wildwood seafood lovers, this dish is a favorite.

               Shrimp Cooked In Romesco With Wilted Spinach

Recipe By     :Judy Rodgers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ROMESCO BASE ===
     1/2         ounce  raw almonds - (abt 2 tbspns or 12 nuts)
  1              ounce  hazelnuts - (1/4 cup or abt 32 nuts)
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped drained canned tomatoes
                        = (or peeled ripe tomatoes)
                        About 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     ancho chili
                        About 1 cup mild-tasting olive oil
  1 1/2         ounces  chewy white peasant-style bread -- about thick slice
  2                     garlic cloves - (to 3) -- peeled
  1           teaspoon  L'Estornel brand red wine vinegar
                        = (or other red wine vinegar fortified
                        with a few drops of sherry vinegar)
  1           teaspoon  hot paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  mild paprika
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === TO FINISH THE DISH ===
  1                cup  chicken stock, shellfish fumet, water, or
                        a combination
  3        tablespoons  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  diced yellow onions - (abt 2 oz)
                        About 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        About 1 1/4 pounds shrimp in their shells
                        = (or just over 1 pound peeled shrimp)
     3/4         pound  spinach -- washed, dried

Make The Romesco Base:  Drop the almonds into a small pot of boiling water and leave for about 10 seconds.  Drain, slide off the skins, and rub dry.  Set aside.

Roast the hazelnuts on a small baking sheet until the skins darken and start to split, 10 to 15 minutes.  While they are still hot, bundle them in a towel beanbag-style, then scrunch and massage them to rub off most of their skins.  Pick out the nuts and set aside.

Turn the oven to broil.  Spread the tomatoes 1/2 inch thick in a small, shallow baking dish.  Trickle with a little of the olive oil and place under the broiler about 4 inches from the element.  Cook until the tomatoes char slightly and bubble, a few minutes.  Remove from the broiler.  Reduce the oven temperature to 425 degrees.

Meanwhile, pour a few cups of boiling water over the chili and leave to swell for a few minutes.  Drain, then stem and seed the pepper.

Pour mild-tasting olive oil to a depth of 1/2 inch into an 8- or 10-inch skillet and set over medium-low heat.  Test the temperature with the edge of the slice of bread; when it barely sizzles on contact, reduce the heat slightly and add the bread.  (You may need to cut the bread into pieces so it fits into the pan in a single layer.)  Check the underside at 1 minute; it should just be beginning to color.  Fry until it is the color of cornflakes 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Drain and cool on a paper towel.

Thickly slice the garlic, then pound to a paste in a mortar.  Scrape into a processor and add the chili, fried bread, almonds, and hazelnuts.  Grind to a fine, moist paste, scraping the sides frequently.  Scrape in the tomato and process to a paste.  Add the vinegar, paprika, the remaining extra-virgin oil and salt to taste.  Taste; it should be bursting with flavor, although not overly spicy.  The flavor of the paprika will come out over time.

Spread the paste in a thick layer in a small shallow baking dish and bake until the surface has turned dark orange with occasional flecks of brown, about 8 minutes.

Finish The Dish:  Bring the stock, fumet, or water and the white wine to a simmer in a small saucepan.  Turn off the heat and stir in the romesco base.  Taste for salt.  Cover and set aside for about 30 minutes.  As this brew cools, the crumbs will begin to swell and soften, which will give the sauce a nice texture.

Place the diced onions in a 3-quart sautÈ pan with about 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and a few pinches of salt.  Cook over medium heat until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the romesco and warm through.  Add the shrimp and turn the heat to medium.  Cook gently, turning each one over once in the thickening sauce, until the shrimp are just firm and opaque.  This should take no longer than 4 minutes, but depends on the size of the shrimp.

Meanwhile, warm another 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat.  Add the spinach and sprinkle with salt.  Gently turn and fold leaves until they are uniformly wilted and bright green.  Taste for salt and add another trickle of oil if the spinach seems lean.

Divide the spinach among warm plates.  Arrange the shrimp on top of the spinach.  Taste the sauce, and correct the salt.  The romesco should be fluid but thick ó reduce briefly or add a splash of water if it seems either watery or pasty.  Spoon the sauce over all.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In Tarragona, on the Catalonian coast, where Romesco is traditional, the word refers to the sauce base, the chili pepper used to make it, and the finished dish it defines, and when there's enough of it, it seems to become a romescada.

The romesco sauce base is a bit labor-intensive, but it is versatile, keeps well, and improves as the flavors mingle, so we always make a large amount and use it with different seafood over the course of a week.  This shrimp dish is the easiest of our romesco dishes, but it is nearly as easy to steam open and then simmer mussels or clams in romesco.

As for the sauce, ancho chiles are a good substitute for the romesco pepper, which so far remains elusive on my coast.  We use a high-acid, oaky Spanish red wine vinegar from L'Estornel, which imparts a distinct character to the sauce.  We also use Spanish paprika, although Hungarian products will do as well-in either case, make sure it is pungent and fresh.  Buy all ground spices in quantities that you will exhaust promptly.

This shrimp dish is the easiest of our romesco dishes, but it is nearly as easy to steam open and then simmer mussels or clams in romesco.
</DirT>
<DirT>
As for the sauce, ancho chiles are a good substitute for the romesco pepper, which so far remains elusive on my coast.  We use a high-acid, oaky Spanish red wine vinegar from L&apos;Estornel, which imparts a distinct character to the sauce.  We also use Spanish paprika, although Hungarian products will do as well-in either case, make sure it is pungent and fresh.  Buy all ground spices in quantities that you will exhaust promptly.

                               Shrimp Salad

Categories    : Entree                          Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  kosher salt -- plus
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1                     lemon -- cut into quarters
  4             pounds  large shrimp in the shell - (16/20 ct)
  2               cups  good mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  good white wine
                        = (or white wine vinegar)
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6        tablespoons  minced fresh dill
  1                cup  minced red onion - (1 onion)
  3               cups  minced celery - (abt 6 stalks)

Bring 5 quarts of water, 3 tablespoons salt, and the lemon to a boil in a large saucepan.  Add half the shrimp and reduce the heat to medium.  Cook, uncovered, for only 3 minutes, or until the shrimp are barely cooked through.  Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl of cool water.  Bring the water back to a boil and repeat with the remaining shrimp.  Let cool, then peel and devein the shrimp.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, wine, 1 teaspoon salt, the pepper, and dill.  Combine with the peeled shrimp.  Add the red onion and celery and check the seasonings.  Serve, or cover and refrigerate for a few hours.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  The key to good shrimp salad is to undercook the shrimp.  I know it sounds amazing, but they really do cook in 3 minutes.  This salad makes a delicious lunch on its own, a first course for dinner, or a great sandwich filling.  The old wives' tale about mayonnaise spoiling on a picnic is false; it's the shrimp that spoils, so be sure all your ingredients are cold before you mix them.

                           Simple Roast Turkey

Recipe By     :Barbara Kafka
Serving Size  : 15    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Main Dish
                Poultry                         Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     turkey - (abt 15 lbs) -- thawed, if
                        necessary, and at room temperature, wing
                        tips removed, reserving giblets and neck
                        for gravy, and the liver for stuffing
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  water
                        = (or homemade or canned turkey or
                        chicken stock)
                        Basic fowl giblet gravy -- (optional)

Place oven rack on second level from bottom of oven.  Heat oven to 500 degrees.

Rinse the turkey inside and out.  Pat dry.  Sprinkle the outside with pepper.  If stuffing the bird, stuff both cavities, securing openings with long metal skewers.  Lace them.  Do not truss.

Put turkey in an 18- by 13- by 2-inch roasting pan, breast-side up.  Put it in the oven legs first.  After 20 minutes, move the turkey around with a wooden spatula to keep from it from sticking.  Roast until the leg joint near the backbone wiggles easily, about 2 hours.  Remove the turkey to a large platter.  Let sit 20 minutes before carving.

Pour off grease from roasting pan and put pan on top of the stove.  Add water or stock.  Bring to a boil while scraping bottom of pan vigorously with a wooden spoon, loosening all the crisp bits.  These add intensity to the gravy.  Let reduce by half.  Serve jus on the side in a sauceboat or add to giblet gravy.

This recipe yields 10 to 15 servings.

Comments:  Many Thanksgivings at my house have proved the high-heat method to be ideal.  A fifteen-pound turkey at room temperature takes two hours to roast.  However, it may take several hours for the turkey to reach room temperature.  While the turkey is sitting out, cover it loosely with a towel, otherwise the skin will dry out.  I prefer a fifteen-pound turkey as it isn't too heavy for me to handle.  It usually gives lots of good leftovers and is generally available.

                Sirloin Of New Season's Lamb With Lentils

Recipe By     :Gordon Ramsay
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LAMB ===
  4                     thick lamb sirloin steaks or chops - -- (abt 7 oz ea)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil - (to 4)
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
     3/4           cup  lentils (lentilles de Puy)
  1             medium  carrot
     1/2                small head celeriac
  1             medium  leek
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  vinaigrette dressing
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GRATIN POTATOES ===
  1              pound  medium slightly-waxy boiling potatoes
                        = (such as Yukon Gold)
  1 1/4           cups  milk
  1 1/4           cups  heavy cream
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
  1                     bay leaf
     3/4           cup  grated GruyËre cheese

Remove the central bone from the chops.  Trim off fat and neaten into nice "rump" or rounded shapes.  Place in a bowl or plastic bag with half of the oil and the leaves from the thyme sprig.  Set aside to marinate in the fridge.

Cook the lentils in boiling salted water for about 15 minutes.  Drain and season with salt and pepper.

Cut the carrot, celeriac, and leek into 1/2-inch squares (we call this a brunoise).  Heat the remaining oil in a saucepan and sautÈ the vegetables until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes.  Add the lentils and half the parsley, then bind with 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette.  Set aside.

For the gratin potatoes, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Peel the potatoes and slice thinly (use a mandoline or the slicing blade of a food processor).  Bring the milk and cream to a boil with some sea salt, the garlic, and herbs, and simmer for a couple of minutes.  Add the sliced potatoes and simmer for about 5 minutes until just tender.  Drain in a colander set over a bowl to catch the creamy milk.

Mix the potatoes gently with two-thirds of the cheese.  Layer neatly into four medium ramekins or gratin dishes, seasoning in between the layers with salt and pepper.  Spoon a little of the saved creamy milk on top of each ramekin and sprinkle with the last of the cheese.  Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake for 8 to 10 minutes until the cheese just turns a golden brown.

Meanwhile, heat a heavy-bottomed nonstick frying pan until really hot.  Remove the lamb steaks from the bowl or plastic bag, wiping off any thyme leaves, and brown for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, seasoning lightly as they cook.  The lamb should be served lightly pink-medium rare.

Reheat the lentils and spoon onto the center of four plates.  Place the lamb steaks on top (slice them first, if you like).  Deglaze the frying pan with the last of the vinaigrette, stirring for a minute, then spoon these juices over the lamb.  Sprinkle with the remaining parsley.  Serve the gratin potatoes, still in their individual dishes, on the same plate.  Simple and delicious!

This recipe yields 4 main-dish servings.

Comments:  This is a good homey dish similar to many served up and down France.  We serve the lamb with creamy gratin potatoes.  By par-cooking the potatoes in milk before finishing them in ramekins, they cook more evenly.  It's a neat little trick.

     1/2           cup  croutons
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  1              sprig  flat parsley -- finely chopped
                        Peeled seeded segments of 1 lemon -- (optional)

Put the flour in the shallow bowl and season it with salt and pepper.  Dredge the fish in the flour and shake off the excess.  Re-season the fish with salt and pepper.

In the sautÈ pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium-high heat.  When the butter has foamed and subsided, add the fish and cook over high heat for 2 minutes.

Add 1 more tablespoon of butter and turn the fish, cooking the other side for 2 minutes.  Transfer the fish to the serving platter.

Discard the butter from the pan and then add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.  Cook over high heat until it foams and subsides, then add the capers and croutons.  Cook for 30 seconds, then add the lemon juice and parsley.  (You can add the lemon segments at this point as well.)  Remove from the heat and spoon the sauce over the fish.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Long thought of as a "trash fish," skate is one of the truly great seafood items: tender, sweet, well-texturedãand cheap.  Which is why many chefs are evangelical about running it as a special.  As it becomes more popular it will no doubt become more and more expensive.  Cleaning it, meaning removing the delicate fillets from the cartilage (though it's perfectly fine to cook it with cartilage intact) and the thick, rubbery skin (which must be removed), is tricky, so have your fishmonger do the work.  Note also that skate, like other more delicate and subtle white-fleshed fishes, is very perishable.  You want to buy it and cook it on the day it came in.

                        === STEAK ===

  4               cups  thinly-sliced shallots
  4          teaspoons  minced thyme
                        === RED WINE JUS ===
  1             bottle  red wine
                        = (such as cabernet sauvignon)
  1                cup  diced (1/2") Spanish onions
  1                cup  sliced (1/2"-thk) peeled carrots
  1                cup  sliced (1/4"-thk) leeks -- white and light
                        green parts only
  1                cup  sliced (1/4"-thk) shallots
  1                cup  sliced (1/4"-thk) button mushrooms and/or
                        mushroom stems
  3                     thyme sprigs
  6                     Italian parsley sprigs
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  black peppercorns
  3              large  garlic cloves -- peeled, smashed
  5               cups  veal stock
                        === SALAD ===
  2             ounces  watercress - (to 3) -- large stems removed
  2          teaspoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced Italian parsley
  1           teaspoon  minced tarragon
  1           teaspoon  minced chives
  1           teaspoon  minced chervil
                        Extra virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  Red Wine Jus -- warmed

Make The Steak:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Season both sides of the steaks generously with salt and pepper, keeping in mind that the salt and pepper will also season the shallots as they cook.

Heat two large skillets over medium-high heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons canola oil to each skillet.  When the oil is hot, add 1 tablespoon butter to each skillet, swirling them to brown the butter.  Add the steaks and sear the first side for about 1 1/2 minutes, or until nicely browned.  Turn the steaks to brown the second side, tilt the skillets, and use a spoon to baste the meat with the oil and butter.  After about 3 minutes, total cooking, remove the skillets from the heat and transfer the meat to a waiting pan.  Set aside while you cook the shallots.

Set the skillets, with the butter and oil, over medium heat.  Add half the sliced shallots to each skillet, toss them in the oil and butter, and cook for about 2 minutes, until they have started to soften.  Combine all the shallots in one skillet, add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the thyme, reduce the heat, and cook gently until the shallots are completely softened and golden brown.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes to caramelize.

Stir any juices that have accumulated around the steaks into the shallots, then spread the shallots over the steaks.  Place in the oven to cook for about 5 minutes, or until the steaks are medium-rare.

Make The Red Wine Jus:  Combine all the ingredients except the stock in a wide heavy saucepan or pot and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the wine has reduced almost to a glaze.  Add the veal stock, bring to a simmer, and simmer for 30 minutes.

Prepare an ice bath.  Strain the jus several times through a fine-mesh strainer or a colander lined with cheesecloth.  Cool in the ice bath, stirring occasionally.  Refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for longer storage.  (Makes 1 quart)

Make The Salad And Serve:  Place the watercress in a bowl and toss with the minced shallots, herbs, and a drizzle of olive oil.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Place the steaks on serving plates and spoon about 2 tablespoons jus alongside each one.  Divide the watercress salad among the plates.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The bavette is a variation of the classic steak frites, and every bit as satisfying.  The skirt steak is quickly sautÈed and served medium-rare with heaps of shallots: About a cup per portion, a mat of them, richly caramelized, is spread atop the beef.  A red wine jus takes the place of the herb butter, echoing the deep, rich flavors of the meat.

Skirt steak, cut from along the ribs of the animal, is fibrous.  When you order it from your butcher, keep in mind that there is an inside skirt steak as well as an outside steak.  At Bouchon, we use the outside cut; thicker and more uniform in size, it can stand up to longer cooking, giving you time to baste the meat and flavor it with shallots and thyme.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (abt 3 lbs) -- cut 8 pieces,
                        and brined* for 8 to 12 hours
  1              quart  buttermilk
  1              pound  lard
  1              stick  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  country-ham pieces
                        = (or 1 thick slice country ham cut
                        into 1/2" strips)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To prepare the chicken for frying: Drain the brined chicken and rinse out the bowl it was brined in.  Return the chicken to the bowl, and pour the buttermilk over.  Cover and refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours.  Drain the chicken on a wire rack, discarding the buttermilk.

Meanwhile, prepare the fat for frying by putting the lard, butter, and country ham into a heavy skillet or frying pan.  Cook over low heat for 30 to 45 minutes, skimming as needed, until the butter ceases to throw off foam and the country ham is browned.  Use a slotted spoon to remove the ham carefully from the fat.  (The ham pieces can be saved and used to make Smoked Pork Stock.)  Just before frying, increase the temperature to medium-high and heat the fat to 335 degrees.

3. Prepare the dredge by blending together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl or on wax paper. Dredge the drained chicken pieces thoroughly in the flour mixture, then pat well to remove all excess flour.

4. Slip some of the chicken pieces, skin side down, into the heated fat. (Do not overcrowd the pan, and fry in batches if necessary.) Cook for 8 to 10 minutes on each side, until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through. Drain thoroughly on a wire rack or on crumpled paper towels, and serve.

Fried chicken is delicious eaten hot, warm, at room temperature, or cold.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  We have blended our best chicken-frying tips from Virginia and Alabama in this recipe: it requires a bit of extra effort, but the results are absolutely outstanding.  The chicken gets two long soaks, Alabama-style, first in brine and then in buttermilk.  The frying fat is a special mix ó Virginia-style ó of lard and sweet butter, flavored with a slice of country ham, which makes the chicken extra crispy and rich-tasting.  The cornstarch in the dredge adds to the crispness too.  Carefully cooked, fried chicken will absorb a minimal amount of fat.  Be sure to pat off all excess dredge; fry evenly at the proper temperature; and drain the chicken well on crumpled-up ó not flat ó paper towels or a wire rack.

* Brining, that is, soaking it in a saltwater solution before cooking, serves a twofold purpose: it helps the flesh retain moisture and seasons it all the way through.  To make the brine, stir kosher salt into cold water until dissolved, in the proportion of 1/4 cup salt to 1 quart of water.  (Don't use table salt in this formula, by the way; it will be too salty).  Mix enough brine to cover the poultry or meat completely in a (non-reactive) bowl or pot.  Store refrigerated 8 to 12 hours for poultry.

To prepare the chicken for frying: Drain the brined chicken and rinse out the bowl it was brined in.  Return the chicken to the bowl, and pour the buttermilk over.  Cover and refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours.  Drain the chicken on a wire rack, discarding the buttermilk.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, prepare the fat for frying by putting the lard, butter, and country ham into a heavy skillet or frying pan.  Cook over low heat for 30 to 45 minutes, skimming as needed, until the butter ceases to throw off foam and the country ham is browned.  Use a slotted spoon to remove the ham carefully from the fat.  (The ham pieces can be saved and used to make Smoked Pork Stock.)  Just before frying, increase the temperature to medium-high and heat the fat to 335 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
3. Prepare the dredge by blending together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl or on wax paper. Dredge the drained chicken pieces thoroughly in the flour mixture, then pat well to remove all excess flour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
4. Slip some of the chicken pieces, skin side down, into the heated fat. (Do not overcrowd the pan, and fry in batches if necessary.) Cook for 8 to 10 minutes on each side, until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through. Drain thoroughly on a wire rack or on crumpled paper towels, and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fried chicken is delicious eaten hot, warm, at room temperature, or cold.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  We have blended our best chicken-frying tips from Virginia and Alabama in this recipe: it requires a bit of extra effort, but the results are absolutely outstanding.  The chicken gets two long soaks, Alabama-style, first in brine and then in buttermilk.  The frying fat is a special mix ó Virginia-style ó of lard and sweet butter, flavored with a slice of country ham, which makes the chicken extra crispy and rich-tasting.  The cornstarch in the dredge adds to the crispness too.  Carefully cooked, fried chicken will absorb a minimal amount of fat.  Be sure to pat off all excess dredge; fry evenly at the proper temperature; and drain the chicken well on crumpled-up ó not flat ó paper towels or a wire rack.

* Brining, that is, soaking it in a saltwater solution before cooking, serves a twofold purpose: it helps the flesh retain moisture and seasons it all the way through.  To make the brine, stir kosher salt into cold water until dissolved, in the proportion of 1/4 cup salt to 1 quart of water.  (Don&apos;t use table salt in this formula, by the way; it will be too salty).  Mix enough brine to cover the poultry or meat completely in a (non-reactive) bowl or pot.  Store refrigerated 8 to 12 hours for poultry.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BRINE ===
  2            gallons  water
  1 1/3           cups  kosher salt
     2/3           cup  granulated sugar
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  dried thyme
  2          teaspoons  cracked whole allspice
  1           teaspoon  crushed juniper berries
  5                     whole cloves
                        === TURKEY ===
  1                     turkey - (16 to 18 lbs) -- see comments
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- as needed
  4             ounces  rosemary branches
  4               cups  chicken fat

Make The Brine:  In a very large stock pot, combine the water, kosher salt, sugar, bay leaves, thyme, allspice, juniper berries, and the cloves, and bring to a boil.  Remove the pot from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature.  Refrigerate the brine until chilled, about 4 to 5 hours.

When the brine is completely chilled, place the turkey parts in the brine, and allow to marinate for at least 12 hours in the refrigerator.

Make The Turkey:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Remove the turkey from the brine and pat dry with a paper towel.  Place the turkey breast in a large shallow roasting pan, breast-side up.  Season lightly with fresh ground pepper, then cover it with the whole branches of rosemary.  Eliminate any extra thick sticks of rosemary by stripping off the leaves, using only the leaves.

Roast the turkey breast for approximately 3 hours until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast reads at least 160 to 165 degrees.

At the same time, make a confit of the turkey legs and thighs by placing them in a saucepan that will hold them both without overlapping but without much extra space.  Pour in the chicken fat, which should almost cover the legs.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil.  The foil should not touch the legs, as the spot where the foil touches the legs might burn.

Place in the oven with the turkey breast if possible.  Remove from the oven when the meat is tender, about 2 hours.  Keep in a warm place until serving.

To serve, remove the legs from the chicken fat and slice the meat from the thigh but serve the leg as is.  When the breast is removed from the oven, bring the pan outside.  Light the whole rosemary branches on fire outside, because of the smoke and fire danger.  Brush off some, not all, of the ashes from the burnt sticks, placing the rosemary back on the breast, and bring it back inside.  Allow the breast to rest at least 20 minutes before slicing and serving in the usual fashion.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Have the butcher remove the legs and thighs from the turkey.  Do not separate the legs from the thighs.

                             Steak Au Poivre

Categories    : Beef                            Entree

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     thick-cut well-marbled strip steak
                        = (abt 1 pound total weight, and 1 1/2"
                        thick)
  2        tablespoons  mixed whole peppercorns
                        = (including black, white, green,
                        Szechuan and Jamaican [whole allspice])
                        Salt
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
                        === PAN SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2        tablespoons  cognac
                        = (or bourbon or red wine)
     1/2           cup  flavorful dark stock
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- room temperature
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped parsley
                        Watercress

Trim the steak of all the surrounding fat and cartilage.  Cut the meat into 2 pieces and crush the peppercorns using the bottom of a heavy skillet.

Sprinkle salt to taste on the top and bottom of the steaks; then press each side into the cracked peppercorns, encrusting the steaks lightly or heavily, as you prefer.

Heat the oil and the butter in a heavy sautÈ or frying pan over high heat.  When the pan is quite hot, lay the peppered steaks in.  Fry for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, until the undersides are well seared.  Turn the meat and cook the second side for about a minute.  Press with a finger to test for the slight springiness that indicates rare.  Cook to desired doneness and remove to a warm platter.

Making The Pan Sauce:  Add the shallots to the pan and sautÈ briefly, stirring with a spoon to scrape up the drippings.  Lean away from the stove (averting your face) and pour the cognac into the pan; tilt the edge of the pan slightly, over the burner flame, to ignite the alcohol.  The cognac will flame for a few seconds as the alcohol burns off; cook for a few moments more and then add the stock.  Bring the liquid back to the boil, and cook about 1 minute to thicken the sauce, stirring occasionally.  Taste and adjust seasoning.  Finally, add the soft butter, swirling the pan until it melts and incorporates with the juices.

When blended, pour the sauce over the steaks.  Sprinkle liberally with chopped parsley and garnish each plate with sprigs of parsley or watercress.

This recipe yields two 6 to 7 ounce steaks; 2 servings.

Comments:  Steak au poivre is a classic preparation for sautÈed steak.  Here Julia Child and Jacques PÈpin update the dish by using a mixture of black, green, white and Jamaican peppercorns, which is really allspice.  A sautÈ of mushrooms and a full-bodied red wine are a fine match.

                Sticky Rice With Mushrooms And Gingko Nuts

                Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RAGŸ ===
  1 3/4          pound  mixed fresh mushrooms
     3/4         ounce  dried porcini -- soaked in warm
                        water for 20 minutes
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  4                     green onions -- minced
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     fresh hot red chili pepper -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
  12                    shelled gingko nuts -- (see Note)
                        A handful of basil leaves -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  coarsely chopped cilantro
                        === RICE ===
  1 1/2           cups  Japanese sticky rice -- rinsed until the
                        water runs clear
  4             ounces  prosciutto -- finely diced
  1              small  onion -- minced
                        A little oil
                        Salt -- to taste

Make the rag˘ of mushrooms first.  Clean the mushrooms thoroughly and, if big, quarter them.  Drain and chop the porcini, reserving the soaking liquid.  SautÈ the garlic and green onion in the olive oil until soft.

Add the chili, ginger, chopped porcini, and the fresh mushrooms, the liquid from the porcini, the soy sauce, lemon juice, and gingko nuts.

Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, then simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.  Stir a few times, adjust the salt and, just before serving, add the herbs.

Meanwhile, sautÈ the prosciutto and onion in a pan with a little oil.  Add the rinsed rice with 2 cups cold water and some salt.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 minutes.  Cover with a lid, then simmer very gently for 6 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and let stand for 10 minutes, covered.  Serve the rice with the mushroom rag˘.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  For this Asian-inspired recipe, which is not a risotto, you could use sulfur shelf, hen of the woods, orange birch boletes, or whatever was the result of a not-very-successful fungus foray.  Cultivated mushrooms could be used too: buna-shimeji would be good.  I like rice in my combination and this one should be the Japanese or Chinese sticky rice (which I find has a slight scent of bacon or pork).  The dish sounds Asian, but you can make it to your liking by simply changing the seasoning.

Note:  Gingko nuts are the slightly sweet center of the inedible fruit of the maidenhair tree, which is found in China.  They can be found in most Asian markets or gourmet stores.

Make the rag˘ of mushrooms first.  Clean the mushrooms thoroughly and, if big, quarter them.  Drain and chop the porcini, reserving the soaking liquid.  SautÈ the garlic and green onion in the olive oil until soft.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the chili, ginger, chopped porcini, and the fresh mushrooms, the liquid from the porcini, the soy sauce, lemon juice, and gingko nuts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, then simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.  Stir a few times, adjust the salt and, just before serving, add the herbs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, sautÈ the prosciutto and onion in a pan with a little oil.  Add the rinsed rice with 2 cups cold water and some salt.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 minutes.  Cover with a lid, then simmer very gently for 6 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and let stand for 10 minutes, covered.  Serve the rice with the mushroom rag˘.

Comments:  For this Asian-inspired recipe, which is not a risotto, you could use sulfur shelf, hen of the woods, orange birch boletes, or whatever was the result of a not-very-successful fungus foray.  Cultivated mushrooms could be used too: buna-shimeji would be good.  I like rice in my combination and this one should be the Japanese or Chinese sticky rice (which I find has a slight scent of bacon or pork).  The dish sounds Asian, but you can make it to your liking by simply changing the seasoning.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Gingko nuts are the slightly sweet center of the inedible fruit of the maidenhair tree, which is found in China.  They can be found in most Asian markets or gourmet stores.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Main Dish
                Poultry                         Quail

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             small  just-ripe mission figs
  2             slices  thin prosciutto -- cut 8 equal pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Ground cardamom -- to taste
  8                     boneless quails
                        Juice of 1 lemon
                        Zest of 1 lemon -- cut into julienne
  1              pound  Swiss chard -- leaves only
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  instant couscous
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  onions -- peeled, sliced
  2        tablespoons  sliced almonds -- lightly toasted

Wrap 8 figs with the pieces of prosciutto.  Season each fig with salt, pepper, and a pinch of cardamom.  Stuff each boneless quail with 1 wrapped fig and squeeze the quail lightly on its sides to give it an oblong shape.  Season each quail with salt, pepper, and a pinch of cardamom and set aside.

Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a small pot over high heat.  Add the lemon zest and boil for 10 minutes.  Strain out the zest and finely chop half of the zest.  Set aside.

Bring 3 quarts water with 2 tablespoons salt to a boil in a pot over high heat.  Blanch the Swiss chard for 4 to 5 minutes, until the leaves are tender.  Drain and cool under cold running water.  Drain well again and set aside.

Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a pot over high heat.  Remove from heat and add the couscous, the chopped lemon zest, a pinch of cardamom, salt, and pepper.  Mix well, cover, and let sit for 5 minutes.

Preheat oven to 475 degrees.  On top of the stove, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in roasting pan over high heat.  When hot, place the quails breast-side down in the pan and brown the skin.  Turn and roast them in the oven for 12 to 15 minutes.  Add the remaining figs during the last 3 to 4 minutes of roasting.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a pan over high heat.  Add the onions and sweat for 2 minutes.  Add the blanched Swiss chard, salt, pepper, and a pinch of cardamom and toss well for 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and set aside.

Mix the lemon juice and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil into the couscous.

PRESENTATION:  Arrange the Swiss chard in a dome shape in the center of a large platter.  Place the quails around the Swiss chard and then arrange the couscous around the quails and out to the rim of the platter.  Sprinkle with the toasted almonds.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This elegant and original recipe shows off the great combination of meat and fruit often used with birds or game.  Here boneless quails are stuffed with whole fresh figs wrapped in prosciutto, roasted, and served on Swiss chard and couscous.  The ingredients of this recipe can be prepared 2 to 3 hours in advance and cooked 15 to 20 minutes before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  shoulder of veal - (to 5)
                        = (ask the butcher to cut a deep pocket
                        in the center of the veal)
                        === STUFFING ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1 1/4           cups  chopped onion
     2/3           cup  coarsely shredded carrots
     1/2           cup  finely diced celery
  1             medium  Granny Smith apple -- peeled, and
                        cut into thin slices
  2               cups  thinly-sliced mushrooms
                        = (use a mixture of button, porcini, or
                        other wild mushrooms)
     1/2           cup  matzah meal
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  white pepper
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh sage
                        = (or 1/2 tspn rubbed sage)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried thyme)
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
                        === MEAT AND ROASTING PAN ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  dry or semidry white wine
                        = (or use 1 cup water and 1 cup wine)

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet.  SautÈ the onion until golden (don't brown).  Stir in the shredded carrots, celery, and apple slices, and cook until softened.  Add the mushrooms.  Cook, stirring for 3 to 4 minutes over a medium flame, until mushrooms are tender.

Off heat, add the matzah meal and seasonings and mix thoroughly.  Let cool and mix in the eggs.

Stuff the veal pocket with a spoon or use your hands, gently packing the stuffing in.  Any remaining stuffing can be baked in the pan with the roast.

Put the stuffed veal in a roasting pan, and rub it with the oil, paprika, salt, and black pepper.  Pour the wine into the pan.  Lightly cover with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven about 2 hours, basting with the juices in the pan every 15 to 20 minutes.  The roast should look lightly browned.

Lower heat to 300 degrees.  Continue roasting, uncovered, for another 30 minutes, until the meat is tender (cut off a little piece to taste for tenderness and seasoning).  Slice to serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  For this elegant and satisfying main course for a Passover meal, we prefer to use veal rather than milk-fed veal for humane reasons.

       Tagine Of Lamb With Prunes, Toasted Almonds And Lakama Spic

Recipe By     :Paula Wolfert
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LAKAMA SPICES ===
  1         tablespoon  ground ginger
  1         tablespoon  finely-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  ground turmeric
  2          teaspoons  ground Ceylon or Mexican cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        === TAGINE ===
  1              pound  unpitted large prunes - (18 to 20)
                        = (preferably Oregon's moyer prunes)
  3             pounds  lamb shoulder -- cut 2" chunks
  2        tablespoons  olive oil or butter
  3              large  garlic cloves -- crushed with
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  LaKama Spices -- (above)
                        A couple pinches of saffron
  1           teaspoon  Ceylon or Mexican cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  orange flower water
  2        tablespoons  sugar - (to 3)
  1                cup  blanched almonds -- toasted in a slow
                        oven (300 degrees) until golden brown
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds

For The Spice Mix:  Combine spices in a small bowl.  Set aside.

Make The Tagine:  Soak the prunes in warm water.  Set aside.

Trim the lamb of excess fat.  In a wide tagine or cazuela set over a flame tamer, or in a skillet slow-cooker, heat the butter with the garlic, LaKama spices, and saffron.  Add the meat and stir until the aromas of the spices are released and the meat is nicely coated.

Add 2 cups water (it doesn't have to cover the meat), bring to the boil, then lower the heat, cover, and simmer gently for 2 hours (3 to 5 hours in the skillet-slow cooker).

After 1 hour, transfer 1/2 cup of the meat juices to a medium skillet, add the drained prunes, cinnamon, orange flower water, and sugar, and cook slowly until the prunes are lightly caramelized, about 25 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat.

When the meat is tender, about 2 hours, remove from the heat.  Push the prunes to one side in the skillet; return to medium heat.  Working in batches, brown chunks of drained lamb in the syrupy prune juices until glazed on all sides.

Skim all the fat off the meat juices in the clay pot.  Return the lamb, add the prunes and reheat.  Decorate with almonds and sesame seeds and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  LaKama is a  spice mixture found only in Northern Morocco, and it is used to flavor soups and tagines.  Moroccan food ó part Arab and part Berber ó is not like Middle Eastern.  Its cooking and spice mixtures are unique and change from region to region.  I don't know of any other Arab country that has such a rich and varied cuisine.

Note:  If desired, prepare the dish one day in advance.  Allow to cool completely.  Store meat, prunes, and sauce in separate containers.  The following day, remove the fat that surfaces.  Combine meat, prunes, and sauce in a cazuela, tagine or shallow ovenproof serving dish, cover, and set in a cold oven.  Turn the heat to 325 degrees and reheat until hot.  Serve from the clay dish garnished with the almonds and sesame seeds.

For The Spice Mix:  Combine spices in a small bowl.  Set aside.

Make The Tagine:  Soak the prunes in warm water.  Set aside.

<DirT>
Trim the lamb of excess fat.  In a wide tagine or cazuela set over a flame tamer, or in a skillet slow-cooker, heat the butter with the garlic, LaKama spices, and saffron.  Add the meat and stir until the aromas of the spices are released and the meat is nicely coated.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add 2 cups water (it doesn&apos;t have to cover the meat), bring to the boil, then lower the heat, cover, and simmer gently for 2 hours (3 to 5 hours in the skillet-slow cooker).
</DirT>
<DirT>
After 1 hour, transfer 1/2 cup of the meat juices to a medium skillet, add the drained prunes, cinnamon, orange flower water, and sugar, and cook slowly until the prunes are lightly caramelized, about 25 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the meat is tender, about 2 hours, remove from the heat.  Push the prunes to one side in the skillet; return to medium heat.  Working in batches, brown chunks of drained lamb in the syrupy prune juices until glazed on all sides.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Skim all the fat off the meat juices in the clay pot.  Return the lamb, add the prunes and reheat.  Decorate with almonds and sesame seeds and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1              pound  medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined
  2              large  leeks
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  minced shallot
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- (optional)
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1              pound  tagliatelle
     1/3           cup  Pecorino Romano cheese -- plus
                        more for table
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In sautÈ pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and quickly sear shrimp for 2 minutes.  Set aside.

Trim leeks and discard top 1/3 of tough green portion.  Slice remainder into 1/2-inch thick rounds and rinse in several changes of cold water to remove all soil and grit.  Drain well.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil with the 2 tablespoons of salt.

In sautÈ pan, heat remaining olive oil, add leeks and sautÈ over moderately-high heat, stirring until softened, about five minutes.  Add shallot and cook, stirring 1 minute.  Add butter and stock and simmer gently for 3 minutes.  Add shrimp and simmer an additional minute.  Add salt and pepper to taste.

Add tagliatelle to boiling water, stirring with a wooden spoon.  If pasta is fresh, it will be done as soon as water returns to a boil.  Otherwise, boil for 2 minutes, then turn off heat and let sit for remaining cooking time as specified on package.

Drain pasta well, add leek sauce and toss to coat pasta.

Sprinkle with Pecorino Romano cheese.  Toss well and serve with plenty of additional cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Cheryl and Bill Jamison
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Entree

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
                        Minced zest and juice of 2 medium to
                        large limes
     1/4           cup  tequila
  1         tablespoon  Triple Sec
                        = (or other orange-flavored liqueur)
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  ground dried green chile or chile
                        seasoning
                        = (or 1 tbspn minced pickled jalapeÒo)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === CHICKEN ===
  4             medium  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- pounded 1/4" thick
  3             medium  limes - (to 4) -- sliced 4 wedges each
                        Few tablespoons tequila
                        Vegetable oil
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro
  2          teaspoons  fresh lime juice
     1/4      teaspoon  dried ground green chile - (to 1/2) -- to taste
                        = (or green chile seasoning or minced
                        pickled jalapeÒo)
                        === TACOS ===
  12                    corn tortillas -- plus
                        a few extras in case of tears

Make The Marinade:  At least 1 hour ahead, or up to the night before you plan to grill prepare the marinade.  Combine the ingredients in a small bowl.  Place the chicken breasts in a zippered plastic bag and pour in the marinade.  Seal the bag, and toss back and forth to coat the chicken evenly.  Refrigerate.

Up to 1 hour ahead, place the lime sections on a plate, sprinkle them with the tequila, and rub lightly with oil.  Let sit at room temperature.

Make The Sauce:  Stir together the ingredients in a small bowl.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

Prepare The Tacos:  When ready to grill, drain the chicken and discard the marinade.  Let sit uncovered at room temperature for about 20 minutes.

Fire up the grill, bringing the heat to medium (4 to 5 seconds with the hand test).

Grill the chicken uncovered for 6 to 8 minutes total.  Turn onto each side twice, rotating the breasts each time to get crisscross grill marks.  The chicken is done when it is white throughout but still juicy.  Grill the limes alongside the chicken, turning them from time to time so that they soften and develop a bit of char.  Remove them as they are ready.  Warm the tortillas on the edge of the grill, then wrap in a dish towel or foil to keep warm.

Working quickly pull the chicken into thin shreds and pile it on a platter.  Surround with the limes, and set the bowl of sauce on the platter or alongside.  Place the wrapped tortillas in a basket.  Serve immediately, encouraging diners to fill and fold the tortillas, drizzle with sauce, squeeze on some of the warm tequila-spiked lime juice, and enjoy.

This recipe yields 4 or more servings.

Comments:  The corn flavor of fresh tortillas, a healthy dose of lime a dash of tequila, and a bit of chile ó chicken doesn't find better mates.  For these soft tacos, we pound the breasts fairly thin so that there are still plenty of crispy edges after we pull the grilled chicken into shreds.  Even without the zippy marinade, the general notion works well with any leftover grilled chicken.  The creamy lime sauce is a luxurious switch from salsa or hot sauce but for variety's sake, either could replace it on occasion.

  2                     green onions -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  1                     green pepper -- diced
  1                     yellow pepper -- diced
  1                     red pepper -- diced
  1                     pear -- diced
  1                     fresh mango -- peeled, diced
                        Fresh chopped coriander -- to taste

Prepare a marinade using the Tex-Mex oil, half the lime juice, salt and pepper.  Place the tuna in the marinade and let sit for at least 1 hour in the fridge.

Meanwhile, prepare the salsa.  Brown the onions and garlic in the reserved 2 tablespoons of the Tex-Mex oil.  Then, add the diced peppers, pear and mango.  Deglaze with the juice of the remainder of the lime juice and remove from the heat.  Sprinkle with the fresh coriander and season with salt and pepper.

Grill or fry the tuna, as desired, for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, until the fish is well grilled on the outside and still pink on the inside.

Arrange each tuna slice on a portion of salsa and trickle warm marinade over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is a perfect outdoor summer meal.  Just fire up the grill and go.  (Stuck inside?  A cast-iron grill pan works just as well.)  The Tex-Mex oil, a fine balance of heat and spice, delivers a welcomed punch to the tuna, which is nicely balanced by the fruit salsa.

         Veal Roast Stuffed With Spinach, Pancetta, And Frittata

Recipe By     :Micol Negrin

Categories    : Entree                          Main Dish
                Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  spinach leaves -- washed thoroughly
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     2/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  2                     extra-large eggs
  2             pounds  boneless veal loin -- butterflied, and
                        pounded thin with a mallet
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced Pancetta
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  chicken broth -- plus
                        extra if needed
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Cook the spinach in a covered 12-inch sautÈ pan over high heat for 5 minutes.  Remove from the pan, rinse, chop, and squeeze dry.  Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in the same pan over medium heat and add the spinach and 1/3 cup of the Parmigiano; cook 5 minutes.  Cool and drain off any liquid.

In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the remaining 1/3 cup of Parmigiano.  Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over a medium flame, add the eggs, and cook until set on both sides, about 2 minutes per side, turning once.  Remove this frittata to a plate.

Place the veal on a cutting board, smooth side down.  Top with the Pancetta, then with the frittata, cutting the frittata as needed to cover it, and finally with the sautÈed spinach.  Roll lengthwise into a bundle and tie with butcher's string.

Heat the olive oil and the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter in a 12-inch sautÈ pan over a medium-high flame.  Add the veal and sear until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes, turning to cook evenly.  Add the wine and cook 5 minutes.  Add the broth, salt, and pepper.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 1 hour, or until the veal is firm but not dry and lets out a clear juice when pierced, adding broth as needed.  Discard the string, slice thinly, and serve hot, with the pan juices.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Emilia-Romagna's meats are just as likely to be stuffed as its pastas.  Capon is filled with ground veal, pork, mortadella, prosciutto, chicken livers, pistachios, and Parmigiano; Cotechino sausage is wrapped in beef and prosciutto; and veal loin in Reggio Emilia is butterflied and rolled around spinach, pancetta, and frittata, as above.  If you prefer, you can substitute prosciutto di Parma for the pancetta and Swiss chard for the spinach.  While the veal is not roasted ó it is cooked in a covered pan ó the result is a browned, moist loin.

Preparation Tips:  Stuff the veal up to 12 hours ahead and refrigerate.

               Veal Shanks With Olives, Anchovies, And Sage

Categories    : Entree                          Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              small  to medium veal shanks, 2"-thk center-cut
                        pieces - (2 1/2 to 3 lbs total)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  flour
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  6                     anchovy fillets -- chopped
  1                     garlic head -- cut in half and
                        excess paper removed
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1                cup  canned diced tomatoes -- drained
  1                cup  pitted and chopped Kalamata olives
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh sage

Adjust an oven rack to the center position and heat the oven to 250 degrees.

Tie a string around the circumference of each shank (or have the butcher do it for you).  Season shanks with salt and pepper.

Heat the butter and olive oil in a 12-inch-wide Dutch oven or sautÈ pan with a lid over medium-high heat.  When the butter-oil mixture is very hot but not smoking, lightly flour the seasoned shanks and then add them to the pot.  SautÈ for 4 minutes per side, shaking the pan occasionally to stop the shanks from sticking.  The shanks should be golden brown on each side.

Remove the shanks from the pot and reserve on a plate.  Add the onion and anchovies to the pot, stir, and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic, wine, chicken stock, tomatoes, and 3/4 cup of the olives along with the veal shanks and bring the mixture to a boil.  Cover and place in the oven.

Cook for 2 to 4 hours or until the meat falls off the bone and is very tender.  Remove the garlic head and squeeze out the contents, adding the cooked garlic back to the liquid.  (Cooking time will depend on the size of the shanks, your oven, and your pot.  You can make the recipe to this point, refrigerate, and reheat later for serving.)

Place the pot on the stove and bring the liquid to a simmer.  Add the sage and the remaining 1/4 cup olives.  Cook, uncovered, for 4 minutes.  Adjust the seasonings, adding salt and pepper to taste.  Transfer one shank to each plate and spoon the sauce over the shanks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Be sure to cook the shanks long enough ó the meat should be falling off the bone, and the internal temperature should reach at least 200 degrees.  This dish can be made earlier in the day and then reheated on top of the stove over low heat (about 15 minutes).  If you refrigerate this dish before reheating, any fat will solidify and come to the surface, where it is easy to remove.  I like to serve this dish with polenta.

                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  Shao-Hsing rice wine
                        = (or dry sherry)
     1/2      teaspoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  lean baby back pork spareribs -- cut into single ribs
     1/3           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
     1/3           cup  Chinkiang or balsamic vinegar
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  lime juice
  1           teaspoon  lime zest -- (optional)

In a large bowl, combine 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, the sugar, cornstarch, rice wine, soy sauce, and the 1/2 teaspoon oil.  Add the spareribs and combine.  Marinate 1 hour.  Pat dry completely with paper towels.

Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok over high heat until a bead of water vaporizes within 1 to 2 seconds of contact.  Swirl in the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and add the spareribs, meat-side down, spreading them in the wok.  Reduce the heat to medium and pan-fry undisturbed 5 minutes, letting the spareribs brown.  Then, using a spatula, turn the spareribs over and pan-fry an additional 2 minutes.

Add the brown sugar, vinegar, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt with 1/3 cup water to the wok and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Turn the ribs meat-side down.  Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the meat is tender.  Add the butter and lime juice and stir to combine.  Garnish with lime zest if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings as part of a multi-course meal.

Comments:  Walter Kei of Hong Kong likes to flour these spareribs and then deep-fry them, but I prefer pan-frying and then braising them.  Kei finishes the sauce with lime juice and butter; this twist reflects the innovative style of Hong Kong cooks.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Fish (Fresh Water)
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LENTILS ===
  1                cup  green lentils
                        = (preferably du Puy)
  2             slices  bacon -- diced small
  4                     thyme sprigs
     1/2        medium  onion -- diced small
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1             medium  carrot -- diced small
  1                     celery stalk -- diced small
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === SALAD ===
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
     1/2         pound  asparagus -- stems trimmed,
                        ends peeled, and cut into 2" pieces
  1                cup  cooked lentils -- (above)
  8                     skin-on trout fillets
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  walnuts
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar -- plus
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1              pound  baby spinach -- well rinsed,
                        and spun dry

Make The Lentils:  Rinse the lentils in cold water and place in a medium saucepan.  Cover with 4 cups of cold water, bring to a gentle simmer, and cook for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, place the bacon and thyme in a small saucepan over a medium flame.  When some of the fat has rendered from the bacon, about 2 minutes, add the onion, garlic, and salt, and cook for about 5 minutes, until the onion is translucent.  Add the butter, carrot, celery, white pepper, and 1 cup of water.  Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.  Drain the lentils and return them to their saucepan.  Add the bacon-vegetable mixture and simmer lightly for 7 to 10 minutes, until the lentils are very tender.

Make The Salad:  In a small bowl, whisk together the honey and mustard to form a glaze.  Set aside.

Prepare an ice-water bath in a large bowl and bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.  Blanch the asparagus until tender, 6 minutes.  Drain and refresh them in the ice water to preserve their color.  Drain again and set aside.  Heat the lentils over a low flame and keep warm.

Spray a grill or grill pan with nonstick spray and preheat until it's very hot (if using a grill pan, heat for at least 4 minutes).  Dry the fillets and season the flesh sides with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper, then brush both sides with the olive oil.  Place the fish, skin-side down, on the grill and cook for 4 minutes.  Flip the fish and brush the skin side with the reserved honey-mustard glaze.  Continue to cook for 2 minutes.  Hold the cooked trout aside.

Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a large sautÈ pan over medium heat.  Add the walnuts and toast for about 3 minutes, shaking the pan often to prevent burning.  Season the nuts with 1/4 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper, and 3 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar.

Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the vinegar has reduced to a thick syrup that coats the nuts.  Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and stir for an additional minute.  Turn the flame down to low and add the asparagus.  In a small saucepan, bring the remaining 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar to a boil.  Cook for about 3 minutes, until it has reduced down to 2 tablespoons.  Turn the flame off under the asparagus-walnut mixture and add the baby spinach along with a drizzle of the balsamic glaze.  Gently toss to combine, and allow the heat of the pan to wilt the spinach.

Plate the salad by creating a small bed of the spinach-asparagus mixture in the center of the plate, surrounded by 3 dollops of warm lentils.  Place 2 trout fillets, skin-side up, on top of the spinach mixture.  Drizzle with the balsamic glaze.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Served at lunch, dinner or late-night, this well-rounded salad has been a favorite since the day we opened.

                        Wasabi Pea-Crusted Salmon

Recipe By     :Andrea Immer
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Entree                          Fish (Ocean)
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon fillets, 1" thick - (6 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
                        more for brushing fillets
     1/2           cup  wasabi-crusted peas
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Brush both the skin and flesh sides of the salmon fillets with olive oil.  Whirl the wasabi peas in a blender until they are the consistency of bread crumbs, and spread them on a plate.  Dip the flesh side of each salmon fillet into the peas, pressing gently so that the surface is evenly coated with the wasabi crumbs.  Set aside and continue with the remaining fillets.

In a large, flat-bottomed nonstick skillet, heat the butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil on medium.  Place the fillets pea-side down in the skillet and cook until the pea crust becomes crisp and starts to brown lightly, about 4 minutes.  Lift the edge of each fillet carefully to check the browning, and lower the heat if necessary to prevent burning.

Turn the fillets and continue to cook until the fillets are medium-rare, about 4 minutes.  Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain briefly, and then serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is another drop-dead-delicious, gorgeous dish that's easy, easy, easy.  It used to be that you could only get wasabi peas (an addictive snack!) in Chinatown.  Now they are in just about every supermarket produce section (near the nuts, dried fruits, and trail mixes).

The blender-crushed peas form an amazing crunchy crust for salmon fillets that's wildly flavorful and beautiful: pink salmon, green pea crust, rose Champagne...awesome.

                        peeled, and halved, green germs removed
                        Grated zest of 1 orange
  2                     ripe tomatoes -- cored, peeled,
                        seeded, and chopped
  2            bottles  white wine
                        = (while a white Chateauneuf-du-Pape is
                        traditional here, any drinkable white
                        without too much oak will work)
  1                     bouquet garni
                        = (large bunch of fresh parsley and
                        several fresh bay leaves, securely
                        fastened with cotton twine or in a wire
                        mesh ball)
     1/2      teaspoon  black peppercorns
  3        tablespoons  coarse sea salt
  8             ounces  imported Italian penne
                        Several tablespoons freshly-grated
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

In a large shallow bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, eau-de-vie, beef, salt, and pepper.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Set aside to marinate at room temperature for 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

In the casserole, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the onions, carrots, mushrooms, garlic, orange zest, and salt to taste.  Reduce the heat to low, and sweat ó cook, covered, over low heat until the onions and garlic are soft but not browned ó for about 5 minutes.  Add the beef and marinade to the casserole, then add the tomatoes, white wine, bouquet garni, and peppercorns.  Cover.  Place in the center of the oven and cook until the meat is ultra-tender, 3 to 4 hours.  Check from time to time to make sure the liquid is at a very gentle simmer.  Do not allow it to boil or the meat will become tough.  (There is no need to baste, for the fats and wine will automatically baste the meat.)  At serving time, taste for seasoning.  Remove and discard the bouquet garni.

Meanwhile, in the pasta pot, bring about 5 quarts of water to a rolling boil over high heat.  Add the 3 tablespoons coarse sea salt and the pasta, stirring to prevent the pasta from sticking.  Cook until tender but firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.  Remove the pasta pot from the heat.  Remove the colander and drain over a sink, shaking to remove excess water.  Place the pasta in a large bowl, sprinkle with the cheese, and toss to evenly coat the pasta.  Transfer the pasta to individual warmed shallow soup bowls.  Arrange several pieces of meat on top of the pasta, spooning several tablespoons of sauce over the meat.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a "quick" variation on the traditional Provencal beef daube, where the meat is generally marinated in red wine for up to several days.  Here, in a traditional beef stew from the city of Avignon, the beef is quickly marinated in white wine for just a few hours.  The result is a stew that is ideal for summer, a bit less hearty but just as delicious as its red wine big brother.

Equipment:  A large heavy-duty casserole with a lid; a 6-quart pasta pot fitted with a colander.
