  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     shallots -- minced
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
  1                     scallion -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed dried red pepper flakes
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  roasted sesame oil or peanut oil

Combine all ingredients except sesame or peanut oil in a small saucepan, bring to a boil, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Let sit for 10 minutes.  Strain into a small bowl.  Add sesame or peanut oil.

This recipe yields about 1/2 cup.

Comments:  This makes a good sauce for chicken, turkey or game hens.  Brush over grilled or roasted poultry just before serving.  Roasted (or toasted) sesame oil has a lot of flavor.  (Do not use regular, unroasted sesame oil.)  It can be found at Asian markets or at health food stores.

Comments:  This makes a good sauce for chicken, turkey or game hens.  Brush over grilled or roasted poultry just before serving.  Roasted (or toasted) sesame oil has a lot of flavor.  (Do not use regular, unroasted sesame oil.)  It can be found at Asian markets or at health food stores.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     slab pork ribs - (abt 3 lbs)
  1                     slab pork spareribs - (abt 3 lbs)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2               cups  pure cane syrup
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  water

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     boneless chicken breasts
  1              bunch  fresh chives
                        Cooking oil -- as needed
                        === CAJUN DRY RUB ===
  2        tablespoons  chile powder
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar - (packed)
                        === CAJUN HERB SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3                     ripe tomatoes
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  dry vermouth
  2        tablespoons  oyster sauce
  2        tablespoons  Louisiana hot sauce
                        = (or your favorite chile sauce)
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh oregano leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves

Rinse the chicken, pat dry, cover and refrigerate.  Chop the chives and set aside.  Set aside the oil if grilling.

Combine all the dry rub ingredients.  Rub the chicken with the dry rub on both sides, cover and refrigerate.

Cut each tomato into 3 equal slices; place 4 inches below the heat source of a preheated broiler and broil until brown on both sides, or grill the tomatoes.  Chop the tomatoes.

In a small bowl, combine the tomatoes with the remaining sauce ingredients and refrigerate.  All advance preparation may be completed up to 8 hours before you begin the final steps.

Just before cooking, remove the chicken from the refrigerator.

To Grill:  If using a gas or electric grill, preheat to medium (350 degrees).  If using charcoal or wood, prepare a fire.  When the gas or electric grill is preheated or the coals or wood are ash-covered, brush the cooking rack with the oil.  Lay the chicken, skin-side down, in the center of the rack.  Regulate the heat so that it remains at a medium temperature.  Grill the chicken for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  The chicken is done when it just loses its pink interior color (cut into a piece).

To Smoke:  Bring chicken to room temperature, about 30 minutes.  Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200 to 220 degrees.  Transfer the chickens to the smoker and cook for about 30 minutes.  The chicken is done when the meat feels firm and just loses its pink interior color.

To Serve:  When the chicken is nearly done, place a small saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the butter and garlic.  When the garlic begins to sizzle, add the remaining sauce ingredients.  Bring to a rapid boil and cook until it thickens enough to lightly coat a spoon, about 3 minutes.

Transfer the chicken to a heated serving platter or heated dinner plates.  Spoon the sauce over the chicken, sprinkle with the chives, and serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :n/a

Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Meatballs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground beef
     1/4           cup  dry bread crumbs
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
     3/4      teaspoon  garlic salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Heavy-duty aluminum foil, as needed
  2             medium  zucchini -- halved lengthwise,
                        then cut crosswise into 1/2" slices
  2               cups  prepared spaghetti sauce
                        Grated Parmesan cheese -- as needed
                        Garlic bread sticks -- (optional)

In medium bowl, combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, 1/4 cup water, garlic salt and pepper, mixing lightly but thoroughly.  Shape into 24 (approx 1 1/4-inch) meatballs.

Cut four 18- by 12-inch long sheets heavy duty aluminum foil.  Place equal amounts of meatballs and zucchini in center of each; top each with 1/3 cup spaghetti sauce.  Bring shorter edges of foil together over the center; fold down loosely to seal, allowing room for heat expansion and circulation.  Fold in open ends to seal.

Place packets on grid over medium ash-covered coals.  Grill, uncovered, 16 to 18 minutes or until meatball centers are no longer pink and zucchini is tender, turning packets over once.

To serve, carefully unfold ends and tops of packets; sprinkle cheese over meatballs.  Serve with garlic bread sticks, dipping into sauce, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Cooks Tip:  To check the temperature of the coals, cautiously hold your hand palm-side down, at cooking height (just above the grid).  Count the number of seconds you can hold your hand in that position before the heat is uncomfortable and you have to pull it away; 4 seconds for medium coals.

  1                cup  dark rum
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  brown sugar - (to 2/3)

                 Eggplant Sandwich With Tomatoes And Feta

Categories    : Grilling                        Sandwiches
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Cooking spray -- as needed
  1         tablespoon  Caesar salad dressing
  1              small  eggplant
  4                     wheat Kaiser rolls -- split
     1/4           cup  plain nonfat yogurt
  1              large  tomato -- cut 8 thin slices
     1/2        medium  red onion -- cut 4 thin slices
  8                     finely-chopped basil leaves
  2             ounces  feta cheese -- crumbled
  4                     romaine lettuce leaves

Preheat the grill.  Coat a grill rack with cooking spray and place on the grill.

Cut eggplant into 16 thin slices.  Drizzle or lightly brush the Caesar salad dressing over one side of each eggplant slice.  Arrange the slices, dressing-side up, on the grill rack.  Grill just until lightly browned on the bottom, juicy on the top and tender, about 15 minutes.

Arrange the rolls, cut-sides down, on the grill; toast for 3 minutes.  Using a spatula or tongs, remove to a platter.

Spread the yogurt on the cut sides of the rolls.  Layer the eggplant, tomatoes, onions, basil and feta cheese on half of the roll, starting and ending with the eggplant.  Top with the lettuce and remaining roll.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The eggplant may be peeled or left unpeeled, as desired.  Some cooks prefer the skin left on; others find it has a bitter taste.  Judging when eggplant slices are done is tricky, so test early; if undercooked, they can always be returned to the grill for a few more minutes.

Preheat the grill.  Coat a grill rack with cooking spray and place on the grill.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut eggplant into 16 thin slices.  Drizzle or lightly brush the Caesar salad dressing over one side of each eggplant slice.  Arrange the slices, dressing-side up, on the grill rack.  Grill just until lightly browned on the bottom, juicy on the top and tender, about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the rolls, cut-sides down, on the grill; toast for 3 minutes.  Using a spatula or tongs, remove to a platter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the yogurt on the cut sides of the rolls.  Layer the eggplant, tomatoes, onions, basil and feta cheese on half of the roll, starting and ending with the eggplant.  Top with the lettuce and remaining roll.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The eggplant may be peeled or left unpeeled, as desired.  Some cooks prefer the skin left on; others find it has a bitter taste.  Judging when eggplant slices are done is tricky, so test early; if undercooked, they can always be returned to the grill for a few more minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     slabs baby back ribs
                        === MARINADE ===
  2               cups  soy sauce
  1                cup  sherry
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  chopped scallions
     1/4           cup  toasted sesame oil
     1/4           cup  fresh grated ginger
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh garlic
  2        tablespoons  crushed red pepper

Combine all of the marinade ingredients and pour over the ribs, reserving 1/2 cup for basting, 1/2 cup for serving.  Marinate the ribs covered in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.

When ready to grill, remove the ribs from the marinade, discard and wipe off excess.  Grill ribs until all sides are nicely browned, basting with 1/2 cup of the reserved marinade occasionally.  Cook approximately 60 minutes.  Check for doneness.  Serve with reserved serving sauce, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 portions for main entree, 6 portions for appetizer.

Comments:  "Bul-go-gi" is probably the most popular meat dish in Korean cuisine.  It is made with thin slices of beef sirloin that have been marinated in soy sauce, onions, garlic and lots of ginger and chilies and then grilled quickly at the table.  Recipe adapted from this traditional Korean favorite.

Comments:  &quot;Bul-go-gi&quot; is probably the most popular meat dish in Korean cuisine.  It is made with thin slices of beef sirloin that have been marinated in soy sauce, onions, garlic and lots of ginger and chilies and then grilled quickly at the table.  Recipe adapted from this traditional Korean favorite.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BLACK BEAN SALAD ===
  2               cups  drained canned black beans
  16            ounces  canned corn -- drained
     1/2           cup  chopped parsley
     1/2           cup  fresh lime luice
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  diced red onion
     1/2           cup  diced green onion
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
  4              large  tomatoes -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  8                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
                        === PEACH CHUTNEY ===
  2               cups  chopped fresh or frozen peeled peaches
     1/2           cup  minced yellow onion
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled ginger -- plus
  1           teaspoon  minced peeled ginger
     1/2           cup  finely-diced red pepper
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
     1/2           cup  white sugar
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar

To make the Black Bean and Corn Salad:  Mix all the ingredients in a large bowl, except for the tomatoes.  Mix together gently.  Add the tomatoes and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate until cold.

To make the Peach Chutney:  Place all of the ingredients in a heavy pot over medium heat and stir well to combine.  Bring to a boil, stirring, and simmer for 25 minutes or until the chutney begins to thicken slightly and is syrupy.  Remove the pan from the heat and let the chutney cool.  Use at once or store covered in the refrigerator.  The chutney will keep 2 to 3 weeks under refrigeration.

Marinade:  Prepare the marinade by combining all of the marinade ingredients together in a small bowl.

Chicken:  Flatten the chicken breasts slightly with the flat side of a heavy knife.  Add the chicken breasts to the marinade and toss to coat.  Cover and chill in the refrigerator for one hour.

Prepare the barbecue grill with medium hot coals.  Grill the chicken breasts, about 3 inches from the heat, until cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.  Remove from the grill and slice the chicken breasts into a fan pattern to lay over the salad.

To Serve:  Spoon the Black Bean and Corn Salad evenly in the center of four dinner plates and top each serving with two chicken breasts.  Sprinkle with the chopped cilantro and dollop with the peach chutney, if desired.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Grilled Ginger Spiced Chicken With Peaches

                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  coriander seed
  1         tablespoon  white peppercorns
  4              whole  star anise
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  fresh gingerroot -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  4              large  boneless chicken breast halves
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into thin slices
  2             medium  ripe peaches
  1                cup  cilantro leaves -- whole
     1/4           cup  mint leaves -- whole
  2                     scallions -- cut thin slices

Prepare the grill.  Using a spice mill or mortar and pestle crush the coriander, peppercorns, and star anise into a coarse powder.  Season the chicken with the salt and then sprinkle evenly with the ginger.  Thoroughly coat the chicken with the ground spice blend.

Remove the peach pits by cutting the peach into quarters around the pit, and then prying the flesh away from the pit.  Cut each quarter into short 1/4-inch thick slices.

Grill the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes on each side until nicely charred.  Check for doneness by cutting into the thickest breast to see if it is white all the way through.  Remove the breasts from the grill and set them aside to cool.  Cut each of the chicken breasts into 5 or 6 slices.

In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, water, sugar, oil, and soy.  Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.  In a large bowl, combine the bell pepper, peaches, cilantro, mint and scallion.  Pour just enough soy dressing over the salad ingredients to moisten (you will have some dressing left over).  Toss gently to coat.

Place a portion of salad onto each plate and arrange a sliced chicken breast alongside.  Spoon additional dressing around the chicken before serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  leeks -- trimmed
  6              large  peppers -- assorted colors
                        Salt -- as needed
  1              pound  large mushrooms
     1/2           cup  olive or salad oil
     1/4           cup  tarragon vinegar
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh oregano

                        Fresh oregano sprigs -- for garnish

Cut leeks lengthwise in half to within 2 inches of root ends.  Separate leaves slightly; rinse leeks with running cold water to wash away sand and grit.  Cut each pepper lengthwise in half; discard seeds.

Bring 2 inches of water in an 8-quart saucepan to boil over high heat.  Add leeks and 2 teaspoons salt; return to boiling.  Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 5 to 10 minutes until leeks are tender.  Drain, reserving water in pan, and remove leeks to a large roasting pan.

Add peppers to saucepan; over high heat, heat to boiling.  Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 5 to 10 minutes until tender-crisp; drain and add to leeks in roasting pan.

To the peppers and leeks, add mushrooms, olive oil, vinegar, oregano, sugar, pepper and 1 teaspoon salt.  Cover; refrigerate at least 2 hours, turning vegetables occasionally.

About 45 minutes before serving, prepare outdoor grill for barbecuing.  Place vegetables on grill over low heat, reserving marinade.  Grill 10 minutes or until heated through, turning vegetables occasionally and brushing with marinade.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  nectarines -- pitted, halved
  1              bunch  fresh mint
     1/4         pound  Smithfield ham -- cut into 8
  1                     thin slices

Wash and dry mint.  Place 2 leaves inside each nectarine half, then wrap 1 strip of ham around each.  Secure with a toothpick.

Grill 1 minute on each side, about 4 to 6 inches away from the heat source.  Serve hot as an hors d'oeuvre, or in place of salad.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Smithfield ham is a variety that's made only in Virginia and has been dry-cured and aged for around six months.  It's available at Dean & Deluca, 560 Broadway, (212) 431-1691.

Tasso ham, a lean cured pork product with a Cajun flavor, is a good substitute.

Comments:  Smithfield ham is a variety that&apos;s made only in Virginia and has been dry-cured and aged for around six months.  It&apos;s available at Dean &amp; Deluca, 560 Broadway, (212) 431-1691.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tasso ham, a lean cured pork product with a Cajun flavor, is a good substitute.

                          Grilled Orange Salmon

Recipe By     :Bob Bowersox
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3        bottle  hickory BBQ sauce
     1/2           cup  frozen orange juice concentrate
                        = (no water added)
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
  4          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh ginger
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar - (to 2)
  2          teaspoons  hot sesame oil
  2             pounds  salmon fillet or steaks

In a blender, combine the barbecue sauce, orange juice concentrate, soy sauce, mustard, sherry, ginger, garlic, vinegar, brown sugar and sesame oil.  Liquify or puree until a smooth liquid is formed.

Place the salmon in an oblong baking dish and pour the marinade over the top (you can also use your Cajun Injector to inject the salmon with some of the marinade, if you so desire).  Let stand for about 1 hour.

Preheat the grill to medium-high.  Gently lift the salmon from the marinade and place on the grill rack.  Cover and grill, turning the steaks 2 to 3 times (baste after each time that you turn them).  The salmon is done when it is starting to flake easily, and is well-glazed and lightly brown.  Medium should take you about 9 to 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === APRICOT GLAZE ===
  6        tablespoons  apricot preserves
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  rum
  3        tablespoons  prepared Dijon mustard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE PORK ===
  1                     pork tenderloin - (12 oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     firm apricots -- halved, pitted

Apricot Glaze:  Combine all ingredients in saucepan.  Simmer over low heat until preserves melt and mixture blends together, about 3 minutes.  (Makes about 3/4 cup)

For the Pork:  Preheat grill.  Oil grill rack.  Season pork with salt and pepper to taste.

Place pork on grill and grill 10 minutes.  Brush generously with Apricot Glaze.  Place apricots, cut-side up, on grill.  Brush with glaze.  Grill pork, brushing occasionally with glaze, 15 minutes longer until meat is no longer red-pink in center.  Apricots should be soft, but not mushy.  If necessary, remove fruit from grill before pork is done.

To serve, cut pork into 1/2-inch-thick slices and arrange on platter with apricots.  Serve any remaining sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  If desired, pork can be cooked in oven at 450 degrees 25 to 30 minutes.  Place tenderloin in shallow roasting pan and cook 10 minutes.  Baste with glaze, add apricots and continue cooking 15 to 20 minutes longer.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh salmon filets -- skin on
                        Olive oil -- for grilling
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black peper -- to taste
  1                cup  finely-diced celery
     1/2           cup  finely-diced red onion
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh dill
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained
  2        tablespoons  raspberry vinegar
  2        tablespoons  good olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Dill sprigs -- (optional), garnish

Prepare grill with hot coals.

Cut salmon crosswise into 4-inch wide slices.  Rub salmon fillet slices with olive oil and sprinkle with Kosher salt and black pepper.  Brush cooking surface with oil to prevent fish from sticking.

Grill fillets 5 to 7 minutes on each side, until rare.  Do not overcook.  Remove to a plate, wrap with plastic, and chill in refrigerator until cold and very firm.

Remove any skin on fillets that didn't come off during grilling.  Break fillets into very large flakes and place in a bowl, adding any juice at bottom of plate.

Add celery, red onions, dill, capers, raspberry vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper to taste.  Mix well, garnish with dill sprigs, if using, and serve cold or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     red bell pepper
  1                     yellow bell pepper
  8                     thick asparagus spears
  1                     yellow squash
  1                     zucchini
  2                     portobello mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/2           cup  fat-free chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed dried thyme
  2                     branches rosemary
  2                     garlic cloves -- halved
  6             slices  French bread -- sliced 1/2" thick

To prepare vegetables, core and seed peppers.  Cut into 1 1/2- to 2-inch squares.  Snap tough ends off asparagus and cut each spear in half.  Slice squash and zucchini in half lengthwise.  Then cut each length in 4 pieces to get 8 pieces from each squash.  Trim and discard stem ends of mushrooms.  Slice mushrooms 1 inch thick.

In a large bowl, stir together vinegar, chicken broth, olive oil, soy sauce, pepper and thyme.  Add vegetables and stir to coat.  Set aside while heating grill.

Heat grill to high.  Soak rosemary branches in cold water for 10 minutes, then add to coals.  Drain vegetables, reserving vinaigrette.  Carefully place vegetables on grid over hot coals.  Grill vegetables until tender and nicely browned, about 2 minutes on each side.

Remove vegetables as they are done and arrange on a platter.  Spoon on reserved vinaigrette.  As soon as there's space on the grill, rub garlic on bread.  Add bread to grill and toast until brown, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                           Guide To Marinating

Recipe By     :n/a

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        HOW MUCH MARINADE IS ENOUGH?

   A marinade is a liquid used to impart flavors and/or tenderness to meat.  Marinades contain acid in the form of vinegar, citrus juice, tomatoes, wine or beer.

    Marinades usually donít penetrate more than a half-inch into food.  Thinner cuts of meats tend to be more flavorful when you use a marinade.  The longer the time you marinate the meat, the stronger the flavor on the outer portion of the meat.

     § Chicken pieces:  For 2 1/2 to 3 pounds, use 1/2 to 3/4 cup marinade.

     § Boneless steak:  For 1 1/2 to 2 pounds, use 3/4 to 1 cup marinade.

     § Chops:  Use 3/4 to 1 cup marinade for 4 chops.

     § Meat chunks:  For 1 to 1 1/2 pounds, use 3/4 to 1 cup marinade.

     § Shrimp:  For 1 pound large peeled shrimp, use 1/2 to 2/3 cups marinade.

     § Swordfish or tuna steaks:  For 4 steaks, use 1/4 to 1/2 cup marinade.

     § Fresh vegetables:  For 1 1/2 pounds of assorted vegetables, use 1/2 to 3/4 cup marinade.

     SAFETY TIPS

   When using liquid marinades remember the following for good health and good cooking:

     § Always marinate in the refrigerator, never at room temperature.

     § Always use glass or stainless steel if you use a casserole or baking dish for marinating.

     § If you are going to use leftover marinade, boil it for at least one minute because it contains raw meat juices.

     § Allow at least five minutes of cooking if you brush the marinade on the meat because the marinade contains raw meat juices and needs to cook.

     § Donít place the cooked meat in the same dish as the raw meat and marinade.

     § Marinades are for one-time use only.  Do not save!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  fresh rosemary leaves - (loosely packed)
     1/4           cup  fresh sage leaves - (loosely packed)
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
     1/3           cup  dry bread crumbs
  6                     lamb loin chops - (8 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Sea salt -- to taste

Mince together the herbs and place them in a shallow bowl.  Add the bread crumbs and a good pinch of salt and toss together so they are thoroughly blended with the herbs.

Brush the lamb chops on both sides with oil and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Using half the herb mixture, press an equal amount onto one side of the lamb chops.  Turn the chops and press the remaining herb mixture on the other side of the chops.

Grill the lamb chops until they are golden and slightly crisp on one side, about 4 minutes.  Turn, and repeat on the other side.  The amount of time you grill the chops will depend on how rare you like them.

After 4 minutes per side, they are usually done all the way through, but still moist and juicy.  For rare lamb chops, reduce the cooking time by 1 minute per side.  Remove from grill and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Susan Hermann Loomis is an authority on farmhouse cooking as the author of the "French Farmhouse Cookbook" and the new "Italian Farmhouse Cookbook".  These lamb chops are simply crusted with Italy's favorite herbs and grilled to perfection.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     day-old French or Italian bread baguette
  1              pound  semi-firm mozzarella cheese
  6                     firm ripe plum tomatoes
  1              bunch  fresh basil
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  2             ounces  anchovies -- drained, and
                        finely minced

Slice baguette into 16 (1/2-inch-thick) rounds and mozzarella into 12 (1/2-inch-thick) slices.  Halve tomatoes lengthwise.  Separate basil leaves from stems, setting aside the largest leaves for use.

To make kabobs, on each of four 12-inch metal skewers, thread one slice bread, followed by a basil leaf, mozzarella slice, another basil leaf, tomato half and then repeat the process, starting with the bread.

The ingredients should be pressed quite firmly together and each kabob should have 4 slices bread, 6 basil leaves, 3 slices mozzarella and 3 tomato halves.  Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil over each skewer and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Heat butter and remaining oil in a small skillet over medium heat.  When butter is melted, add garlic and sautÈ until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add anchovies and sautÈ 1 minute more.  Keep warm over very low heat.

Meanwhile, place kabobs in the center of the cooking grate and grill about 3 minutes per side to toast the bread and gently melt (but not dissolve) the cheese.  Place kabobs on serving plates and drizzle generously with warm anchovy butter.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  diced onions
  1                cup  diced red bell pepper
     1/2           cup  tomato puree
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  pineapple juice
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  chopped jalapeÒo chile
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Heat oil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onions and bell pepper; cook 5 to 7 minutes until tender.

Add remaining ingredients; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium; cover and cook 10 minutes.  Uncover; simmer 20 to 25 minutes more until vegetables soften.  Puree in blender.

                          Mambo Chicken Burgers

Recipe By     :Bob Blumer
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Poultry                         Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  boneless skinless chicken breasts
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (2" long) -- peeled, grated
  3        tablespoons  tamari or soy sauce
  3          teaspoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  toasted sesame oil -- (optional)
  4                     sesame seed hamburger buns
  4        tablespoons  mango chutney jam

Rinse chicken thoroughly under cold running water.  Pat dry.

In a large bowl, combine the garlic, ginger, tamari, lime and (optional) sesame oil.  Add chicken breasts and toss with the marinade.  Make sure the chicken is submerged in the marinade.  Cover and marinate for 2 to 4 hours in the refrigerator.

Grill chicken breasts for 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until cooked throughout.  Avoid overcooking.

While chicken is cooking, toast the buns on the grill for 1 to 2 minutes.  Serve the chicken "burgers" on the toasted buns and top each with a tablespoon of mango chutney.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Cookbook author Bob Blumer is known to most as "The Surreal Gourmet".  A graphic artist by training, his love of food and culinary adventure changed his professional course.  These Mambo Chicken Burgers are typical of his fun, inventive approach to entertaining and food.

Note:  When shopping for boneless chicken breasts, choose the plumpest breasts possible, as these tend to remain moister.  Make a small incision to see whether the chicken is cooked throughout.  If any pink remains, return it to the grill.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  cider vinegar
     1/3           cup  ketchup
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  molasses
  2          teaspoons  Pickapeppa sauce
                        = (or tspns vegetarian
                        Worcestershire-style sauce)
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, minced
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
                        Few drops liquid smoke
  2        tablespoons  miso (preferably red)

In a medium saucepan, whisk together the cider vinegar, ketchup, tomato paste, brown sugar, molasses, Pickapeppa sauce, garlic, ginger and liquid smoke.  Bring to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes, whisking continuously.  Remove from the heat and let the sauce cool slightly.

Comments:  Look for Pickapeppa sauce in the condiment aisle of grocery stores.  Miso, a fermented soybean paste also called bean paste, can be found at health food stores, Asian and specialty markets and some supermarkets.  Look for it in the produce or refrigerated sections.

Comments:  Look for Pickapeppa sauce in the condiment aisle of grocery stores.  Miso, a fermented soybean paste also called bean paste, can be found at health food stores, Asian and specialty markets and some supermarkets.  Look for it in the produce or refrigerated sections.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lamb racks - (1 1/2 to 2 lbs ea)
                        Oil -- for brushing grate
                        === MARINADE ===
  1              small  yellow onion
  6              large  garlic cloves -- crushed
  4                     plum tomatoes -- roughly chopped
     1/2           cup  fresh parsley
     1/2           cup  rosemary
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1                cup  dry red wine
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === WHITE BEANS ===
  1                cup  dried cannellini beans
  4               cups  chicken broth
  1              small  yellow onion -- quartered
  1                     carrot -- cut 2" pieces
  1                     celery stalk -- cut 2" pieces
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  1                cup  fresh tomatoin 1/2" dice
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced black or green olives

To make the Marinade:  In a food processor, combine the onion, garlic, tomatoes, parsley, rosemary, mustard, red wine, salt and pepper.  Process until pureed, then pour into a large bowl.

Trim any excess fat from the lamb and "french" the racks (cut the meat away from the ends of the ribs).  Add the lamb to the bowl, turn to coat, cover and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours.

To make the White Beans:  In a large saucepan over high heat, combine the beans and 4 cups water and bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat, cover, and let rest for 1 hour.

Drain and rinse the beans, then return them to the saucepan with the chicken broth, onion, carrot, celery and oregano.  Season with pepper to taste.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and cook until the beans are tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

During the last 10 minutes of cooking, season with salt to taste.  Remove and discard the onion, carrot and celery.  Drain the beans and transfer them to a medium bowl.  Add the olive oil, vinegar, parsley, tomato and olives.  Mix well.  Taste for seasonings.  Serve the white bean salad at room temperature.

Remove the lamb from the marinade.  Cover the bones with aluminum foil to prevent them from burning.  Lightly brush the cooking grate with vegetable oil.  Grill the lamb directly over medium heat, turning once.  The lamb will take 20 to 30 minutes to reach medium-rare.  Let the lamb rest for 5 minutes before cutting it into chops.  Serve warm with the white beans.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  dry Sherry
     1/4           cup  turbindo or palm sugar
     1/2         pound  rhubarb -- trimmed, and
                        cut on the bias
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              pound  sweet onions -- thickly sliced
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  1              sprig  thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  fava beans -- shelled
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
  4                     skin-on salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice

In a saucepan, combine the sherry and sugar and cook until dissolved.  Add rhubarb and cook until tender, about 1 minute.  Strain liquid, and boil it until reduced to 1 cup.

Melt the butter in a saucepan.  Add onions and cook slowly until soft, about 15 minutes.  Add stock, thyme, salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer about 8 minutes.

Boil the fava beans in salted water for 2 minutes, until tender, then rinse under running water.  Add to onions.

Lightly oil salmon fillets, season, and grill over medium-hot fire, skin-side down, until skin is crisp, about 4 minutes.  Turn, and grill until barely cooked through, about 4 minutes more depending on thickness.

To serve, rewarm the onions; add the lemon juice and season to taste.  Bring the sherry-rhubarb liquid to a boil, add the cooked rhubarb and cook until hot.  Spoon rhubarb onto 4 plates and top with onions.  Top with salmon and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  medium shrimp -- cleaned, deveined
  1              pound  asparagus spears -- trimmed
     1/4           cup  butter -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  snipped fresh dill
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             medium  leek -- thinly sliced
                        Hot cooked rice -- for serving

Rinse the shrimp and pat dry.  Cut the asparagus on the diagonal into 2-inch pieces.  In a bowl, combine the butter, dill, wine, lemon peel, salt and pepper.

Have ready a 36- by 18-inch piece of foil.  Fold it to make an 18-inch square.  In the center of the foil, place the shrimp, asparagus and leek.  Top with the butter mixture.  Bring up the 2 opposite sides of the foil and seal with a double fold.  Fold remaining ends so that the shrimp mixture is enclosed, but leave a little space for steam to build up.

  2                     limes -- wedged
  1              pound  Monterey Jack cheese with
                        jalapeÒo peppers -- grated
                        Sour cream -- as needed
                        Salsa -- as needed
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped onion
  10            medium  garlic cloves

Slice steak across grain into narrow strips.  Toss steak strips with onion mixture in skillet, being careful that beef keeps its reddish-pink center.

To assemble fajitas, fill tortilla with beef-onion combination.  Squirt with lime juice if desired.  Top with grated cheese, sour cream and salsa.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  eggplant
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  8             ounces  fresh mild red cherry peppers or
                        mild banana peppers -- halved, and
                        stems and seeds removed
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  12            ounces  beef flank steak or
                        boneless beef sirloin, abt 1" thk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  dried Italian seasoning -- crushed
  4                     six-inch Italian sourdough rolls -- split horizontally
                        Olive oil -- (optional)
                        Salad greens or romaine leaves
  2             ounces  shaved Parmesan cheese
                        Fresh thyme sprigs -- (optional)

Trim ends off eggplant; discard.  Cut eggplant lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices, discarding the outside "peel" slices.  Spread the eggplant slices in a single layer on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cover and set aside for 30 minutes.  Rinse eggplant; pat dry.  Rub eggplant slices with half of the olive oil; set aside.

For pepper spread, in a large skillet heat remaining oil.  Cook onion and garlic, uncovered, in hot oil over medium heat for 5 minutes or until onion turns golden, stirring often.  Add the cherry or banana peppers, the balsamic vinegar, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook and stir for 2 minutes.  Reduce heat; cover.  Cook over low heat for 10 minutes or until mixture is soft, stirring occasionally.  Remove pepper mixture from heat.  Let cool.

In a food processor bowl or blender container cover and process or blend pepper mixture until nearly smooth.  Set aside.

Score meat on both sides by making shallow diagonal cuts at 1-inch intervals in a diamond pattern.  Season steak with salt and pepper, if desired.  Rub steak on both sides with dried Italian seasoning.

Grill steak on rack of uncovered grill directly over medium coals for 18 to 22 minutes for medium doneness, turning once.  Grill eggplant slices for 6 to 8 minutes or until cooked through, turning once.  Set aside.  If desired, brush cut sides of Italian bread halves with olive oil.  Grill bread, cut-side down, for 1 to 2 minutes or until toasted.

To assemble, spread about 1 tablespoon pepper spread on bottom half of each Italian roll.  Top with greens and eggplant slices.  Slice steak across grain into very thin strips.  Arrange sliced steak on eggplant slices.  Add Parmesan, if desired.  Lightly spread top halves of Italian rolls with remaining pepper spread.  Serve open-face with top halves of rolls on the side.  Garnish with sprigs of thyme, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Crisp greens and roasted mild peppers are popular in Apulia, a region of Italy famous for dishes made with fresh ingredients that are casually prepared.

  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
  2              large  portobello mushrooms
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire Sauce

Start grill.  While it is heating, rub steaks with pepper.

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter with bleu cheese and garlic, about 5 minutes.  While that is melting, chop green onions and wash and slice mushrooms.

Stir sauce until smooth and fold in onions and mushrooms.  Cook just until mushrooms soften, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Cover and keep warm while steaks cook.

To cook steaks, place on hot grill and cook until well-seared, about 7 minutes for a steak 1 1/2-inches thick.  Flip and cook for about another 5.  (While steak is cooking, you can husk the corn and slice melon).

Place each steak on a plate and top with about 1/4 cup sauce.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              pound  skirt steak, top round, or
                        other steak -- cut 6" long pieces
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  rich red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Colman's dry mustard
  5                     plump garlic cloves -- smashed
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  canola oil
  1              large  yellow onion -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        === PEPPER SAUTE ===
  1              large  red bell pepper
  1                     yellow or orange bell pepper
  3                     mild chiles - (to 4)
  1                     poblano chile
  2                     New Mexico red chiles, or
                        other hot chiles -- cut thin rings,
                        and seeded
  1              large  sweet onion -- thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     plump garlic cloves -- thinly sliced,
                        and julienned
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  minced fresh cilantro

Make the Marinade:  Combine the vinegar, mustard and garlic in a large non-reactive baking dish.  Blend thoroughly, then whisk in oils to make a thick emulsion.  Add the onions and cilantro.  Then add the meat, turning in the marinade to coat on both sides.  Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, turning the meat several times.

Seed the peppers and cut lengthwise into 3/4-inch wide strips.  Combine all the peppers and the onions in a large mixing bowl.  Heat the oil in a wok until hot.  Add the pepper mix to the hot oil and stir-fry over high heat until peppers and onions are nearly tender, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and toss until the slivers and somewhat softened.  Transfer the pepper mixture to a serving bowl and toss with the lime juice.  Season with salt and pepper and stir in the cilantro.  Set aside in a shallow serving bowl.

Remove the steaks from the marinade and grill on a hot grill, turning after 2 minutes on one side.  Grill 2 minutes on the other side for rare, 3 minutes for medium.  Transfer to a carving board and let rest for 2 minutes, then carve into 2-inch wide pieces.  Serve generously garnished with warm pepper sautÈ.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Olive oil cooking spray -- as needed
  1                     green onion -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh herbs
                        = (such as oregano, basil,
                        dill or tarragon)
  2             pounds  fresh halibut -- cut into fillets
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
                        = (or garlic-flavored olive oil)
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice

Heat a barbecue grill to high heat, closing the lid to retain heat inside.

Tear off a sheet of aluminum foil that is about 24 inches long and fold it twice to make three layers of foil about 8 inches long.  Coat the foil with the olive oil cooking spray.  Sprinkle half the green onion and fresh herbs on the bottom.

Wash the halibut under cold running water.  Pat dry.  Place fish on top of the green onions.  Sprinkle remaining green onion and herbs on top and drizzle fish with the olive oil or garlic-flavored olive oil and lemon juice.  Tent lightly with a separate sheet of foil.

If using a gas grill, turn off the flame on one side and place the fish over the side without the flame.  If using a charcoal grill, place the fish farthest away from coals.

Close the grill lid.  Cook the fish 15 to 20 minutes, according to thickness, or until the fish is firm to the touch.  If desired, place the fish over the flame for the last 5 minutes of cooking to brown the edges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Suggestion idea:  Serve with rice pilaf and grilled or steamed asparagus on the side.

                 The Best Damn Grilled Chicken I Ever Ate

Recipe By     :Paul Prudhomme
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  onion powder -- plus
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  1         tablespoon  ground ginger -- plus
     3/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
  1         tablespoon  grated lime peel
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground white pepper
  1 1/4      teaspoons  ground cardamom
  1 1/4      teaspoons  cinnamon
  1 1/4      teaspoons  nutmeg
  1 1/4      teaspoons  ground savory
     3/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  ground habanero chile peppers
  4                     bay leaves
  1                     chicken - (3 to 4 lbs) -- cut up
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Make a paste of the first 17 spice ingredients (salt through bay leaves) in a large bowl or zip-lock bag.  Place the chicken pieces in the bowl and rub the pieces evenly with the seasoning paste.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate 6 to 8 hours.

When ready to cook, light the coals or prepare the grill.  Bring the chicken to room temperature.  Melt the butter.  With a spoon, gently scrape as much of the seasoning paste as possible off of the chicken, combine it with any paste remaining in the bowl and stir in into the butter.

Place the large pieces of the chicken on the hottest spot on the grill and the smaller pieces on the less hot section and cook, turning the pieces and basting several times with the butter paste mixture, until done.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This can also be prepared by broiling chicken pieces until brown crust forms, then baking in 300 oven until done.  Or rub a whole chicken with the paste and roast in 300 oven about three hours or until done.

                        === GARNISH ===
  4                     starfruit -- cut 1/2" slices
  16           bunches  green grapes - (1 oz ea)

For marinade, blend ginger, brown sugar and lemon and lime juices in a small pan.  Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until brown sugar is completely dissolved.  Remove from heat; set aside.

Carefully thread the fruits onto the skewers.  An eye-pleasing order: Grape, mango, pineapple, another grape, peach, kiwi fruit, more mango, more pineapple, a third grape and, finally, a peach half again.

Brush kebabs generously with marinade 15 minutes before grilling or broiling.  Grill kebabs 5 minutes, turning them once.  Remove from heat and glaze once more with the marinade before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

               Turkey-Breast Steaks With Grilled Pineapple

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  LHJís Barbecue Sauce -- (see recipe)
  4                     turkey-breast steaks, 1/2"-thk -- (4 to 6 oz ea)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              small  pineapple -- cored, and
                        cut into 8 spears

Heat grill.  Place 1/4 cup of the LHJ's Barbecue Sauce in small bowl for pineapple spears; set aside.

Sprinkle both sides of turkey steaks with salt and pepper.  Brush tops with 1/4 cup barbecue sauce.  Arrange steaks, sauce-side down, on grill.  Grill over medium-hot heat 4 to 5 minutes.  Brush other sides with remaining 1/4 cup sauce.  Turn and grill 4 to 5 minutes more until cooked through.

Meanwhile, grill pineapple spears 3 minutes.  Turn spears; brush with reserved 1/4 cup barbecue sauce and grill 3 minutes more until heated through.

Arrange turkey steaks and pineapple on serving platter.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Quick to cook and low in fat, boneless, skinless turkey-breast steaks are a great new cut of poultry to grill.  Fresh pineapple spears add a tropical touch -- using a twenty-ounce package of peeled and cored pineapple from the supermarket makes the prep a breeze.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  red snapper - (abt 1 lb ea) -- scaled, cleaned
  1              bunch  fresh chives or scallions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARLIC-SOY SAUCE ===
  1                cup  light soy sauce
     1/4           cup  unseasoned rice wine vinegar
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame oil
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
                        === GARNISH ===
  6                     scallions -- cut 2" lengths

Mix all sauce ingredients together in a large bowl.  Reserve.

Have your fish scaled and cleaned.  With a sharp knife, cut 2 to 3 diagonal slashes on both sides of the fish (this will facilitate the cooking of the fish).  Brush the fish with a small amount of vegetable oil and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper.  Stuff the cavity with whole chives; close with a toothpick or trussing pin.

Place the fish in the center of the cooking grate.  Grill approximately 8 to 10 minutes.  Carefully turn fish over and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or until cooked to desired doneness.  Place fish on a warm plate.

Heat reserved sauce and pour over fish.  Garnish with plenty of scallions.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
