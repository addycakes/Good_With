                       Almond Cookies - {Amaretti}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  unblanched whole almonds
  2 1/4           cups  confectioner's sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  4              large  egg whites -- room temperature
                        Parchment paper

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Cut sheets of parchment paper to fit 4 cookie sheets.

In a food processor or by hand, finely chop the almonds and place them in a large bowl.

In a medium bowl, mix the confectioner's sugar and baking powder together.  Add to the almonds and mix well.

In a separate bowl (preferably copper), beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.  With a rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the almond mixture a little at a time until the mixture is well blended.

Using two soup spoons, shape the batter into balls about 2 inches in diameter and place them about 1 inch apart on the cookie sheets.  They will spread while baking.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until firm to the touch and golden brown.  Let the cookies cool completely on the parchment paper before removing; otherwise, they will break.  Store the cookies in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  Almonds have been essential to Italian cooking for centuries.  They were used to make sauces during the early Renaissance, especially during Lent.  Today, as then, they are used in sauces and in fillings for meats; for stuffings for tortellini and vegetables, for marzipan, in cakes, breads, and of course, in biscotti.  These Amaretti are just one of many kinds to be found all over Italy.  In Italy, Amaretti are made with sweet and bitter almonds, but only sweet almonds are used in this recipe.  Bitter almonds are not available in the United States because they contain prussic acid, a toxin that is believed harmful if ingested in large quantities.

                       Almond Crunch - {Croccante}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Candies                         Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3               cups  blanched whole almonds
  3        tablespoons  water
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice

Brush a marble slab or cookie sheet with the oil.  Place all the remaining ingredients in a heavy nonstick saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.  Cook, stirring, for about 15 minutes, or until the syrup has turned a deep caramel color and is very foamy; it should register 300 degrees on a candy thermometer.

Immediately pour the mixture out onto the oiled slab or cookie sheet, spreading it evenly with the spoon.  Let cool completely.

Cut the croccante into rough 1-inch pieces with a heavy knife.  Store in airtight jars.

This recipe yields about 3 dozen.

Comments:  Croccante, which means cracklings, reminds me of peanut brittle, except that this sweet confection is made from almonds or hazelnuts.  I usually buy it at street fairs and outdoor markets in Italy.  Croccante is great party food.  For gift giving, pile it into a fancy candy dish or decorative jar.

                   Almond Foams - {Spumini Mandorlati}

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  whole blanched almonds
  2              large  egg whites -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour

Preheat the oven to 225 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.

Grind the almonds in a food processor until very fine and transfer them to a medium-size bowl.

In an electric mixer whip the egg whites until they are foamy.  Gradually whip in the sugar, a little at a time, until the egg whites begin to form peaks and appear shiny.  Whip in the flour a little at a time.  Fold the nuts into the egg-white mixture until they are well blended.

Use 2 teaspoons to spread small rounds of batter onto the parchment paper, spacing the spumini about 1/2 inch apart.  They will spread a little.  Or fill a tipless pastry bag with the batter and pipe out 1-inch rounds.

Bake the spumini without opening the oven door for about 45 minutes, or until crisp.  They should remain pale in color.

Allow the spumini to cool completely on the baking sheets, then carefully remove them from the parchment paper.

Note:  These are perfect to serve with fresh fruit, ice cream, or sherbets.

This recipe yields about 4 dozen cookies.

Comments:  What I love about these bite-size meringue and almond cookies are their delicateness and their almost ethereal texture and taste.  And I also love the name given to them by my Tuscan friends and super cooks Giovanni and Iris Lodovici, spumini mandorlati, the literal translation of which is "almond foams".  This exquisite cookie calls for only four ingredients, is quick to put together, but requires a 45-minute baking time to produce a dry, crisp spumini that literally melts in your mouth like foam.

                        Sweetened whipped cream for serving -- (optional)

Brush a charlotte mold or other 7- by 4-inch-deep pan with butter.  Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom of the mold and brush it with butter.  Set the mold aside.

In a bowl, toss the apple slices with the lemon juice.  Set aside.

In a small bowl, mix the sugar, cinnamon, and cloves together.  Sprinkle the sugar mixture evenly over the bottom of the prepared mold.

Drain the apple slices.  Arrange 4 or 5 slices side by side in the center of the mold.  Then arrange a circle of apple slices around the outer part of the mold, overlapping them slightly and partially covering the slices in the center.  Line the side of the mold with a ring of apple slices, standing them curved-side up.  You may not need all the apple slices.  Set aside.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Shape the dough into a flattened ball just large enough to cover the apples in the bottom of the mold.  Do not worry if the dough does not quite touch the apple around the sides of the mold; as it rises, it will.  Cover the mold with a clean cloth and let rise for 40 minutes, until the dough has risen three quarters of the way up the mold.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Bake the charlotte for 35 to 40 minutes, until the top is golden brown and a cake skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool the charlotte in the mold on a rack for 30 minutes.

Carefully run a table knife around the inside edges of the mold.  Invert the charlotte onto a serving plate.  Remove and discard the parchment paper.  Serve the charlotte warm, cut into wedges, with a dollup of sweetened whipped cream if you wish.

Note:  If the charlotte has baked so that there is a high dome on top, slice off some of the top crust with a bread knife before unmolding it so it will rest evenly on the serving dish.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  For this recipe I have borrowed on the idea of the classic molded apple charlotte, which uses trimmed slices of bread, pureed apples, rum, and plenty of butter.  But in this version, crunchy slices of apple line the bottom of the mold, nestled in a bed of cinnamon-and-clove-flavored sugar.  Instead of lining the sides of the mold with strips of buttered bread, I cover the apple slices with the Simply Sweet Dough and allow it to rise before baking.  Use a seven-by-four-inch charlotte mold or another similar-sized mold, or a deep baking dish, such as a seven-inch souffle dish.  This uses only half of the sweet dough recipe, so the remaining dough may be used for another recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  4                     eggs -- seperated
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
  1 1/4           cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Grated zest of one large lemon
                        === PISTACHIO CREAM FILLING ===
  2 1/2         ounces  natural pistachios
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  flour
  4                     egg yolks
  2               cups  milk
                        === GARNISH ===
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  Alkermes liqueur -- (optional)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        === CHERRY FILLING ===
  1 1/2           cups  amarena cherries -- pureed

For the cake, pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a jellyroll pan and set aside.  Dust a clean kitchen towel with confectioners' sugar and set aside.

Beat the egg yolks with the sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, then beat in the butter.  Set aside.

In another bowl, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together.  Sprinkle the flour mixture a little at a time over the egg whites and gently fold them in with a rubber spatula.

Fold the egg white batter into the egg yolk batter, along with the lemon zest.

Spread the batter on the jellyroll pan and bake for 10 to 15 minutes or just until the top and edges are nicely browned and the cake springs back when touched with your finger.

Turn the pan over onto the towel lightly dusted with confectioners' sugar.  Starting at the short end of the cake, roll it up gently in the towel and let cool.

For the pistachio cream filling, grind the nuts and 1/2 cup of the sugar until powdery in a food processor or with a mortar and pestle.

In a saucepan off the heat, beat the egg yolks with the remaining sugar until the mixture is lemon colored; then beat in the flour.  Slowly stir in the milk.  Cook the mixture over medium high heat until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon.  Remove the mixture from the heat, and stir in the pistachio and sugar mixture.

Transfer the pistachio cream to a bowl and cover the top with a piece of buttered wax paper.  Refrigerate for at least one hour.

Line a 2-quart bowl with plastic wrap, allowing excess to hang over the edges of the bowl.

Unroll the cake and spread it with the amarena cherry filling; then carefully spread a thin layer of the pistachio cream over the cherry filling.  Reroll the cake, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour.

Using a serrated knife, cut the cake into 1/2-inch slices.  Place a few slices in the bottom of the bowl and cover with a layer of pastry cream.  Add another layer of cake, positioning the layers against the inside walls of the bowl and add more pastry cream.  Be sure to put a few pieces of cake in the center as you layer filling and cake.  The top layer should be cake.  Fold the overhanging plastic wrap over the cake and refrigerate until ready to serve.

In a bowl, whip the cream with the Alkermes and the sugar until stiff.

Turn the bowl over to unmold the cake onto a decorative serving dish.  Remove the plastic wrap and discard.

Fit a large pastry bag with a #2 star tip.  Fill the bag with the whipped cream and pipe a decorative border around the base of the cake and at the top if desired.  Cut into wedges to serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4               cups  cold milk -- plus
  2        tablespoons  cold milk
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour - -- (lightly packed)
  1                cup  finely-grated semisweet chocolate - (7 oz)
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  3          teaspoons  Amaretto liqueur
     3/4           cup  coarsely-chopped amaretti cookies
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds

Place the egg yolks and sugar in a saucepan and mix well with a wire whisk.  Add 2 tablespoons of the milk and whisk until smooth.  Sift in the flour a little at a time and continue whisking.  Add the remaining milk and whisk to blend.

Place the saucepan over medium-low heat and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken slightly.  Add the chocolate and continue whisking until the mixture reaches the boiling point.  Whisk for a minute, taking care not to let the mixture burn, then remove the pan from the heat.

Add the vanilla, butter, and liqueur and blend carefully with a rubber spatula.  Cover the mixture with a sheet of buttered waxed paper and let cool about 5 minutes.

Blend in the cookies, and pour the mixture into individual serving dishes or into a decorative serving dish.  Cover with buttered waxed paper and refrigerate at least 4 to 6 hours or until set.

Just before serving, sprinkle the sliced almonds over the top.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Cocoa beans were one of the New World's offerings to Europe in the sixteenth century.  Southern Italians embraced this new ingredient more than their northern neighbors, using it in sweet confections as well as in some vegetable dishes such as Caponata.

The combination of semisweet chocolate, amaretti cookies, and Amaretto liqueur in this chocolate cream dessert makes for a sublime ending to a dinner party.  Be sure to use good quality chocolate such as Lindt or Ghiradelli.  I serve this in individual goblets, or use it as a filling to make chocolate pie.

  5 1/3    tablespoons  butter or shortening
  6              large  eggs
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  anise extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease 2 cookie sheets.

Spread the almonds on an ungreased cookie sheet and toast them for 10 minutes, stirring once or twice.  Transfer the nuts to a bowl and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt.  Add the butter and rub the mixture with your hands until it has the texture of coarse corn meal.

In a large bowl, beat the eggs well with a whisk or electric mixer.  Beat in the sugar, then the anise extract.  Stir in the flour mixture and mix until a firm dough is formed.  Add the almonds and knead into the dough.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface.  With floured hands, divide the dough in half and shape each half into a 12- by 3-inch rectangular loaf.  Place the loaves on the greased cookie sheets and bake for 25 minutes, or until firm to the touch and puffed and light golden.  Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes.

Cut each loaf on the diagonal into 1-inch slices.  Place the slices on their sides on the cookie sheets and bake them for about 7 minutes on each side, or until toasted and golden brown.  Transfer to wire racks to cool.

The cookies will keep in an airtight container for several weeks.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Biscotti is a catchall word that can be used for any cookie.  The literal translation is "twice cooked", because some Italian cookies such as these anise cookies are baked first as long, flat loaves, then sliced and baked again.  They are a family favorite, traditionally dunked in a glass of Vin Santo, a dessert wine, or in coffee.  They were the most requested breakfast food of an Italian student from Reggio Emilia who lived with us one summer.

                  Aniseed Ring Biscuits - {Ciambellette}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  vanilla or anise extract
  4        tablespoons  sugar plus -- plus extra for
                        dipping the rings into before baking
  2 1/2      teaspoons  anise seeds -- slightly crushed if
                        desired
  2 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 3 1/4)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  baking powder

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, combine 4 eggs, the olive oil, lemon zest, vanilla, sugar, and anise seeds.

On a sheet of wax paper, sift together 2 3/4 cups of the flour, salt, and baking powder.  Slowly add to the egg mixture and combine to make a smooth but fairly stiff dough.  If more flour is needed, add it a little at a time until the right consistency is obtained.  All the flour may not be necessary, depending on the type of flour used and the size of the eggs.

Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces; work with one piece at a time; keep the remaining pieces covered so they do not dry out.

Roll each piece into a 12-inch-long rope and cut twelve 1-inch pieces from each rope.  Roll each piece under the palm of your hands into a 5-inch long rope; form a circle and pinch the ends closed.

Beat the remaining egg slightly with a fork, then dip each ring into the egg wash, and then coat each of them in sugar.  Place the rings on the parchment lined baking sheets.

Bake the ciambellette for about 20 to 25 minutes or just until they are golden brown.  Cool on racks.

This recipe yields 4 dozen.

Comments:  I could have eaten more than one of these at the Ceccarani di Santino pastry shop.  These little rings with the licorice flavor are a favorite of mine.  They freeze beautifully.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  eggs -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  heavy cream or sour cream
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
     3/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  1              pinch  salt
  6               cups  sliced Golden Delicious apples
                        = (abt 4 or 5 large apples)
  2        tablespoons  warm apple jelly or apricot jam

Line an 8-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil, allowing enough for a 1-inch overhang.  Butter and flour the foil and set the pan aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl beat the eggs with the sugar with a hand-held mixer until the mixture is fluffy and lemon colored.  Beat in the vanilla and heavy or sour cream.  Stir in the lemon zest.

On a sheet of wax paper sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together.  On medium speed beat the flour mixture into the egg mixture.  Fold in the apples.

Pour the batter into the foil-lined pan.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until the apples are nicely browned.

Transfer the cake to a wire rack.  Brush the top of the cake with the warm apricot jam.  Let the cake cool to warm.  Carefully lift the foil out of the pan.  Remove the foil from the cake and discard.  Serve the cake cut into squares.

Tip:  Why buy expensive pastry brushes to brush tarts and cakes?  Instead, buy inexpensive, small paintbrushes at the hardware store.

This recipe yields 1 small cake.

Comments:  Marie Gorelli was such a gracious host during the taping of Ciao Italia at Banfi that she even found time to make some typical Tuscan biscotti, which we all enjoyed after the filming.  We talked about our favorite dolci and she was intrigued by my description of a moist apple cake that was a favorite of the renowned Tuscan chef Edgardo Sandoli, so I gave her the recipe.  When I returned home, there was a letter from her telling me that la torta e squisita!  This cake reminds me of apple pancakes; the batter is thin, there are more apples than batter, and the cake does not rise very high.

       Apples With Raspberry Sauce - {Mele Con La Salsa Di Lampone}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  fresh raspberries
  3        tablespoons  raspberry jam
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  white dessert wine
                        = (like Moscato d'Asti)
  1         tablespoon  raspberry vinegar - (to 2)
  8             medium  Golden Delicious apples - (to 10) -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
                        Mascarpone cheese or
                        sweetened whipped cream -- for serving
     1/2           cup  crushed almonds

Puree the raspberries in a blender or food processor.  Add the jam and sugar and pulse to blend.  Add the wine and vinegar and blend well.

Put the apple slices in a large bowl and pour the raspberry sauce over them.  Mix gently to coat the apple slices.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for 1 hour.

Spoon the fruit with some of the sauce into individual dessert bowls and top with a dollop of Mascarpone cheese or whipped cream.  Sprinkle the almonds over the top of each bowl and serve immediately.

Note:  To keep raspberries fresh and prevent mold from developing, remove them from their container and place them in a single layer on a paper-towel-lined dish.  Cover and refrigerate.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Going through the Mercato Centrale in Florence and admiring the variety of fruits and vegetables conjures up all kinds of ideas that I am eager to try when I get home.  The unbelievably plump raspberries grab my attention because they are as big as gun balls and are just begging me to make one of my standby quick company desserts, apples with raspberry sauce.

           Apricots Cooked In Wine - {Albicocche Cotte Al Vino}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  fresh apricots -- washed, stemmed,
                        cut in half, and pitted
  2               cups  dry white wine
                        = (such as chardonnay)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1              piece  vanilla bean - (5" long)
  2             sprigs  fresh basil leaves - (to 3)

Heat the wine in a 10- by 2-inch deep saute pan.  Stir in the sugar and cook gently until the sugar dissolves.  Add the vanilla bean and the apricots cut-side down in a single layer in the pan.  Lower the heat and simmer the apricots for about 4 minutes.  Do not overcook them or they will turn mushy and not hold their shape.

With a slotted spoon remove the apricots to a serving bowl.  Continue cooking the wine for about 10 minutes, or until it is slightly syrupy.  Remove the vanilla bean and pour the syrup over the apricots.  Add the basil leaves.  Let the apricots cool to room temperature before serving.

Note:  The apricots can be made ahead and kept in the refrigerator for a week.

Did you know that cutting a whole apricot along the side where there is an indentation line and then twisting the fruit will result in two perfect halves?

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Fresh apricots simmered in dry white wine was my choice for a refreshing dessert at Osteria di Rubbiara.  Select apricots that feel heavy, yield gently to the touch, and have no brown spots.  Once the apricots are cooked, they can be used in a variety of ways, including serving them as is, or as a sauce over ice cream or lemon sherbet, or over a plain cake.  Fresh basil complements the taste of the apricots.  They also make a great hostess gift when spooned into a decorative jar and covered with wine syrup.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           envelope  active dry yeast - (2 1/2 tpns)
     1/2           cup  warm milk
  4              large  eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
  8        tablespoons  butter (1 stick) -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3 1/2           cups  cake flour -- measured then sifted
                        === FOR THE SYRUP ===
  2               cups  sugar
  2               cups  water
                        Zest of 1 lemon
  2        tablespoons  rum - (to 1/4 cup)
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        Heavy cream -- whipped
                        = (or thin pastry cream)

Dissolve the yeast in the milk and set aside.

Beat the egg whites until stiff and set aside.

In a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the paddle, cream the butter with the sugar and salt until the mixture is light colored and fluffy.

Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating to incorporate each before adding the next.

Add 1 cup of the sifted flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating each addition until it is incorporated and scraping down the bowl and beaters between additions.

Add half the beaten egg whites and beat until incorporated.  The dough will loosen up.  Add another cup of flour, 1/2 cup at a time, again scraping down the bowl and beaters between additions.  Beat in the remaining egg whites.  Add the last 1 1/2 cups of flour, 1/2 cup at a time.

Finally, beat the milk and yeast mixture into the dough and let the machine run about 90 seconds, until the dough loses enough of its stickiness to pull away cleanly from the bowl when scraped with a rubber spatula.

Turn the dough out into the bowl used to beat the egg whites.  Cover with a towel and set aside to rise for 1 hour.  It should be doubled in bulk.

Generously butter a 9-inch tube pan.

When the dough has risen, using a rubber spatula, dislodge the dough from the bowl and ease it into the tube pan, turning the bowl or the pan so that the dough stretches around to fill the pan.  Using the rubber spatula, prod and poke the dough so it fills the pan more or less evenly.  (You will not be able to get the top of the dough smooth.  Don't worry about it.)  Cover with a kitchen towel and set aside to rise for another 1 1/2 hours.  At this point, the dough should have risen to fill about 3/4 of the pan.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Bake for about 35 minutes, until the cake begins to pull away from the sides of the pan.  Remove and let the cake cool in the pan, on a wire rack, for about 10 minutes.  Unmold the cake and place it in a deep dish.

While it cools more, make the syrup:  Combine the sugar, water, and lemon zest in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.  Reduce heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes.  Remove the syrup from the heat and add the rum.  Allow to cool slightly before drenching the cake.

With a toothpick or thin bamboo skewer, make a couple of dozen tiny holes in the top of the cake.  Spoon syrup over the cake very slowly.  As syrup accumulates in the platter, spoon back over the cake.  Use all the syrup.

Serve with whipped cream or thin pastry cream, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This is the family recipe of Maria Giovanna Fasulo Rak, a restoration expert at the National Archives in Rome and author of La cucina napoletana in cento ricette tradizionali (Neapolitan Cooking in 100 Traditional Recipes).  The mixing procedure is most unusual, but it is the only recipe of the many I have tried that gives the real Neapolitan texture.  Beaten egg whites are incorporated into the dough, but not folded in, to retain their airiness, and the yeast is not beaten into the dough until the very end.  The mixing requires a heavy-duty mixer with a paddle to do it well and easily.  Individual babas au rhum, which are shaped like stout mushrooms and are submerged in bowls full of syrup, are also popular in Naples, but most cafes and pastry shops proudly display a huge crown of only lightly doused baba.  After each portion is cut and put on a plate, it is doused again, moistening the cake more thoroughly.

              Banana Cream Pudding - {Bavarese Alle Banane}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Italian
                Puddings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  unflavored gelatin
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  boiled milk
  1              large  well-mashed banana - (2/3 cup)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1               pint  strawberries -- stemmed, wiped clean
  2        tablespoons  brandy

Pour the water into a medium bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over it, stir, and let dissolve.  Set aside.

In another bowl, beat the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of sugar with an electric mixer until the mixture is lemon colored.  Set aside.  Gradually stir the milk into the gelatin mixture, blending well.  While beating, slowly pour the milk and gelatin mixture into the egg mixture.  Add the banana and the cream, and continue to beat until smooth.

Pour the mixture into a 4-cup mold.  Cover the mold with foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until firm.

In a food processor or blender, puree the strawberries with the brandy and remaining sugar until smooth.  Set aside.

To serve, unmold the bavarese by placing a serving dish larger than the mold on top and carefully turning the dish over.  Holding the sides of the plate and the mold, shake the mold gently to release it.  If it does not come out easily, quickly dip the bottom of the mold in hot water and repeat the process.

Cut the mold into serving pieces and pour some of the sauce over the top.

Variation:  Make individual molds.  Spoon some of the sauce over each mold after unmolding.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A bavarese is a rich molded pudding made with cream and milk.  It is one of my favorite desserts and very easy to make, lending itself to a variety of flavors.  This one is made with very ripe bananas, which minimizes the amount of sugar needed.  Make this early on the day you plan to serve it.

                        Extra-virgin olive oil
                        Sterilized clear wine bottles and
                        new corks

Wash and dry the basil carefully.  Put 3 or 4 sprigs into each bottle.  With a small knife, make a slit in the garlic cloves.  Add 1 clove to each bottle.  Fill the bottles with olive oil and cork the bottles.

Store the oil in the refrigerator and use within 3 weeks.  Bring the oil to room temperature before using.  You will have oil with a beautiful basil flavor, and the leaves stay perfectly preserved.

Note:  Use Basil Oil as you would any other oil in salads.  It also is wonderful for browning chicken, pork, and veal, and it is equally good tossed with fresh pasta.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  When it's high garden season, I head for the patch on the hill where my husband, Guy, has planted our Italian garden.  The four rows of basil plants swing happily in the breeze, the unmistakable peppery scent lingering in the hot summer air.  I pinch off the tops of the plants to make them bushy and prevent them from going to flower.  Soon I realize I have a fearful amount of basil to deal with.  Some will be made into pesto, some leaves will be packed in salt and stored in the refrigerator, and what is left over will go into my basil-flavored vinegars and oils.  Other herbs such as fennel, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and chives can also be preserved this way.

  3                     basil sprigs - (to 4) -- per bottle
  1                     peeled garlic clove -- per bottle

                        Sterilized glass bottles and caps or corks

Wash and dry the basil sprigs.  Place 3 or 4 sprigs in each bottle.  With a knife, make a small slit in the garlic cloves.  Add 1 clove to each bottle and fill the bottles with vinegar.  Cap or cork the bottles and place them outside in the sun or in a sunny place indoors to "ripen" for 4 or 5 days.

Let the vinegar sit for at least 6 weeks before using; the vinegar will keep for up to 6 months.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  In our basement, there was a collection of empty gallon-size wine bottles that my grandmother had saved.  In the summer, the cumbersome bottles were brought upstairs, given a good scrubbing and scalding, and then stuffed with fresh herbs, such as basil and parsley.  A funnel was placed over the mouth of the bottle and wine vinegar was added, filling the bottles to the brim.  Then they were left to steep for weeks so the herbs would flavor the vinegar.  Almost any fresh herbs can be used this way.  I like combining herbs too, for thyme-mint vinegar, or parsley-chive vinegar.  I use these vinegars on salads, in marinades, and to deglaze chicken dishes.  You don't need gallon wine bottles to do this.  I save interesting bottles of different sizes, fill and label them, and often give them as Christmas presents with a favorite recipe for using the vinegar.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4            cup  raisins
     1/2           cup  diced candied lemon peel
     1/2           cup  diced candied orange peel
     1/4           cup  brandy
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  5               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces,
                        and softened
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  warm milk
     1/2           cup  chopped almonds
  1                     dried fava or other large bean
  1                     egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  turbinado (coarse brown) sugar

Put the raisins in a bowl, cover with warm water, and set aside to plump.

In a bowl, mix the citrus peels with the brandy.  Set aside.

In a medium bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Add 1 cup of the flour and mix until a ball of dough is formed.  Fill a large bowl two-thirds full with warm water.  Place the ball of dough in the water, cover with plastic wrap, and let the sponge rise in a warm place until doubled, about 20 minutes.

In a food processor, combine 4 cups of the flour, sugar, salt, and lemon zest.  Add the butter, eggs, and milk and process to a slightly stiff dough.  With a slotted spoon, scoop the risen sponge from the water and add it to the dough.  Process until thoroughly incorporated into the dough.  If the dough seems too stiff, add a little tepid water.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for a few minutes.  Butter a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap, then a towel, and let rise in a warm spot for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.

Butter a 10- by 3 1/2-inch deep round cake pan, ceramic pan or tube pan.  Dust with flour and shake out the excess.  Drain the raisins, pat dry with paper towels, and toss with 1 tablespoon of the flour.  Drain the candied citrus peels, reserving the brandy.  Toss the peels with the remaining 1 tablespoon flour.

Punch down the dough.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface.  With your hands, work the raisins, candied peels, almonds, and dried bean into the dough, and knead until you have a uniform ball of dough.  It should feel slightly tacky.  Place the dough in the pan, cover with a towel, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until doubled in size.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a small bowl, beat the egg yolk and reserved brandy together.  Brush the top of the cake with this mixture and sprinkle with the coarse sugar.  Bake for 45 minutes, or until nicely browned.  Let the cake cool for 10 minutes in the pan.  Carefully run a knife around the sides of the pan to loosen the cake, and turn the cake out onto a cooling rack to cool completely.  To serve, cut into wedges.

Note:  To freeze, wrap the cake well in aluminum foil.  Freeze for up to 1 month.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  This cake, which is more of a fruit-studded sweet bread, is traditionally made for the Feast of Epiphany, or Three Kings, the day when Befana, the old woman, brings gifts to children, hoping that one of them is the child king she refused to acknowledge centuries ago.  Before the cake is baked, a large dried bean is kneaded into the dough.  The cake is presented on a silver crown, and whoever receives the slice with the bean is king or queen for the day.  This is a very old recipe that begins with a sponge, or starter, that sits in water to rise.  Because this is a stiff and sticky dough, it is best to make it in a food processor.  Make it ahead for the holidays and freeze.

                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  blanched and slivered almonds
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven for 7 to 10 minutes, or just until they begin to brown at the edges.  Transfer the almonds to a bowl and allow them to cool.

In another bowl mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt.

In another bowl mix together the sugar, eggs, and vanilla.  Add the sugar and egg mixture to the flour mixture and mix with your hands to form a dough.  Fold in the almonds.  The dough will be stiff.

With floured hands transfer the dough to a sheet of wax paper and shape it into a 10- by 5 1/2-inch-long loaf.  Wrap the dough in the wax paper and refrigerate it for several hours or overnight.

With a sharp knife, cut the dough in half lengthwise and place each half, cut-side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them 2 inches apart.  Reshape the loaves slightly.

Bake the loaves for about 18 minutes, or until they are firm to the touch but still pale looking.  Remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow the loaves to cool for 10 minutes.

With a sharp knife cut diagonal 1/2-inch thick slices from each loaf.  Lay the slices on their sides and return the baking sheet to the oven.  Toast the biscotti on each side for about 5 minutes, or until they are golden brown.  Remove the baking sheet from the oven.

Transfer the biscotti to a cooling rack.  These cookies should be hard in texture.  Serve them with vin santo or other dessert wine or with coffee and tea.

Note:  These are "long keepers" if stored in an airtight tin.  The can be frozen successfully for several months.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 dozen biscotti.

Comments:  What do Tuscans have for dessert after a meal?  Biscotti di Prato dunked in vin santo.  The city of Prato has special meaning for me since it was the home of one of Tuscany's most influential citizens, Francesco di Marco Datini, whose palazzo I visited, and whose life I read about in the book The Merchant of Prato by Iris Origo.  Datini was a wealthy textile merchant who had great influence in political circles.  In his daily diary, he talked about the deals he made and the debts he owed.  He also made many notations about the foods he enjoyed and those that were forbidden to him by his doctor.  It is a fascinating look at life in Renaissance Tuscany.  Not far from Datini's palazzo is the shop of Antonio Mattei, in via Ricasoli; this old establishment has been making and selling biscotti di Prato since 1858.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven for 7 to 10 minutes, or just until they begin to brown at the edges.  Transfer the almonds to a bowl and allow them to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In another bowl mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In another bowl mix together the sugar, eggs, and vanilla.  Add the sugar and egg mixture to the flour mixture and mix with your hands to form a dough.  Fold in the almonds.  The dough will be stiff.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With floured hands transfer the dough to a sheet of wax paper and shape it into a 10- by 5 1/2-inch-long loaf.  Wrap the dough in the wax paper and refrigerate it for several hours or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With a sharp knife, cut the dough in half lengthwise and place each half, cut-side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them 2 inches apart.  Reshape the loaves slightly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the loaves for about 18 minutes, or until they are firm to the touch but still pale looking.  Remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow the loaves to cool for 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With a sharp knife cut diagonal 1/2-inch thick slices from each loaf.  Lay the slices on their sides and return the baking sheet to the oven.  Toast the biscotti on each side for about 5 minutes, or until they are golden brown.  Remove the baking sheet from the oven.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the biscotti to a cooling rack.  These cookies should be hard in texture.  Serve them with vin santo or other dessert wine or with coffee and tea.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  These are &quot;long keepers&quot; if stored in an airtight tin.  The can be frozen successfully for several months.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 1/2 dozen biscotti.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  What do Tuscans have for dessert after a meal?  Biscotti di Prato dunked in vin santo.  The city of Prato has special meaning for me since it was the home of one of Tuscany&apos;s most influential citizens, Francesco di Marco Datini, whose palazzo I visited, and whose life I read about in the book The Merchant of Prato by Iris Origo.  Datini was a wealthy textile merchant who had great influence in political circles.  In his daily diary, he talked about the deals he made and the debts he owed.  He also made many notations about the foods he enjoyed and those that were forbidden to him by his doctor.  It is a fascinating look at life in Renaissance Tuscany.  Not far from Datini&apos;s palazzo is the shop of Antonio Mattei, in via Ricasoli; this old establishment has been making and selling biscotti di Prato since 1858.

                    Bread Pudding - {Pudding Di Pane}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Italian
                Puddings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  stale sweet bread in 1" pieces
     1/2           cup  sweet Marsala wine
  4               cups  milk
     1/2           cup  light cream or half-and-half
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest
  4              large  eggs -- separated
     1/3           cup  sugar
                        Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream -- for serving

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Butter a 9- by 12-inch baking dish.

Put the bread in a large bowl, add the Marsala wine, and toss until the bread is evenly moistened.  Set aside.

Bring the milk and cream to a boil in a large saucepan.  Remove from the heat and stir in the cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon and orange zests.

In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks until light and fluffy; whisk in the cream mixture.  In another large bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry.  Add the sugar.  Fold into the bread mixture.  Pour the mixture into the prepared dish.  Place the dish in a large baking pan and carefully add hot water to come halfway up the sides of the baking dish.  Bake the pudding until a knife inserted in the custard comes out clean, about 2 hours.

Serve the bread pudding warm, with a garnish of whipped cream or a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Use leftover bread from recipes using the Simply Sweet Dough to make this delicious and comforting bread pudding.  It is a great fall and wintertime dessert and a great way to use up leftover holiday breads.  (If you don't have any leftover sweet bread, you can use plain bread, but increase the sugar to three quarters of a cup.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  4              large  eggs -- room temperature
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  white wine
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  5                     unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 6)
                        === FILLING ===
  4 1/2           cups  raisins
  3 1/2           cups  walnut pieces
  1 3/4           cups  honey
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground cloves
                        === BAKING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- more or less
  4        tablespoons  sugar - (to 5)
                        Parchment paper

In a large bowl, mix together the eggs, salt, wine, oil, sugar, and yeast.  Cover and let stand for 10 minutes.

Add the flour 1 cup at a time, mixing with your hands until a soft ball of dough is formed.  Knead the dough on a floured surface until it is smooth and no longer sticky, adding flour as necessary.  Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.

Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper.  In a medium bowl, mix together the raisins, walnuts, 1 cup of the honey, cinnamon, and cloves.  Set aside.

Punch down the dough and knead it for a few minutes on a floured surface.  Take a piece of dough the size of a medium orange and roll it out on a floured surface, into a 9-inch circle.  Place the circle on one of the cookie sheets and brush the dough lightly with vegetable oil.  Sprinkle evenly with 1 tablespoon of the sugar.

Take a second piece of dough the size of a large orange and roll it into a 20- by 8-inch rectangle.  Cut the rectangle crosswise into eight 2 1/2-inch-wide strips.  Spread about 2 tablespoons of the filling mixture evenly down the center of each strip.  Starting at a short end, roll each strip up tightly like a jelly roll.  Place them close together on top of the circle of dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the outside edge of the circle.

Brush the outside edge of the circle with water.  Bring the edge of the circle up around the rolled strips, and tie the cake loosely with string.  Continue with the remaining dough to make 3 or 4 more cakes.  Cover and let the cakes rise for 4 hours, or overnight, in a warm place.  They will rise only slightly.

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.  Brush each cake with a little vegetable oil, and drizzle 2 tablespoons of the remaining honey over the top of each cake.  Bake the cakes for about 45 minutes, or until they are light golden in color.  As they bake, baste the cakes occasionally with any drippings.  Remove the cakes immediately to a cooling rack set on a piece of wax paper under it.  Cool completely.

Wrap each cake in plastic wrap, then in aluminum foil, and store in airtight tins.  After about a week, turn the cake tins upside down, then reverse the cakes again to distribute the honey collected on the bottom of the tins.  These are best eaten at Christmas and should not be stored for long after the holiday.  Give as gift in a decorative tin tied with a bow, along with the recipe.

This recipe yields 4 to 5 small cakes.

Comments:  This unusual Christmas cake, made from yeast dough and filled with nuts, raisins, spices, and honey, has many names, ranging from pittenguise to dolce antica.  Said to have originated in Calabria, the rosette-shaped cake must be made at least two months before it is eaten.  This recipe will make four to five small round cakes that are the perfect size for gift giving.  Start the process early in the day, and have all the ingredients at room temperature.

             Candied Orange Peel - {Scorza D'Arancia Candita}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  navel oranges -- washed and dried
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1 1/4           cups  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  turbinado (coarse brown) sugar

Cut the oranges in half and squeeze the juice; there should be about 1 cup.  Set the juice aside.  Cut each orange half in two and pull out the pulp and membranes.  Using a very sharp small knife, scrape as much white pith as possible from the peel and discard it.  Cut the peel into 1/4-inch-wide strips.  Place them in a medium-size saucepan and cover generously with cold water.  Bring to a boil and boil for 1 minute.  Drain the peel and rinse the saucepan.  Repeat this process two more times.  (Blanching the peel in boiling water helps to eliminate the bitterness.)  Set the drained peel aside.

Pour the orange juice into a medium-size nonreactive saucepan and add the 1 1/2 cups water, granulated sugar, and salt.  Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Add the blanched orange peel and stir the ingredients with a wooden spoon.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the syrup thickens and reduces by about two thirds (it should be the consistency of corn syrup), about 2 1/2 hours.

Spread the turbinado sugar in a 9- by 12-inch baking pan.  Line a baking sheet with wax paper.

With a slotted spoon, remove the peel from the syrup and spread it over the turbinado sugar.  With your fingers, roll the strips in the sugar to coat them evenly on all sides.  Place the sugared strips on the baking sheet and let them dry, uncovered, overnight.

Store the candied peel in glass jars in the refrigerator or in glass jars or airtight plastic bags in the freezer.

This recipe yields about 2 cups.

Comments:  Even though you can purchase candied fruit peels in supermarkets and Italian specialty stores, the quality and taste just cannot compare, for my money, with the homemade version.  The most popular is orange peel but the same procedure for making it can be used for lemon and grapefruit.  Orange peel is called for in the exquisite-tasting Torta Di Tagliatelline Di Modena.  Candied peels can be made ahead and stored for months under refrigeration.

Pour the orange juice into a medium-size nonreactive saucepan and add the 1 1/2 cups water, granulated sugar, and salt.  Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Add the blanched orange peel and stir the ingredients with a wooden spoon.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the syrup thickens and reduces by about two thirds (it should be the consistency of corn syrup), about 2 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the turbinado sugar in a 9- by 12-inch baking pan.  Line a baking sheet with wax paper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With a slotted spoon, remove the peel from the syrup and spread it over the turbinado sugar.  With your fingers, roll the strips in the sugar to coat them evenly on all sides.  Place the sugared strips on the baking sheet and let them dry, uncovered, overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Store the candied peel in glass jars in the refrigerator or in glass jars or airtight plastic bags in the freezer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 2 cups.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Even though you can purchase candied fruit peels in supermarkets and Italian specialty stores, the quality and taste just cannot compare, for my money, with the homemade version.  The most popular is orange peel but the same procedure for making it can be used for lemon and grapefruit.  Orange peel is called for in the exquisite-tasting Torta Di Tagliatelline Di Modena.  Candied peels can be made ahead and stored for months under refrigeration.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  1                     extra-large egg
  1         tablespoon  milk
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  brandy or rum
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for sprinkling

To make the dough using a food processor, combine all the ingredients in the bowl and process until a ball of dough starts to form.  Add a little water if the mixture seems dry.  The dough should be soft but not sticky, with the consistency of pasta dough.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead a few times.

To make the dough by hand, in a bowl, mix the flour, sugar, and salt.  Work in the butter with your hands or a fork until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add the egg, milk, lemon juice, and brandy or rum, and knead until a ball of dough forms.

Divide the dough into 4 pieces.  Work with one piece at a time.  Run each piece of dough through the rollers of a pasta machine to the thinnest setting.  Alternatively, using a rolling pin, roll each piece out on a floured surface until it is about 1/8-inch thick.

With a pastry wheel, cut each piece into 5 by 1-inch strips.  Twist each strip loosely and place on clean cloths.

In a deep fryer or deep heavy pan, heat the vegetable oil to 375 degrees.  Fry the strips about 12 at a time until golden brown.  Drain on brown paper.

When cool, sprinkle the strips with confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields 9 to 10 dozen.

Comments:  Somewhere between a pastry and a cookie, these flaky, twisted strips of dough are usually made during Carnevale, the period just before Lent.  Chiacchiere means "chit-chat" or "gossip," and like chatter that does not stop, you will not be able to stop eating these.  The dough has the consistency of pasta dough, and if you have a hand-crank pasta machine, you can turn these out in no time at all.  Mound these on a pretty plate for a party presentation.

                     Cherry Tart - {Torta Di Amarene}

Categories    : Desserts                        Italian
                Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY DOUGH ===
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter
  2              large  egg yolks -- slightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  ice water - (to 4) -- or more
                        === FILLING ===
  3               cups  drained Amarena cherries - (2 1/4 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  milk or cream
  1         tablespoon  turbinado (coarse brown) sugar

To prepare the dough, in a bowl or food processor, mix the flour, salt, and sugar together.  Work in the butter with a pastry blender or pulse it several times in the food processor until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  Blend in the yolks and water, or add through the feed tube and pulse to blend, until a ball of dough is formed.  If the dough seems dry, add a little more water.  Divide the dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other and wrap in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.

To prepare the filling, put the drained cherries in a food processor and pulse until a smooth, thick paste is obtained.  Alternately use a blender.  There should be about 3 1/4 cups of smooth cherry paste.  The drained syrup can be saved to spoon over fresh fruit, ice cream, or sherbet.

Lightly butter a 10 1/4- by 1-inch deep tart pan with a removable bottom.  Set it aside.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

On a floured surface, roll out the larger piece of dough to a 14-inch circle.  Lightly dust the top of the dough and fold it loosely into quarters.  Lift the dough and position it in the tart pan with the point of the fold in the center of the pan.  Carefully unfold the dough and fit it to the pan, trimming off the excess at the top edges.  Any pastry dough scraps can be rerolled and used to line small tart pans for jam tarts.

Spread the filling over the dough and set it aside.

Roll the second piece of dough into a 12-inch circle.  Use a pastry wheel to cut twelve 1/2-inch wide strips. Lay six of the strips vertically over the top of the filling, spacing them evenly.  Lay the remaining strips horizontally over the first strips, spacing them evenly.  Trim and pinch the ends to seal.

Brush the strips with the milk and sprinkle the turbinado sugar evenly over the top.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.  Cool the tart completely on a wire rack, remove the sides of the tart pan, then transfer the tart to a serving dish.  Cut with a sharp knife into thin wedges and serve.

Variation:  Serve the tart with a little sweetened whipped cream or a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields one 10 1/4- by 1-inch tart.

Comments:  All the cares and stresses that each day brings seem to evaporate once Italians step into their local pasticceria (pastry shop) and indulge in something sweet like a cornetto, baba au rhum, or a slice of glistening torta di frutta.  And when they are invited to someone's home for dinner, they bring cakes, tarts, or cookies from the pastry shop all beautifully wrapped and tied with a bow.  I like to duplicate many of these sweets in my kitchen.  Fruit tarts are a favorite, like this Amarena cherry tart.  Amarena cherries are small, dark red, and slightly sour, and take their name from the word amare, which means "bitter".  They grow around the cities of Bologna and Modena and are preserved in a sugar syrup, which makes them perfect for drizzling over a plain cake, or toping off a dish of vanilla ice cream.  When ground to a paste and set in a sweet pastry crust, Amarena cherries make such a dense and intense-tasting tart that a mere sliver of a wedge will make you swoon.  Amarena cherries are very expensive, so make this tart for a special occasion.  One export company, Fabbri, sells them in beautiful blue and white glass jars.  These are available in Italian specialty stores or by mail order.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2            cup  hazelnuts
  1                cup  butter - (2 sticks) -- plus
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  5                     eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  baking cocoa
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  confectioner's sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the nuts on a cookie sheet and toast in the oven for about 5 minutes.  Watch carefully so they do not burn.  Cool the nuts, then coarsely chop them and set aside.

In a large bowl with an electric mixer, cream 1 cup butter with the sugar until lemon colored.  Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating each in completely.  Add the vanilla and continue to beat a few seconds more.

Sift the flour, cocoa, and baking powder together.  Using an electric mixer, gradually add the flour mixture to the egg mixture.  Fold in the nuts and set aside.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt until very stiff.  With a rubber spatula, fold the egg whites a little at a time into the egg mixture until no streaks of white remain.

With the remaining tablespoon of butter, grease a deep 9 1/2-inch springform pan, then dust the pan with flour, shaking out the excess.  Spread the batter in the pan and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the middle comes out clean.

Let the cake cool in the pan for 20 minutes.  Carefully release the sides of the pan, remove the bottom, and let cake cool on a rack.

When ready to serve, dust the cake with confectioner's sugar.

This recipe yields one 9-inch cake.

Comments:  I make this dense chocolate cake dotted with chopped hazelnuts frequently because it is a good keeperÖbut it rarely lasts long.  Cut it in small wedges and serve it with espresso.  For best results, lightly spoon the flour into your measuring cup; do not pack it in.

<DirT>
Let the cake cool in the pan for 20 minutes.  Carefully release the sides of the pan, remove the bottom, and let cake cool on a rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, dust the cake with confectioner&apos;s sugar.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields one 9-inch cake.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  I make this dense chocolate cake dotted with chopped hazelnuts frequently because it is a good keeperÖbut it rarely lasts long.  Cut it in small wedges and serve it with espresso.  For best results, lightly spoon the flour into your measuring cup; do not pack it in.

         Chocolate Fantasy Cake - {Torta Fantasia Di Cioccolate}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2               cups  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  8             ounces  butter - (2 sticks)
     1/2           cup  brewed espresso
                        = (or other strong coffee)
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     1/4           cup  baking cocoa -- plus
  1         tablespoon  baking cocoa
     1/2           cup  mascarpone cheese -- room temperature
  2                     eggs -- slightly beaten
  2          teaspoons  almond extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease an 8- by 2-inch round pan and set aside.  In the bowl of an electric mixer, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.  Set aside.

In a saucepan, melt the butter.  Remove the pan from the heat and add the coffee, orange juice, and cocoa, stirring well to combine.  Pour the butter mixture over the flour mixture.  Add the cheese, eggs, and almond extract, and beat the ingredients until the batter is smooth.

Pour the batter into the pan and bake it for 35 to 45 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the middle comes out clean.

Let the cake cool in the pan, then carefully unmold it onto a serving plate.  Serve the cake as is, or sprinkled with confectioner's sugar.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Wondering what to do with some leftover mascarpone cheese (a sweet dessert cheese from northern Italy), a few dried out oranges, and some cold espresso coffee, I decided to make a cake.  To me, it is the perfect cake -- dense, yet moist -- and needs no fancy embellishment.  If wrapped well, it will remain moist for a week.  It also freezes beautifully for up to 3 months.  Ricotta cheese can be substituted for the mascarpone.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2               cups  sugar
  6        tablespoons  cocoa
                        = (Perugina, if available)
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  2               cups  cold water
                        === FROSTING ===
  2           packages  Philadelphia Lite Cream Cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  3 1/2           cups  confectioners sugar - (to 4)
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon oil
                        = (or 1 tbspn almond extract)
                        Crystallized white sugar -- for sprinkling on
                        top

Butter and flour two 9-inch cake pans and set aside.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Mix the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda and salt together in a large bowl.  With a hand mixer on low speed beat in the oil, vinegar, vanilla, and water until smooth.  Pour the mixture into the prepared pans.

Bake for 30 minutes or until a cake skewer inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.  Do not overbake the cake.  It should be firm to the touch, and a cake skewer inserted in the middle of the cake should come out clean.

Put the cake pans on cooling racks and cool for 15 to 20 minutes before removing the cakes from the pans to cool completely.  Frost when cool with frosting below.

Beat the cream cheese in a bowl until smooth; gradually add in enough of the sugar to make a smooth frosting that is not runny.  Stir in the cinnamon oil or the almond extract.

Frost the cake layers and sprinkle the crystallized sugar over the top.  Or if you are making the cupcakes, frost them and sprinkle the tops with the sugar.

Cut the cake into wedges to serve.

Note:  You may use either regular all purpose flour or cake flour in this recipe; both will give great results.  For the icing, use either the cream cheese or an equal amount of Marscapone cheese for an even richer frosting.

This recipe yields 1 cake.

Comments:  Even cakes taste better made with olive oil, and this super chocolate, dense cake is so moist that it keeps well for a week in the refrigerator, but I can say with certainty that it will never last that long; as an alternative the batter can be poured into cupcake pans for smaller versions.  This cake freezes well too.

                    Crumbly Cake - {Torta Sbrisolona}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/3           cups  finely-ground cornmeal
  1                cup  whole almonds -- finely chopped
  1                cup  sugar
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  lard
  3              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
                        Grated zest of 1 lemon
                        Confectioner's sugar -- for sprinkling

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a 10- by 2-inch round cake pan.

In a bowl, mix the flour, cornmeal, almonds, and sugar together.  With a pastry blender or your hands, work in the butter and lard until the mixture is the consistency of coarse cornmeal.

In a medium bowl, beat the eggs, vanilla, and lemon zest together.  Add to the flour and blend with your hands.  The batter will be very stiff.

Pat the batter into the pan, smoothing the top.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top is nicely browned.

Let the cake cool completely in the pan on a rack, then dust the top with confectioner's sugar.  Cut into wedges to serve.

Variation:  Serve the cake as a shortcake, either split in half or whole, with sliced and sugared fresh strawberries or other fruits.  It is also good with ice cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This flat, crumbly cake comes from Mantua in the region of Lombardy.  My friend Terri Rozzi, who comes from that region, gave me her recipe, which I have altered slightly.  Use finely ground cornmeal; if you have only coarse cornmeal, grind it fine in a food processor.  This batter is more the consistency of a dough; don't be surprised by its compactness and dryness, which give it its crumbly texture and its name.  This is a good cake to have on hand for company.

  1         tablespoon  milk
  1         tablespoon  turbinado (coarse brown) sugar

In a bowl or in a food processor, mix the flour, salt, and sugar together.  Work in the butter with a pastry blender, or pulse several times, until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  Blend in the yolks and water, or add through the feed tube and pulse to blend, until a ball of dough is formed.  If the dough seems dry, add a little more water.  Divide the dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other, and wrap in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place the pine nuts on a cookie sheet and lightly toast them, about 7 minutes.  Watch carefully so they do not burn.  Place the pine nuts in a small bowl, and set aside.  Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees.

Put the figs in a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a gentle boil.  Simmer for about 10 minutes, until softened.  Drain and let cool.

Remove the stems, cut the figs into small pieces, and place in a large bowl.  Add the pears, lemon juice, orange peel, and sugar and toss well.  Cover and let marinate while you roll out the dough.

Lightly butter an 11-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  On a floured surface, roll out the larger piece of dough to a 14-inch circle.  Fit the dough into the tart pan, and trim off the excess dough.  (If the dough tears, simply patch it with the scraps.)

Spread the filling evenly in the tart pan.

Roll the remaining dough into a 12-inch circle.  Using a pastry wheel, cut twelve 1/2-inch-wide strips.  Make a crisscross or lattice top on the filling with the strips, trim the ends, and pinch the ends to seal.  Brush the strips with the milk and sprinkle the turbinado sugar evenly over the top.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.  Cool completely on a wire rack, and cut into wedges to serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A crostata is a two-crusted pie.  This one is a favorite of my husband, Guy, because it reminds him of another holiday favorite, mincemeat.  Pasta frolla (pastry dough) encases a dense filling of dried figs, fresh pears, pine nuts, and candied orange peel.  I use tiny Seckel pears in this recipe, but ripe Bosc pears will work too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  2               cups  cake flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter or margarine - (2 sticks)
  1                cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
  4              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  finely-ground hazelnuts
                        === FROSTING ===
     1/2           cup  solid vegetable shortening
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  8               cups  confectioners' sugar
  1         tablespoon  almond extract
                        Currants for the lamb's eyes
                        Almond confetti
                        Colored ribbon

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 10- by 4-inch two-piece lamb cake mold well with butter and dust it with flour.  Sift the flour, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt together into a bowl.

In another bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar until pale yellow.  Beat in the zests, vanilla, and almond extracts.  Beat in the eggs one at a time.  Then gradually beat in the flour mixture.  Fold in the nuts.

Spoon the batter into the bottom half of the mold.  Place the top piece of the mold over the bottom, making sure the fit is even.  Bake for 40 to 45 minutes.  Carefully lift off the top of the mold and test the cake for doneness; if it is still soft in the middle, bake about 10 to 15 minutes longer, until firm, without replacing the mold top.  A cake tester inserted in the middle should come out clean.  Remove the mold to a rack to cool completely.

In a bowl, beat the shortening and butter until smooth.  Gradually beat in the sugar.  Beat in the almond extract.  The frosting should be firm enough to pipe through a pastry bag.  Chill if necessary.

Run a knife around the edges of the mold and carefully remove the cake.  Stand the cake upright on a cake stand or decorative platter.  You may need to glue the base of the cake to the serving dish by spreading some frosting on it.

Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip with frosting and squiggle the frosting over the cake to simulate wool.  Use the currants for eyes and sprinkle almond confetti along the lamb's back and at the base of the cake to give it a festive look.  Tie a ribbon carefully around the neck.  To serve, cut the cake into thin slices.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  cake flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  cake flour
  1              pinch  salt
  3              large  eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
     3/4           cup  sugar
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  milk
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
     3/4           cup  diced mixed dried fruits
                        = (such as apricots, pears, and apples)
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  1         tablespoon  Alchermes
                        = (or rum or raspberry brandy)
  1 1/4           cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        Dried apricots, pears, and/or apples -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter and flour a 9-inch round cake pan.  Sift the flour and salt onto wax paper.

In a bowl, beat the egg yolks until lemon-colored.  Gradually beat in the sugar.

In another bowl, with clean beaters, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry.  Gradually fold the whites into the egg yolk mixture until well blended.  Spoon the flour over the batter a little at a time, and fold in until no streaks of flour remain.

Pour the batter into the pan.  Bake for 25 minutes, or until the cake is delicately browned and a cake skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean.  Let the cake cool completely in the pan on a rack, then use a knife to loosen the cake from the edges of the pan and invert it onto a rack.

Meanwhile, make the filling.  In a small saucepan, scald the milk (bring to just under a boil).  Let cool to warm.

In the top of a double boiler, off the heat, whisk the yolks with the sugar until smooth.  Gradually whisk in the flour.  Slowly whisk in the warm milk.  Place the double boiler over medium-low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the filling thickens and coats the whisk.  Remove the top of the double boiler from the heat and stir in the butter, zest, vanilla, and diced fruits.  Set the pan in a pan of ice cubes and water to cool.

When cool, transfer the filling to a bowl, cover with a piece of buttered wax paper, pressing it against the surface of the filling, and refrigerate for several hours, or overnight.

To assemble the cake, use a serrated knife to split the cake into 2 layers.  Place one layer on a serving plate.  Sprinkle with the Alchermes, rum, or raspberry brandy.  Spread the filling evenly over the layer.  Top with the second layer.  Refrigerate until chilled.  (The cake can be loosely covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated overnight.)

In a bowl, beat the cream with the confectioners' sugar until still peaks form.  Fill a pastry bag fitted with a star tip with the cream.  Pipe a decorative border around the top and bottom edges of the cake.  If you wish, arrange dried fruits in the cream.  Cut the cake into wedges with a serrated knife.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Zuppa inglese is similar to English trifle.  The name derives from the word inzuppare, which means "to moisten" or "to soak".  In this recipe, the cake, which is similar to a sponge cake, is split and sprinkled with Alchermes, a spicy red liqueur made from cochineal and used in many Italian desserts.  If Alchermes is difficult to find, substitute brandy or raspberry liqueur.  The cake is best make a day ahead; add the whipped cream toping just before serving.

Spread the filling evenly over the layer.  Top with the second layer.  Refrigerate until chilled.  (The cake can be loosely covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated overnight.)

In a bowl, beat the cream with the confectioners&apos; sugar until still peaks form.  Fill a pastry bag fitted with a star tip with the cream.  Pipe a decorative border around the top and bottom edges of the cake.  If you wish, arrange dried fruits in the cream.  Cut the cake into wedges with a serrated knife.

Comments:  Zuppa inglese is similar to English trifle.  The name derives from the word inzuppare, which means &quot;to moisten&quot; or &quot;to soak&quot;.  In this recipe, the cake, which is similar to a sponge cake, is split and sprinkled with Alchermes, a spicy red liqueur made from cochineal and used in many Italian desserts.  If Alchermes is difficult to find, substitute brandy or raspberry liqueur.  The cake is best make a day ahead; add the whipped cream toping just before serving.

               Eyes Of Saint Lucy - {Occhi Di Santa Lucia}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 2/3           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 5)
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
  1                cup  milk
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for sprinkling

In a bowl, mix together 4 cups of the flour, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, and the salt.

In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and milk together.  Stir the mixture into the flour mixture, adding enough additional flour to make a soft ball of dough.

On a floured surface, knead the dough until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide the dough in half.  Roll out each piece into a rectangle about 15 by 12 inches.  Sprinkle each rectangle evenly with half of the remaining sugar and roll up tightly like a jelly roll.  Cut the rolls into 1/2-inch-thick slices.

In a deep-fryer or deep heavy pot, heat the vegetable oil to 375 degrees.  Fry the cookies, a few at a time, until golden brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon to brown paper to drain.  Sprinkle the cookies with confectioners' sugar and serve.

This recipe yields about 5 dozen.

Comments:  Expressions of devotion on the Feast of Saint Lucy are not always in the form of prayer; the making of these cookies, formed in the shape of eyes, is a tradition in honor of this revered saint, the protector of eyesight.  These fried cookies are best eaten warm as soon as they are made.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  5        tablespoons  butter -- chilled, and
                        cut in pieces
  1              large  egg
  1              pinch  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg*
  2        tablespoons  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  apricot jam
  4               cups  hulled strawberries
                        = (or an assortment of blackberries,
                        raspberries, melon balls, kiwi and/or
                        seeded green and black grapes)
     1/2           cup  water
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
                        Mascarpone cheese -- (optional)

* Note: Nutmeg is optional in the tart shell; some Italian chefs use grated lemon rind.

To make the pastry, in a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, and butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse corn meal.  Add the egg, salt, nutmeg, and almond extract.  Pulse just to blend.  With the motor running, add the water gradually through the feed tube and process until the mixture begins to form a ball; you may not need all of the water.  (If you prefer, combine the flour, salt, and sugar in a bowl and use a pastry blender to work the mixture until it resembles coarse corn meal.  Mix in the egg, salt, nutmeg, and almond extract.  Add the water gradually, adding just enough to form the mixture into a ball of dough.)  Wrap the dough in waxed paper and chill for at least 2 hours, or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place the dough between 2 clean sheets of waxed paper and roll it out to fit a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Fit the dough into the pan and trim off the excess dough.  Prick the dough in several places with a fork.  Put a sheet of foil or waxed paper over the dough and weigh it down with dried beans or rice.  Bake for 12 minutes, remove the foil and beans, and bake for about 3 to 5 minutes more, or until light golden brown.  Let cool on a rack.

Filling:  In a small saucepan, heat the apricot jam until smooth and melted.  Brush the crust with the jam to seal it.  Reserve 1/2 cup of fruit for the glaze, and arrange the remaining fruit in a decorative pattern in the tart shell.  Set aside while you make the glaze.

Cut the reserved fruit into coarse pieces and place in a saucepan.  Add the 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil.  Boil until the fruit is soft, about 3 minutes.  Transfer to a strainer set over a bowl.  Mash the fruit with a wooden spoon and press against the solids to extract as much of the juices as possible.  Discard the solids.  Add enough water to the strained juices to make 1 cup.

In a saucepan mix the sugar and cornstarch together.  Slowly add the strained juice and mix well.  Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture begins to thicken and becomes clear, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the almond extract.  Let cool for 5 minutes.

Using a pastry brush, coat the fruit in the tart shell with the glaze, letting some of the glaze run down between the fruit.  Chill the tart for at least 2 hours.

To serve, slice the tart and place a dollop of mascarpone on the side of each serving, if you wish.

Variation:  A thin layer of mascarpone can be spread over the crust before the fresh fruit is added.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY CREAM ===
  1 2/3           cups  whole milk
                        Grated zest of 1 large lemon
  6                     egg yolks -- plus
  1              whole  egg -- slightly beaten
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1              piece  vanilla bean - (2" long)
                        = (or 2 tspns vanilla or almond extract)
                        === PASTRY DOUGH ===
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  5        tablespoons  unsalted cold butter -- cut into bits
  1              large  egg yolk
  1         tablespoon  white vinegar
  3        tablespoons  cold water
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  2        tablespoons  apricot jam
                        Assorted fresh fruits -- (strawberries,
                        blackberries, cherries, raspberries,
                        plums, nectarines, peaches) cut into thin
                        slices or left whole to arrange on top of
                        the tart
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for sprinkling

Pour the milk into a 1 quart saucepan and stir in the lemon zest.  Heat it over low heat just until bubbles start to appear at the edge of the pan.  Remove the pan from the heat and set it aside while you beat the egg yolks, egg, and sugar in a bowl with a hand-held mixer until the eggs look very pale yellow.  Slowly beat in the flour and the salt until the mixture is well blended.  Pour the heated milk into the bowl and stir with a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients well.  Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.  Remove the saucepan from the heat, stir in the butter, then add the vanilla bean or stir in the vanilla or almond extract.  Pour the pastry cream into a clean bowl and cover it with a piece of wax paper or plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming on top of the cream.  Refrigerate until needed.  This can be made at least three days ahead of time.  Remove the vanilla bean before using the pastry cream.

Pastry Dough:  Use a food processor or your hands to make the dough.  Pulse the flour, sugar, salt, and butter together in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the dough blade, or blend the ingredients together in a large bowl with a fork or pastry blender until the butter is in small bits.  The whole idea here is to coat the flour proteins with the butter to prevent gluten from forming which would make a tough pastry dough, so be sure the butter is very cold.

Beat the egg yolk and the vinegar together in a small bowl with a fork.  Add this to the food processor with the motor running, or to the bowl if you are making this by hand, and process or blend until a rough-looking dough starts to form.  Slowly add in enough of the cold water for a ball of dough to form that holds together.  The dough does not need to form a complete ball of dough but you should be able to gather it up without it crumbling.

Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour or overnight to make it easier to roll.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly butter a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and set aside.

Flatten the dough with a rolling pin and roll it between 2 sheets of wax paper into a 12-inch circle.  Dust the top of the dough lightly with flour, then fold it in fourths.  Lift the dough and position it with the point of the fold in the center of the tart pan.  Unfold the dough and fit it into the pan, allowing the excess to drape over the sides.  Trim the edges even with a scissors and press the dough even with the top of the pan.  Poke holes in the tart shell with a fork to allow for air to escape during baking.  Place a sheet of foil over the top of the dough and weigh it down with dried beans or rice; this will help prevent the tart shell from puffing up as it bakes.

Bake the tart shell for 10 minutes, then remove the foil and beans and bake the tart 2 or 3 minutes longer, or until it is light golden brown.  Let the tart shell cool to room temperature on a cooling rack.

Heat the apricot jam until it melts.  Cool slightly then brush the jam over the base of the shell; this will seal it and prevent it from becoming soggy when the pastry cream is added.

Spread the pastry cream in the shell.  Chill uncovered for 2 hours.

Arrange the selection of fruits on top of the pastry cream in a decorative pattern.  Sometimes I also add long ribbons of shaved chocolate on top of the fruit, but this is optional.  Sprinkle the tart with confectioners' sugar.  Cut into wedges to serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Making a fruit tart like those in Sandri's display windows in not difficult at all.  Here is how to construct one of your own.  Begin by making a short-cut pastry dough that is fitted into a tart shell pan, and then baked.  A velvety pastry cream is spread over the tart, and last a variety of fresh seasonal fruits are arranged on top.  Both the dough and the pastry cream can be made ahead of time.  Be artistic in how you arrange the fruit, mixing and matching to achieve vivid color.  Signora Carla would be proud!

Pour the milk into a 1 quart saucepan and stir in the lemon zest.  Heat it over low heat just until bubbles start to appear at the edge of the pan.  Remove the pan from the heat and set it aside while you beat the egg yolks, egg, and sugar in a bowl with a hand-held mixer until the eggs look very pale yellow.  Slowly beat in the flour and the salt until the mixture is well blended.  Pour the heated milk into the bowl and stir with a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients well.  Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture coats the back of a spoon.  Remove the saucepan from the heat, stir in the butter, then add the vanilla bean or stir in the vanilla or almond extract.  Pour the pastry cream into a clean bowl and cover it with a piece of wax paper or plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming on top of the cream.  Refrigerate until needed.  This can be made at least three days ahead of time.  Remove the vanilla bean before using the pastry cream.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pastry Dough:  Use a food processor or your hands to make the dough.  Pulse the flour, sugar, salt, and butter together in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the dough blade, or blend the ingredients together in a large bowl with a fork or pastry blender until the butter is in small bits.  The whole idea here is to coat the flour proteins with the butter to prevent gluten from forming which would make a tough pastry dough, so be sure the butter is very cold.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat the egg yolk and the vinegar together in a small bowl with a fork.  Add this to the food processor with the motor running, or to the bowl if you are making this by hand, and process or blend until a rough-looking dough starts to form.  Slowly add in enough of the cold water for a ball of dough to form that holds together.  The dough does not need to form a complete ball of dough but you should be able to gather it up without it crumbling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour or overnight to make it easier to roll.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly butter a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Flatten the dough with a rolling pin and roll it between 2 sheets of wax paper into a 12-inch circle.  Dust the top of the dough lightly with flour, then fold it in fourths.  Lift the dough and position it with the point of the fold in the center of the tart pan.  Unfold the dough and fit it into the pan, allowing the excess to drape over the sides.  Trim the edges even with a scissors and press the dough even with the top of the pan.  Poke holes in the tart shell with a fork to allow for air to escape during baking.  Place a sheet of foil over the top of the dough and weigh it down with dried beans or rice; this will help prevent the tart shell from puffing up as it bakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the tart shell for 10 minutes, then remove the foil and beans and bake the tart 2 or 3 minutes longer, or until it is light golden brown.  Let the tart shell cool to room temperature on a cooling rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the apricot jam until it melts.  Cool slightly then brush the jam over the base of the shell; this will seal it and prevent it from becoming soggy when the pastry cream is added.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the pastry cream in the shell.  Chill uncovered for 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the selection of fruits on top of the pastry cream in a decorative pattern.  Sometimes I also add long ribbons of shaved chocolate on top of the fruit, but this is optional.  Sprinkle the tart with confectioners&apos; sugar.  Cut into wedges to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Making a fruit tart like those in Sandri&apos;s display windows in not difficult at all.  Here is how to construct one of your own.  Begin by making a short-cut pastry dough that is fitted into a tart shell pan, and then baked.  A velvety pastry cream is spread over the tart, and last a variety of fresh seasonal fruits are arranged on top.  Both the dough and the pastry cream can be made ahead of time.  Be artistic in how you arrange the fruit, mixing and matching to achieve vivid color.  Signora Carla would be proud!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs
  2              large  egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Grated zest of 1 lemon
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for coating

Sift the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt, together into a bowl.

In another bowl, stir the eggs, egg yolks, olive oil, lemon juice, and zest together until well blended.  Stir in the flour mixture to form a thick batter.

In a deep-flyer or deep heavy pot, heat the vegetable oil to 375 degrees.  Drop tablespoons of the batter into the oil and fry until golden brown and puffed.  Remove to brown paper to drain and cool.

Put the confectioners' sugar in a heavy paper bag.  Add a few puffs at a time and shake them in the bag to coat with the sugar.

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  Crostoli means "crusty," and these fried puffs of dough remind me of fritters.  They are made during Carnevale, just before Lent, and for Easter in the Naples area.  This recipe is from my good friend Maria Castaldo Esposito.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  hazelnuts
     1/2           cup  candied orange peel -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  candied lemon peel -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  mace or ground nutmeg
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  honey
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for sprinkling

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Grease an 8- or 9-inch pie pan or round cake pan with butter.  Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper and grease the paper.  Place the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast for 5 to 8 minutes.  Let cool.  Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.

Coarsely chop the hazelnuts.  Put them in a bowl, add the candied citrus peel, cocoa, flour, and spices; mix well.  Set aside.

In a saucepan, combine the sugar and honey and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.  Cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes or until a spoonful of the mixture forms a ball when dropped into a bowl of cold water.

Add the sugar syrup to the flour and nut mixture and stir to mix well.  Pour into the pan and pat the top smooth.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until firm to the touch and a cake tester inserted in the middle comes out clean.  Carefully turn the cake out onto a rack and remove the parchment paper.  Invert the cake onto another rack and let cool completely.

Sprinkle the cake liberally with confectioners' sugar.  Cut into small wedges to serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Although panforte literally means "strong bread", this is more like a spicy, dense flat cake.  It is a specialty of Siena, but its origins date back to the Renaissance, when it was characteristic to use an abundance of spices in many foods for both flavor and preservation.  Panforte is enjoyed year-round, but it is especially welcome at Christmastime, wrapped in its artistic Renaissance-inspired paper.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  hazelnuts
     1/2           cup  slivered almonds
     1/2           cup  diced candied orange peel
     1/2           cup  diced candied lemon peel
     1/4           cup  Dutch process cocoa
                        = (such as Droste)
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  mace
     1/4      teaspoon  coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white or black pepper
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  honey
  1               drop  cinnamon oil
                        Rice paper -- (optional)
                        Confectioners' sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter an 8-inch cake pan, line it with rice paper cut to fit, or parchment paper.  Butter the rice paper or parchment paper and set the pan aside.

Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast them for 5 minutes.  Let cool.  Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.

Coarsely chop the hazelnuts and almonds coarsely.  Transfer them to a glass bowl and stir in the candied citrus peels, cocoa, flour, and spices; mix well.  Set aside.

Combine the sugar and honey in a small saucepan; bring the mixture to a boil and cook for 3 or 4 minutes or until the mixture registers 248 degrees on a candy thermometer or a small amount dropped into cold water forms a ball when squeezed.  Add the cinnamon oil and then pour the liquid into the dry ingredients and work quickly to mix everything well.  The mixture will be stiff and sticky and hard to mix.  I use a soupspoon to help gather up the ingredients.

Scoop and spread the mixture into the prepared cake pan.  The mixture should be no more than 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick in the pan.  Keep a bowl of water handy and wet your hands to help you pat the mixture into the pan.

Bake for 25 minutes or until firm to the touch.  While still warm, run a butter knife along the inside edge of the pan, then invert the cake onto a cooling rack.  If you used parchment paper on the bottom of the cake, remove it and discard.  Carefully turn the cake right side up.

If you used rice paper, do not remove it.  Allow the cake to cool for 5 minutes then turn it right side up.

Allow the cake to cool completely, then dust it liberally with confectioners' sugar.  Serve cut into thin wedges.

Note:  Cake decorating supply stores often have unique looking wrapping papers with Florentine and Renaissance designs that are perfect for wrapping panforte to give as a gift.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Panforte is probably the most revered cake at Nannini's in Siena.  You can tell by just looking at it that it is a chewy, dense, fruitcake, chock full of spices, fruit and nuts.  Because of all the spices, panforte had a long shelf life and was even carried into battle as sustenance for hungry soldiers.  Traditionally edible rice paper lines the baking pan, but it is not critical if you cannot find rice paper.  Wrapped in beautiful Florentine papers, often with historic scenes on them, this bread-cake makes a wonderful gift.

<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter an 8-inch cake pan, line it with rice paper cut to fit, or parchment paper.  Butter the rice paper or parchment paper and set the pan aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast them for 5 minutes.  Let cool.  Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Coarsely chop the hazelnuts and almonds coarsely.  Transfer them to a glass bowl and stir in the candied citrus peels, cocoa, flour, and spices; mix well.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the sugar and honey in a small saucepan; bring the mixture to a boil and cook for 3 or 4 minutes or until the mixture registers 248 degrees on a candy thermometer or a small amount dropped into cold water forms a ball when squeezed.  Add the cinnamon oil and then pour the liquid into the dry ingredients and work quickly to mix everything well.  The mixture will be stiff and sticky and hard to mix.  I use a soupspoon to help gather up the ingredients.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Scoop and spread the mixture into the prepared cake pan.  The mixture should be no more than 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick in the pan.  Keep a bowl of water handy and wet your hands to help you pat the mixture into the pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake for 25 minutes or until firm to the touch.  While still warm, run a butter knife along the inside edge of the pan, then invert the cake onto a cooling rack.  If you used parchment paper on the bottom of the cake, remove it and discard.  Carefully turn the cake right side up.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you used rice paper, do not remove it.  Allow the cake to cool for 5 minutes then turn it right side up.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Allow the cake to cool completely, then dust it liberally with confectioners&apos; sugar.  Serve cut into thin wedges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Cake decorating supply stores often have unique looking wrapping papers with Florentine and Renaissance designs that are perfect for wrapping panforte to give as a gift.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Panforte is probably the most revered cake at Nannini&apos;s in Siena.  You can tell by just looking at it that it is a chewy, dense, fruitcake, chock full of spices, fruit and nuts.  Because of all the spices, panforte had a long shelf life and was even carried into battle as sustenance for hungry soldiers.  Traditionally edible rice paper lines the baking pan, but it is not critical if you cannot find rice paper.  Wrapped in beautiful Florentine papers, often with historic scenes on them, this bread-cake makes a wonderful gift.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1                cup  solid vegetable shortening or lard
     1/2           cup  milk
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
  1              large  egg
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  milk
     1/2           cup  semolina flour
  2               cups  well-drained ricotta cheese
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  grated orange zest
  2        tablespoons  fresh orange juice
     1/4           cup  apricot jam -- warmed
     3/4           cup  toasted slivered almonds
     1/3           cup  confectioner's sugar

In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder.  With a fork or your hands, cut in the shortening or lard until the mixture is coarse.

In a separate bowl, lightly whisk the milk, vanilla, and egg together and add to the flour mixture.  Combine with your hands until a soft ball of dough is formed.  Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.

In a medium saucepan, bring the milk for the filling just to a boil.  With a wooden spoon, stir in the semolina flour in a thin stream and continue to stir until the mixture thickens and leaves the sides of the pan.  Remove from the heat and let cool to lukewarm.

In a large bowl, mix the ricotta, eggs, sugar, orange zest, and juice.  Add the semolina mixture and beat with an electric mixer just until blended.  Set the filling aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Divide the dough in half and roll 1 piece on a floured surface into a 15- by 11 1/2-inch rectangle.  Place the dough on a greased cookie sheet of the same size and pat gently to fit.  Fill any small holes by stretching and patting the dough into place.  Spread the filling evenly over the dough to the edges.  Set aside.

Roll the remaining dough into another 15- by 11 1/2-inch sheet.  Using your rolling pin, carefully lift the dough and place it over the filling.  Use a fork to pinch the edges closed.  If a tear occurs, patch it with some of the dough.

Bake the pie for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned.  You may have to move the pie from the bottom rack to the middle rack for even browning.  Remove the pie from the oven and immediately brush with the warmed apricot jam.  Sprinkle the almonds evenly over the top, gently pressing them to adhere, and let the pie cool completely.

Before cutting and serving the pie, sprinkle the top evenly and generously with confectioner's sugar.  Cut into squares.

Variation:  Add 1/2 cup each raisins and diced citron to the filling.

This recipe yields one large rectangular pie.

Comments:  The pastry shop windows in any Italian town or city display works of edible art.  Usually I try something new each time.  At Il Forno in Florence, a popular local spot, I got in line with everyone else giving orders.  I chose the torta della nonna, or grandma's pie, and I was not disappointed.  This two-crusted flat pie, made in a long rectangular pan and cut in squares, was filled with ricotta and orange flavoring and topped with almonds and confectioner's sugar.  I wanted to know exactly how it was made, and when I asked, the answer was "Un po' di farina, zucchero, uove, e mandorle."  What follows is my recreation of this delicious pie.  When I made it the first time, I was surprised how close it came in appearance and taste to the original.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 3/4           cups  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  malt extract
                        = (or sugar)
  4        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  mascarpone cheese
  6               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 7)
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        === FILLING ===
  2 1/2           cups  dried mixed fruits -- diced
                        = (such as apricots, pears,
                        prunes, and/or apples)
     1/3           cup  coarsely-chopped hazelnuts
     1/4           cup  raisins
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4           cup  sweet marsala wine
  1                cup  apricot or orange marmalade
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  turbinado (coarse brown) sugar

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in 3/4 cup of the warm water, stir in the malt extract, and let proof for about 10 minutes, until foamy.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the butter, sugar, eggs, and mascarpone cheese until smooth.  Stir the remaining 1 cup water into the yeast mixture, then stir in the mascarpone mixture.  Slowly add 5 cups of the flour and the salt, and mix with your hands to form a ball of dough, adding additional flour if necessary, until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes.  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for about 2 hours.

Generously grease two 2-quart souffle dishes or round baking dishes.  You could also use 10-inch springform pans or oven-safe pottery bowls.  In a bowl, combine all the filling ingredients except the marmalade; mix well.

Punch down the dough and divide it in half.  On a well-floured surface, roll each piece into a 16-inch circle.  Spread 1/2 cup of the marmalade over each circle, leaving 1/2-inch around the outer edge, then sprinkle on half of the fruit mixture.  Roll up each piece like a jellyroll, tucking the edges in as you roll.  Pinch the seam tightly closed.  Turn each bread seam-side down, and shape into a spiral.  Place the breads in the souffle or baking dishes, cover, and let them rise for 30 minutes in a warm place.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Brush the tops of the spirals with the beaten egg, and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the turbinado sugar over each one.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the tops are nicely browned and a cake tester inserted in the middle comes out clean.  Let cool for 30 minutes.

Run a knife around the edges of each dish and carefully turn the breads out.  This bread is best eaten warm; the breads can be reheated in a warm oven.

Note:  The breads can be frozen.  Let cool completely, then wrap tightly in foil and freeze for up to 3 months.  To serve, unwrap and let thaw, then reheat in a warm oven.

This recipe yields 2 spiral-shaped breads.

Comments:  This impressive spiral-shaped bread is my version of an old Italian standby, the classic sweet nut-and-fruit-filled bread of Friuli called gubana.  I've added malt extract to fortify the proofing yeast and mascarpone cheese to create a delicate texture.  If you can't find these ingredients, you can use sugar in place of the malt extract and cream cheese instead of mascarpone.

                    Homemade Bread - {Pane Casereccio}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast - (0.25 oz)
  1 3/4           cups  warm filtered or
                        bottled noncarbonated water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 4 1/2)
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt

To make the dough by hand in a bowl, dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup of the water in a large bowl, stirring to mix well.  Let the yeast proof for about 5 minutes, or until tiny clusters of chalky-looking bubbles appear on the surface.  Stir the remaining 1 1/4 cups water and the olive oil into the proofed yeast.  Begin adding the flour to the yeast mixture, 1 cup at a time, mixing it in well with your hands.  Add the salt with the third cup of flour.  Add just enough flour so that the dough comes together in a shaggy mass.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it until you have a soft ball of dough that is slightly tacky but not sticking to your hands, about 5 minutes.  Lightly spray a large bowl with olive oil spray, put the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat it with oil.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Line a baker's peel with parchment paper or lightly spray a baking sheet with olive oil spray.  Set aside.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a floured surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until it is smooth and no longer sticky.  Form the dough into the shape you desire and place it on the baker's peel or baking sheet.  Cover the dough with a clean cloth and let it rise until almost doubled in size.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees if using a baking stone, or 400 degrees if baking the bread on a baking sheet.  If using a stone, put it on the lowest oven rack to preheat.

If using a stone, hold the handle of the baker's peel and with a quick jerking motion, slide the dough, with the parchment paper, onto the baking stone.  Using a mister, mist the oven walls with water and immediately close the oven door.  Repeat the misting process two or three times more during the first 10 minutes of baking.

If using a baking sheet, put the bread in the oven on the sheet and mist the oven following the instructions above.

Bake the bread on the stone for 35 to 40 minutes, or on the sheet for 40 to 45 minutes, until it is evenly browned on the top and bottom and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped.  Remove the bread to a cooling rack and let cool completely.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Pizza With Cresciuta -- (see recipe)
                        === TOPPING ===
  1              pound  Swiss chard -- cleaned, and
                        stems removed
  7        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  white onion -- thinly sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1             medium  yellow squash -- cut 4" by 1/4"
                        strips
     1/2           cup  grated Asiago cheese
     1/2           cup  grated ricotta salata cheese
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the Swiss chard leaves in a skillet and add 1 cup water.  Cover and cook over medium heat for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the leaves are tender.  Drain the Swiss chard well in a colander, using your hands to squeeze out the excess water.  When cool, chop coarsely and set aside.

In the same skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, add the onions and cook slowly over medium-low heat until translucent.  Remove the onions to a dish.  In the same pan add the Swiss chard, minced garlic, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Saute the Swiss chard for 3 to 4 minutes, add the salt and pepper, and mix well.  Remove to a dish and set aside.

Preheat the broiler.

In a small bowl, toss the squash with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Place the squash on a broiler pan lined with foil and broil for 5 minutes, or until they start to brown.  Remove the squash to a dish.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Lightly brush a 15- by 14-inch cookie sheet with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Roll the dough into a 16- by 15-inch rectangle.  Place the dough on the cookie sheet.  Create an edge by turning the edges in toward the center and pinching the dough with your fingers.

Spread the Swiss chard on top.  Sprinkle on the onions and the squash.  Sprinkle the cheeses over the top.  Drizzle on the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and add the pepper.

Bake the pizza for 25 to 30 minutes, or until it is a golden brown.  Cut into squares with kitchen scissors and serve immediately.

Note:  This makes a nice party appetizer when cut into small squares.

This recipe yields one 15- by 14-inch pizza.

Comments:  I make pizza at least once a week because it is my son Chris's favorite food.  The topping for this pizza was invented when I found some odds and ends of cheese in the refrigerator and vegetables from my garden.  When I took my creation out of the oven, it was so beautiful to look at that I snapped a picture of it.  To me it was a good example of the create-with-what's-on-hand style of home cooking I grew up with, and made me feel very close to my roots.  In this recipe, I have used Swiss chard, but you can use spinach as well.  As for the cheeses, use what you have on hand.

                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4                     hard-boiled extra-large egg yolks -- sieved, or
                        mashed with fork
     3/4           cup  jam -- more or less
                        = (apricot, raspberry or orange marmalade)
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for sprinkling

In a bowl, with an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar.  Beat in flour and then the vanilla and beat until a soft dough is formed.  Beat in the egg yolks just until blended.  Wrap the dough in wax paper and chill for at least 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease two cookie sheets.  Divide the dough in half.

On a well-floured surface, roll out each half 1/4-inch thick.  Use an assortment of cookie cutters to cut out the dough, making sure to cut out an even number of each shape, and place the cookies about 1 inch apart on the cookie sheets.

Spread a thin coating of jam over half the cookies, and top each one with another cookie to form a sandwich.  Seal the edges by pressing on all sides with the tines of a fork.

Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly browned.  Let cool on the cookie sheets for a few minutes before removing them to cooling racks.

When cool, sprinkle the cookies with confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

Comments:  These jam-filled cookies have a shortbread-like texture.  Sieved hard-boiled egg yolks in the dough give it an added richness.  This dough can be rolled out and cut into various shapes to fit the occasion.

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  milk
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
     2/3           cup  sugar
  5               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (5 1/4)
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  milk -- for egg wash
                        Turbinado (coarse brown) sugar -- for sprinkling
                        Raisins or currants

In a saucepan, scald the milk (bring almost to a boil).  Let cool until warm (110 degrees  to 115 degrees).  Pour the milk into a large bowl, add the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the sugar and stir to blend.  Cover and let proof for about 10 minutes, until the yeast is foamy.

In another bowl, mix 5 cups flour, the salt, and the remaining sugar together.  Add the butter and work it into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal.  Slowly add the yeast mixture, and mix with your hands until a ball of dough is formed, adding additional flour only if the dough is very sticky.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 10 minutes.

Lightly butter a bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Grease two cookie sheets.  Punch down the dough and divide it into 24 equal pieces.  Use 4 pieces for each bear: Roll 3 pieces of dough into balls about 2 inches in diameter.  Place the balls of dough together in a line on one of the cookie sheets, as if making a snowman: One for the head, one for the upper body, and one for the lower body.  Divide the fourth piece of dough into 7 pieces for the ears, nose, feet, and hands, and attach to the bear.  Repeat with the remaining dough, placing the bears 3 inches apart on the sheets.  Cover with a towel and let rise for 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Insert raisins or currants into the heads for the bears' eyes.  Brush the bears with the egg wash and sprinkle the bodies with the coarse sugar.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.

Cool on wire racks, then tie ribbons around the necks.

Note:  You can make more bears by using smaller pieces of dough.  These freeze beautifully and can be made 2 to 3 weeks ahead.  Wrap them individually in foil and place in freezer bags (add the ribbons after thawing).  Or use the bears as placecards at children's birthday parties: Print each child's name on a paper flag made from a toothpick and a small piece of paper, and insert into the bears' paws.

This recipe yields 6 breads.

Comments:  These bear-shaped breads are a favorite at holiday time, and they make unique favors for a children's party.  Dress them up with brightly colored bows around their necks.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  water
     2/3          cups  whole natural almonds -- more or less
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  turbinado (coarse brown) sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease two cookie sheets.  In a bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, and salt.  Add the wine, oil, and water, and mix with a fork until a ball of dough begins to form.  Alternatively, make the dough in a food processor; combine the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of the processor.  Add the wine, oil, and water through the feed tube, pulsing until a dough begins to form.

Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead a few times, until smooth.  (You should not need to add any flour.)  The dough will be soft.

Pinch off 1-inch pieces of dough and roll each one under the palms of your hands into a 6-inch rope.  To shape each cookie, braid two ropes together to form a twist, and place on the cookie sheets.

Insert 5 almonds in the folds of each twist, spacing them evenly.  Brush the tops of the braids with the beaten egg, and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the braids are lightly browned.  Remove the braids to wire racks to cool completely.

Note:  These can be made larger or smaller as you wish.  They can be frozen for up to 2 months in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  I found these little braided cookies in a pasticceria in the very baroque city of Lecce in Puglia.  The dough, which has just a hint of sweetness, is made with flour, olive oil and wine.  I like these with a glass of chilled Moscato dessert wine.

                         Little Rolls - {Panini}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose floor - (to 4 1/2)
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  warm milk -- (110 to 115 degrees)
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  5        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/4           cup  water

Mound 4 cups flour on a work surface and make a well in the center.  Place the yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in the well and mix together.  Add l/4 cup of the warm milk and, with your hands, begin incorporating the flour from the inside avails of the well into the yeast mixture.  Use just enough of the flour to make a ball of dough about the size of an orange: this is the panetto.  Leave the panetto in the well, cover with a clean cloth, and let rest for 15 minutes.

Add 2 tablespoons of the sugar, the salt, egg, the remaining 3/4 cup milk, and the butter to the well.  With your fingers, carefully break up the panetto into the other ingredients.  Then incorporate the remaining flour from the sides of the well, working the mixture with your hands until a ball of dough is formed, adding additional flour if necessary.  Knead the dough until smooth and elastic.

Cover the dough with a bowl and let rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.

Generously butter two cookie sheets.  Punch down the dough and divide it into 12 equal pieces.  On a floured surface, shape each piece into a 4-inch oval, and place the rolls 1 inch apart on the cookie sheets.  Cover the rolls with clean cloths and let rise for 50 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 575 degrees.  In a small bowl dissolve the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in the water.

Brush the rolls with the sugar glaze.  Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the rolls are nicely browned on top.  Remove to racks to cool.

This recipe yields 1 dozen.

Comments:  These versatile, oval-shaped rolls make wonderful dinner rolls.  Or fill for sandwiches, serve with soup, or toast and eat for breakfast.  The dough is strengthened by a panetto, a small bit of dough and set well in a well in the middle of the flour and left to rise for 15 minutes.

                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
  1 1/2           cups  chopped celery
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dark raisins
  1 1/2           cups  cubed (1/2") stale bread
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
                        === FOR THE CHICKEN ===
  1                     roasting chicken - (4 lbs) -- rinsed and dried
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted

In a medium skillet, melt the butter.  Add the onions and celery and cook until translucent.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the raisins and cook 1 minute longer.  Set aside.

Place the bread cubes in a large bowl and moisten them with the broth.  Gently stir in the onion and celery mixture.  Let cool.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Season the cavity of the chicken with salt and pepper.  Stuff the cavity loosely with the bread mixture, and sew the cavity closed with butcher's twine or skewer it closed if desired.  Baste the chicken all over with the melted butter.  Place on a rack in a roasting pan, breast-side up.

Roast the chicken, basting occasionally with the pan drippings, for about 1 1/2 hours, until the juices from the thigh run clear when it is pierced.  Remove the chicken to a cutting board and let it cool for 10 minutes.

With a large spoon, scoop the stuffing from the cavity into a serving bowl.  Cover to keep the stiffing warm while you carve the chicken.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  One of the popular uses for leftover bread is for bread stuffing.  This is my mother's standard recipe, which she uses to stuff chicken, turkey, and capon.

Season the cavity of the chicken with salt and pepper.  Stuff the cavity loosely with the bread mixture, and sew the cavity closed with butcher&apos;s twine or skewer it closed if desired.  Baste the chicken all over with the melted butter.  Place on a rack in a roasting pan, breast-side up.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast the chicken, basting occasionally with the pan drippings, for about 1 1/2 hours, until the juices from the thigh run clear when it is pierced.  Remove the chicken to a cutting board and let it cool for 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With a large spoon, scoop the stuffing from the cavity into a serving bowl.  Cover to keep the stiffing warm while you carve the chicken.  Serve immediately.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  One of the popular uses for leftover bread is for bread stuffing.  This is my mother&apos;s standard recipe, which she uses to stuff chicken, turkey, and capon.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1 1/2           cups  cake flour
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  6              large  eggs -- separated, room
                        temperature
     1/2           cup  cold water
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     3/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  6        tablespoons  bourbon whiskey
                        === CUSTARD FILLING ===
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
  4               cups  milk
  4              large  egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
                        === MERINGUE TOPPING ===
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  water
  6              large  egg whites -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  bourbon whiskey
     1/2           cup  sugar

To make the filling, in a small bowl, mix the sugar and cornstarch.  In the top of a double boiler, bring the milk to just under a boil.  Reduce the heat to low.  Add 1/4 cup of the hot milk to the sugar and cornstarch mixture, and stir to make a paste.  Stir the paste into the milk in the double boiler, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

In a bowl, beat the egg yolks until pale and thick.  Beat in 1/4 cup of the warm milk mixture and return to the double boiler; cook, stirring, over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, or until thickened.  Transfer to a bowl and stir in the vanilla.  Cover the bowl with a sheet of buttered wax paper and refrigerate until ready to use.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

To make the cake, sift the flour 3 times and set aside.

In a large bowl, beat the sugar and egg yolks with an electric mixer until thick and pale yellow in color.  Gradually beat in the water, then the vanilla.  With a spatula, fold in the sifted flour 2 tablespoons at a time.  Set aside.

In another bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until stiff peaks form.  Fold the whites into the egg yolk mixture and pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan.  Bake for 40 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean.  Invert the cake pan over the neck of a wine or soft drink bottle and let the cake cool completely.

Run a knife around the sides of the pan to release the cake and turn it out onto a plate.  With a serrated knife, cut the cake into 1/4-inch slices.

Line a 9- by 12-inch ovenproof platter or baking sheet with a layer of cake slices.  Fill in any spaces with pieces of cake.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the whiskey evenly over the cake slices.  Spread the cake slices with half of the custard filling.  Place a second layer of cake on top of the custard filling, filling in any gaps with pieces of cake.  Sprinkle with another 2 tablespoons of the whiskey.  Make a second custard layer and top with a third layer of cake.  Sprinkle the top of the cake with the remaining 2 tablespoons whiskey.  Refrigerate the cake while you make the meringue.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

To make the meringue, in a small saucepan, dissolve the cornstarch in the water.  Cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until well blended, but still liquid.  Set aside to cool.

In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until foamy.  Add the whiskey and beat for 1 minute.  Beat in the sugar 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat until the whites form stiff peaks.  Slowly beat in the cornstarch mixture and beat for 3 minutes more.

Frost the cake with the meringue, making sure to spread the meringue all around the bottom of the cake to seal the edges.  Bake until the meringue is golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes; be careful, as it will brown quickly.  Let the cake cool for 5 minutes, then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours before serving.

To serve, cut into small squares.

Note:  This cake will keep for up to a week in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 24 servings.

Comments:  My mother's whiskey cake was served at every holiday meal.  This dense cake, soaked liberally with whiskey, filled with a delicious vanilla custard, and covered all over in a cloud of fluffy meringue, won the acclaim of all who were privileged to sample it.  Make the filling a day ahead, so you won't have so many steps when you assemble the cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into chunks
  1              large  egg
                        === PASTA DOUGH FOR TAGLIATELLINE ===
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        === FILLING ===
  4             ounces  slivered blanched almonds -- processed to a
                        powder
  4             ounces  mixed candied fruit peels -- diced
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted and cooled
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  light cream

Butter a 9- or 10 1/2- 3-inch-deep springform pan, dust it with flour, and set aside.

For the pastry dough, place the flour, sugar, salt, and butter in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade and pulse until the butter is reduced to bits.  Add the egg and process until the mixture begins to form a ball.  Remove the dough from the work bowl, shape it into a disk, and wrap tightly in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight.

With a rolling pin, roll the pastry dough out on a floured surface into an 18-inch-diameter round and line the springform pan, bringing the dough 2 inches up the sides.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.

For the pasta dough, crack the eggs into the bowl of a food processor and pulse to break up.  With the motor running, add the flour and salt.  Allow the dough to form a ball that is moist but does not stick to your hands.  If slightly sticky, do not add additional flour, as the dough will be rolled out on a floured surface.  If the dough appears too dry and crumbly, add a few drops of water.

Gather up the pasta dough and knead it on a lightly floured surface until it is soft and smooth, 3 to 4 minutes.  Cover the dough with a bowl and let rest for 30 minutes while you make the filling.

In a medium-sized bowl, mix the almonds, candied peels, sugar, and cocoa together.  In a large bowl, whisk the butter, eggs, and cream together until blended.  Stir the almond mixture into the butter mixture, blending well.  Set aside.

Divide the pasta dough in half and work with one half at a time, keeping the piece you are not working with covered.  Roll and cut the dough on a hand-crank pasta machine, using the vermicelli cut for the tagliatelline.  Or roll and cut by hand.  Lay the tagliatelline on floured kitchen towels as you make them, keeping them separated so that they do not clump together.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Scatter one third of the tagliatelline over the bottom of the pastry-lined springform pan.  Carefully spread the filling over the top.  Scatter the remaining tagliatelline evenly over the top of the filling.  Cut a circle of parchment paper to fit the top of the pan.  Butter the paper and place it over the top of the torta.

Bake until a cake skewer inserted into the center comes out clean and the pasta is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes for a 10-inch pan and 35 to 40 minutes for a 9-inch pan.  Halfway through the baking process, remove and discard the parchment paper.  Transfer the torta to a cooling rack and cool completely before releasing the spring.  Carefully slide the torta from the base onto a serving dish.  Cut into thin wedges.

Note:  I find homemade candied peels far superior to store-bought.  See recipe for Candied Orange Peel.  Candied peels can be made several months in advance.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  The classic torta di tagliatelline (noodle cake) from Modena was known in the eighteenth century.  The clever use of thinly cut uncooked pasta provides an interesting texture and look.  The torta is best eaten the day it is made.  Use a food processor to prepare the pastry and pasta doughs.  Several other steps can be done the day before to save time; line the pan and have all the filling ingredients measured out.  The tagliatelline, which are thinner than tagliatelle, should be made just before filling the pastry so they remain damp and are not brittle.  Using a 9-inch pan will result in a slightly higher torta, but I prefer the thinner look achieved with a 10-inch pan.

Comments:  The classic torta di tagliatelline (noodle cake) from Modena was known in the eighteenth century.  The clever use of thinly cut uncooked pasta provides an interesting texture and look.  The torta is best eaten the day it is made.  Use a food processor to prepare the pastry and pasta doughs.  Several other steps can be done the day before to save time; line the pan and have all the filling ingredients measured out.  The tagliatelline, which are thinner than tagliatelle, should be made just before filling the pastry so they remain damp and are not brittle.  Using a 9-inch pan will result in a slightly higher torta, but I prefer the thinner look achieved with a 10-inch pan.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  6              large  eggs
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  6               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  5          teaspoons  baking powder
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  8                     colored hard-boiled eggs
  1 1/4           cups  confectioner's sugar
  2        tablespoons  milk - (to 3)
                        Colored sprinkles -- as needed

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl, beat the eggs, butter, sugar, vanilla, and vegetable oil with a rotary beater or a wooden spoon until well blended.  Sift the flour and the baking powder together and add to the egg mixture about a cup at a time, mixing with your hands until a soft but no longer sticky dough is formed.

Transfer the dough to a well-floured surface and knead until smooth and pliable, about 5 minutes.  Divide the dough into 4 pieces.  Roll each piece into a rope 22 inches long and 1 inch thick.  Cut a 2-inch piece off each rope and reserve.  Loosely braid 2 of the ropes together and bring the ends together to form a circle; pinch the ends together.  Repeat with the remaining 2 ropes.

Place each braid on a greased baking sheet.  Space 4 eggs evenly around the circles, nestling them in the braided dough.  Divide each of the reserved 4 pieces of dough into 4 pieces.  Roll each piece into a 3-inch-long rope.  Using 2 ropes of dough per egg, place a cross over each egg, tucking the ends into the dough.

Bake the braids for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the bread is nicely browned.  Transfer to wire racks to cool.

In a small bowl, combine the confectioner's sugar and 2 tablespoons of the milk.  Mix well.  Add enough additional milk to make a thin icing, stirring until smooth.  Drizzle the icing over the braids and scatter colored sprinkles over them.

This recipe yields two 9-inch round breads.

Comments:  One of the Easter breads my mother made had colored eggs nestled in the dough before it was baked.  The recipe came from her friend Mrs. Condello, who made sure this bread was blessed by the priest on Holy Saturday.  The bread has a coarse texture, is not overly sweet, and can be dressed up with a thin vanilla icing and gaily colored sprinkles after it is baked.  (The eggs will not be edible.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  2               cups  sugar
  1                cup  solid vegetable shortening
  4              large  eggs -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  milk
  1 1/4    tablespoons  almond extract
     3/4           cup  confectioners' sugar

Sift the flour, baking powder, and baking soda together into a bowl.

In another bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the sugar and shortening together until light and fluffy.  Beat in the eggs one at a time.  Beat in the milk and almond extract, beating until smooth.  On low speed, slowly beat in the flour mixture until well combined.  Cover the dough and refrigerate for 2 to 5 hours.

Preheat the oven to 550 degrees.  Lightly grease two cookie sheets.  Place the confectioners' sugar in a dish.

Using two teaspoons, form balls of dough the size of a walnut, drop the balls into the confectioners' sugar, and gently roll them to coat completely.  Place the balls on the cookie sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart.

Bake the cookies for about 15 minutes, or until firm to the touch and just lightly browned.  Transfer to cooling racks.

Note:  These can be made ahead and frozen for up to one month.  When ready to serve, sprinkle additional confectioners' sugar over the tops.

This recipe yields 4 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  Signora Libera Pilla sent me the recipe for this heirloom cookie, which she begins making right after Thanksgiving and continues until Christmas.  The dough is very soft, so it's best to refrigerate it for several hours before forming the cookies.  Their delicate cake-like texture and not-too-sweet taste make these cookies a perfect accompaniment to fresh strawberries, raspberries, and peaches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3           packages  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  3               cups  sugar -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  2               cups  milk
  31                    eggs
  1              pound  solid vegetable shortening -- melted, and
                        cooled to lukewarm
  5             pounds  unbleached all-purpose flour -- sifted
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  fine sea salt
  2                     egg yolks -- beaten with
  2        tablespoons  water -- for egg wash

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water.  Sprinkle on 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar and stir to dissolve.  Let the yeast proof, covered, for 10 minutes, or until foamy.

In a medium saucepan, scald the milk (bring to just under a boil).

In a heavy-duty electric mixer, beat 21 of the eggs until frothy.  Add the milk and the remaining 3 cups sugar and blend well.  Add the shortening and mix well.  Add the yeast mixture and stir to blend.

Sift the flour, cinnamon, and salt together.  Using a dough hook, gradually add the flour mixture to the egg mixture, mixing until a ball of dough forms.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.

Place the dough in a large oiled bowl.  Brush the top of the dough with oil and cover the dough with plastic wrap and then a towel.  Let the dough rise in a warm place until it is doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.

Lightly butter two cookie sheets.  Punch down the dough.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 2 to 3 minutes.  Divide into 30 equal balls.  Roll each ball into a rope about 12 inches long.

For each bread, braid 3 ropes together, then nestle an egg in the top of the braid.  Place the braids on the cookie sheets and brush with the egg wash.  Cover the braids with a towel and let rise in a warm place for about 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Bake the braids for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown.  Transfer to wire racks to cool.

Note:  When completely cool, these may be frozen, well wrapped in aluminum foil.

Variation:  Make braided wreaths instead of pupazze.

This recipe yields 10 dolls.

Comments:  Easter Bread in Calabria is shaped like dolls or babies called pupazze.  My good friend Tomie dePaola, the noted children's author and illustrator, who often sets his stories in Italy, gave me his grandmother's recipe in which the dough is braided and an egg is nestled in the top of the braid, like a small baby wrapped in a blanket.  When Tomie makes these, he freezes them to give away to dear friends.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  4               cups  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  9               cups  unbleached all purpose flour
  1                cup  whole-wheat flour
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Semolina or cornmeal -- to flour work board

For the slurry, combine the yeast and 1/2 cup of water in a bowl; stir and set aside.

Measure 2 cups of the unbleached flour into a large bowl.  Make a hole in the center of the flour with your hands and pour in the yeast mixture.  Move the flour from the sides of the bowl into the yeast mixture and combine.  Gradually pour in 1 cup of water.  Use a wooden spoon to mix the flour and yeast mixture together to form a thick slurry.  Sprinkle another cup of the unbleached flour over the top of the slurry; cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place to rise for 6 to 8 hours or overnight.

Next day add the whole wheat flour, 1 cup of warm water and another cup of the unbleached all purpose flour to the bowl and mix, kneading the dough slightly in the bowl with your hands.  The dough will be very sticky.  Cover and set aside again to rise for 6 to 8 hours or overnight.

Next day stir in the remaining 1 1/2 cups of water.  Work in the remaining flour, leaving a little of it aside to spread on the board or work surface.  Turn the dough onto the floured surface and knead it for 10 to 15 minutes or until the dough is silky and springy and has lost its stickiness.  Place the dough in a large bowl sprayed with olive oil.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and place the dough in a warm place (75 degrees) to rise for 2 to 3 hours.

It is best to bake the dough on a baking stone or tiles.  To do this, preheat the oven stone at 450 degrees for 30 minutes prior to baking the bread.

Turn the risen dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, punch it down, knead it briefly and form it into two big oval or round loaves.  Set the loaves on 2 oven peels lined with cornmeal.  Cover the loaves with a clean towel and allow them to rise for 45 minutes while the oven is heating.

Transfer the loaves from the peel to the stone; if you only have one peel, form one at a time.  Bake 10 minutes then lower the heat to 350 degrees and continue baking another 40 to 45 minutes or until the bread is nicely browned and sounds hollow when tapped with your knuckles.

To bake the loaves without a stone, form the loaves as above and place each one on a lightly oiled and cornmeal lined baking sheet.  Cover as above and let rise.  Bake as above.

Cool the bread on a rack before slicing.

Note:  Traditionally, Tuscan bread is not slashed with a lame or razor before baking to allow steam to escape, but it is a good idea to do it to prevent the bread from splitting as it bakes.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

Comments:  Nancy makes Tuscan bread the traditional way, without salt.  She begins two days prior to baking the bread by making a slurry, a loose starter dough that will help give texture, taste, and a nice rise to the final dough.  Although this method is time consuming, it is well worth it to achieve a nearly authentic loaf.  For a quicker version of Tuscan Bread, check out my recipe.

                  Neapolitan Pizza - {Pizza Napoletana}

Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  dough
  3               cups  drained seeded plum tomatoes - (abt 2 lbs)
  1              pound  fior di latte mozzarella cheese -- sliced
  8                     salted anchovies -- cut small pieces
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Divide the dough in half and roll each piece out on a floured surface into a 13 1/2-inch round.  Place the rounds on each of two lightly oiled 13-inch pizza pans.  You can stretch the dough to fit an even larger pan, if you wish.  Turn in the overhanging edge 1/2-inch to form a rim.  Or place the rounds on 2 wooden peels, sprinkled with cornmeal, if you plan to bake the pizza on baking stones.

Divide the tomatoes and spread them evenly on each pizza.  Divide and layer on the cheese.  Divide the anchovies and scatter them over the top.  Divide and sprinkle on the oregano and olive oil.

Bake the pizzas for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the bottom crusts are nicely browned and the cheese is melted on top.  Cut the pizzas into wedges and serve immediately.

If using baking stones, preheat the stones for 20 minutes, then sprinkle them with cornmeal and transfer each pizza from the peel onto a hot stone.  Bake until the crusts are nicely browned, about 25 minutes.  Cut the pizzas into wedges and serve immediately.

This recipe yields two 13-inch pizzas.

Comments:  Ask for pizza Napoletana in Naples and you will be served a crisp disk of dough with a layer of freshly chopped and seeded plum tomatoes, fresh buffalo mozzarella cheese, anchovy fillets, and a sprinkling of oregano.  Since buffalo mozzarella is very perishable and rarely available, substitute fresh whole-milk fior di latte.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Straight Dough -- (see recipe)
  6               cups  vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  2               cups  homemade or store-bought tomato sauce
  1              pound  Italian Fontina or fresh mozzarella cheese -- diced
                        Fresh basil leaves -- for garnish

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead it for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.

Divide the dough into 12 to 14 pieces.  Shape them with your hands into rough 3- to 4-inch rounds.  Place the rounds on a clean cloth and set aside.

Preheat the broiler.  In a deep-fryer or deep heavy pot, heat the vegetable oil to 375 degrees.  Fry the rounds, a few at a time, until they are golden brown.  Remove them with a slotted spoon to brown paper to drain.

Place the rounds on the broiler pan and spread each one with about 3 tablespoons of the tomato sauce.  Top with the cheese.  Place the pan 5 inches from the heat and broil just until the cheese begins to melt.  Garnish each round with a basil leaf.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 to 14 pizzette.

Comments:  Like every Italian cook I know, I have my favorite recipe for pizza fritta, or fried dough rounds.  They are so easy to make, fashioned from rough pieces of the Straight Dough.  Each one is a little different from the next, which is part of their charm.  Usually they are deep-fried, sugared, and eaten immediately.  But in this version, the pizze fritte are toped with tomato sauce and either smooth and creamy Fontina or delicate fresh mozzarella cheese and quickly run under the broiler to melt the cheese.  They are just as delicious as their sugared cousins.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Rice papers -- as needed
  8             ounces  honey
  2                     egg whites
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
  1              pound  blanched almonds
     1/2         pound  hazelnuts
  2          teaspoons  candied orange peel cut into bits
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest

Line 2 or 3 (6- by 8-inch) loaf pans with the rice papers, cutting them to fit if necessary.

Heat the honey in a double boiler over boiling water and stir for 3 or 4 minutes.  Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form and slowly mix into the honey.  The mixture will be fluffy and white.

Combine the sugar with 2 tablespoons of water in small pan and let it boil without stirring until it is caramel-colored Add this to the honey, mixing well.  Cook until a little of the mixture hardens when dropped into water.  Stir in the nuts, peels and zest.  Mix quickly before it hardens.

Divide and pour the mixture into the pans to a depth of about 2-inches.  Cover the top of each pan with rice papers cut to fit and let the torrone cool for twenty minutes, then cut each into pieces.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  It just would not be Christmas without those little boxes of torrone; this chewy candy is a tradition in Italian families; every region of Italy claims to make the best.  Made from sugar, egg whites, and nuts, it is a symbol of the Italian Christmas season.  Here is a recipe for you to try.  Ostia are rice papers that you can purchase online at Fante's in Philadelphia.  Or call them at 800-878-5557.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
     1/2           cup  hulled unsalted pumpkin seeds
  1 1/2           cups  warm potato water -- (110 degrees)
  1            package  active dried yeast
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 3 1/2)
  1         tablespoon  wheat gluten -- (optional)
                        = (or 1/2 crushed vitamin C tablet)
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
                        === TOPPING ===
  1              large  Russet potato
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  sweet red onions - (2 large) -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  4        tablespoons  sugar
     1/3           cup  balsamic or red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  fresh thyme leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Spread the pumpkin seeds on a cookie sheet and toast them for 10 minutes.  You will hear a popping noise as they toast.  Remove the seeds to a dish to cool.

Make the dough in an electric mixer, food processor, or by hand.  Pour 1/2 cup of the potato water into a mixing bowl.  Sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir it with a spoon.  Allow the yeast to "proof", or get bubbly.  This will take about 5 minutes.  Pour in the remaining water.  Mix in one cup of the flour along with the wheat gluten or Vitamin C.  Stir in the olive oil and the salt.  Continue adding enough of the flour to create a dough that moves away from the sides of the mixing bowl and is not sticking to your hands.  The dough should be slightly tacky but not sticky or gooey feeling.  Knead the dough a few times on a lightly floured surface.  Round the dough into a ball and place it in a large bowl.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow it to rise until double in bulk.  Or make the dough a day ahead, and after it has risen, punch it down and place the dough in a vegetable-oil-sprayed plastic bag.  Refrigerate the dough.  When ready to use, transfer the dough to a bowl; cover it and allow it to come to room temperature, and rise.

Meanwhile make the topping.  Peel the potato, and cut it into paper-thin slices.  (If you want to prep them ahead of time, place the slices in a bowl and cover them with cold water to prevent them from discoloring.  Be sure to dry the slices before sauteing them.)

Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a saute pan set over medium heat.  Cook the potatoes, turning them frequently, until they just start to brown around the edges.  Remove the potatoes to a paper-towel-lined dish.  Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil, stir in the onions, and cook them until the onions begin to soften.  Stir the sugar into the onions and continue cooking them for 2 or 3 minutes.  They should look soft and glazed.  Raise the heat to high and stir in the vinegar.  Continue cooking and stirring until all the vinegar has evaporated.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and allow it to cool.

Punch down the dough with your fists, and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface.  Stretch out the dough with your hands into a rough looking round.  Spread the pumpkin seeds on top of the dough.  Fold the dough over the pumpkin seeds, and knead the dough until the seeds are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

To make one deep-dish focaccia, roll the dough into a 15- by 1 1/2-inch round, and place it in the pan.  To make two thinner and smaller focacce, divide the dough in half, and roll each half into roughly a 13 1/2- to 14-inch round.  Place the rounds on each of two baking-parchment-lined peels.

If making the deep-dish focaccia, spread all the potato slices over the top of the dough.  Spread the onions evenly over the potatoes, and sprinkle the thyme and pepper over the onions.  Cover with a clean dish towel and allow to rise for 20 minutes.  If making two smaller ones, divide and spread the potatoes, onions, thyme, and pepper over the top of each focaccia.  Cover them with a clean dish towel and allow them to rise for 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees if making deep-dish focaccia or using conventional pizza pans; preheat the baking stones at 450 degrees for 25 minutes prior to baking the smaller focacce.  Then lower the temperature to 400 degrees.

Bake the deep-dish focaccia for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the bottom crust is nicely browned.  Use the same baking temperature and time if using conventional pizza pans.  Remove the focaccia from the oven and set the pan on a cooling rack.

If using baking stones, slide the focaccia with the parchment paper onto the stone.  You may need to bake one at a time if you do not have a double oven and two baking stones.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the bottom crust is nicely browned.  To remove the focaccia from the stone, slip the peel underneath the parchment paper and slide the focaccia onto the peel and transfer to a cooling rack.

Cut the focaccia into wedges with a scissors and serve warm.

This recipe yields one 15- by 1 1/2-inch deep-dish focaccia or two 13 1/2- by 14-inch focacce.

Comments:  I must give credit to my maternal grandmother, Anna Galasso, for the trick I have used on my series to demonstrate how to make a good, light-tasting yeast dough.  Grandma always saved potato water -- either the water potatoes had been boiled in or the water that peeled, uncooked potatoes had been held in.  In either case, the potatoes release plenty of starch, which yeast just loves to feed on.  When I boil potatoes I make sure to drain off the water into containers that I can freeze.  That way I always have potato water on hand, to crumble yeast into.

This dough is what is referred to as a straight dough because it uses just water, active dry yeast, unbleached all-purpose flour, salt, and a little olive oil.  To give the dough an added boost when rising I add wheat gluten, available in the baking section of most supermarkets.  This is optional, and half a crushed chewable vitamin C tablet will have the same effect.  When I knead the dough I embed it with toasted pumpkin seeds for a nice look, nutty flavor, and texture.  I top the dough with onions, paper-thin slices of potatoes, and fresh thyme.  For an impressive look I use a deep-dish 15 1/2- by 1 1/2-inch pizza pan, but you can make two free-form focacce about 13 1/2 by 15 1/2 inches and bake them on preheated baking stones, which give a nice crisp texture to the crust.  Or simply use standard pizza pans.  This is a great starter for a rustic Italian dinner.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  golden raisins
     1/4           cup  grappa or brandy
  5        tablespoons  butter -- softened
  2              large  eggs
  4              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  4 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 5) -- plus
  1         tablespoon  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        Grated zest of 1 medium orange
                        Grated zest of 1 medium lemon
     1/2           cup  chopped candied citron

To make the sponge, in a medium bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Add the flour and stir with a spoon or your fingers to make a loose, almost liquid, dough.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for at least 6 hours, or overnight.

In a small bowl, combine the raisins and grappa or brandy, and let marinate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.

In a large bowl, stir the butter, eggs, yolks, sugar, warm water and vanilla together.  Drain the marinated raisins in a small strainer set over a bowl and press on the raisins with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible.  Set the raisins aside and add the liquid to the egg mixture.  Add the sponge and mix well with your hands.  Add the flour about 2 cups at a time, mixing with your hands until a ball of dough forms.

Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead for 5 to 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic, adding additional flour as needed.

Butter a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat.  Cover with a clean cloth and let rise for 6 hours in a warm place.

Butter and flour a panettone or other deep mold at least 6 1/2 inches tall and 7 to 8 inches wide.  (The ceramic insert to a crockpot is ideal.  Or you can use two 2-pound coffee cans and make 2 smaller loaves.  Panettone can also be baked in two greased and floured 6- by 6-inch clay flowerpots.)

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a floured surface.  Flatten the dough out with your hands and sprinkle on the lemon and orange zest.  In a small bowl, mix the raisins and citron with the 1 tablespoon flour, and sprinkle the mixture over the dough.  Fold the dough in half, press the edges together, and knead to distribute the fruits.  Continue to knead for 5 to 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, adding additional flour if necessary.  Place the dough in the mold, cover with a clean cloth, and let rise for 35 minutes in a warm place.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Cut an X in the top of the bread.  Bake for 5 minutes, reduce the heat to 375 degrees, and bake for 10 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees, and bake for 30 to 35 minutes longer, or until a skewer inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.  If the top begins to brown too much, cover the bread loosely with a piece of foil.

Cool the bread on a rack for about 30 minutes before removing it from the mold.

Note:  There are many versions of panettone.  Some use Vin Santo, a sweet dessert wine, instead of grappa.  Some are made with olive oil instead of butter, and some include pine nuts and anise seed instead of raisins and citron.  Try it using these variations.

This recipe yields 1 large loaf or 2 smaller ones.

Comments:  Whether you call it a big bread or Tony's bread, panettone is a sweet fruit bread from Milan.  Today panettone is found all over Italy, but the Motta shop in Milan is the most famous for its panettone.

To make the sponge, in a medium bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Add the flour and stir with a spoon or your fingers to make a loose, almost liquid, dough.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for at least 6 hours, or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, combine the raisins and grappa or brandy, and let marinate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, stir the butter, eggs, yolks, sugar, warm water and vanilla together.  Drain the marinated raisins in a small strainer set over a bowl and press on the raisins with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible.  Set the raisins aside and add the liquid to the egg mixture.  Add the sponge and mix well with your hands.  Add the flour about 2 cups at a time, mixing with your hands until a ball of dough forms.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead for 5 to 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic, adding additional flour as needed.

<DirT>
Butter a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat.  Cover with a clean cloth and let rise for 6 hours in a warm place.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Butter and flour a panettone or other deep mold at least 6 1/2 inches tall and 7 to 8 inches wide.  (The ceramic insert to a crockpot is ideal.  Or you can use two 2-pound coffee cans and make 2 smaller loaves.  Panettone can also be baked in two greased and floured 6- by 6-inch clay flowerpots.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a floured surface.  Flatten the dough out with your hands and sprinkle on the lemon and orange zest.  In a small bowl, mix the raisins and citron with the 1 tablespoon flour, and sprinkle the mixture over the dough.  Fold the dough in half, press the edges together, and knead to distribute the fruits.  Continue to knead for 5 to 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, adding additional flour if necessary.  Place the dough in the mold, cover with a clean cloth, and let rise for 35 minutes in a warm place.

                  Parsley Sauce - {Salsa Di Prezzemolo}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Italian
                Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  3              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
  1 1/2           cups  flat-leaf parsley leaves - (packed)
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 2)

Place all the ingredients except the olive oil in a food processor or blender and pulse to make a smooth paste.  With the motor running, drizzle in just enough olive oil to make a smooth but not too liquid sauce.

Spoon the sauce into clean jars, cap and refrigerate until needed.  The sauce will keep for 2 to 5 weeks.

To serve, heat the sauce over medium heat until hot.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

Comments:  When you need a quick hostess gift, make this elegant, eye-appealing parsley sauce.  Delicious over grilled fish, scaloppine of veal, or pork, it is also the perfect cover for fettuccine, rice, or cooked vegetables such as zucchini and carrots or fresh summer corn.  It will keep in the refrigerator for several weeks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ====
     1/2           cup  butter
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla
  1                cup  flour
                        === FILLING ===
  4             ounces  dried pasta -- cooked and drained
                        = (leftover pasta is fine)
  1                cup  milk
                        = (for richer filling, use half-and-half)
  6        tablespoons  melted butter or margarine
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2             medium  apples -- grated
     1/2      teaspoon  almond flavoring
     1/2           cup  dried sour cherries
                        = (substitution of dried cranberries or
                        raisins is fine)
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds
                        === OPTIONAL ===
     1/2           cup  fresh raspberries, blueberries or peaches
                        Cinnamon sugar

Filling:  Combine milk, butter, sugar and eggs.  Grate apples into mixture.  Add almond flavoring, dried sour cherries and 1/2 cup of the almonds.  (If using optional fresh fruit, add it here.)  Add the cooked pasta and mix well.  Pour into the prepared tart crust or the solid tart pan.

If you wish, sprinkle the top with about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon sugar.

Bake for 1 hour or until a knife comes out clean.  Serve warm or cold.

Decorate with whipped cream and fresh fruit, if desired.  For a special occasion, make pasta flowers to decorate the top of the tart.

If you wish to use a 9-inch tart pan, reduce pasta to 3 ounces of dried pasta, milk to 3/4 cup, sugar to 1/3 cup and butter to 5 1/2 tablespoons.

For Diabetics or low sugar diets, substitute another apple for all sugar or add only 1/4 cup.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

           Pastry Of The Nobles - {Sfogliatelle Della Nobilita}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Italian
                Pastry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  semolina flour
  1                cup  whole-milk ricotta cheese -- well drained
  1              large  egg -- beaten
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  1            package  frozen puff pastry - (2 sheets) -- thawed,
  4        tablespoons  lard or butter -- melted
                        Confectioner's sugar
                        Cinnamon
                        Parchment paper -- optional

To make the filling, in a saucepan, bring the milk to a boil over medium-high heat.  Add the semolina flour in a thin steady stream, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, and cook, stirring, until the mixture is thickened and smooth, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer to a bowl and let cool for 5 minutes.

Add the cheese, egg, sugar, and lemon zest to the semolina mixture and beat well.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper, if available.

Roll 1 sheet of the puff pastry out to a 16- by 22-inch rectangle on a floured, and preferably cold, surface (I use a marble slab).  Starting at a short edge, brush one third of the sheet with some of the melted lard or butter and begin rolling the pastry sheet up tightly like a jelly roll; brush the remaining two thirds of the sheet with lard or butter and roll up.

Cut the roll into 2-inch thick slices.  Form each piece into a small seashell shape by pushing your thumbs against the center of the piece and spreading it out to a small cup shape.

Fill each shell with about 2 tablespoons of the semolina filling and place them 1 inch apart on the parchment-lined sheets or on ungreased cookie sheets.  Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling.  Bake for 15 minutes or until nicely browned.  Let cool slightly on the cookie sheets and then transfer to racks to cool completely.

To serve, sprinkle the sfogliatelle with confectioner's sugar and then sprinkle a line of cinnamon down the center of each one.

Note:  These can be assembled ahead of time, placed on cookie sheets, wrapped in foil, and frozen for later baking.  Bake them frozen, allowing about 10 to 12 minutes more baking time.

This recipe yields about 16 pastries.

Comments:  When I was in Sorrento, I went to the pasticceria to do what most Italians do everyday -- pick out a tempting pastry to have as a little snack.  There were so many kinds that it was blind luck that I should choose sfogliatelle.  These are flaky pastries that look like seashells when baked.  They are filled with a mixture of sweetened ricotta cheese, semolina, and cinnamon.  Sometimes citron pieces are also added.  In talking with the owners of the shop, I learned that these regal gems were originally made only for the noble families of the Renaissance and that is the reason why they are called sfogliatelle della nobilita, pastry of the nobles.  Sfogliatelle means many folds or leaves, similar to the many layers created by puff pastry dough.  I have experimented with frozen puff pastry, and I like the results better.

To make the filling, in a saucepan, bring the milk to a boil over medium-high heat.  Add the semolina flour in a thin steady stream, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, and cook, stirring, until the mixture is thickened and smooth, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer to a bowl and let cool for 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the cheese, egg, sugar, and lemon zest to the semolina mixture and beat well.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper, if available.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll 1 sheet of the puff pastry out to a 16- by 22-inch rectangle on a floured, and preferably cold, surface (I use a marble slab).  Starting at a short edge, brush one third of the sheet with some of the melted lard or butter and begin rolling the pastry sheet up tightly like a jelly roll; brush the remaining two thirds of the sheet with lard or butter and roll up.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut the roll into 2-inch thick slices.  Form each piece into a small seashell shape by pushing your thumbs against the center of the piece and spreading it out to a small cup shape.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill each shell with about 2 tablespoons of the semolina filling and place them 1 inch apart on the parchment-lined sheets or on ungreased cookie sheets.  Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling.  Bake for 15 minutes or until nicely browned.  Let cool slightly on the cookie sheets and then transfer to racks to cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, sprinkle the sfogliatelle with confectioner&apos;s sugar and then sprinkle a line of cinnamon down the center of each one.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  These can be assembled ahead of time, placed on cookie sheets, wrapped in foil, and frozen for later baking.  Bake them frozen, allowing about 10 to 12 minutes more baking time.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 16 pastries.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  When I was in Sorrento, I went to the pasticceria to do what most Italians do everyday -- pick out a tempting pastry to have as a little snack.  There were so many kinds that it was blind luck that I should choose sfogliatelle.  These are flaky pastries that look like seashells when baked.  They are filled with a mixture of sweetened ricotta cheese, semolina, and cinnamon.  Sometimes citron pieces are also added.  In talking with the owners of the shop, I learned that these regal gems were originally made only for the noble families of the Renaissance and that is the reason why they are called sfogliatelle della nobilita, pastry of the nobles.  Sfogliatelle means many folds or leaves, similar to the many layers created by puff pastry dough.  I have experimented with frozen puff pastry, and I like the results better.

                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4              large  eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
  2             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
     3/4           cup  crushed amaretti cookies
  1              pinch  salt
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 9-inch cake pan.  Line it with parchment paper and butter the paper.  Sift the flour and baking powder together onto wax paper.

In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in the egg yolks one at a time.  With a rubber spatula, fold in the flour mixture.  Stir in the chocolate and crushed cookies.

In another bowl, with clean beaters, beat the egg whites with the salt until stiff peaks form.  With a rubber spatula, fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture one at a time.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake for 30 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the middle comes out clean.  Let the cake cool in the pan for 2 to 3 minutes, then invert it onto a cooling rack.  Carefully remove the parchment paper; set another rack on top of the cake and turn right side up.  Cool the cake completely.

Dust the cake with confectioners' sugar and cut into wedges to serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Bits of bittersweet chocolate and crushed amaretti cookies add a wonderful taste and texture to this cake.  The recipe, which comes from my friend Raffaella, was given to her mother by an old woman called Peppina from Reggio Emilia.  It is a simple cake, but one of my very favorites.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Pizza With Cresciuta -- (see recipe)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     ripe plum tomatoes -- cut into thin rounds
  2               cups  diced fresh fior di latte mozzarella
                        cheese
  12                    fresh basil leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Divide the dough in half and roll each piece out on a floured surface into a 13 1/2-inch round and place the rounds on lightly oiled 13-inch pizza pans.  Turn in the overhanging edge 1/2 inch to form a rim.  You can stretch the dough to fit an even larger pan if you wish.  Place the dough on 2 wooden peels, dusted with cornmeal, if you plan to use baking stones to bake the pizza.

Brush each round with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Divide the tomato slices between the rounds.  Divide the cheese and sprinkle it on top of the tomatoes.  Divide the basil leaves and sprinkle them on top of the cheese.  Divide and sprinkle on the salt and the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil.

Bake the pizzas for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top and bottom crusts are nicely browned.  Cut into wedges and serve immediately.

If using baking stones, preheat the stones in a 450 degrees oven for 20 minutes.  Just before placing the pizza on the stone from the baking peel, sprinkle each stone with a handful of cornmeal.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the crust in nicely browned on the bottom.

This recipe yields two 13-inch pizzas.

Comments:  This pizza was created around 1890 for Queen Margherita of Italy and was said to be one of her favorites, so it bears her name.  The rolled dough is topped with paper-thin slices of fresh plum tomatoes, chunks of creamy fresh mozzarella cheese, and whole leaves of fragrant, peppery basil.  It is baked quickly in a hot stone oven and is a triumph of Neapolitan cooking.

Categories    : Italian                         Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRESCIUTA ===
     3/4      teaspoon  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        === SECOND DOUGH ===
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1 1/2           cups  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 4)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

For the Cresciuta:  In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Let it rest, covered, for 10 minutes.  Stir in the flour with a spoon and blend well.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for 3 to 4 hours.

For the Second Dough:  In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Add the cresciuta to the second dough and mix well with your hands.

In a separate bowl, mix 3 1/3 cups of the flour and the salt and add to the large bowl.  Mix with your hands until you have a ball of dough.  Add up to 2/3 cup additional flour as needed to make a dough that is soft and slightly sticky.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, adding additional flour as needed, to make a smooth and elastic ball.

Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil; add the dough, turning it in the bowl to coat it with the oil.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 2 to 3 hours.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface.  Pinch off a piece of dough about the size of a small orange, roll it into a ball, and place it in a small jar that has been lightly brushed with olive oil.  Cap the jar and store in the refrigerator.  This is your cresciuta and next time you make pizza you will only need to make the second dough and add the saved cresciuta.  Make sure you always tear off a piece of dough and save it for the next time you make the dough.

Knead the remaining dough for 3 to 4 minutes.  Divide the dough in half and use as directed in pizza recipes.

Note:  Wrap the dough well and freeze for future use.

This recipe yields 1 3/4 pounds.

Comments:  Now let me get you started on making pizza with a cresciuta.  Use fresh, active dry yeast.  I buy it loose in bulk; it is cheaper and fresher, and I use a lot of it.  Store it in a jar in the refrigerator.

I use filtered water in this recipe because it is purer than tap water and I do think it makes a difference in taste, especially if your water is heavily treated with chemicals and high in sodium.  I also spoon the flour into my measuring cup instead of scooping it from the bag or flour bin.  This ensures that I have 4 ounces to my cup instead of the 5 for the scooped method.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  red or purple plums - (10 medium) -- halved, pitted,
                        and cut into 1/4"-thick slices
     1/3           cup  sweet Marsala wine
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        Grated zest of 1 large lemon
  1             recipe  Simply Sweet Dough -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  currant jelly -- melted

Place the plums in a large shallow glass dish and pour the wine over them.  Gently toss the slices in the wine with a spoon.  Cover the dish and let the plums macerate for at least several hours, or overnight.

Lightly brush a 17 1/2- by 11 1/2-inch baking pan with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter and set aside.

Dust a work surface lightly with flour and sprinkle the lemon zest over the flour.  Punch down the dough and turn it out onto the work surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky, evenly incorporating the zest as you knead.

Roll the dough out into an 18- by 14-inch rectangle and fit it into the baking pan, bringing the dough up along the sides and fitting it into the pan.  Brush the dough with the remaining melted butter.

Drain the plum slices, reserving the wine.

Make seven or eight overlapping lengthwise rows of plum slices on top of the dough, pressing the slices slightly into the dough.  Drizzle the reserved wine over the top of the slices.  Cover the kuchen with a clean towel and let it rise for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Bake the kuchen on the middle oven rack for 30 to 35 minutes, until the edges of the dough have browned and a knife inserted into the center of the kuchen comes out clean.

Remove the kuchen to a rack.  With a pastry brush, glaze the top of the kuchen with the melted jelly.  Let the kuchen cool slightly, then cut it into squares and serve warm.

This recipe yields 16 to 20 servings.

Comments:  Glistening slices of scarlet red plums soaked in sweet Marsala wine snuggle together atop this wonderful kuchen, which will please a crowd at brunch or afternoon tea.  To have the kuchen warm and waiting for friends, macerate the plums a day ahead and refrigerate.  Make the dough, let it rise until almost doubled in size, place it in a plastic bag, and refrigerate it.  The next morning, put the dough in a bowl and let it come to room temperature and rise again, then assemble the kuchen and bake.

                 Prosciutto Pie - {Tortina Di Prosciutto}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
     3/4           cup  warm milk
  2              large  eggs -- slightly beaten
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1                cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  3 1/4           cups  unbleached all purpose flour - (to 3 1/2)
     1/4         pound  finely-diced prosciutto
  1         tablespoon  minced rosemary

Dissolve the yeast in the milk in a small bowl.  Set aside.

Mix the eggs, butter, salt, and cheese together in a large bowl.  Stir in the yeast mixture.  Gradually add the flour mixing it with your hands until a ball of dough is formed that is not sticking to your hands; you may not need all the flour.

Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until soft and smooth.  Put the dough in an oiled bowl; cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let it rise for 2 hours in a warm but not hot area, about 75 degrees.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil a 15- by 12-inch baking pan.

Punch down the dough with your hands and put it on a work surface; flatten the dough with your hands and sprinkle the prosciutto and rosemary over the top.  Fold the dough over on itself to enclose the ingredients and knead the dough for 3 or 4 minutes to evenly distribute the ingredients.

Roll the dough into a 15- by 12-inch rectangle and place it on the greased baking sheet.  Bake the tortina until golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes.

Cut into small squares and serve hot.

This recipe yields twenty 3-inch squares.

Comments:  Keeping to the tradition of flat breads, this prosciutto pie comes from the Hotel Grifone's cooking school in Perugia.  It is a yeast bread but is made in a rectangular pan, and cut into squares.  This a great antipasto for a party, and is best eaten hot.  I have taken a few liberties with the recipe, adding rosemary and more cheese.  The dough can be made effortlessly in a food processor.

               Pumpkin Seed, Sage And Pancetta Bread - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  hulled pumpkin seeds
     1/4         pound  pancetta or unsmoked bacon -- diced (abt 1 cup)
  1             recipe  Nonna's Sponge Dough -- (see recipe)
     1/3           cup  minced fresh sage

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spread the pumpkin seeds on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 7 minutes, until they just start to brown; watch carefully so they do not burn.  Remove the seeds to a bowl and let them cool.

In a small skillet, saute the pancetta or bacon over medium heat until nicely browned and crisp.  Transfer to a cutting board and let it cool slightly.  Mince the pancetta or bacon very fine and transfer it to a small dish.

Line a baker's peel with parchment paper or lightly grease a baking sheet.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead it for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Roll the dough out into a 14-inch circle.

Sprinkle the pumpkin seeds, pancetta, and sage over the dough.  Starting at the side nearest you, roll the dough up tightly and pinch the seam closed.  Fold the dough in half and knead it until the filling bursts through the dough.  Continue kneading until the filling ingredients are evenly dispersed throughout the dough (if some ingredients pop out, knead them back into the dough) and the dough feels smooth.  Form the dough into a round loaf, and place it on the baker's peel or greased baking sheet.  Cover the dough with a clean towel and set aside to rise for about 35 minutes, until nearly doubled in size.

If using a baking stone, preheat the oven to 425 frgrees and put the stone on the lowest oven rack to preheat.  If using a baking sheet, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Make three short shallow slashes across the top of the dough with a lame, sharp knife, or razor blade.  If using a baking stone, slide the bread, with the paper, onto the stone.  Or put the baking sheet in the oven.  Mist the oven walls with water, then mist again once or twice during the first 10 minutes of baking.  Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes if using a stone, 40 to 45 minutes if using a baking sheet, until it is golden brown and crusty on the top and bottom and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped.  Remove the bread to a cooling rack.

This recipe yields 1 large loaf.

Comments:  Inspiration for this bread comes from the many breads I have joyfully eaten all over Italy.  From craggy-looking loaves of crusty Pugliese olive bread to the airy bread of Ferrara called manina (little hand), Italian breads have always held a fascination for me.  This bread is studded with toasted pumpkin seeds and cracklings of crispy Italian bacon (pancetta), and perfumed with specks of fresh sage.  Almost a meal by itself, it complements a bowl of homemade tomato soup perfectly.  It is the bread to serve on your Thanksgiving table, and it is unmatched in its versatility as a sandwich bread for egg salad, grilled vegetables, cold chicken, or roast beef.

Or put the baking sheet in the oven.  Mist the oven walls with water, then mist again once or twice during the first 10 minutes of baking.  Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes if using a stone, 40 to 45 minutes if using a baking sheet, until it is golden brown and crusty on the top and bottom and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped.  Remove the bread to a cooling rack.

Comments:  Inspiration for this bread comes from the many breads I have joyfully eaten all over Italy.  From craggy-looking loaves of crusty Pugliese olive bread to the airy bread of Ferrara called manina (little hand), Italian breads have always held a fascination for me.  This bread is studded with toasted pumpkin seeds and cracklings of crispy Italian bacon (pancetta), and perfumed with specks of fresh sage.  Almost a meal by itself, it complements a bowl of homemade tomato soup perfectly.  It is the bread to serve on your Thanksgiving table, and it is unmatched in its versatility as a sandwich bread for egg salad, grilled vegetables, cold chicken, or roast beef.

          Quick Veronese Christmas Cake - {Pandorato Di Verona}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  potato starch
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  9        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     3/4           cup  sugar
  4              large  eggs -- separated
  1         tablespoon  Cognac
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for sprinkling

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter and flour a pandoro or other deep 1 1/2-quart mold.  Sift the flour, potato starch, and baking powder together into a bowl.

In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the butter until smooth.  Beat in the sugar, then beat in the egg yolks one at a time.  Beat in the Cognac, lemon juice, and vanilla.  Spoon the flour mixture over the egg yolk mixture a little at a time, beating well after each addition.

In another bowl, with clean beaters, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until stiff peaks form.  With a rubber spatula, fold the whites into the egg yolk mixture.  Fill the mold with the batter.

Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean.  Let the cake cool in the mold on a rack for 30 minutes.

Gently run a knife around the edges of the mold, turn the mold upside down, and gently shake the cake loose.  Let the cake cool completely, then dust the top with confectioner's sugar.  Cut into wedges to serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  In addition to its renowned Christmas cake, Verona is also famous for its large confection houses such as Bauli, which makes a quick version of pandoro called pandorato.  This cake does not begin with a yeast starter; instead the batter is lightened with baking powder and stiffly beaten egg whites.  Using a pandoro mold is optional -- any deep one-and-a-half-quart mold will do.  The cake has an interesting biscuit-like texture and is very good with fresh fruit.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  toasted bread crumbs
  2                     Golden Delicious apples -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2              large  eggs -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/2           cup  cold milk
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/4    tablespoons  baking powder

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 9-inch round cake pan and coat it with the bread crumbs.  Refrigerate.

Place the apples in a bowl, pour the lemon juice over them, and toss to coat.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the eggs with the sugar until light-colored.  Beat in the butter.  Beat in the milk and then the vanilla.

Sift the flour and the baking powder together.  Add to the egg mixture a little at a time, beating well after each addition.  Fold in the apples.  Spoon the batter into the pan.

Bake for about 45 minutes, or until the cake is firm to the touch and nicely browned on top and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool the cake in the pan on a rack.  Turn out onto a plate and cut into wedges to serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This is a good winter cake that goes well with afternoon tea or coffee.  The recipe comes from my friend Raffaella Neviani, who lives in Reggio Emilia.  Use Golden Delicious apples in the batter, which, in Raffaella's words, make this cake "squisita!"

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dried yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  1                cup  warm milk -- (110 degrees)
  3              large  eggs -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  6               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 6 1/4)
  1                cup  raisins
  1         tablespoon  anise seeds -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  fine salt

Dissolve the yeast in the water in a large bowl.  Stir in the milk, 2 eggs, sugar, and butter.  Stir in two cups of the flour, raisins, anise seeds, and salt.  Add the remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft ball of dough is created.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow it to rise for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Transfer the dough to a floured surface and punch it down with your fists.  Knead the dough for a few minutes, then roll it out into a 32-inch rope, and bring the ends together to form a ring shape.  Place the ring on a lightly buttered cookie sheet.  Cover with a clean towel and allow it to rise until almost doubled.

Brush the dough with the remaining egg and bake until golden brown, about 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove the buccellato to a cooling rack to cool completely.

Option:  To keep the center of the ring open during baking, place a well buttered custard-type dish in the center of the ring.  After the bread is baked and cooled, carefully remove the dish.

This recipe yields 1 large ring.

Comments:  Buccellato Taddeucci in Lucca sells the sweet bread that was said to be a favorite of the ancient Roman army and in fact are sometimes made as large as a Roman cart wheel!  Bucellato is the standard confirmation gift to children from their grandparents.  If you go, get there early to buy one so you won't be disappointed.

             Raisin Semolina Bread - {Pane Di San Francesco}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  1 3/4           cups  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
     1/2           cup  honey
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4               cups  fine durum semolina flour - (to 4 1/2)
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1                cup  raisins
     1/2           cup  candied lemon peel -- diced
                        Cornmeal -- for sprinkling
                        = (if using a baking stone)
  1                     egg yolk -- lightly beaten

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in 1 cup of the warm water.  Add the honey and let the yeast proof for 5 minutes or until foamy.

Stir in the remaining 3/4 cup water and the olive oil.  Add 3 1/2 cups of the flour along with the salt and mix with your hands into a rough ball.  Add the raisins and lemon peel and continue to work the dough, adding additional flour as necessary, until the dough is no longer sticky.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it until soft and very smooth, about 5 minutes.

Generously grease a large bowl with olive oil and add the dough, turning to coat.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for about 2 hours until doubled in size.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Set a baking stone on the lowest rack to preheat for at least 20 minutes, or butter a cookie sheet.  Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for about 5 minutes.  Then roll it under your palms into a 26-inch long log.  Turn the dough in on itself from each end until the two ends meet in the middle, like a pretzel.

If using a baking stone, place the loaf on a peel dusted with cornmeal or place on a cookie sheet.  Cover and let rise for 20 minutes.

Brush the top of the loaf with the beaten egg yolk.  If using a baking stone, dust with cornmeal, and slide the loaf from the peel onto the stone.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  If using a cookie sheet, bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until the crust is a shiny brown.  Remove the bread to a wire rack to cool.

This recipe yields 1 large loaf.

Comments:  I first sampled this bread in Sicily at Eastertime in Santa Caterina Villarmosa, the birthplace of my Grandfather Saporito.  Grano duro, a hard wheat semolina flour, gives this bread its deep, shiny brown crust and golden interior.  You can substitute unbleached all-purpose flour for the semolina, but the interior will be lighter.

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in 1 cup of the warm water.  Add the honey and let the yeast proof for 5 minutes or until foamy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir in the remaining 3/4 cup water and the olive oil.  Add 3 1/2 cups of the flour along with the salt and mix with your hands into a rough ball.  Add the raisins and lemon peel and continue to work the dough, adding additional flour as necessary, until the dough is no longer sticky.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it until soft and very smooth, about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Generously grease a large bowl with olive oil and add the dough, turning to coat.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for about 2 hours until doubled in size.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Set a baking stone on the lowest rack to preheat for at least 20 minutes, or butter a cookie sheet.  Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for about 5 minutes.  Then roll it under your palms into a 26-inch long log.  Turn the dough in on itself from each end until the two ends meet in the middle, like a pretzel.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If using a baking stone, place the loaf on a peel dusted with cornmeal or place on a cookie sheet.  Cover and let rise for 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush the top of the loaf with the beaten egg yolk.  If using a baking stone, dust with cornmeal, and slide the loaf from the peel onto the stone.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  If using a cookie sheet, bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until the crust is a shiny brown.  Remove the bread to a wire rack to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 large loaf.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  I first sampled this bread in Sicily at Eastertime in Santa Caterina Villarmosa, the birthplace of my Grandfather Saporito.  Grano duro, a hard wheat semolina flour, gives this bread its deep, shiny brown crust and golden interior.  You can substitute unbleached all-purpose flour for the semolina, but the interior will be lighter.

                        Rhubarb And Fig Pie  - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
  1              large  egg
  1              large  egg yolk
                        Grated zest of 1 lemon
  2 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/4         pounds  rhubarb -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" chunks
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
     3/4           cup  chopped Calimyrna figs - (1/4 lb)
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
     1/2           cup  slivered almonds
  1         tablespoon  turbinado (coarse brown) sugar

In a food processor or in a bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, and salt.  Add the butter and pulse, or cut in with a pastry blender, until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.  Add the egg, egg yolk, lemon zest, and juice through the feed tube, or stir in, and pulse or mix just until a dough starts to form.  Gather the dough into a ball and wrap in wax paper.  Refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the filling:  In a medium saucepan, combine the rhubarb, sugar, and water.  Cook, stirring, over low heat until the mixture thickens.  Remove from the heat and stir in the figs and vanilla.  Cover and refrigerate.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Divide the dough in half.  On a lightly floured board surface, roll out one piece to a 13-inch circle.  Fit it into a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, and trim off the excess dough.

Spoon the filling into the pan.  Sprinkle the almonds evenly over the top.

Roll out the second piece of dough to an 11-inch circle.  With a pastry wheel, cut the dough into 1/2-inch wide strips.  Made a lattice top for the tart.  Pinch the ends of the strips into the bottom pastry.  Scatter the turbinado sugar over the top of the tart.

Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the lattice top is nicely browned.  Remove from the oven and let cool completely on a rack.  Cut into wedges to serve.

Note:  If you wish, use any leftover dough to make miniature tarts and fill them with jam.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Tart rhubarb and sweet dried figs create a delicious filling for an unusual lattice-crust pie.  I make it in celebration of spring, but I also harvest and freeze some of the deep ruby-colored stalks so I can make this jewel-like pie any time of the year.

          Rice Cake From Tuscany - {Torta Di Riso From Tuscany}

                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  raisins
     1/4           cup  orange liqueur or rum
  4               cups  milk
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  arborio rice
                        Grated zest of 1 large lemon or orange
     1/2           cup  diced candied orange peel
     1/2           cup  slivered almonds
  2              large  eggs
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        = (or Mascarpone cheese or plain yogurt)

Butter and flour a 9- by 2-inch cake pan.  Line the bottom of the pan with a sheet of parchment paper and brush the top with melted butter.  Set the pan aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Put the raisins in a small bowl, pour the liqueur over them and allow to marinate at least 30 minutes before making the cake.

Slowly bring the milk to a boil in a saucepan, lower the heat, stir in the sugar, and the rice.  Lower the heat to simmer, cover the pan and allow the rice to cook until all the milk is absorbed, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Transfer the rice to a large bowl and allow the mixture to cool to lukewarm.  Stir in the raisins with the liqueur, zest, peel, almonds, eggs, and the salt and cinnamon.  Slowly stir in the heavy cream and mix well.

Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan.  Place the pan in a larger pan and carefully pour enough hot water into the large pan to a depth of 1 inch.

Bake the cake until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean but not dry, about 45 minutes.

Remove the cake pan from the water bath and cool it on a rack.  Use a butter knife to loosen the cake around the edges of the pan and carefully invert the cake onto a serving dish.  Remove and discard the parchment paper.

Serve the cake cut into wedges with a dollop of mascarpone cheese or whipped cream.  Garnish with an orange segment or a strawberry.

The cake can also be made in a buttered and floured 9- by 2-inch ring pan.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Being in the kitchen with Maria Gorelli in Montalcino brought back such fond memories for me of the many times I have traveled to this town of timeless character devoted to wine.  While there a few years ago I had the privilege of teaching Tuscan cooking with Italian rice expert Edgardo Sandoli.  We were evenly suited to one another in the kitchen and Edgardo made this wonderful torta di riso (rice cake) with arborio rice for us to enjoy after we had sent the students home.  Over some coffee and wonderful bites of this comforting treat we talked about the joys of living and cooking in Tuscany.  The cake is easy to make and cooked in a bagnomaria, a water bath, to create even heat.  Arborio rice is available in supermarkets and specialty stores; it is the same rice used to make risotto.

             Ricotta Cheesecake With Pomegranate Sauce - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHEESECAKE ===
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened
  16            ounces  skim-milk ricotta cheese -- well drained
  1              pound  mascarpone cheese or cream cheese -- softened
  1                cup  sugar
  4              large  eggs -- separated
     1/3           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === POMEGRANATE SAUCE ===
  4              large  pomegranates - (abt 3 lbs)
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch -- sifted
     3/4           cup  sugar

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Grease a 9-inch springform pan with the butter.  Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper and grease the paper with the remaining butter.  Generously dust the pan with flour and shake out the excess.

In a bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the cheeses until smooth.  Beat in the sugar.  Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, until well blended.  Fold in the flour.

In another bowl, with clean beaters, beat the egg whites with the salt until stiff peaks form.  Fold the egg whites into the cheese mixture.  Pour the batter into the pan, and smooth the top with a spatula.

Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.

Turn off the oven and leave the cake in the oven with the door ajar for 30 minutes.  Remove the cake to a rack and let cool completely, then cover and refrigerate the cake for at least 2 hours.

To serve, run a knife around the edges of the cake to loosen it.  Release the spring on the side of the pan and remove the springform ring.  Put a serving dish over the top of the cake and invert it onto the plate.  Remove the parchment paper.

Spread the pomegranate sauce evenly over the top of the cake.  Cut the cake into wedges.  (The sauce may also be placed in a bowl and passed on the side.)

Pomegranate Sauce:  Cut the pomegranates in half.  Place a fine mesh sieve over a large bowl.  Using a spoon or your fingers, scrape the seeds into the sieve.

With a wooden spoon or a flat meat pounder, press on the seeds to extract 2 cups of juice.  Discard the seeds and set the juice aside.

In a medium saucepan, mix the cornstarch with the sugar.  Slowly stir in the pomegranate juice and mix well.  Cook the sauce over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce begins to thicken and darkens to a deep wine color, and the sauce coats the back of the spoon.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  The sauce may be made ahead and stored in a jar in the refrigerator.  It will thicken somewhat if stored.  When ready to use, thin with a little warm water if necessary.

This recipe yields 1 cake.

Comments:  Christmas cooking would not be complete without pomegranates.  The fruit is often depicted in Italian works of religious art.  It is said that the multitude of seeds, nestled together so neatly in one fruit, is like the union of people who make up one church.  For eating, the seeds are squeezed to make a drink called granatina, or they are sprinkled into salads of bitter chicories.  This recipe is a modern departure for another use of the fruit, as a sauce for ricotta cheesecake.  The cake, as well as the sauce, can be made two days ahead.  Skim-milk ricotta best approximates the texture of Italian ricotta.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  3               cups  skim-milk ricotta cheese -- well drained
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  3 1/2         ounces  milk chocolate bar -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest
                        === DOUGH ===
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (12 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  ice water - (to 2 1/2)
  1                     egg -- beaten

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  In a bowl, combine all the filling ingredients.  Cover and refrigerate while you make the crust.

In a bowl, mix the flour and salt together.  Add the butter and, with a pastry blender, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the eggs and ice water and mix with your hands until a ball of dough is formed.  Wrap the dough in wax paper and chill for 10 to 15 minutes.

Divide the dough in half.  On a floured surface, roll out one piece of dough to a 12-inch round.  Fit it into a 9-inch pie dish.  Scoop the filling into the crust.

Roll out the second piece of dough to an 11-inch round and place it on top of the filling.  Trim the excess dough and pinch the edges to seal them.  With a skewer, make tiny holes all over the crust.  Brush the top crust with the beaten egg.

Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned.  Let the pie cool completely before cutting into wedges.

This recipe yields 1 pie.

Comments:  This rich sheep's-milk ricotta pie was served to my husband and me by my friend Maria Iapichino, whose home in Cefalu on the northern coast of Sicily overlooks the sea.  Shepherds and their flocks are all you see for miles in the interior of Sicily.  Sheep's-milk ricotta cheese, a by-product of Pecorino cheese, is much stronger in flavor than the cow's-milk ricotta found in our supermarkets.  I used skim-milk ricotta in the recipe with excellent results.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  2              large  eggs -- plus
  1              large  egg yolk
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2               cups  milk -- scalded, and
                        cooled slightly
  1 1/2           cups  ricotta cheese -- well drained
                        Grated zest of 1 large lemon
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  cornstarch
     1/2           cup  sugar
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract

In a medium stainless-steel saucepan, beat the whole eggs and 3/4 cup sugar with a wire whisk until well blended.  Add the 1/4 cup flour a little at a time and blend well.  Gradually add the milk and whisk well.  Place the saucepan over medium heat and whisk the mixture constantly for about 6 minutes, or until it thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon.  Place the filling in a bowl and cover with a sheet of buttered waxed paper.  Set aside.

In another bowl, with a hand-held mixer, beat the ricotta, remaining sugar, and egg yolk until very smooth.  Fold in the lemon zest.  Add the cooled filling, blend well, and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly grease an 11-inch round tart pan and a 14- by 4-inch rectangular pan with removable bottoms.

With a food processor or by hand, combine the flour and cornstarch in a bowl; add the remaining dough ingredients and mix until a soft ball begins to form.  Knead the dough for just a few minutes on a floured surface, then divide it in half.  Pat each half into a tart pan to cover the bottom and sides.  Freeze the rectangular shell for future use.

Pour the filling into the round tart pan and smooth the top.  Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean.  Remove the tart to a rack to cool completely.  Remove the sides from the pan, place the tart on a serving dish, and cut into wedges to serve.

Variation:  Cut thin slices of fresh strawberries, kiwi fruit or figs to layer over the top.  Glaze with warmed apricot or apple jelly.

As an alternative, make one thicker-crusted tart in a 16-inch pan.

This recipe yields one 11-inch tart.

Comments:  Golden-rich ricotta tarts are a specialty of the arcaded city of Bologna.  Some are filled with hazelnuts and chocolate; others have sweet almond paste; and there are even some filled with tagliatelle!  This one has an easy-to-make custard and ricotta filling.

The amount of pastry dough here is enough for 2 small tart shells.  I make one large round tart and one long and narrow rectangular shell, which I freeze for future use.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  warm water -- (100 degrees)
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  dry white wine -- room temperature
                        = (such as Orvieto Classico)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  anise seeds
                        = (or 1 tspn anise extract)
  5               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

Pour the water into a large bowl or into the bowl of a stand mixer.  Stir in the yeast and allow it to proof or get chalky-looking, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the wine, olive oil, salt, and anise seeds.  Mix well by hand or use the paddle blade on the stand mixer to blend to ingredients.

Begin adding the flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition.  If using the stand mixer, beat each cup of flour in before adding another.  This is a soft and silky dough and 5 cups should be just about the right amount.  If the dough is still sticky after 5 cups, gradually add in 1 tablespoon flour until the right consistency is obtained.  The dough should come away from the bowl with ease.

Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead it with your hands for 2 or 3 minutes.  Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll each piece into a 12- or 14-inch long rope.  Bring the two ends together and place the ciambelle on a clean towel.  Allow them to rise covered for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile bring a large pot of water to the boil.  Boil the ciambelle one at a time and when they bob to the surface, remove them with a slotted spoon and place them on a towel-lined baking sheet.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Remove the ciambelle from the towel-lined baking sheet and space them evenly on the parchment-lined sheet.  Bake the ciambelle for 35 to 40 minutes or until they are golden brown.  Transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Variation:  Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and roll each one into a 12- to 14-inch long rope.  Use two ropes to make a braid; pinch the ends together and continue as above for the recipe.  Or divide the dough into small orange-size pieces and make ciambelline, mini ciambelle.

This recipe yields 4 small ciambelle.

Comments:  In the southwestern-most corner of Umbria in the town of Otricoli, a special ciambella, ring-shaped bread, said to have its origins among the poor, is made to honor Saint Joseph for his intercession in multiplying the townspeople's grain harvest and thereby saving them from famine and death.  So on his feast day, March 19th, and also at Christmastime, the ciambelle are made in abundance and distributed to everyone along with cooked fava beans in celebration of this miracle.  Flavored with anise seeds, they resemble large bagels and are boiled then baked, resulting in a chewy texture that is just right for accompanying soups, stews, or eaten plain as a snack.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  anise extract
  2        tablespoons  anise seeds
  6               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour

In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk.  Slowly add the honey, whisking constantly.  Gradually whisk in the oil and whisk for 2 to 3 minutes longer.  Then add the anise extract and anise seeds and mix well.  Add the flour 1 cup at a time, and mix until a ball of dough is formed.  The dough will be sticky.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes.  With floured hands, pinch off pieces of dough the size of golf balls and roll them into ropes 6 inches long and the width of your middle finger.  Pinch the ends of each roll together to form a ring.  Place the taralli on kitchen towels as you form them.

In a large pot of boiling water, cook the taralli in batches: Drop the rings a few at a time into the water and boil for 5 minutes after they have returned to the surface.  (They will look a little wrinkled at this point, but will smooth out as they bake.)  Remove the taralli with a slotted spoon and place them on clean towels.  Let stand for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Lightly grease 2 cookie sheets.

Place the rings 1/2 inch apart on the baking sheets and bake for 20 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Transfer to wire racks to cool.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  The first time my husband and I visited Milan, we had no idea where to eat dinner.  We knew we wanted to taste northern specialties like risotto, veal chop Milanese-style, and polenta, but since we were so tired, we chose a restaurant near the train station.  It was called La Porta Rossa (The Red Door).  One look at the menu told me that seafood, southern style, was the specialty, and that the establishment was owned by Pugliese.  Puglia is the region at the heel of the Italian boot, and Esposito is a very common name there.  When the cameriere saw our last name on my credit card, it was as if we were long-lost relatives of the owners.  They gave us ceramic pitchers to take home and newspapers about Puglia as well as a bagful of taralli, honey-and-anise-flavored cookies that look like miniature bagels.  When we went back the following evening, we were welcomed as family and given another bag of taralli; I asked how they were made and this is what I came away with.

              Rosemary And Raisin Rolls - {Pan Di Ramerino}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1 3/4           cups  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 4 1/2)
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt
                        === FILLING ===
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh rosemary needles -- minced
     1/2           cup  chopped dark raisins
                        = (or 1/3 cup whole currants)
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten

Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup of the water in a large bowl.  Stir to mix well and allow the yeast to get chalky looking and bubbly, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the remaining water and the olive oil.  Begin adding the flour one cup at a time to the yeast mixture, working it in with your hands until you have a rough looking or shaggy mass of dough.  Add the salt with the last addition of flour.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it with your hands until a soft ball of dough comes together that is not sticking to your hands.  If you need more flour, add it a little at a time, about 2 tablespoons, otherwise a tough dough will result.

Lightly spray a large bowl with olive oil, add the dough, turning it in the bowl to coat it with the oil.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow it to double in size in a warm but not hot place.

Meanwhile heat the olive oil in a small skillet over low heat.  Stir in the rosemary needles and cook them for 2 minutes, pressing on them with the back of a wooden spoon to release their oil.  Stir in the raisins or currants and cook 1 minute.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl to cool.

Lightly spray two baking sheets with olive oil and set aside.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead for 3 or 4 minutes until smooth and not sticky.  Roll the dough into a 14-inch round and spread the rosemary mixture over it.  Roll the dough up like a jelly roll, tucking in the ends as you go.  Pinch the underside seam closed.

Fold the dough in half and knead it into a ball to distribute the filling.  The dough will feel wet and sticky at first but as you knead it, it will come together.  Roll the dough out under the palm of your hands to form a long rope and cut it into 12 equal pieces.

Roll each piece into a smooth round ball.  Place the balls 1 inch apart on the baking sheets.  Brush the tops with the beaten egg.  Cover the balls with a clean towel and allow them to rise for 35 to 40 minutes or until they are puffy looking.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Just before baking, make an in the top of each roll with a scissors.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the rolls are nicely browned on top and bottom.  Remove them to cooling racks and cool completely.

Note:  These freeze well if wrapped individually in aluminum foil and placed in zip lock bags.  Allow the rolls to defrost, unwrapped, at room temperature.  Reheat in a preheated 325 degree oven for about 5 minutes.

This recipe yields 1 dozen.

Comments:  Nannini's is a favorite stop for hungry school children, too, where small rolls flavored with rosemary and raisins or currants, are a popular merenda (snack) and seem to fly out of the shop!  At one time women used to have these ready when children arrived home, but today they are rarely made at home.

  1                cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1           teaspoon  malt extract

Add additional flour only if necessary -- this is a loose dough; it should remain slightly wet and sticky.  Resist the temptation to add too much flour.

On a floured surface, knead the dough: Pick the dough up with one hand, using a pastry scraper to scrape it all up, and slam it back down on the work surface.  Do this six or seven times, or until the dough is smooth and slightly less sticky.

Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil and add the dough, turning it to coat.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for at least 4 to 6 hours, or even overnight, to allow the bread to develop its sour tang.

Punch down the dough, and turn it out onto a floured surface.  Knead the dough with floured hands until it is smooth and just barely sticky.  Form the dough into a round or oblong.  If using a baking stone, place the bread on a wooden peel heavily dusted with cornmeal or lined with parchment paper.  Or place it on a baking sheet.  Cover the dough with a clean cloth and let rise for about 40 minutes.

If using a baking stone, set the stone on the lowest oven rack and preheat the oven to 500 degrees at least 20 minutes before baking the bread.  If baking the bread on a baking sheet, preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Slash the top of the loaf in several places with a sharp knife, razor blade, or scissors.  If baking the bread on a stone, sprinkle the stone with cornmeal.  Slide the bread from the peel onto the stone, starting at the back of the oven and working forward; if the bread is on parchment, slide it on the paper onto the baking stone.  Or place the baking sheet in the lower third of the oven.

Using a plant mister, spray the oven several times with water, and close the oven door.  Spray two or three more times during the first 10 minutes of baking.  If using a stone, bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the bread is dark brown in color and sounds hollow when tapped with your hand.  If using a baking sheet, bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the bread is nicely browned and sounds hollow.  Remove the bread to a wire rack to cool.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

Comments:  This dense country loaf, made with a natural starter and malt extract, available in health food stores or through mail-order sources, gives a boost to the rising dough.  I bake the bread directly on a hot baking stone to ensure an evenly browned loaf, and I achieve a crackling crust by spraying water into the oven while the bread is baking.

                     Rustic Sicilian Pie - {Impanata}

Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  1              large  white onion -- thinly sliced
  2           packages  frozen spinach - (10 oz ea) -- cooked, drained,
                        and squeezed dry
     1/2           cup  toasted pine nuts
  1                cup  grated provolone cheese - (4 oz)
     1/2           cup  raisins
                        === DOUGH ===
     1/4        recipe  Carmelo's Sicilian Bread dough -- (see recipe),
                        prepared through step 4 - let rise on a
                        cookie sheet
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        Sesame seeds -- for sprinkling
                        Coarse sea salt -- for sprinkling

In a skillet, heat the olive oil over low heat.  Add the onions and cook until they are deep brown and lightly caramelized.  Add the spinach and pine nuts, and cook for 2 minutes.  Transfer to a bowl, and let cool, than add the cheese and raisins.  Mix well and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Divide the dough in half.  On a floured surface, roll one piece into a 12-inch circle.  Fit it into a 9-inch pie pan.  Spoon the filling into the pan.

Roll out the remaining dough to a 14-inch circle, and cover the filling with the dough.  Trim the excess dough and pinch the edges to seal.  Make a decorative border with your fingers.  Brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg, and sprinkle on the sesame seeds and coarse salt.

Bake the pie for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top is nicely browned.  Let cool slightly before cutting into wedges.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Impanata is a rustic Sicilian pie, filled with spinach, cheese, pine nuts, and raisins.  You will need only one quarter of the basic dough for Carmelo's Sicilian Bread for this two-crust pie; use the remaining dough to make a slightly smaller loaf of bread.  Since it can be made ahead and transported with ease, impanata is perfect picnic fare.

              San Costanzo Bread - {Torcolo Di San Costanzo}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  raisins
  1                cup  warm milk -- (110 degrees)
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- melted and cooled
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3              large  eggs -- slightly beaten,
                        plus
  1                     egg yolk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  finely-diced citron
  1         tablespoon  anise seeds
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
                        Grated zest of 2 large lemons
  6               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- more or less

Put the raisins in a small bowl and cover them with water.  Let them soak for 30 minutes to plump them, then drain off the water, mince the raisins, and set aside.

Pour the milk into the bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Sprinkle the yeast over the milk and quickly whisk it to dissolve the yeast.  On low speed blend in the butter, sugar, the whole eggs, salt, citron, raisins, anise seeds, pine nuts, and zest.  Begin adding 1 cup of the flour at a time on low speed and blend the mixture well before adding the next cup of flour.  Continue adding flour until the dough forms around the paddle and leaves the sides of the bowl.  Do not add so much flour that the dough will be tough and too dry.  It should not be sticky on your hands but just feel slightly tacky.

Remove the dough from the bowl onto a lightly floured surface and knead the dough with your hands several times to form it into a ball.  Put the dough in a large buttered bowl and cover it tightly with plastic wrap.  Allow the dough to rise in a not-too-hot-area, (75 degrees is ideal), until it is doubled in size; this could take 2 to 3 hours.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a 9- by 2-inch ring mold and set aside.

Punch down the dough with your fists.  Transfer the dough to a work surface and roll it into a 23- or 24-inch long rope.  Bring the two ends together, pinching them closed and place the dough in the prepared mold.  Cover with a clean towel and let rise for 30 minutes.  If you do not have a ring mold, place the dough on a greased baking sheet and place a well-greased 2 1/2- to 3-inch round oven proof dish in the center of the dough to keep its shape while baking.

When ready to bake, beat the remaining yolk with a fork; use a pastry brush to paint the top of the bread; this will give the finished bread a nice shiny look.

Bake the bread for 30 to 40 minutes or until the bread is firm to the touch and sounds hollow when tapped.  You can also insert a cake tester into the center of the bread and if it comes out clean, the bread is baked.  If the top browns too fast while baking, cover it loosely with a piece of aluminum foil.

Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 20 minutes.  Use a butter knife to loosen the sides of the bread from the mold.  Invert the mold and remove the bread to a cooling rack.  Allow the bread to cool completely.  If the bread was baked on a baking sheet, carefully remove the greased bowl in the center before transferring the bread to the cooling rack.

This recipe yields 1 large ring-shaped loaf.

Comments:  Torcolo is the classic sweet bread of Perugia made on January 29th to commemorate the feast of its' patron, San Costanzo.  It is also a tradition for a man to give this bread to his lover.  The story goes that if the statue of San Costanzo winks at you on the day the bread is presented, a couple will marry within the year.  It would be nice to speculate that this is true, and that the breads ring shape is symbolic of the wedding ring, but even if this is not the case, it is easily made for any occasion in a stand mixer.  The dough is very heavy and laden with citron, raisins and anise seeds.  The dough can also be made by hand in a bowl.  Start the process early in the day.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  skim milk ricotta cheese -- well drained
  4             ounces  milk chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  1 3/4           cups  sugar
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  4              large  eggs
  2               cups  fine dry bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon
  1             recipe  Straight Dough -- (see recipe)
  6               cups  vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

In a small bowl, combine the cheese, chocolate, 1/4 cup of the sugar, and the lemon and orange zests and stir to blend.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Crack the eggs into another small bow.  Beat them slightly with a fork and set aside.

Pour the bread crumbs into a medium bowl and set aside.

Place the remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar and the cinnamon in a heavy paper bag.  Fold over the top, shake to blend the ingredients well, and set aside.

Punch down the risen dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Roll the dough out into an 18-inch circle.  Using a 3-inch round cutter, cut circles from the dough.  Place the circles on clean dish towels, about 1 inch apart.  Reroll the scraps and cut enough circles to make 24 in all.

Place 2 tablespoons of the filling in the center of each of 12 of the circles.  Brush the edges lightly with some of the beaten eggs.  Cover with the remaining circles and seal the edges with your fingers.  Then pinch the edges together all around to seal.

Carefully lift each filled round with your fingers and dip it in the beaten eggs, turning to coat on both sides.  Then gently coat each round with the bread crumbs and place the rounds on cookie sheets, leaving some space between each one.

In a deep-fryer or deep heavy pan, heat the vegetable oil to 375 degrees.  Fry the iris a few at a time until they puff up and are browned on the bottom.  Turn and cook until browned on the other side.  With a slotted spoon, remove the iris to brown paper to drain well.

While they are still warm, place the iris one at a time in the bag with the sugar and cinnamon and gently shake to coat them.  Place the iris on a decorative platter and serve warm.

This recipe yields 1 dozen iris.

Comments:  As soon as I spotted iris, typical Sicilian street food, in the Capo market in Palermo, I knew I had to try one of these beautiful golden disks of yeast dough, coated with crunchy bread crumbs and cinnamon sugar.  From the inside, a pleasant surprise of warm soft and creamy sheep's milk ricotta cheese, sweetened with sugar and mixed with chunks of chocolate, oozed out.  I even found myself licking my fingers after this most satisfying culinary experience.  Since sheep's milk ricotta cheese is not easy to find, use skim milk ricotta.  Iris are best eaten the day they are made.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  2        tablespoons  orange liqueur
  2              large  carrots -- peeled and grated
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  finely-chopped walnuts
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for sprinkling
  18                    aluminum foil cupcake cups
                        = (3" wide and 1 1/2" deep)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter the aluminum foil cupcake cups.  In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks and sugar until lemon-colored and doubled in volume.  Gradually beat in the butter and orange liqueur.  Fold in the carrots, flour, and salt.  Fold in the nuts.

In another bowl, with clean beaters, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry.  Gently fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture.

Divide the batter among the cupcake cups, filling them about 2/3 full.  Place the cups on two cookie sheets.  Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the cakes are golden brown and firm to the touch.  Remove the cups to racks and let cool completely.

Run a knife around the outside edge of each cup, and unmold the cakes onto a serving dish.  Sprinkle the tops with confectioners' sugar.

Note:  The cakes can be baked a day ahead.  Let cool, wrap each foil cup in plastic wrap, and store at room temperature.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  For a large gathering, I like to serve several desserts, choosing those I can prepare ahead.  These light-textured small carrot cakes can be baked a day ahead.

                    Spicy Mustard - {Senape Piccante}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  brown mustard seeds
  1                cup  yellow mustard seeds
  2               cups  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  honey
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt
  1           teaspoon  ground allspice
  6                     sterilized 1/2-pint jars

Put the mustard seeds in a large noncorrosive bowl and pour the vinegar over them.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the seeds soak for 2 days.  As they do, they will absorb the vinegar.

Transfer the mustard seeds to a food processor.  Add the honey, salt, and allspice and pulse until a grainy paste if formed.  If you want a smoother texture, pulse longer.

Fill the jars with the mustard.  Place a round of wax paper slightly larger than the jar opening over the top of each one and cap.  Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.

This recipe yields 3 pints.

Comments:  If you are a spicy mustard fan, you owe it to yourself to try this easy recipe.  You'll find it becomes one of your must-have-on-hand ingredients.  Use it in marinades and sauces, on pizza, in sandwiches, for dipping bread sticks, or top dainty pieces of cheese with it for an antipasto.

             Spicy Mustard, Potato, And Red Onion Pizza - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- or more if
                        necessary
  2             medium  red onions - (1/2 lb) -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  3             medium  all-purpose potatoes - (3/4 lb) -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/4" thick
  1             recipe  Straight Dough -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  spicy mustard
  2         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme
     3/4         pound  caciocavallo cheese -- grated
                        Fine Sea salt -- to taste

Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.  Add the onions and 1 teaspoon of the sugar and cook until the onions are soft, glazed, and starting to brown, 5 to 8 minutes.  Remove the onions to a bowl and set aside.

Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon sugar to the pan.  Cook the potatoes, in batches if necessary, stirring often and adding additional olive oil if the pan is dry, until the potatoes just begin to brown.  Remove the potatoes to a bowl and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Lightly spray two 13- or 14-inch pizza pans with olive oil spray and set aside.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide the dough in half.  Work with one piece at a time, keeping the second piece covered with a towel or bowl.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to fit a pizza pan.  Place the dough on one of the prepared pans and brush 2 tablespoons of the mustard evenly over the surface.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the thyme evenly over the dough.

Arrange half the potatoes over the dough.  Scatter half the onions over the potatoes.  Sprinkle on half the cheese and sea salt to taste.

Repeat the process with the remaining dough and topping ingredients.

Bake the pizze for 25 to 30 minutes, until the tops are golden brown, the cheese is melted, and the bottom of the crust is crisp and evenly browned.  Remove the pizze to a cutting board, and cut into wedges with scissors.  Serve immediately.

Variation:  Scatter a combination of black and green oil-cured olives over the pizza halfway through the baking.

This recipe yields two 13- to 14-inch pizze for 12 to 16 servings.

Comments:  This slightly unconventional potato-and-red-onion-topped pizza has lots of zip and tang because of the thin coating of spicy mustard over the dough.  Caciocavallo cheese is a cow's milk cheese that is shaped something like a melon.  It is sold in pairs, tied together with string.  If it is unavailable, substitute mozzarella cheese.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.  Add the onions and 1 teaspoon of the sugar and cook until the onions are soft, glazed, and starting to brown, 5 to 8 minutes.  Remove the onions to a bowl and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon sugar to the pan.  Cook the potatoes, in batches if necessary, stirring often and adding additional olive oil if the pan is dry, until the potatoes just begin to brown.  Remove the potatoes to a bowl and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly spray two 13- or 14-inch pizza pans with olive oil spray and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide the dough in half.  Work with one piece at a time, keeping the second piece covered with a towel or bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to fit a pizza pan.  Place the dough on one of the prepared pans and brush 2 tablespoons of the mustard evenly over the surface.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the thyme evenly over the dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange half the potatoes over the dough.  Scatter half the onions over the potatoes.  Sprinkle on half the cheese and sea salt to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Repeat the process with the remaining dough and topping ingredients.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the pizze for 25 to 30 minutes, until the tops are golden brown, the cheese is melted, and the bottom of the crust is crisp and evenly browned.  Remove the pizze to a cutting board, and cut into wedges with scissors.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Variation:  Scatter a combination of black and green oil-cured olives over the pizza halfway through the baking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields two 13- to 14-inch pizze for 12 to 16 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This slightly unconventional potato-and-red-onion-topped pizza has lots of zip and tang because of the thin coating of spicy mustard over the dough.  Caciocavallo cheese is a cow&apos;s milk cheese that is shaped something like a melon.  It is sold in pairs, tied together with string.  If it is unavailable, substitute mozzarella cheese.

             Square Pizza With Olives - {Scacciata Con Olive}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1                     egg -- room temperature
  4 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 4 1/2)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        === TOPPING ===
  2               cups  prepared tomato sauce
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
     1/3           cup  oil-cured black olives - (abt 14) -- pitted and halved
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino-Romano cheese

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1/2 cup of the water.  Allow the yeast to proof, covered, for about 10 minutes.  Add the remaining water, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and the egg and beat with a whisk to blend.

Add 4 cups of the flour mixed with the salt to the yeast mixture and mix with your hands to form a soft ball.  Add additional flour as needed.

Place the dough on a floured surface and knead it for 5 minutes, or until very soft.  Grease a bowl with 1 teaspoon of olive oil, add the dough, and toss it in the oil.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Grease a 17- by 11-inch jellyroll or other pan with the remaining olive oil.  Set aside.

Punch down the dough on a floured surface and, with a rolling pin, roll it out to fit the pan.  Fit the dough in the pan, bringing the edges up the sides.

Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough.  Sprinkle the oregano over the sauce.  Evenly space the olives, cut-sides down, over the top.  Sprinkle on the cheese.

Bake the pizza for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the bottom crust is nicely browned.    Cool slightly for even cutting, then cut into squares and serve.

This recipe yields one 17- by 11-inch pizza.

Comments:  I was amused and delighted when a friend of mine sent me a food clipping from Florida showing a woman cutting into scacciata.  She wanted to know if I had ever heard of it.  Yes, my grandmothers and my mother made this thick egg-dough-based pizza.  It is usually baked in a square or rectangular pan and cut into squares.  The word scacciata is derived from scacco, which means "square".  There are infinite toppings for this chewy pizza, and probably as many names.  Scacciata con Olive, which is a family favorite, can be cut into tiny squares for appetizers, or it can be the centerpiece for lunch or a simple supper.

                          Starter - {Cresciuta}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  water -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  natural apple cider
  1                     generous cup seedless grapes -- washed and dried

In a bowl or tall glass jar, stir together the flour, water, and cider until smooth.

Wrap the grapes in a piece of cheesecloth and tie the cloth into a knot.  Press on the cheesecloth with your hand to slightly crush the grapes.  Submerge the grapes in the flour mixture and cover the bowl or jar with a piece of damp cheesecloth.

Let this mixture sit in a warm place, preferably in a place where you make bread -- this is where the air in your kitchen is filled with wild yeast spores, and keeping the starter there increases the likelihood that wild yeast spores will be "captured" by the starter.  Keep the cheesecloth covering the starter damp; after a day, remove the cheesecloth and cover the bowl or jar loosely with plastic wrap.

The starter is ready to use when you see many bubbles on the surface and it begins to smell very sour.  It will take about 2 days to develop.  Discard the grapes in cheesecloth, pour the starter into a glass jar with a lid, and refrigerate it.

To make Pane Rustico with the starter, you will need 1 cup of starter.  Put it in a bowl and let it come to room temperature.  Stir 3/4 cup flour and 3/4 cup room-temperature water into the starter remaining in the jar.  Cover the jar and refrigerate.  Replenishing the starter will keep it active and strong; each time the starter is used, be sure to add equal amounts of flour and water to it.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 cups.

Comments:  This is my favorite recipe for a natural starter.  It produces a loaf of bread with a crunchy crust, a chewy interior, and just the right amount of tang.  Starters using natural yeast can be made in your kitchen from nothing more than flour, water, and something for the sugars in the flour to feed on.  This could be a bunch of grapes, a bit of overripe mashed banana, or naturally fermenting cider.  Once you make the starter, keep it active by feeding it additional flour and water.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  1           teaspoon  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  mascarpone cheese -- room temperature
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  8        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces
     1/4           cup  cold water
  1         tablespoon  strawberry or apple jelly -- melted
                        === GLAZE ===
  5              pints  strawberries
     1/2           cup  water
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2 1/2    tablespoons  orange liqueur

In the top of a double boiler, off the heat, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar.  Whisk in the flour until well blended.  Whisk in the milk.  Cook over medium heat, whisking, until the filling begins to thicken and coats the whisk.  Pour the filling into a bowl.  Cover with a piece of buttered wax paper, pressing it against the surface of the filling, and refrigerate for several hours, or overnight.

In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, and salt, and process to blend.  Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.  With the motor running, add the water through the feed tube and process just until a ball of dough begins to form.  Do not overprocess the dough, or it will be tough.  Alternatively, in a bowl, mix the flour, sugar, and salt.  With a fork or pastry blender, work in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.  Add the water and stir to form a dough.

Gather the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for 1 hour, or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees, and place a rack in the center of   the oven.  On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a 14-inch circle.  Fit the dough into an 11-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, and trim the excess dough.  Prick the dough all over with a fork.

Bake the tart shell for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove to a cooling rack and immediately brush it with the jam.  Let cool completely.

Hull the strawberries and wipe them clean with a damp towel; do not wash the berries, or the tart will be soggy.  Chop enough of the berries to make 1/2 cup.  Put the chopped berries in a saucepan, add the water, and bring to a boil, crushing the berries with a wooden spoon to release their juices.  Pour the mixture into a fine strainer set over a bowl, and set the saucepan aside.  Press on the berries to release as much juice as possible, then discard the strawberry pulp.  You should have about 2/3 cup juice.

In the saucepan, stir together the sugar and cornstarch, making sure there are no lumps.  Slowly stir in the strawberry juice and blend well.  Cook over medium heat, stirring, until the glaze thickens to the consistency of honey.  Remover the saucepan from the heat and stir in the orange liqueur.  Cover to keep warm.

Stir the mascarpone cheese into the cream filling.  Spread the filling over the cooled tart shell.  Arrange the remaining whole strawberries decoratively over the filling.  With a pastry brush, paint the strawberries with the glaze, letting it run down between the berries.

Place the tart on a serving plate and refrigerate for several hours before serving.  To serve cut into wedges.  (This is best eaten the day it is made.)

This recipe yields 1 tart.

In the top of a double boiler, off the heat, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar.  Whisk in the flour until well blended.  Whisk in the milk.  Cook over medium heat, whisking, until the filling begins to thicken and coats the whisk.  Pour the filling into a bowl.  Cover with a piece of buttered wax paper, pressing it against the surface of the filling, and refrigerate for several hours, or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, and salt, and process to blend.  Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.  With the motor running, add the water through the feed tube and process just until a ball of dough begins to form.  Do not overprocess the dough, or it will be tough.  Alternatively, in a bowl, mix the flour, sugar, and salt.  With a fork or pastry blender, work in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.  Add the water and stir to form a dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Gather the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for 1 hour, or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees, and place a rack in the center of   the oven.  On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a 14-inch circle.  Fit the dough into an 11-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, and trim the excess dough.  Prick the dough all over with a fork.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the tart shell for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove to a cooling rack and immediately brush it with the jam.  Let cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Hull the strawberries and wipe them clean with a damp towel; do not wash the berries, or the tart will be soggy.  Chop enough of the berries to make 1/2 cup.  Put the chopped berries in a saucepan, add the water, and bring to a boil, crushing the berries with a wooden spoon to release their juices.  Pour the mixture into a fine strainer set over a bowl, and set the saucepan aside.  Press on the berries to release as much juice as possible, then discard the strawberry pulp.  You should have about 2/3 cup juice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the saucepan, stir together the sugar and cornstarch, making sure there are no lumps.  Slowly stir in the strawberry juice and blend well.  Cook over medium heat, stirring, until the glaze thickens to the consistency of honey.  Remover the saucepan from the heat and stir in the orange liqueur.  Cover to keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir the mascarpone cheese into the cream filling.  Spread the filling over the cooled tart shell.  Arrange the remaining whole strawberries decoratively over the filling.  With a pastry brush, paint the strawberries with the glaze, letting it run down between the berries.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the tart on a serving plate and refrigerate for several hours before serving.  To serve cut into wedges.  (This is best eaten the day it is made.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 tart.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  warm water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1              large  egg -- slightly beaten
  5        tablespoons  butter -- melted
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest
     1/8      teaspoon  powdered saffron
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
                        Confectioner's sugar -- for sprinkling

Pour the warm water into a bowl, sprinkle on the yeast, and stir to dissolve.  Gradually add the flour and mix with your hands until a ball of dough is formed.  Knead the dough on a floured surface.  Oil a bowl with 1 teaspoon of olive oil, add the dough, and turn the dough in the oil to coat it.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and place it in a warm place to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Remove the plastic wrap.  Do not punch the dough down.  Add the egg and all but 1 tablespoon of the melted butter, the granulated sugar, zest, saffron, and vanilla.  Using an electric mixer with a dough hook, beat the ingredients on high for about 2 minutes.  Or use a wooden spoon, and beat the ingredients by hand into the dough using a circular motion.  Beat for about 10 minutes to incorporate enough air into the dough.  It will be very soft and sticky.

Use 1 teaspoon of the remaining butter to grease a 12- by 10-inch baking sheet.  Using a rubber spatula, pour the dough onto the sheet and smooth it out to the edges.  Brush the remaining melted butter over the top.  Let the dough rise in a warm oven for about 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Bake the bread for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the top is nicely browned.  Let the Schiacciata cool completely, then cut into squares and dust with confectioner's sugar.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

Comments:  In the tombs of the Etruscans, early inhabitants of Italy, there are curious drawings of daily activities, including depictions of pasta making and bread making.  One such bread was Schiacciata, a flat bread that today has many different versions, depending on where you are in Italy.  In Siena, it is a flat Easter cake with confectioner's sugar on the top; in Florence, an hour's drive away, it is a flat pizza with herbs or onions.  This recipe, an old version of Schiacciata, is made with batterlike dough and baked in a rectangular pan.  It has a slightly sweet flavor and is perfect for breakfast or tea.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  10 1/2   tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
     2/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1              large  egg
  3              large  egg yolks
                        Grated zest of 1 lemon
  3 2/3           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
                        === FILLING ===
     2/3           cup  grape jam
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped toasted almonds - (3 oz)
  2             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  unsweetened cocoa
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

In a bowl, using an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light-colored.  Beat in the egg and then the egg yolks one at a time.  Beat in the lemon zest.

Sift the flour with the baking soda over the egg mixture, stirring it in with a wooden spoon.  The dough will be very soft.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly grease two cookie sheets.  In a bowl, combine the filling ingredients and mix well.  Set aside.

Divide the dough in half.  On a floured surface, roll out each half to a thickness of 1/4 inch.  Using a 2 1/4-inch round cookie cutter, cut out circles from the dough.  Place a generous teaspoon of the filling on one half of each circle and fold the other half over to enclose the filling.  Press the edges closed with a fork dipped in flour, and place the cookies 1 inch apart on the cookie sheets.  Reroll the scraps to make more cookies.

Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are lightly browned.  Remove to cooling racks to cool completely.

Dust the cooled cookies with confectioners' sugar.

This recipe yields about 5 dozen.

Comments:  Bocconotti translates to "mouthfuls" or "bites".  This traditional half-moon-shaped cookie with a cake-like texture is filled with grape jam and chocolate.  The recipe comes from my friend Domenica Baglioni Flamminj, a chef who lives in Teramo in the region of Abruzzi.

              Tangy Tomato Logs - {Ceppi Tangy Di Pomodoro}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        recipe  Straight Dough -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  diced homemade or store-bought
                        dried tomatoes in olive oil -- drained
     1/4           cup  diced oil-cured black olives -- (optional)

Lightly spray a baking sheet with olive oil spray.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces.  Work with one piece at a time, keeping the other piece covered with a towel or a bowl.

Roll the dough out into a 10-inch round.  Spread half the tomatoes and half the olives, if desired, over the dough.  Roll the dough up like a jelly roll, beginning at the side nearest you.  Pinch the seam closed.

Fold the dough in half and knead it until the tomatoes and olives burst through the dough.  The dough will be wet because of the tomatoes, but will come together as you knead it.  If you must, add only enough additional flour to the work surface to keep the dough from sticking.  With lightly floured hands, roll the dough into a 16-inch-long log.  Place the log on the greased baking sheet.  With scissors, make alternating 1/2-inch-deep diagonal slits 2 inches apart on either side of the log.

Repeat the process with the remaining dough, leaving a 3-inch space between the 2 logs on the baking sheet.  Cover the logs with a clean cloth and let rise for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Bake the logs for 30 to 35 minutes, until they are nicely browned on the top and underside.  Remove the logs to a rack to cool completely.

This recipe yields two 16-inch long logs.

Comments:  Dried tomatoes have many uses: In sauces, stews, salads, antipasto, and sandwiches.  I also add them to half the Straight Dough to make a pair of rustic, crunchy bread logs that are great with cheeses such as Asiago and Taleggio.  While you're at it, you may use the remaining dough to make a loaf of bread or use all the dough and double the amount of dried tomatoes (and olives, if you like) to make four logs.  The logs freeze beautifully.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  11            ounces  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        = (abt 3 cups lightly spooned into
                        measuring cup)
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  chili powder, anise seeds or
                        coarsely-ground black pepper, or a
                        combination
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Mix all the dry ingredients well and add the eggs, wine and oil until a soft ball of dough is formed; if the dough is too wet, add a little more flour.

Pinch off small rounds of dough the size of a small egg and roll them into 5-inch ropes.  Bring the ends together to form a circle and place the taralli on cloth lined towels as you form them.

Drop them a few at a time in a pot of salted boiling water and, when they float to the top, remove them with a slotted spoon and lay them on a greased baking sheet.

Bake them in a preheated 350 degrees oven for about 20 minutes.

Cool to room temperature.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  So many of you have asked for a taralli recipe.  Taralli are a hard round biscuit shaped like a bagel, only in miniature size and come from the region of Puglia.  Many versions of them are made including this one with chili powder but I also like to add anise seeds and coarse black pepper to mine.  Fennel seeds are another option.  The procedure requires two steps, a boiling step and a baking step.  Serve these as an accompaniment to antipasto or for snacking with a glass of wine.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        === FILLING ===
     1/3           cup  golden raisins
     1/3           cup  dark raisins
  3        tablespoons  vin santo
                        = (or brandy)
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped walnuts
  5                     dried figs -- stemmed and diced
  5                     dried prunes -- diced
  2                     Golden Delicious apples -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        === DECORATION ===
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
  2                     coffee beans or candied cherries
  1              whole  almond
                        Coarse white sugar -- as needed

Pour the water into a food processor bowl fitted with the steel blade or pour the water into a large bowl.  Sprinkle the yeast over the water and pulse or stir to dissolve it.  Add the olive oil, salt, sugar and blend well.  Pulse or stir in the flour, 1 cup at a time.  Three cups should give you a non-sticky smooth dough; if the dough is too tacky, add a bit more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough is smooth and non-sticky.

Transfer the dough to a bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap.  Let the dough rise in a warm (75 degrees), but not too hot area until it is doubled in size.

Meanwhile make the filling.  In a small bowl combine the raisins and the vin santo or brandy and allow to soak for 30 minutes.  In another bowl combine the walnuts, figs, prunes, apples, olive oil, and sugar.  Add the raisins and all the liquid and combine well.  Set aside.

Punch down the dough and transfer it to a work surface.  Roll the dough out into an 18-inch circle and spread the filling ingredients evenly over the surface of the dough to within 2 inches of the edges.  Roll the dough up on itself into a tight jelly-roll, tucking in the sides as you roll.  Lift the roll and place it on the baking sheet.  With your hands, create an "S" shape with the dough but leave the head larger than the tail area.

Insert the coffee beans or candied cherries into the head area to form the eyes.  Use the almond for the tongue.  Cover the serpentone with a towel and allow it to rise about 45 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Brush the serpentone with the egg wash and sprinkle the sugar evenly over the dough.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes on the middle rack of your oven.  If the top browns too much while baking, cover the dough loosely with a piece of aluminum foil.  The serpentone is done when a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean.  Transfer the serpentone to a wire rack to cool slightly.  This is best served warm.

This recipe yields 1 large snake.

Comments:  Serpentone, the serpent, is a sign of fertility and also a sign of a good and abundant harvest, and is another specialty of Perugia.  They were originally made by Capuchin nuns who sold them to the public in order to get needed funds for their monastery.  The dough is quickly made in the food processor or by hand.  Other versions of this pastry are made with egg whites, sugar, and ground almonds and are called Anguille di Lago Trasimeno, Eels of Lake Trasimeno.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPONGE ===
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast - (1 pkg)
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast - (1/2 pkg)
  1 1/4           cups  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 4 1/2)
                        Cornmeal -- as needed
                        = (if using a baking stone)

To make the sponge, in a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water.  Let stand to proof until foamy, about 10 minutes, and then add the flour.  Stir well to mix; the mixture should have the consistency of a soft dough.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm draft-free place for 24 hours.

In a large bowl, sprinkle the yeast over 1/4 cup of the water and let proof until foamy, about 10 minutes.  Add the remaining 1 cup water.  Add the sponge and mix well with your hands.  Add 3 1/2 cups of the flour and mix well, then add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft ball.  Turn the mixture out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, turn to coat the dough, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for 3 to 4 hours, or until doubled in size.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and gently form it into a rectangular or round loaf.  Place the loaf on a greased baking sheet.  Let rise for about 35 minutes, or until doubled in size.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  If using a baking stone, set it on the bottom rack of the oven to preheat for 30 minutes.  Sprinkle the preheated stone with cornmeal and carefully slide the bread onto the stone.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the bread is evenly browned and the bottom crust is hard.

If baking on a baking sheet, bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the bread is nicely browned and hollow sounding when tapped on the bottom.

Note:  This is the perfect bread to use for crostini, as well as for fettunta.  If planning to use the bread for crostini, shape the dough into 2 or 3 long narrow loaves and adjust the baking time accordingly.

This recipe yields 1 large loaf.

Comments:  Bread has always had historical and symbolic, as well as practical, meaning for mankind.  Somewhere in antiquity the idea of making food from grain and water took hold and literally changed the way in which people interacted with one another.  Human suffering, wars, and the course of history have been determined by whether or not there was bread to eat.

One of the many breads that has its roots in historical events is Tuscan bread.  Its main characteristic is that is has always been made without salt because of a tax on salt imposed by the popes in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.  To show their displeasure, the townspeople went without salt, and the bakers refused to put it in their bread.  To this day, this saltless bread is eaten daily in Tuscany and is a reminder of the steadfastness of a proud people.  Some people say that the saltless bread is the perfect foil for the many kinds of flavorful foods traditionally made with it.  Cooked cannellini beans, flavored with dark green Tuscan olive oil, are wonderful on this bread.  The bread is equally good in soup or as the base for fettunta, Tuscan bread grilled and rubbed with garlic, then drizzled with dense extra-virgin olive oil.  Making Tuscan bread requires a starter dough, known as a sponge, which needs at least a day to develop its sour tang.

One of the many breads that has its roots in historical events is Tuscan bread.  Its main characteristic is that is has always been made without salt because of a tax on salt imposed by the popes in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.  To show their displeasure, the townspeople went without salt, and the bakers refused to put it in their bread.  To this day, this saltless bread is eaten daily in Tuscany and is a reminder of the steadfastness of a proud people.  Some people say that the saltless bread is the perfect foil for the many kinds of flavorful foods traditionally made with it.  Cooked cannellini beans, flavored with dark green Tuscan olive oil, are wonderful on this bread.  The bread is equally good in soup or as the base for fettunta, Tuscan bread grilled and rubbed with garlic, then drizzled with dense extra-virgin olive oil.  Making Tuscan bread requires a starter dough, known as a sponge, which needs at least a day to develop its sour tang.

           Umbrian Griddle Baked Flat Bread - {Torta Sul Testo}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  20            ounces  fresh spinach -- stemmed, rinsed well
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- diced
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
                        === DOUGH ===
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1              large  egg
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  6        tablespoons  grated Pecorino cheese
                        Warm water -- as needed

Cook the spinach without the addition of any water, covered, in a 2-quart pot about 3 or 4 minutes or just until it wilts down.  Transfer the spinach to a colander and squeeze it dry with a wooden spoon or let it cool, and squeeze it dry with your hands.  On a cutting board chop the spinach fine and set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan; add the prosciutto, and cook it until it begins to brown and crisp.  Stir in the spinach, and a good grinding of black pepper, and mix well.  Set the filling aside, and make the dough.

Mix the flour, and baking soda together in a bowl.  In another bowl, beat the egg, olive oil, and cheese together.  Add this to the flour mixture, and mix with your hands to obtain a soft dough.  Add warm water, 2 tablespoons at a time, if the dough seems dry.  It should feel soft and pliable.  Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5 minutes or until it is smooth and elastic.  Let it rest covered for 10 minutes.  Divide the dough into 6 pieces and roll each piece into a 6-inch circle.  Set the circles aside on a floured surface.

Heat a cast-iron griddle, frying pan, or an electric frying pan until hot.  Prick the circles all over with a fork.  This will help to keep the rounds flat as they cook.  Use a small glass to make overlapping circle designs on each piece.  These marks are decorative.  Place one or two of the circles on the hot pan; do not cook more than two at a time.  Cook until they have browned slightly on the bottom, about 3 or 4 minutes, then turn them over and brown them on the other side.

Transfer the circles to a wire rack to cool completely.

Divide the spinach mixture among 3 of the circles; top with the remaining three circles.  With a knife cut each into 4 wedges to make 12 sandwiches.

Serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 rounds or 12 small sandwiches.

Comments:  Flat bread cooked on a dry skillet is reminiscent of some of the first unleavened breads.  In Umbria this has evolved into torta sul testo or bread baked in earthenware.  I use a dry electric skillet.  If you have a stovetop griddle, that will work well too.  Torta sul testo is often served with a stuffing of bitter greens such as spinach or broccoli rape; or serve them warm without a stuffing, accompanied by Pecorino cheese, and oil cured olives for an antipasto.

                Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
     1/4           cup  sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  malt extract or sugar
  2               cups  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  5 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 5 3/4)
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4           cup  finely-minced fresh basil
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              pound  small zucchini -- thinly sliced
  2             pounds  tomatoes -- thinly sliced
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Dried oregano -- (optional)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Spread the sesame seeds on a cookie sheet and toast for about 5 minutes, until golden.  Watch them carefully to prevent burning.  Remove the seeds to a small dish and set aside.

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and malt extract or sugar in the warm water and let proof until foamy, about 10 minutes.

In another bowl, mix 5 cups of the flour and the salt.  Add to the yeast mixture along with the basil.  Using your hands, form a ball of dough that is smooth and no longer sticky, adding flour as needed.  Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes.

Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil, add the dough, turning it to coat, and cover tightly with plastic wrap.  Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Lightly oil two 15 1/2- by 14-inch baking pans or 15- by 11-inch cookie sheets.  Spread the sesame seeds over the work surface.  Punch the dough down and turn it out on top of the sesame seeds.  Knead the seeds into the dough, adding a little flour to the work surface if necessary to prevent the dough from sticking.

Divide the dough in half.  On a lightly floured surface, roll out each piece of dough to a rectangle the size of the prepared pans, and fit the pizzas into the pans.

Brush 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over the top if each pizza.  Arrange alternating rows of the zucchini and tomatoes on each pizza, overlapping them slightly.  Brush the vegetables with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Sprinkle the tops with salt and pepper, and with oregano if desired.

Bake for 45 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Cut the pizze into squares and serve warm.

This recipe yields 2 large pizze for 12 servings.

Comments:  Top a basil-and-sesame-seed yeast dough canvas with fresh, seasonal vegetables to create this vibrantly colored pizza.  The recipe makes two pizze, enough to serve twenty as an antipasto if cut into small squares.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  raisins
  2        tablespoons  grappa
                        = (or 1/2 cup warm water)
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2               cups  cornmeal
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  5               cups  water
  1                cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  diced candied lemon or orange peel
  1                     yellow Delicious apple -- peeled and diced
  1                     Bartlett pear -- peeled and diced
  10             whole  dried Calamyrna or Calabrian figs -- stemmed and chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts

Butter the baking pan and dust it with flour, shaking out the excess, or line the pan with a sheet of aluminum foil, allowing the foil to come up the sides of the pan.  Butter and dust the foil with flour.  Set it aside.

Pour the water or grappa over the raisins in a small bowl and let them soak for 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, and baking powder in a heavy-duty 4-quart saucepan.  Slowly stir in the water.  Cook the mixture, stirring frequently, over medium-high heat for 15 minutes.  The mixture will be very thick.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the sugar and butter, making sure that the butter melts completely.

Strain the raisins, discarding the water, and stir them into the batter.  If using the grappa, add it with the raisins.  Stir in the lemon or orange peel, apple, pear, figs, and walnuts.

Pour the batter into the pan, smoothing out the top.

Bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.  The top of the cake should be golden brown.  Cool the cake completely.  If using the foil-lined method, simply lift the foil with the cake out of the pan and, when cool, remove the foil.  This will allow for neatly cut slices with no waste at the edges.

To serve, cut into squares.

Tip:  For parties, I chill the baked cake, then use small cookie cutters to cut out decorative shapes, which I place in small cupcake papers.  They make the perfect dessert finger food for a crowd.

This recipe yields one 9 1/2- by 13- by 2-inch cake.

Comments:  The Bottega del Pane, adjacent to Padua's fabulous outdoor market, sells delightful breads, pizze, focacce, biscotti, and other pastry delights.  You cannot walk in there without succumbing to buying several items.  Some of their Venetian specialties include sweets made with cornmeal, since the Veneto region grows a great deal of corn for polenta.  Two of my favorites are sbrisolana, a dense cornmeal cake studded with almonds and hazelnuts that is perfect with coffee or tea, and pinza, a cake also made with cornmeal and laden with dried figs, walnuts, and raisins soaked in grappa.  Pinza originally was made for the Christmas holidays and was eaten up until the feast of the Epiphany.  Now it is enjoyed year-round.  There are many versions of this cake; some contain eggs, spices, and a variety of other fruits.  In this version, diced pears and apples are also used.  This cake is very moist and very hearty.  It will keep a week in the refrigerator and is best eaten at room temperature.  For best results use a heavy saucepan to cook the flour and cornmeal.  I like copper for its even heat distribution.  The grappa in this recipe is optional.

<DirT>
Butter the baking pan and dust it with flour, shaking out the excess, or line the pan with a sheet of aluminum foil, allowing the foil to come up the sides of the pan.  Butter and dust the foil with flour.  Set it aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the water or grappa over the raisins in a small bowl and let them soak for 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, and baking powder in a heavy-duty 4-quart saucepan.  Slowly stir in the water.  Cook the mixture, stirring frequently, over medium-high heat for 15 minutes.  The mixture will be very thick.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the sugar and butter, making sure that the butter melts completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain the raisins, discarding the water, and stir them into the batter.  If using the grappa, add it with the raisins.  Stir in the lemon or orange peel, apple, pear, figs, and walnuts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the batter into the pan, smoothing out the top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.  The top of the cake should be golden brown.  Cool the cake completely.  If using the foil-lined method, simply lift the foil with the cake out of the pan and, when cool, remove the foil.  This will allow for neatly cut slices with no waste at the edges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, cut into squares.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tip:  For parties, I chill the baked cake, then use small cookie cutters to cut out decorative shapes, which I place in small cupcake papers.  They make the perfect dessert finger food for a crowd.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields one 9 1/2- by 13- by 2-inch cake.

Comments:  The Bottega del Pane, adjacent to Padua&apos;s fabulous outdoor market, sells delightful breads, pizze, focacce, biscotti, and other pastry delights.  You cannot walk in there without succumbing to buying several items.  Some of their Venetian specialties include sweets made with cornmeal, since the Veneto region grows a great deal of corn for polenta.  Two of my favorites are sbrisolana, a dense cornmeal cake studded with almonds and hazelnuts that is perfect with coffee or tea, and pinza, a cake also made with cornmeal and laden with dried figs, walnuts, and raisins soaked in grappa.  Pinza originally was made for the Christmas holidays and was eaten up until the feast of the Epiphany.  Now it is enjoyed year-round.  There are many versions of this cake; some contain eggs, spices, and a variety of other fruits.  In this version, diced pears and apples are also used.  This cake is very moist and very hearty.  It will keep a week in the refrigerator and is best eaten at room temperature.  For best results use a heavy saucepan to cook the flour and cornmeal.  I like copper for its even heat distribution.  The grappa in this recipe is optional.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
     3/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  2        tablespoons  cold water
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  finely ground walnuts
     1/2           cup  sugar -- plus
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted, for brushing
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

In a bowl, mix the flour and butter together with your hands or a fork until it resembles coarse crumbs.  Slowly add the water and mix until a ball of dough is formed.  Do not over mix.  (Alternatively, combine all the ingredients in a food processor and pulse until a ball of dough is formed.)  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.

In a small bowl, mix together the walnuts and 3 tablespoons of the sugar.  Set aside.  In another bowl, mix the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon.  Set aside.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a square, and trim it to an even, 10-inch square, reserving the scraps.  With a pastry wheel, cut the dough length-wise into 5 strips, and cut each strip into 5 squares.

Lightly brush each square with the melted butter.  Place about 1 teaspoon of the walnut filling in the center of each square, and roll each one up like a small jelly roll.  Pinch the seam closed and twist each end.  Place the caramelle on a clean towel.  Gather the dough scraps together and reroll to make more caramelle.

In a deep-flyer or a deep heavy pan, heat the oil to 375 degrees.  Fry the caramelle, a few at a time, until golden brown.  With a slotted spoon, transfer to brown paper to drain.

While they are still warm, roll each caramella several times in the sugar and cinnamon mixture.

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  These twisted and fried cookies, which look like wrapped pieces of candy, are a favorite Christmas giveaway.  I developed it using leftover pieces of dough and a few teaspoons of ground walnuts that were on hand after making a sweet rotolo.  Everyone loves these, and the dough is very easy to work with.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  buttermilk
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
     1/2           cup  solid vegetable shortening
  3               cups  sugar
  10             large  eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
  2        tablespoons  almond extract
     1/2           cup  finely-ground hazelnuts
     1/2           cup  finely-ground walnuts
  1                cup  shredded sweetened coconut
                        === FROSTING ===
  1              pound  unsalted butter -- softened
     3/4                mascarpone
                        = (or good-quality cream cheese, softened)
  12              cups  sifted confectioners' sugar - (to 13)
  2 1/2    tablespoons  rum or almond extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour a 12- by 12- by 3-inch cake pan.  Combine the buttermilk and baking soda in a bowl.  Set aside.

Sift the flour and salt onto wax paper.

In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, cream the butter, shortening, and sugar until well blended.  Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, making sure that each one is well incorporated before adding the next.  Beat in the almond extract.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk mixture, blending well.  Stir in the nuts and coconut.

In another bowl, with clean beaters, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry.  With a large spatula, fold the egg whites into the batter.  Pour the batter into the pan.  Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the middle comes out clean.

Cool the cake completely in the pan on a cooling rack.  (At this point, the cake can be wrapped in heavy freezer paper, then in aluminum foil, and frozen for up to 1 month.  It can be frosted still-frozen.)

In a heavy-duty mixer or a food processor, beat or process the butter and cheese until smooth.  Add the confectioners' sugar a cupful at a time, beating or processing to achieve a frosting that is easily spreadable but firm enough to pipe through a pastry bag.  Add the extract.  (The frosting can be made up to 3 days ahead.  Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.  Let come to room temperature before using.)

When ready to frost the cake, assemble a cake frosting knife, or icing spatula, a rubber spatula, and a pastry bag and assorted tips.  Prepare a bowl of ice water.

Using a pastry brush, gently brush any loose crumbs from the top and sides of the cake.  Spread a small amount of the frosting on the cake platter or board to help anchor the cake and prevent it from shifting.  Carefully position the cake on the platter or board.  Slip a border of wax paper around the bottom edges of the cake to keep the platter or board clean.

Apply a base coat of frosting to the cake, covering the top first then the sides.  Dip the frosting knife in the ice water frequently and wipe clean to help keep the frosting smooth as it is spread and to prevent loose crumbs from making unsightly flecks in the frosting.

Using the pastry bag and an assortment of decorative tips, pipe the frosting to make a design on the cake: swags, swirls, a basket-weave design, columns, free-form designs, or whatever you desire.  Finish with a decorative border around the bottom of the cake.  Carefully pull away the wax paper.  Refrigerate the cake until ready to serve.

To give the cake a final elegant touch, place a small spray of fresh flowers on the top.

This recipe yields 1 cake.

                   Whole Wheat Bread - {Pane Integrale}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  1 3/4           cups  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  2          teaspoons  malt barley or sugar
  1                cup  whole wheat flour
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (12 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1              large  egg -- slightly beaten
  1         tablespoon  wheat bran

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of the warm water.  Allow the yeast to proof until it is foamy, about 10 minutes.  Add the remaining 1 1/2 cups water and malt barley or sugar and mix well.  Set the bowl aside.

In a separate bowl, mix the whole wheat flour, 2 cups of the all-purpose flour, and the salt.  Add to the yeast mixture and mix with a wooden spoon.  At this point, the mixture will be very soft.  Add the remaining flour and mix with your hands until a ball of dough is formed.  Add additional all-purpose flour as needed to make a soft dough.

Place the dough on a floured work surface and knead it for 5 to 10 minutes, folding the dough over on itself several times, until it is shiny and elastic.  Let the dough rest, covered, on a floured surface for 5 minutes.

Grease a bowl with the olive oil.  Put the dough in it and turn the dough a few times to coat with the oil.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and then a towel, and let it rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch the dough down and knead it a few times on a floured surface.  Shape the dough into a round, oval, or braid and place on a baking sheet.  Cover the bread and let rise about 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease a baking sheet.

Just before baking, brush the top of the dough with the beaten egg and sprinkle on the wheat bran.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the top and bottom are nicely browned.  Remove the bread to a rack to cool completely.

This recipe yields 1 large loaf.

Comments:  I developed this wheat bread using the Basic Dough recipe from my book Ciao Italia.  I have simply changed the ratio of unbleached flour to whole wheat flour, and added malt barley because the sugars in it cause rapid multiplication of yeast cells.  Malt barley is used by many bread bakers in Italy to help give color and rise to their breads.  You can find it in health food stores or by mail order.  Add an equal amount of sugar if malt barley is not available.

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of the warm water.  Allow the yeast to proof until it is foamy, about 10 minutes.  Add the remaining 1 1/2 cups water and malt barley or sugar and mix well.  Set the bowl aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a separate bowl, mix the whole wheat flour, 2 cups of the all-purpose flour, and the salt.  Add to the yeast mixture and mix with a wooden spoon.  At this point, the mixture will be very soft.  Add the remaining flour and mix with your hands until a ball of dough is formed.  Add additional all-purpose flour as needed to make a soft dough.

Place the dough on a floured work surface and knead it for 5 to 10 minutes, folding the dough over on itself several times, until it is shiny and elastic.  Let the dough rest, covered, on a floured surface for 5 minutes.

Grease a bowl with the olive oil.  Put the dough in it and turn the dough a few times to coat with the oil.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and then a towel, and let it rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch the dough down and knead it a few times on a floured surface.  Shape the dough into a round, oval, or braid and place on a baking sheet.  Cover the bread and let rise about 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease a baking sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Just before baking, brush the top of the dough with the beaten egg and sprinkle on the wheat bran.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the top and bottom are nicely browned.  Remove the bread to a rack to cool completely.

Comments:  I developed this wheat bread using the Basic Dough recipe from my book Ciao Italia.  I have simply changed the ratio of unbleached flour to whole wheat flour, and added malt barley because the sugars in it cause rapid multiplication of yeast cells.  Malt barley is used by many bread bakers in Italy to help give color and rise to their breads.  You can find it in health food stores or by mail order.  Add an equal amount of sugar if malt barley is not available.
