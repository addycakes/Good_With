  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  store-bought crescent roll dough
                        = (Pilsbury brand recommended)
     1/4           cup  apricot preserves or all fruit spread
     1/4           cup  orange marmalade
  1                     egg
                        A splash of water
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds
     1/4           cup  sliced almonds

Preheat oven to package directions and roll out dough on a nonstick cookie sheet.  Cut and separate dough into perforated triangles.

Combine the apricot jam or fruit spread and the orange marmalade in a small bowl.  Place bowl in microwave and cook on HIGH 15 seconds to loosen the preserves.

Roll crescents up, brush with a little egg wash and coat with sesame seeds and almonds.  Bake to package directions until deep golden in color.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 8 rolls.

                        = (or diced tomatoes with peppers and
                        onions, or stewed tomatoes)
  8             slices  white sandwich bread
     1/2           cup  hot pepper jelly
                        = (or chili sauce, tomatillo or tomato
                        salsa, taco sauce ñ whichever you have on
                        hand)
  8             slices  honey baked ham -- from deli counter
  8             slices  Pepper Jack cheese -- from deli counter
  8             slices  smoked turkey -- from deli counter
  2                     eggs -- beaten
                        A splash of milk
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  2                     scallions - (to 3) -- chopped

Heat a medium soup pot over medium-high heat.  Add EVOO to hot pot then bay leaves, jalapeÒo, garlic, celery and onions.  Cook 3 to 4 minutes, then add red peppers and continue to cook.  Drain 2 cans of beans and add them.  With remaining can, pour the juice and half the beans into the pot.  Use a fork to mash up the beans remaining in the can.  Stir the mashed beans into the pot and season with cumin, coriander, salt and pepper and 2 to 3 tablespoons hot sauce.  Add stock and tomatoes to the stoup and bring to a bubble.  Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes over low heat.

While stoup cooks, make Monte Cristos:  Spread bread with a light layer of pepper jelly or chili sauce, salsa, taco sauce then build sandwiches using 2 slices each of ham, cheese and turkey per sandwich.  Beat eggs with milk and 2 teaspoons hot sauce and season the eggs with a little salt.

Heat a griddle pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Melt butter in skillet.  Dip each sandwich in egg coating and cook 3 to 4 minutes on each side to melt cheese and warm the meats through.

In a small bowl, mix together sour cream and scallions and reserve for topping the stoup.  Ladle up black bean soup and top with sour cream mixture.  Cut Monte Cristos corner to corner and serve alongside soup for dipping and munching.

Heat a medium soup pot over medium-high heat.  Add EVOO to hot pot then bay leaves, jalapeÒo, garlic, celery and onions.  Cook 3 to 4 minutes, then add red peppers and continue to cook.  Drain 2 cans of beans and add them.  With remaining can, pour the juice and half the beans into the pot.  Use a fork to mash up the beans remaining in the can.  Stir the mashed beans into the pot and season with cumin, coriander, salt and pepper and 2 to 3 tablespoons hot sauce.  Add stock and tomatoes to the stoup and bring to a bubble.  Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes over low heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While stoup cooks, make Monte Cristos:  Spread bread with a light layer of pepper jelly or chili sauce, salsa, taco sauce then build sandwiches using 2 slices each of ham, cheese and turkey per sandwich.  Beat eggs with milk and 2 teaspoons hot sauce and season the eggs with a little salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a griddle pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Melt butter in skillet.  Dip each sandwich in egg coating and cook 3 to 4 minutes on each side to melt cheese and warm the meats through.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, mix together sour cream and scallions and reserve for topping the stoup.  Ladle up black bean soup and top with sour cream mixture.  Cut Monte Cristos corner to corner and serve alongside soup for dipping and munching.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless rib-eye steaks abt 1 1/2" thk - -- (10 to 12 oz ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil - (abt 1/2 cup) -- divided
  2        tablespoons  steak seasoning
                        = (recommended Montreal Steak Seasoning
                        by McCormick)
  4                     stems fresh oregano -- stripped of leaves
  5             sprigs  fresh sage leaves -- stripped
  6                     stems fresh thyme leaves -- stripped
  1                     generous handful fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        leaves
  3                     garlic cloves -- popped from skins
  1             medium  red onion -- 1/2 finely chopped,
                        and 1/2 thinly sliced
  1                     lemon
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
                        Splash water
  3        tablespoons  chipotle in adobo -- chopped with sauce
                        = (or 1 tbspn powdered chipotle chili
                        powder)
  2                     large bundle spinach leaves - (1 lb)
  1 1/2         pounds  combined weight shiitakes and
                        baby portobellos -- thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Worcestershire sauce -- for seasoning steaks
  4                     thick slices whole-grain crusty bread
                        Butter -- softened
                        Chives -- chopped or snipped,
                        to garnish bread

Pat rib-eyes dry.  Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil across each side of the steaks then season them with grill seasoning blend and reserve.

Prepare chimichurri:  Pile the herbs together and finely chop.  Coarsely chop 2 cloves of the garlic, reserving one large clove left cracked away from skin but whole.  Add coarse chopped garlic to herbs and mill them together, chopping even finer, then transfer to a small bowl.  Add in the finely chopped red onions and the zest of 1 lemon.  Once the lemon has been zested, cut it into wedges and reserve.  To the herbs and onions, add 3 tablespoons (eyeball it) red wine vinegar, a splash of water and about 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil.  Stir to combine the chimichurri and reserve.

Fill sink or large bowl with cold water.  Remove stems from spinach and add to water.  Agitate the leaves to release the grit attached to the leaves.  Repeat this process, testing leaves as you go until they are free of sand.  Dry in a salad spinner or on layers of paper towels.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, then add in the chipotle in abobo, sliced onions and mushrooms.  If you are using powdered chipotle, add onions and mushrooms first then season with the powder.  Cook the mushrooms and onions, stirring frequently, 10 minutes.  Do not add salt and pepper ó the salt will draw liquid out of the mushrooms, slowing up the browning process.

Heat a heavy-bottomed pan and sear the steaks for about 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare to medium.  Add 2 minutes for medium to medium-well doneness.  Once cooked, let meat rest 5 or 10 minutes for juice to redistribute.

Once the mushrooms are tender, coarsely chop the spinach and fold into the pan in bunches until wilted and incorporated fully.  Season the mixture with salt and pepper and remove from heat.

Char bread under broiler, rub it with the remaining clove of garlic, butter the bread and sprinkle with chives.  Place the toasted bread on plates and top each slice with a whole steak.  The bread will catch meat juices as you dine.  Top the steaks with a few shakes of Worcestershire and generous spoonfuls of chimichurri.  Serve "mountains" of smoky mushrooms and spinach alongside the steaks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        = (Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick
                        recommended)
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley - (to 1/3)
     1/2        medium  yellow skinned onion
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  8             slices  sandwich white or whole-wheat bread
  2        tablespoons  butter - (to 3) -- softened
  2               cups  chopped baby spinach, watercress or
                        arugula

* Smoked paprika is widely available, especially in larger markets, but if your store does not carry the smoked kind, mix 1 tablespoon cumin with 2 teaspoons sweet paprika in its place.  You can also order smoked paprika on-line at spice company sites such as Penzy's.  It is a cool spice to have in the cabinet.  It's great in lentil soup or to mix with grill seasoning for a smoky rub to use on any lean meat.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat.

Place chicken in a bowl and add the smoked paprika, grill seasoning and parsley to it.  Using a hand held grater or microplane, grate the onion into the chicken.  (Boo liked onion juice and its flavor, but she did not like big pieces of onion).  Add the garlic (Boo LOVED garlic!) and mix to combine.  Make a mini patty, the size of a quarter, and cook it up, a minute on each side, to taste and check seasonings.  If you want it really smoky, like Boo, you can adjust the seasonings accordingly.

Drizzle the chicken mixture with about 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and form 4 large thin patties then place them in the pan.  Cook patties 5 minutes on each side.  Toast bread slices and spread liberally with softened butter.  Serve patties on buttered toast with some chopped dark greens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                      Buffalo Popcorn Chicken Bites

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  2 1/2           cups  complete pancake mix - any brand -- divided
  1 1/4           cups  water
  8          teaspoons  hot sauce -- divided
                        = (Tabasco recommended)
  1 1/4         pounds  chicken tenders or chicken breast -- cut into small
                        bite-sized pieces
  1                cup  quality refrigerated blue cheese dressing
                        = (Marie's brand recommended)
  2                     scallions -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
                        Cut celery sticks -- store bought

In a deep sided skillet heat 1 1/2 inches of vegetable oil over medium heat.  If you wish to test the oil, add a 1-inch cube of bread to hot oil.  If it turns deep golden brown in color in a count of 40, the oil is ready.

While the oil is heating make the batter.  In a wide mixing bowl combine 2 cups of the pancake mix, 1 1/4 cups water and about 6 teaspoons hot sauce.  (Use a regular teaspoon you would stir coffee with ó that's what I did.  I don't, technically, have a set of actual measuring spoons.)  Place the remaining plain 1/2 cup pancake mix in another wide mixing bowl.  Arrange the batter and the bowl of plain pancake mix near the cook top and the heating oil.  Line a plate with a few sheets of paper towels and keep within reach.

Once the oil is heated and ready, toss the chicken pieces in 2 teaspoons of hot sauce then toss in the plain pancake mix, coat evenly and shake off excess.  The plain dry pancake mix will help the batter stick to the chicken pieces.  Add some of chicken to the batter, you are going to want to work in 3 to 4 batches coating and frying.  Using a fork, toss the bites in the batter.  Remove the first batch from the batter, shaking off the excess batter as you carefully add them to the hot oil.  Fry for 2 minutes on the first side, or until the first side is a deep golden brown, flip and continue to fry for another 2 minutes or until deep golden brown all over.  Remove from the oil and drain on the paper towel lined plate, season with salt.  Repeat until all the popcorn chicken bites are fried.  Serve immediately with refrigerated, good quality creamy blue cheese prepared dressing with chopped scallions and black pepper stirred into it for dipping.  Garnish platter with celery sticks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  macaroni with lines
                        = (such as tubatini or mini penne rigate)
                        Salt -- as needed
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2        medium  onion
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves -- plus
                        a few sprigs for garnish
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1                     box frozen cooked butter nut squash - (10  -- defrosted
  1                cup  cream or half-and-half
  2               cups  grated sharp Cheddar - (8 oz)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat a pot of water to boil for the pasta.  Salt the water then add the pasta and cook to al dente or, with a bite to it.

While pasta cooks, heat a medium heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.  Add the extra-virgin olive oil and butter.  When the butter melts into the oil, add the thyme and grate the onion directly into the pot with a hand held grater or Microplane.  Cook the grated onion in butter and oil 1 to 2 minutes, then add flour and cook together 1 to 2 more minutes.  Whisk in stock, then combine with butternut squash until warmed through and smooth.  Stir in cream or half-and-half and bring sauce to a bubble.  Stir in cheeses in a figure 8 motion and season the completed sauce with salt, nutmeg and pepper.  Taste to adjust seasonings.

Drain cooked pasta well and combine with sauce.  Serve alongside chicken sammies and top with thyme leaves picked from remaining sprigs (Boo would also have a little extra sprinkle of that cheese, please!)

This recipe yields 5 servings.

Comments:  I know it sounds odd, but my girl LOVED butternut squash!  This dog might even go for it before a steak, especially if there were also pasta and cheese involved in the deal!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  caramel coated popcorn
                        = (Cracker Jack recommended)
                        Plastic food storage bag -- gallon size
  1            package  chopped nut topping - (2 oz)
  2              pints  vanilla ice cream
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISHES ===

Place the popcorn in a food storage bag and crush with a small skillet.  Pour the crushed popcorn mixture onto a cookie sheet and combine with nuts.

Soften ice cream 15 seconds per pint in microwave oven.  Use a large scoop to overpack a round ball of ice cream.  Place ice cream onto cookie sheet and roll in coating.

        Caramelized Onion And White Cheddar Dip With Apples, Bread

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Fondue

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2              large  onions -- finely chopped
  1                     bay leaf -- fresh or dried
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme or poultry seasoning
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     green apples
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1              small  round loaf crusty pumpernickel bread -- cut bite-size cubes
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  half-and-half
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        A pinch or 2 of ground cloves
  2 1/2           cups  shredded sharp white Cheddar

Heat a heavy-bottomed medium pot or deep skillet over medium heat.  Melt butter in pot and add onions, raising heat slightly.  Add bay, thyme, salt and pepper to onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft and caramel in color, 20 minutes.

While onions cook, slice apples and douse with a little lemon juice to slow browning.  Arrange the apples and bread on a board or platter.

When onions are soft and sweet, add flour and cook a minute.  Whisk in wine, cook a minute then whisk in half-and-half.  When the liquid comes up to a bubble, season with nutmeg and cloves and adjust salt and pepper, to taste.  Stir in Cheddar and melt then remove from heat and serve in fondue pot or transfer to a small, warmed sauce pot which you can return to the stove top to reheat sauce as necessary.  Dip apples and bread in warm cheesy sauce and enjoy.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         pound  bulk breakfast sausage
                        = (such as maple sausage)
  1             medium  sweet potato -- scrubbed clean,
                        halved lengthwise, sliced thin half-moons
  1              large  red onion -- sliced thin, divided
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  2          teaspoons  ground coriander
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     yellow vine ripe tomatoes -- seeded, diced
  1              small  jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro - (to 3)
  1                     lime -- juiced
     1/2           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  1                cup  grated manchego or extra-sharp Cheddar
  1         tablespoon  butter
  4              large  eggs

Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat with 2 turns of the pan of olive oil, about 2 tablespoons.  Add the breakfast sausage and break it up with the back of a wooden spoon into little chunks, brown sausage for 3 minutes.  Add the sweet potatoes and 3/4 of the chopped red onion to the sausage, season with chili powder, cumin, coriander, salt and pepper, stir frequently and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the potatoes are nice and tender.

While the hash is cooking, in a small bowl combine the tomatoes, jalapeÒo, and the remaining chopped red onion, cilantro, lime juice and a little salt and pepper.

Once the hash is cooked, add the chopped parsley, stir to combine and transfer hash to a serving platter.  Sprinkle with the cheese and cover with aluminum foil, the cheese will melt while you make the fried eggs.

Wipe clean the skillet you made the hash in, return it to the cook top over medium-high heat and add the butter.  Once the butter has melted, crack each of the eggs into the skillet, season with a little salt and pepper and fry to desired doneness.  Eggs may, of course, be scrambled as well.  As you like!

Transfer the fried eggs to the top of the hash, sprinkle with the fresh tomato salsa and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  grill seasoning blend
                        = (Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick
                        recommended)
  2        tablespoons  hot sauce
  4        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  4        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  extra virgin olive oil -- plus
                        some for drizzling
  2             pounds  flank steak
  8             pieces  'thin-cut' chicken breast cutlets
  2                     slightly under-ripe Hass avocados -- but still firm
  2                     vine ripe tomatoes -- cut into wedges
  2            bunches  watercress -- trimmed, and
                        roughly chopped
  8                     strips bacon -- thick sliced
  1                     lemon -- zested, juiced
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3         pound  blue cheese -- crumbled
                        = (Maytag Blue recommended)

Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to high heat.

Mix garlic, steak seasoning, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce and vinegar.  Whisk in the extra-virgin olive oil.  Divide the mixture between 2 shallow dishes.  Add the flank steak to one and the thin chicken cutlets to the other.  Toss to coat all of the meats thoroughly and marinate for 5 minutes.

While the flank steak and chicken are marinating, cut the avocados in half lengthwise cutting around the pit.  Separate the halves then, using a spoon, scoop out the pit, then use the spoon to scoop the avocado from its skin.  Chop the avocado flesh into bite-size pieces add to a mixing bowl.  Add the tomatoes, watercress and crisp chopped bacon.  Dress the salad with the juice of 1 lemon and a generous drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper.

Grill flank steak 6 to 7 minutes on each side.  Grill the thin cut chicken cutlets 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Remove both meats from the grill to a cutting board to rest for about 5 minutes.  Thinly slice the flank steak on an angle, cutting the meat against the grain.  Cut the chicken into thin strips.  Add both meats to a platter or dinner plates.  Top the meats with a mound of the salad.

To make the dressing, combine in a small bowl the lemon zest and juice, Dijon mustard, salt, pepper, crumbled blue cheese, whisk in 3 tablespoons EVOO.  Pour the dressing over the salad.  Eat and enjoy the lack of lettuce getting in your way!

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A Cobb Salad is usually a big mound of lettuce topped with strips of chopped chicken, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, hard-boiled egg and blue cheese.  I love it, but I've noticed that once I mix it up and start eating, my fork is busy fishing around the lettuce trying to catch all the chicken and bacon.  So, I decided to hold the lettuce.  I did add some watercress, but that's for its great peppery flavor!

  2                     portobello mushroom caps -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  fresh mixed wild mushrooms
                        = (shitakes, oyster, woodear, your pick) -- stems trimmed, and
                        caps thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
                        = (or more stock)
  1              pound  extra-wide egg noodles
                        Butter -- as needed
     3/4         pound  Gruyere or Swiss Emmentaler cheese -- shredded
  3        tablespoons  chopped chives - (12 to 15 blades)

Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the egg noodles.

Heat a medium sauce pot over medium heat.  Add extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, about 1 tablespoon, and 2 tablespoons butter.  When butter melts, add in chopped button mushrooms and cook 5 minutes, until just tender.  Sprinkle in a couple of tablespoons flour and cook 1 minute.  Whisk in chicken stock and bring to a bubble then stir in the whole milk or cream.  Reduce heat to low and gently simmer.  Season the sauce with nutmeg, salt and pepper.

Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan then the shallots and mushrooms.  Cook the mushrooms 8 minutes, until tender.  Season with thyme, salt and pepper and deglaze the pan with 1/3 cup dry white wine or a little stock.  Reduce heat to medium low and let the liquid cook off.

Preheat broiler to high.

While the mushrooms cook, drop egg noodles in water, salt the water and cook noodles to al dente, with a bite to them.  Drain noodles and return to hot pot.  Add the sauce to the pot and toss noodles to coat in sauce.

Lightly cover a casserole dish with softened butter then transfer cream of mushroom noodles to the casserole dish and top with wild mushroom ragout and the shredded cheese.  Place the casserole under the broiler and melt and bubble the cheese until brown at edges.  Garnish with chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                can  black beans - (14 oz)
  2             pounds  flank steak
  2        tablespoons  grill seasoning blend
                        = (Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick
                        recommended)
  1                     lime
  3                     green plantains
                        Waxed paper
  1              small  green bell pepper -- seeded, and

                        skin and finely chopped
  1              pound  small shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        and coarsely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     lemon
  1                can  tomato sauce - (8 oz)
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley leaves
                        Hot sauce -- to taste
                        = (Tabasco recommended)

Heat a medium pot over medium heat.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, and half of the finely chopped onion.  Saute 3 minutes, then season with 2 teaspoons cumin, eyeball the measurement in the palm of your hand, and the thyme leaves.  Pour in 2 1/2 cups of chicken stock and raise heat to bring to a boil.  Add rice and lower heat to simmer when boil resumes.  Cover pot tightly.  After 12 minutes, stir in black beans and replace cover.  Cook another 6 to 7 minutes.  Turn off rice and beans, season with salt and stir to combine then let stand until ready to serve.  While rice cooks, make plantains with shrimp and the meat.

Preheat a grill pan over high heat.  The meat can also be prepared in a hot, large cast-iron or nonstick skillet if you do not have a grill pan.

Place flank steak in a shallow dish and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil to coat ó about 2 tablespoons.  Mix grill seasoning with 1 tablespoon cumin, eyeball the measurement in your palm.  Add the zest of 1 lime to the grill seasoning and cumin.  Rub the mixture over the steak evenly.  Wash up and cut lime into wedges and reserve.  Place the steak on hot grill or in hot pan and cook 4 to 5 minutes, turn and cook 3 minutes longer.  Remove from heat and let juices redistribute 5 minutes.

Slit the skins of the plantains from end to end to vent them for microwave cooking.  Wrap them each in wax paper, twisting up paper at ends.  Microwave the plantains 4 to 5 minutes together or 90 seconds each individually on high.

While plantains and steak cook, place a medium nonstick skillet on the heat over a high flame.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and the sliced onions.  Sear the onions up and heat through, but leave a bite to them.  Place on a platter and cover with foil to reserve heat.  Return pan to stove and reduce heat to between medium-high and medium.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, and the remaining finely chopped onion, the bell pepper, garlic and shrimp.  Season with salt and pepper and add the zest of 1 lemon.  Cook until shrimp are firm and peppers begin to soften, 4 minutes or so.  Add the juice of 1/2 lemon, the tomato sauce and parsley.  Turn off heat.

Peel and mash the steaming hot plantains with remaining 1/2 cup chicken stock and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.  Season the plantains with salt and pile on platter or dinner plates then top with garlicky shrimp and tomatoes.  Very thinly slice the cooked steak on an angle, working against the grain.  Squeeze lime juice over the meat and arrange over the cooked sliced onions on serving platter.  Fluff up rice and black beans a bit, transfer them to a bowl and pass at table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tidbit:  This dinner is also delicious made with seasoned grilled thin cut chicken breast, seasoned in the same manner as steak.

Gossip:  Gloria Estefan's favorite album of hers is one she shares with many great guest artists. It's called "Unwrapped" and you might want to play it for mood music with this supper, as she did inspire its creation. It'll taste even better!

Heat a medium pot over medium heat.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, and half of the finely chopped onion.  Saute 3 minutes, then season with 2 teaspoons cumin, eyeball the measurement in the palm of your hand, and the thyme leaves.  Pour in 2 1/2 cups of chicken stock and raise heat to bring to a boil.  Add rice and lower heat to simmer when boil resumes.  Cover pot tightly.  After 12 minutes, stir in black beans and replace cover.  Cook another 6 to 7 minutes.  Turn off rice and beans, season with salt and stir to combine then let stand until ready to serve.  While rice cooks, make plantains with shrimp and the meat.

<DirT>
Preheat a grill pan over high heat.  The meat can also be prepared in a hot, large cast-iron or nonstick skillet if you do not have a grill pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place flank steak in a shallow dish and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil to coat ó about 2 tablespoons.  Mix grill seasoning with 1 tablespoon cumin, eyeball the measurement in your palm.  Add the zest of 1 lime to the grill seasoning and cumin.  Rub the mixture over the steak evenly.  Wash up and cut lime into wedges and reserve.  Place the steak on hot grill or in hot pan and cook 4 to 5 minutes, turn and cook 3 minutes longer.  Remove from heat and let juices redistribute 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Slit the skins of the plantains from end to end to vent them for microwave cooking.  Wrap them each in wax paper, twisting up paper at ends.  Microwave the plantains 4 to 5 minutes together or 90 seconds each individually on high.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While plantains and steak cook, place a medium nonstick skillet on the heat over a high flame.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and the sliced onions.  Sear the onions up and heat through, but leave a bite to them.  Place on a platter and cover with foil to reserve heat.  Return pan to stove and reduce heat to between medium-high and medium.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, and the remaining finely chopped onion, the bell pepper, garlic and shrimp.  Season with salt and pepper and add the zest of 1 lemon.  Cook until shrimp are firm and peppers begin to soften, 4 minutes or so.  Add the juice of 1/2 lemon, the tomato sauce and parsley.  Turn off heat.

          Fiery Hot Texas T-Bones With Chipotle Smashed Potatoes

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              whole  jalapeÒos
  3                     bell peppers (choose 3 different colors)
  2 1/2         pounds  small potatoes -- coarsely chopped
                        = (such as baby Yukon gold or small red
                        skin potatoes)
                        Salt -- as needed
  4             slices  bacon -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chipotle powder -- divided
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1                cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  dark chili powder
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  grill seasoning
                        = (Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick
                        recommended)
  2              large  T-Bone steaks 1 1/2" thk, 2 1/2 lbs total
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- divided
     1/4           cup  bourbon

Seed and slice the hot and sweet fresh peppers and reserve.

Cover potatoes with water and bring to a boil.  Add salt to boiling water.  Cook potatoes until tender, 10 to 12 minutes.  Chop and brown bacon in a small skillet and add a tablespoon of chipotle powder and onions.  Cook 5 minutes over medium heat until onions are tender.  When potatoes are tender, drain and return to hot pot.  Add bacon mixture and sour cream to the potatoes.  Smash potatoes and season with salt, to taste.

While potatoes are working, combine dry spice rub: chili powder, remaining chipotle powder, cumin and grill seasoning.  Rub steaks liberally on both sides with the mixture.  Heat a 12- to 14-inch skillet screaming hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, 2 turns of the pan.  It will smoke.  Add steaks and do not turn for 6 minutes.  Flip and cook another 6 minutes for medium-rare, up to 10 minutes for well done.  Remove skillet from flame and add bourbon.  Return steaks to stove and flame the pan.  When the fire goes out, transfer the meat to a large serving platter and pour pan juices over the top.  Let meat rest for juices to redistribute.  Return pan to heat and add remaining tablespoon vegetable oil to the skillet.  Add hot and sweet peppers to the pan and saute them for 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pile peppers alongside steaks.

Remove meat from the T bones and cut into 4 portions.  Top with some peppers and pile some chipotle smashers along side.  Spoon drippings and juices over meat and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Cover potatoes with water and bring to a boil.  Add salt to boiling water.  Cook potatoes until tender, 10 to 12 minutes.  Chop and brown bacon in a small skillet and add a tablespoon of chipotle powder and onions.  Cook 5 minutes over medium heat until onions are tender.  When potatoes are tender, drain and return to hot pot.  Add bacon mixture and sour cream to the potatoes.  Smash potatoes and season with salt, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While potatoes are working, combine dry spice rub: chili powder, remaining chipotle powder, cumin and grill seasoning.  Rub steaks liberally on both sides with the mixture.  Heat a 12- to 14-inch skillet screaming hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, 2 turns of the pan.  It will smoke.  Add steaks and do not turn for 6 minutes.  Flip and cook another 6 minutes for medium-rare, up to 10 minutes for well done.  Remove skillet from flame and add bourbon.  Return steaks to stove and flame the pan.  When the fire goes out, transfer the meat to a large serving platter and pour pan juices over the top.  Let meat rest for juices to redistribute.  Return pan to heat and add remaining tablespoon vegetable oil to the skillet.  Add hot and sweet peppers to the pan and saute them for 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pile peppers alongside steaks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove meat from the T bones and cut into 4 portions.  Top with some peppers and pile some chipotle smashers along side.  Spoon drippings and juices over meat and serve.

Throw together a salad, such as Panzanella with The Works, below, then go back to the fish.

When you are ready to eat, grill swordfish skewers 3 minutes on each side, 6 minute total.  Slide from skewers and squeeze lemon juice over the fish.  Cook tuna steaks 2 to 3 minutes on each side for pink, medium-rare fish, 4 minutes on each side for fully cooked fish.  Serve tuna with sliced oranges alongside and scatter scallions over both.  Each person should end up with 4 or 5 cubes of swordfish and 1 small tuna steak.  Serve with salad.

                        on a heavy angle

Place a medium skillet over medium to medium-high heat and add the extra-virgin olive oil and the butter.  Melt butter into oil then add onions and garlic cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add bouillon cube to the pan with 1/2 cup water and cook until it "melts" coats onions, stirring frequently, 3 minutes.  Season the onions with pepper, thyme and Worcestershire sauce.  Remove from heat and transfer to a plate to quick-cool a bit.

In a medium bowl, mix together the sour cream and softened creamed cheese using a rubber spatula.  Stir in the onion mixture until completely combined, add salt if necessary and adjust your seasonings.  Serve at room temperature or chill.  Garnish with chives.

Pack up chips as-is.  Season the veggie chips with salt and pack up with a paper towel to capture excess moisture in a plastic food bag.  If serving at home, salt vegetables in single layer, let stand 5 minutes then pat dry.  Arrange chips and vegetable chips around dip and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Salt -- as needed
  1               head  cauliflower -- cut into florets
  1              pound  asparagus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        some for drizzling
  2                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  white mushrooms*
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar - (to 3)
  1 1/2         pounds  kielbasa
  1                cup  drained cornichons or baby Gherkin pickles
  2                     red pears
  4          teaspoons  lemon juice -- divided
  1                     baguette -- sliced
  6             slices  thick-cut bacon
  8             ounces  Gruyere -- shredded
     1/3         pound  smoked Gouda -- shredded
  1                     rounded tablespoon all-purpose flour
  1              large  garlic clove -- smashed away from
                        skin
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  smoked almonds -- coarsely chopped

* If you like, score the tops of a few of the larger mushrooms with a paring knife.  It will dress up the serving platter when mushrooms are cooked.

Heat 2 or 3 inches water in a medium frying pan until it boils then salt it and add the cauliflower.  Cook 3 minutes, then remove from water with tongs or spider to a colander.  Cool under cold running water.  Trim asparagus of tough ends and add to salted water, cook 3 minutes, remove and cool in the same manner as the cauliflower.  In a second skillet, while cauliflower and asparagus work, saute shallots and mushrooms together in 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil over medium high heat until tender, 8 to 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and add red wine vinegar to the pan and cook it out, 1 minute.  Remove from heat.

Preheat broiler to high and a grill pan or large nonstick skillet to medium-high.  Drizzle sausage casing with extra-virgin olive oil and prick skin in a few places with the tines of a fork.  Grill kielbasa on hot grill pan or in large nonstick skillet 6 to 8 minutes until casing is crisp.  Remove sausage and cut in 2-inch chunks on a bias.

While sausage cooks, pile veggies on a platter and add cornichons and chopped pears coated with 2 teaspoons lemon juice.  Broil bacon on slotted pan until crisp.  Drain, cool and chop.

Make the fondue:  Combine cheeses in a bowl with flour.  Rub the inside of a small pot with smashed garlic then discard.  Add wine and remaining 2 teaspoons lemon juice and bring up to a bubble over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to simmer and add cheese in handfuls.  Stir constantly, melting the cheese in batches.  Stir in a figure-eight pattern with wooden spoon.  Transfer the fondue to fondue pot and top with chopped bacon and smoked nuts.

This recipe yields 40 servings.

Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  water
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 1") -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                     lemon zested
  2                     firm pears, such as Bosc or Anjou -- peeled, cut
                        into thin wedges, core cut away
  1               pint  French vanilla bean ice cream
                        Ground cinnamon -- for garnish
  1                cup  fresh blueberries

In a saucepan, bring the water, ginger, sugar, and lemon zest to a boil over medium-high heat.  Add the pears, and when the pot returns to a boil, reduce the heat to a medium-low to maintain the simmer.  Cook the pears until very soft when pierced with a knife (but not falling apart), about 12 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat, and using a slotted spoon, divide the pears among 4 dessert cups or ice cream dishes.

Add scoops of ice cream to the pears and garnish with a sprinkle of cinnamon then tumble some fresh blueberries over each serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This dish is so simple, yet could be served at any elegant dinner party.  It is equally good warm or cold, and makes a great addition to a Sunday Brunch.

                            Good Fennels Pasta

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  bucatini pasta (hollow fat spaghetti)
                        Salt -- as needed
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1              pound  bulk sweet Italian sausage
  4                     garlic cloves -- very thinly sliced
  1                     fennel bulb -- trimmed, quartered,
                        and core cut away, very thinly sliced
  1              small  yellow onion -- very thinly sliced
  2                     cubanelle peppers -- seeded, and
                        thinly sliced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  dry white wine or stock
  28            ounces  canned crushed San Marzano tomatoes
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus
                        some to pass at table
  1                cup  basil - (20 leaves) -- shredded or torn
                        Crusty bread -- for mopping

Place a large pot of water on to boil for pasta.  Salt water and add bucatini and cook to al dente.

While water comes to boil and pasta cooks, make the sauce.  Heat a large, deep nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan.  Add sausage to the skillet and break up the sausage into small bits.  Brown sausage all over then transfer to a paper towel lined plate.  Return pan to heat and add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, the garlic, fennel, onions and peppers.  Season the vegetables with salt and pepper.  Cook, turning frequently, 7 to 8 minutes until tender but do not allow the fennel and onions to brown ó reduce heat a bit if they begin to.  Add the wine or stock next and reduce 2 minutes.  Stir in the tomatoes and the sausage.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until pasta is done.

Drain the pasta very well and add to the sauce.  Sprinkle the pasta with 1/2 cup cheese, a couple of handfuls, then toss pasta with thick sauce to combine.  Transfer pasta to a large shallow platter and cover with the pasta with basil leaves.  Serve with extra cheese and pass crusty bread at the table to mop up the plates.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I make this one to watch with Good Fellas.  Shave the garlic nice and thin, like Pauly, but don't use a razor blade like he does in the movie.  A sharp knife is fine.

  1                     box spinach fettuccini pasta - (12 to 14 o
                        Salt -- as needed
     1/4         pound  prosciutto (Italian ham)
  3        tablespoons  butter -- cut small pieces
  1                cup  cream
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Romano -- plus
                        even more to pass at table
  1                cup  frozen peas

Bring a large pot of water to a boil then add salt, a generous grab from your salt dish, to season up the pasta as it cooks.  Carefully add pasta to water and stir then cook to al dente or until pasta is tender but it still has a bite to it in the center ó in other words, do not cook it until it is mushy.

Cut ham into thin, short ribbon-like pieces and separate them into a loose pile.  Kids not so good with knives can use kitchen scissors to cut the ham up.

Preheat a large skillet over medium heat.  Add butter to the pan and melt it.  Add 1 cup cream and warm it up a minute.  Add about a cup of cheese, 4 big handfuls or so, and stir constantly for another minute then season the sauce with nutmeg (your SECRET ingredient) and pepper.  Taste and add a little salt, if necessary.

Turn off heat under sauce and add the peas to it.  They will warm through in no time.  Next, drain the pasta.  Kids should have Grown Helpers drain pasta for them.  Toss pasta with sauce in the skillet and use tongs to help you pull pasta through sauce until it is coated evenly.  Sprinkle in the ham and toss the pasta again to combine it.  You can even add a little more cheese, if you say so.

Wow!  Green noodles are even yummier than white ones when you add in the ham and cheese and peas!  Yum-o!

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  starchy potatoes -- such as Idaho
                        Salt -- as needed
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped, divided
  4                     scallions -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
                        = (4 to 5 sprigs, stripped)
  4              large  portobello mushroom caps -- wiped clean
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless skinless chicken thighs - (6 pcs)
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     cubanelle (Italian light green peppers) -- seeded, and
                        thinly sliced
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  1                can  fire roasted diced tomatoes - (28 oz) -- lightly drained
                        = (Muir Glenn brand recommended)
                        Generous handful flat-leaf parsley -- chopped
  1                cup  ricotta cheese
     1/2           cup  milk
  1                cup  shredded or grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or
                        Romano

Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to high heat.

Peel up the taters and cut them into small chunks.  Place potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water.  Cover the pot and bring up to a boil over high heat.  Uncover, add salt to season up the potatoes and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.

In a small pot over medium-low heat and add vegetable oil, about 1 tablespoon ó just eyeball it.  Add 2 tablespoons butter in small pieces.  When butter melts into oil, add 4 cloves of chopped garlic.  Saute garlic 1 to 2 minutes, then add scallions and remove pan from heat and reserve.

Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.

In a large bowl, combine balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire, crushed red pepper flakes, rosemary then whisk in about 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, eyeball it.  Turn portobello caps in marinade and transfer to a plate to reserve.  Add chicken thighs to remaining marinade and coat evenly.  Season 1 side of the chicken thighs, as well as the reserved mushroom caps with salt and pepper then transfer just the thighs to hot grill, seasoned-side down.  Season the opposite side of the chicken thighs and grill for 6 minutes on each side then transfer to a plate to rest.  Add raw marinated mushroom caps to grill and top with a heavy skillet to press down on them as they grill.  Cook 3 to 4 minutes on each side until, dark, tender and well-marked.

While chicken thighs and mushrooms cook, add a tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, a turn of the pan, to hot skillet.  Add remaining 2 cloves of garlic, peppers and onions to the skillet season with salt and pepper and cook, tossing frequently, 7 to 8 minutes.  Add tomatoes and parsley to the pan and toss to heat through, about 1 minute then remove from heat.

Thinly slice rested chicken thigh meat and grilled mushrooms.

Drain potatoes then return them to the hot pot to evaporate some of the water content.  Add the reserved garlic and scallion mixture to the potatoes along with the ricotta, 1/2 cup milk and grated cheese and smash away to combine potatoes with cheeses and milk.  Season the super-mashers with salt and pepper.

Pile up 1/4 of the potatoes on each plate.  Top each pile with 1/4 of chicken, mushrooms and sauce and serve immediately.  Yum-o!

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     baguettes -- halved across,
                        split, some of the soft insides removed
  4        tablespoons  sherry vinegar
  2                     rounded tablespoons spicy mustard
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  8                     portobello mushroom caps -- stems removed and
                        wiped clean with damp cloth
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped parsley
  6               cups  deveined triple washed spinach -- coarsely chopped
     3/4         pound  manchego cheese -- thinly sliced
                        = (common Spanish sharp table cheese,
                        available in the specialty cheese case,
                        or sharp cheddar may be substituted)
  4                     piquillo peppers, pimientos or
                        roasted red peppers -- patted dry, and
                        cut into strips

Preheat a grill pan to medium-high heat or prepare outdoor grill.

Turn the oven on moderate heat.  Place the hollowed bread in oven to crisp, 5 minutes.

In a small bowl, whisk together sherry vinegar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, extra-virgin olive oil and garlic.  Place mushrooms in a shallow dish and pour marinade over the caps.  Turn caps in marinade and season with salt and pepper.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Prep your parsley and spinach.

Grill mushrooms 4 to 5 minutes on each side and remove to a cutting board a few at a time.  Thinly slice the mushrooms and transfer back to the dish you marinated them in and add parsley and spinach as you go, layering hot mushrooms with the herb and greens.  Once all the hot sliced mushrooms combine with the spinach, the greens will wilt up a bit.  Toss the salad and adjust the salt and pepper, to your taste.

Pile the salad into crispy bread and top with manchego cheese and red peppers of choice then set bread tops in place.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  Yukon gold potatoes -- sliced 1/4" thick
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  grill seasoning blend
                        = (Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick
                        Grill Mates recommended)
  2        tablespoons  rosemary leaves - (3 sprigs) -- stripped, chopped
  2                     navel oranges -- peeled, chopped
  1              small  red onion -- thinly sliced
  4               cups  arugula - (to 5) -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar

Place potatoes in large bowl and toss with about 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 tablespoons grill seasoning and rosemary.  Grill potatoes 4 to 5 minutes on each side.

While the potatoes are cooking, combine oranges and red onion and dress with red wine vinegar and some extra-virgin olive oil.

Remove the potatoes from the grill to the dressed oranges and onions, toss to coat.  When you grill potatoes they will be slightly drier than when you use other methods of cooking.  By adding the potatoes to the dressing while they are hot, they really will soak in the dressing.

When ready to serve, add the arugula to the potatoes and toss to distribute.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     vine ripe tomatoes -- cut into 8 wedges,
                        and each wedge cut in 1/2
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves - (10 leaves) -- torn
  1                     handful flat-leaf parsley -- coarsely chopped
  1              small  red onion -- thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  4                     bone-in rib veal chops - -- (1" to 1 1/2" thk)
  1              pound  fresh spinach -- trimmed of thick
                        stems and washed
     1/2           cup  pitted kalamata olives -- roughly chopped

In a bowl combine the tomatoes, basil, parsley, red onion, salt, pepper, balsamic vinegar and about 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil.  Allow the tomatoes to sit for 10 minutes so that the salt will leach out the juice of the tomatoes.

Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to medium high-high heat.  Drizzle 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, eyeball it, on a plate.  Place chops on plate and turn in extra-virgin olive oil using tongs and season both sides liberally with salt and pepper.  Once the grill pan or grill is screaming hot, add the chops and cook on the first side for 5 minutes.  Resist the temptation to move the chops around, you want nice grill markings and a good crust on them.  Before flipping the chops, reduce the heat to medium or move chops a little off to the side on an outdoor grill for more indirect heat.  Flip and cook them on the second side for 7 to 8 minutes, remove the chops and let them rest covered with a tented piece of aluminum foil for about 5 minutes.

Once the chops are cooked and rested, add the spinach and olives to the tomatoes and toss to coat.  Serve the salad on or alongside the chops and spoon out some of the tomato balsamic juice from the bottom of the salad bowl to top each chop.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                   Ham And Spinach Hash With Fried Eggs

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  8              small  red potatoes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1             medium  red onion -- chopped
  1              large  ham steak -- finely chopped
  4                     extra-large eggs
  2               cups  baby spinach leaves -- chopped
                        = (or a 10-oz box defrosted frozen
                        chopped spinach wrung dry in a towel)
  10                    fresh basil leaves -- chopped or torn
                        = (a few rounded spoonfuls of prepared
                        store bought pesto may be substituted)
  2                     plum tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat with 2 turns of the pan of extra-virgin olive oil, about 2 tablespoons, and 2 tablespoons of butter.  While the pan is getting hot and the butter is melting, cut the potatoes in half and then thinly slice them, add to the hot skillet and season with salt, pepper, thyme and the crushed red pepper flakes.  Cook, stirring every now and then, for about 10 minutes or, until potatoes have browned and are tender.  Add the onion and the ham and continue to cook for 3 to 4 minutes

Preheat another skillet over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of butter.  Once the butter has melted and the bubbles have subsided, crack extra-large eggs into the pan, season with salt and pepper and fry to desired doneness.

While the eggs are frying, finish off the hash by adding the roughly chopped spinach and basil to the potatoes.  (Defrosted frozen spinach and some pesto would be added in at the same point if using substitutions.)  Toss to wilt and warm the spinach.  Sprinkle the hash with tomatoes and cheese and remove from the heat.  Transfer the ham and spinach hash to plates.  Top each portion with a single fried egg or arrange the fried eggs evenly over the platter.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is a B, L or D: Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner recipe.  The portions can easily be adjusted, up or down in number.  The fresh spinach and basil can be swapped for pesto and frozen spinach, defrosted, making the recipe more versatile.  You could keep all of the ingredients easily on hand, keeping you ever-prepared for a brunch in a crunch!

Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat with 2 turns of the pan of extra-virgin olive oil, about 2 tablespoons, and 2 tablespoons of butter.  While the pan is getting hot and the butter is melting, cut the potatoes in half and then thinly slice them, add to the hot skillet and season with salt, pepper, thyme and the crushed red pepper flakes.  Cook, stirring every now and then, for about 10 minutes or, until potatoes have browned and are tender.  Add the onion and the ham and continue to cook for 3 to 4 minutes
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat another skillet over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of butter.  Once the butter has melted and the bubbles have subsided, crack extra-large eggs into the pan, season with salt and pepper and fry to desired doneness.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the eggs are frying, finish off the hash by adding the roughly chopped spinach and basil to the potatoes.  (Defrosted frozen spinach and some pesto would be added in at the same point if using substitutions.)  Toss to wilt and warm the spinach.  Sprinkle the hash with tomatoes and cheese and remove from the heat.  Transfer the ham and spinach hash to plates.  Top each portion with a single fried egg or arrange the fried eggs evenly over the platter.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  This is a B, L or D: Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner recipe.  The portions can easily be adjusted, up or down in number.  The fresh spinach and basil can be swapped for pesto and frozen spinach, defrosted, making the recipe more versatile.  You could keep all of the ingredients easily on hand, keeping you ever-prepared for a brunch in a crunch!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     bay leaf
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1              small  red cabbage - (1 1/2 lbs) -- quartered, cored,
                        and shredded
  2                     whole cloves
  1                     cinnamon stick
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  2        tablespoons  grill seasoning
                        = (Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick
                        recommended)
  3        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
     1/4           cup  red wine or cider vinegar
  1              large  pumpernickel, rye or sourdough bread from
                        bakery counter
     1/2         pound  deli-sliced corned beef
     1/2         pound  deli-sliced smoked turkey
     1/2         pound  deli-sliced pastrami
     1/2         pound  sliced Swiss cheese
     1/2           cup  sweet pickle relish
  1                cup  chili sauce

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Preheat broiler and place rack 10 to 12 inches from heat.

To very hot skillet add vegetable oil, 2 turns of the pan, bay, garlic, cabbage, cloves, cinnamon stick and nutmeg.  Cook, stirring frequently, 5 minutes, then add in the grill seasoning and brown sugar and toss to coat.  Add vinegar, cook off 2 minutes then remove from heat and let stand.  Remove bay leaf and cinnamon stick.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cut 1 inch off bread across the whole loaf to remove the top.  Remove the soft insides of the bread to form a bread bowl.  Pile half the cabbage into base of the bread.  Fill bread with meats and Swiss cheese.  Place filled bread into the oven to melt the Swiss.  Top melted cheese with the remaining seared pickled cabbage.  Slather the top with sweet pickle relish mixed with chili sauce and set bread top into place.  The loaf will appear whole and empty to the eye.  Pack to travel or serve on cutting board.  Cut the loaf into 6 sections and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  starchy potatoes -- such as Idaho
                        Salt -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  4                     scallions -- chopped
  1              pound  beef sirloin cut no more than 3/4" thk -- trimmed, and
                        thinly sliced
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  2                     Anaheim or poblano chiles -- seeded, sliced thin
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves - (to 3)
  1                     lime -- cut into wedges
     1/2           cup  sour cream or reduced fat sour cream
     1/4           cup  milk - (to 1/2) -- depending on how
                        you soft you like your mashers
  1                     sack shredded sharp Cheddar - (10 oz)

Cut potatoes, skins-on, into small chunks.  Place potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water.  Cover the pot and bring up to a boil over high heat.  Uncover, add salt to season up the potatoes and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.

Place a small pot over low heat and add butter, garlic and scallions.  Let the mixture melt together and infuse.  Cook over low heat and 5 minutes.  Turn off heat and let stand.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Season up the sliced steak with salt and pepper then add a tablespoon of vegetable oil, 1 turn of the pan, the oil will smoke ó don't freak out, just add the meat and start searing it up.  Brown the strips on all sides, hit it with some Worcestershire sauce then push it off to 1 side of the pan.  Add another tablespoon vegetable oil to the pan then the chiles and onions.  Season up the veggies with salt and pepper then toss them around, searing up the edges, for another 1 to 2 minutes before combining all the meat and veggies together.  Add in thyme and cook another 2 to 3 minutes, keeping everything moving around like a stir fry.  Turn off heat and squeeze the juice of 1 lime over the steak and veggies.  Taste for seasoning.

Drain potatoes then return them to the hot pot to evaporate some of the water content.  Add the reserved garlic and scallion mixture to the potatoes along with the sour cream and start smashing away with a masher.  Add in 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup milk to get potatoes to desired consistency then mash in cheese.  Season-up the mashed super skins with salt and pepper, to your taste.  Pile up the mashed super skins on a platter, top with steak hash.  Yum-o!

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                can  tomato sauce - (8 oz)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  gnocchi - (potato dumplings from
                        refrigerated or frozen foods section of
                        market)

                        Peppery Salad -- (see recipe)

Bring a pot of water to a boil for gnocchi.  Salt boiling water but wait a while to drop in gnocchi.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Place chicken in a medium bowl with grill seasoning and fennel seeds.  Pile sun-dried tomatoes on top of each other in small stacks then slice into thin strips.  Coarsely chop the thin strips and add to bowl.  Stack the basil leaves together then roll them up into a log.  Shred the basil by thinly slicing the log.  Add the half the basil to the bowl.  Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil over the bowl.  Mix chicken together, roll into mini balls, 1 1/2 inches across, and arrange on a nonstick cookie sheet.  Bake at 400 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes or until firm and lightly golden.

Heat a large skillet over medium heat.  To the hot skillet, add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan then the garlic, onions and crushed red pepper flakes.  Cook until tender, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Add crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce and season sauce with salt and pepper.

Drop gnocchi in boiling water and cook 5 minutes or to package directions.

Stir basil into sauce to wilt it.  Drain gnocchi and arrange on a platter.  Remove balls from oven and add to gnocchi, equally distributing them.  Sprinkle cheese over meatballs and hot dumplings then top with sauce by carefully ladling it all over and around the platter.  Gently toss to combine then serve with crusty bread and Peppery Salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings, 27 (1-inch balls).

         Oregon Style Pork Chops With Pinot Noir And Cranberries

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless pork loin chops - (1 1/2" thick)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     leeks
  1                cup  hazelnut or filbert nut pieces
     1/2           cup  dried sweetened cranberries
  1                cup  Pinot Noir
                        = (Willamette Valley Oregon recommended)
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/2         stick  butter -- divided
  2                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  crimini (baby portobello) mushrooms -- cleaned, sliced
     1/2         pound  shiitake mushroom caps -- sliced
  1              bunch  kale -- chopped, 4 to 5 cups
  1                can  sliced beets - (15 oz) -- drained
  8             ounces  blue cheese crumbles
                        = (Oregon recommended)
  1                     loaf crusty whole-grain bread
  3        tablespoons  chopped chives

Preheat a large skillet over medium high heat.  Season chops with salt and pepper.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil to the hot skillet and the chops.  Cook chops 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  While they cook, split leeks lengthwise, slice in 1/2-inch half-moon pieces and wash vigorously under running water in a colander to release sand.  Shake to dry.

Preheat a second large skillet for your hash over medium-high heat.  Add nuts to the skillet and brown 2 to 3 minutes then remove and reserve them.

To chop skillet, add another tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and the leeks.  Cook the leeks until tender, 5 minutes.  Add cranberries and Pinot Noir to the pan.  Scrape up the pan drippings and stir in chicken stock.  When sauce comes up to a bubble, add the chops back to the pan and reduce heat to simmer.  Finish cooking chops through, 10 minutes.

To the hash skillet, add a tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter.  When butter melts into oil, add shallots then mushrooms and cook 5 minutes, then add kale.  Wilt the kale into the pan and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  When kale is hot and wilted, add beets and gently combine.  Adjust seasonings.

Preheat broiler.

Pull chops from their sauce.  Raise heat and bring back to a bubble.  Cut off 4 thick slices of whole-grain bread.  Char bread under broiler on each side while you finish the sauce.  Add 2 tablespoons butter to the sauce to give it gloss and weight and turn off heat.  Pour sauce over the chops.  Serve hash alongside the chops and top with crumbles of blue cheese and reserved nuts.  Spread charred bread with remaining butter and sprinkle liberally with chopped chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Preheat a large skillet over medium high heat.  Season chops with salt and pepper.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil to the hot skillet and the chops.  Cook chops 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  While they cook, split leeks lengthwise, slice in 1/2-inch half-moon pieces and wash vigorously under running water in a colander to release sand.  Shake to dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat a second large skillet for your hash over medium-high heat.  Add nuts to the skillet and brown 2 to 3 minutes then remove and reserve them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To chop skillet, add another tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and the leeks.  Cook the leeks until tender, 5 minutes.  Add cranberries and Pinot Noir to the pan.  Scrape up the pan drippings and stir in chicken stock.  When sauce comes up to a bubble, add the chops back to the pan and reduce heat to simmer.  Finish cooking chops through, 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To the hash skillet, add a tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter.  When butter melts into oil, add shallots then mushrooms and cook 5 minutes, then add kale.  Wilt the kale into the pan and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  When kale is hot and wilted, add beets and gently combine.  Adjust seasonings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat broiler.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pull chops from their sauce.  Raise heat and bring back to a bubble.  Cut off 4 thick slices of whole-grain bread.  Char bread under broiler on each side while you finish the sauce.  Add 2 tablespoons butter to the sauce to give it gloss and weight and turn off heat.  Pour sauce over the chops.  Serve hash alongside the chops and top with crumbles of blue cheese and reserved nuts.  Spread charred bread with remaining butter and sprinkle liberally with chopped chives.

                           Oven Baked Corn Dogs

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     boxes corn muffin mix - (8 1/2 oz ea)
                        = (Jiffy brand recommended)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2                     eggs
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/2         stick  butter -- melted
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  2          teaspoons  cumin
  2          teaspoons  cayenne pepper sauce
                        = (Tabasco or Frank's Red Hot recommended)
  2                     scallions -- finely chopped
  8                     jumbo pork or beef franks
                        Sweet Relish Slaw Salad -- (see recipe)
  1                     bag reduced fat potato chips
                        = (Cape Cod brand or Terra brand Garlic
                        and Onion flavor Yukon chips recommended)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

In a shallow dish, combine muffin mix with the flour, then stir in the eggs, milk and melted butter.  Season the mix with chili powder, cumin, cayenne and scallions.  The batter will be a thick, sticky biscuit dough.  Place a hot dog in the bowl of batter and swoosh it around to coat it.  Remove coated dog to a nonstick cookie sheet and use your fingers to spread batter on any exposed dog spots.  Don't coat it too thick, just shy of 1/2-inch should do the trick.  If it's too thick it will just slide off the dog while it's baking, leaving the dog exposed.  If that happens don't sweat it, they will still taste great.  Repeat until all 8 are coated.  Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until evenly deep brown all over.

Serve the oven baked corn dogs with your favorite hot dog condiments.  Serve with Sweet Relish Slaw Salad and with some baked or reduced-fat chips alongside the dogs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tidbits:  To serve these corn dogs on a stick, insert bamboo skewers into the bottom of the dogs.  For parties, use mini dogs.  You can coat up to 24 with one batch of batter.  Serve them on 3-inch bamboo party skewers - TOO CUTE!

  1            package  extra crispy style frozen fries - -- (16 to 18 oz)
  1 1/2         pounds  ground chicken breast
  1                cup  flat-leaf parsley -- divided
  7                     garlic cloves -- minced, divided
  4          teaspoons  sweet paprika -- divided

  2                     lemons -- zested, 1 cut into
                        wedges after zesting
  2 1/2    tablespoons  grill seasoning -- divided
                        = (Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick
                        recommended)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
     1/2         pound  chorizo -- peeled from casing,
                        cut into 4 (3") pieces, butterfly each
                        piece*
  1                cup  pimiento peppers (jarred or canned) -- drained well
  1                cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
                        Salt -- as needed
  4                     jumbo shrimp or prawns - (8 ct per lb) -- peeled, and
                        deveined and butterflied*
  3        tablespoons  butter
  4                     Portuguese rolls -- split
                        = (slightly sweet rectangular crusty
                        rolls - any crusty bread or roll of choice
                        may also be substituted here)
  2               cups  chopped romaine lettuce

* To butterfly the chorizo chunks or shrimp, cut into and across but not all the way through then spread the meat, like wings. For the shrimp, cut along the deveined incision, then spread it open.

Preheat oven to temperature on back of sack of fries and scatter them across a thin nonstick cookie sheet in a single layer.  Cook fries according to package directions.

Preheat a large griddle or nonstick skillet over medium-high to high heat.

Place chicken in a bowl.  Separate out a handful of the parsley leaves and leave them whole.  Chop the remaining and take half of the chopped parsley and place it in the bowl with the chicken.  Add 3 cloves of the chopped garlic, a little less than half the total amount.  Next, add 2 teaspoons or a palm full of paprika, about 2 teaspoon hot sauce and the zest of 1 lemon.  Measure out a palm full then half again of the grill seasoning and add that to the chicken.  Pour a healthy drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil around the inside of the bowl using a spatula.  Mix the chicken and form 4 patties.  Wash up and add the patties to the grill.  Cook 5 minutes on each side.

Place the chorizo above or alongside burgers.  Try to weight the chorizo down to keep it from curling up by topping a plate or small skillet on the sausage and adding something heavy from your pantry like canned goods to weight it down.  Cook sausage just 2 or 3 minutes on each side.  It is already fully cooked, you're just crisping the edges and heating it through.

Place the pimiento peppers and mayonnaise in a food processor and add the whole parsley leaves, the chopped onion, the zest of a lemon, 2 teaspoons hot sauce and a few pinches of salt.  Turn the processor on and grind until the dressing is smooth and even.

Squeeze a little lemon juice over the shrimp or prawns, about 1 tablespoon then season them with a little coarse salt and drizzle them with EVOO.  Grill the butterflied shrimp or prawns alongside the burgers, 2 minutes on each side, weighting them as you did the chorizo.

Remove the patties and shrimp and add to the chorizo ó loosely tenting to keep warm.  Drizzle rolls with extra-virgin olive oil and place cut side down on grill.  Weight the rolls down and press to toast and char them on both sides.

Melt butter together with remaining 4 cloves chopped garlic and 2 teaspoons sweet paprika over low heat until garlic sizzles in butter.  Remove the fries from the oven and place in a large bowl.  Add the chopped parsley to the bowl and pour the melted garlic butter over the fries then season with salt to your taste.

Add chopped lettuce to roll bottoms then top with chorizo, chicken patty and shrimp.  Slather the bun top with pimiento mayonnaise and set in place.  Serve extra mayonnaise with fries for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

* To butterfly the chorizo chunks or shrimp, cut into and across but not all the way through then spread the meat, like wings. For the shrimp, cut along the deveined incision, then spread it open.

Preheat oven to temperature on back of sack of fries and scatter them across a thin nonstick cookie sheet in a single layer.  Cook fries according to package directions.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat a large griddle or nonstick skillet over medium-high to high heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place chicken in a bowl.  Separate out a handful of the parsley leaves and leave them whole.  Chop the remaining and take half of the chopped parsley and place it in the bowl with the chicken.  Add 3 cloves of the chopped garlic, a little less than half the total amount.  Next, add 2 teaspoons or a palm full of paprika, about 2 teaspoon hot sauce and the zest of 1 lemon.  Measure out a palm full then half again of the grill seasoning and add that to the chicken.  Pour a healthy drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil around the inside of the bowl using a spatula.  Mix the chicken and form 4 patties.  Wash up and add the patties to the grill.  Cook 5 minutes on each side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the chorizo above or alongside burgers.  Try to weight the chorizo down to keep it from curling up by topping a plate or small skillet on the sausage and adding something heavy from your pantry like canned goods to weight it down.  Cook sausage just 2 or 3 minutes on each side.  It is already fully cooked, you&apos;re just crisping the edges and heating it through.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the pimiento peppers and mayonnaise in a food processor and add the whole parsley leaves, the chopped onion, the zest of a lemon, 2 teaspoons hot sauce and a few pinches of salt.  Turn the processor on and grind until the dressing is smooth and even.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Squeeze a little lemon juice over the shrimp or prawns, about 1 tablespoon then season them with a little coarse salt and drizzle them with EVOO.  Grill the butterflied shrimp or prawns alongside the burgers, 2 minutes on each side, weighting them as you did the chorizo.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the patties and shrimp and add to the chorizo ó loosely tenting to keep warm.  Drizzle rolls with extra-virgin olive oil and place cut side down on grill.  Weight the rolls down and press to toast and char them on both sides.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt butter together with remaining 4 cloves chopped garlic and 2 teaspoons sweet paprika over low heat until garlic sizzles in butter.  Remove the fries from the oven and place in a large bowl.  Add the chopped parsley to the bowl and pour the melted garlic butter over the fries then season with salt to your taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add chopped lettuce to roll bottoms then top with chorizo, chicken patty and shrimp.  Slather the bun top with pimiento mayonnaise and set in place.  Serve extra mayonnaise with fries for dipping.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  cubed day-old crusty bread
  4                     Roma or plum tomatoes -- cubed
  1              small  red onion -- chopped
  1                     Cubanelle pepper or green bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
     1/2           cup  pepperoncini or hot cherry peppers -- chopped
  2                     roasted red peppers -- drained, chopped
  1                cup  pitted olives -- kalamata or
                        Sicilian green or a combination
  1                     tin flat fillets of anchovies -- drained, chopped
  1                cup  basil leaves -- torn
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Splash of liquid from bottled
                        pepperoncini or hot cherry peppers
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine all the salad ingredients in a large bowl and dress salad with lemon juice, red wine vinegar, evoo, and a splash of the hot pepper juice, then season with salt and pepper, to your taste.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Bread that is too dry or tough to cube can be soaked in water and squeezed dry, like a sponge, before cubing.  I store left over or purchase day-old Tuscan style breads in plastic bags, which keep them moist enough to cube.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        some for drizzling
     3/4         pound  chorizo sausage -- thinly sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- 2 chopped,
                        and 1 crushed
  1              large  yellow onion -- chopped
  2                     celery ribs -- chopped
  1              large  carrot -- peeled, chopped
  6             medium  red potatoes -- halved, sliced thin
  4                     fresh thyme sprigs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                can  fire roasted diced tomatoes - (28 oz)
                        = (Muir Glen recommended)
  2               cups  chicken broth
  4                     thick crusty country-style bread slices
     1/2           cup  picked flat-leaf parsley leaves
  1                     lemon -- zest
  1                     orange -- zest
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  4                     eggs -- 1 per serving

Preheat a medium soup pot over medium-high heat with 2 turns of the pan of olive oil, about 2 tablespoons.  Add the chorizo and cook, stirring frequently, 3 minutes.  Add the 2 cloves chopped garlic, onion, celery, carrot, potatoes, thyme, salt and pepper, cook for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and chicken broth and bring up to a bubble, turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes, or until slightly thickened.

Fill a medium skillet with warm water.  Bring water to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat.  As the water is coming up to a simmer proceed with making the garlic croutons and the zesty parsley sprinkle.

Toast the bread in the broiler or in a toaster oven.  Once the bread is toasted, rub with the cracked garlic and then drizzle extra-virgin olive oil over it and reserve.

Pile the parsley leaves, lemon zest and orange zest on a cutting board.  Run your knife through the pile until the parsley is finely chopped and the zests are completely incorporated into the parsley, reserve.

Once the water is at a bubble for poaching the eggs, pour the vinegar into the simmering water.  Crack an egg into a small bowl.  Gently pour the egg into the simmering water.  Repeat with the remaining 3 eggs.  Cook eggs for about 2 minutes for runny yolks, or about 4 for solid yolks.  Do not allow the water to boil.  Carefully remove the eggs with a slotted spoon to a towel-lined plate to drain.

To serve, pull thyme stems from chorizo-tomato stew, then arrange the garlic croutons in the bottom of 4 shallow soup bowls, ladle some of the stew on top of the garlic croutons, set eggs in place and sprinkle dish with zesty parsley sprinkle and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe can be adapted to serve 6 to 8 by simply bumping up the bread, eggs and broth used.  Add on 1 slice of bread and 1 egg preserving and 1 cup of broth per 2 additional servings.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     hot red cherry peppers -- chopped

  1                     box corn muffin mix - (8 1/2 oz)
                        = (Jiffy recommended)

Prick sausages with a fork and place in a large skillet then add 1-inch of water to the pan.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil to the pan then bring water up to a boil then reduce the heat to medium.  Let the sausages cook until the liquid evaporates 10 minutes.  Work on the corn cakes, see below.  Move the sausages off to 1 side of the pan to allow the casings to crisp and brown.  Add peppers to the other side of the pan, season with salt and pepper and let them cook until just tender.  Add hot peppers to sweet peppers and combine and douse the pan with a splash of pepper juice, just before you serve them.

For the cakes, combine muffin mix with egg and 2 tablespoons of the butter ñ heat it in the microwave on high for 15 seconds, with the milk, rosemary, chopped prosciutto and a few grinds of black pepper.  Rub the griddle with remaining butter nested in a paper towel to lightly coat the cooking surface.  Form 6 small cakes, 2 to 3 inches and cook cakes until golden on each side, then repeat with remaining mixture.

Serve sausages with peppers on top and the cakes along-side drizzled with honey.

  1                cup  store-bought tomato salsa -- your favorite brand
                        and flavor
  2              large  carrots -- peeled
  1                     sack blue corn tortilla chips -- plain or flavored

Heat a small pot over medium heat.  Add butter and melt.  Add flour to butter and cook 1 minute.  Whisk in milk and season sauce with salt and chipotle powder or smoked paprika.  Stir in cheese and melt.  Thicken sauce 1 minute.  Stir in salsa and remove from heat.  Serve sauce from hot pot and return to stove, as necessary, to loosen.

Cut carrots in half then stand on end and cut thin strips.  Cut strips across on an angle, forming 2 long triangles.  Lightly salt the carrots.  Pile chips into a bowl and tuck carrots in and around the chips.  The blue and orange triangles are your "witches hats".

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     Golden or Red Delicious apples -- peeled, chopped
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
  1                cup  apple cider
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1                cup  prepared whole berry cranberry sauce
                        = (store bought or homemade)
  3               cups  smashed or leftover mashed potatoes*
                        Water or milk -- as needed to thin
                        potatoes
  2               cups  grated Cheddar
  2                     scallions -- finely chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Drizzle vegetable oil
                        Butter pats
                        Paprika -- to garnish, optional

* To make fresh smashed potatoes, cook off 2 1/2 pounds of small new skin potatoes until tender and smash them up with some milk or stock and butter, salt and pepper to taste.

Place apples, lemon juice, cider, sugar and cinnamon in a medium pot over medium-high heat and cook down into a thick sauce, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in cranberry sauce to warm through and combine.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.

Place potatoes and water or milk in a bowl and cover with plastic.  Microwave 2 minutes on high to slightly reheat and loosen potatoes.  Stir them up with the liquid to make them workable again.  Combine cheese, scallions and nutmeg with potatoes and adjust salt and pepper.

Add a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pat of butter to your preheated skillet then score the potatoes and cheese mixture in half.  Using the first half of the potatoes, make 6 (3-inch across and 1/2-inch thick) potato cakes and space them evenly around the pan.  Cook the cakes until golden all over, 3 minutes per side, then remove and garnish with paprika, if using, and repeat with remaining ingredients.

Serve potato-cheddar cakes with warm cran-apple sauce for topping.

This recipe yields 4 servings, 3 cakes each.

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  macaroni elbows or
                        cavatapi corkscrew shaped pasta twists
                        Salt -- as needed
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        some for drizzling
     3/4         pound  chorizo -- casing removed,
                        and diced
  1                can  diced fire roasted tomatoes - (15 oz) -- drained
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  2                     chipotle in adobo and their juices -- chopped
                        = (or 1 tbspn ground chipotle chili)
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  whole milk
  1                cup  chicken stock
  3               cups  shredded smoked Cheddar

Place a pot of water on to boil for macaroni.  When it boils, salt water and cook pasta until a little under done, just shy of al dente.

While pasta cooks, place a small nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and chorizo.  Brown the chorizo then add the canned tomatoes to the pan and heat them through.  Remove from heat and reserve.

While chorizo begins to cook, heat a medium sauce pot over medium-low heat.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, then add onions and chipotles and cook 3 to 5 minutes to sweat it out and turn the juices sweet.  Raise heat up a bit, add the flour and whisk together until mixture bubbles up.  Cook 1 minute more.  Whisk in milk and stock and raise heat up a little more to bring the sauce to a quick boil.  Once it bubbles, drop heat back to a rolling simmer sauce to thicken, 3 to 5 minutes.

Drain macaroni or pasta.  Add cooked pasta back to the large pot.

Add cheese to milk sauce and stir to melt, a minute or so.  Stir in chorizo and tomatoes and season sauce with salt and pepper.  Pour sauce over cooked pasta in large pot and toss to combine.  Transfer to a large serving platter, garnish with chives and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  orange flavored liqueur

  1                     sheet puff pastry -- thawed, kept chilled
                        = (recommended brand: Pepperidge Farm
                        puff pastry sheets; 1 box comes with 2
                        sheets 9 1/2" by 9 1/2")
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  beef skirt steaks - (to 2)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        some for drizzling
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2                     rosemary sprigs -- leaves removed,
                        and finely chopped
  1                     small bunch thin asparagus
     1/2           cup  crumbled blue cheese
  1                     large bunch arugula -- trimmed of stems,
                        cleaned and roughly chopped
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar

Preheat oven 400 degrees.

Preheat a grill pan or outdoor grill on high.

With a sharp knife, cut the thawed but chilled puff pastry sheet in to 4 squares and arrange on a cookie sheet and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper.  Cook the puff pastry according to package directions, or until golden brown all over, about 12 to 15 minutes.

While the puff pastry is cooking, season the skirt steak with extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper.  Grill meat 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Remove meat and let it rest 5 minutes to allow juices to redistribute.  While the steak is cooking, trim the woody ends off a small bunch of asparagus.  Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  As soon as the steak is off the grill and resting, add the asparagus to the grill.

Grill the spears turning frequently until the asparagus is tender, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove the asparagus from the grill and cut into large 2-inch pieces.

In a bowl, toss together the grilled chopped asparagus, crumbled blue cheese, and chopped arugula.  Season the mixture with balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.

Slice the rested steak thinly across the grain.  Top each golden brown puff pastry square with some steak slices.  Top the steak with the asparagus salad and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                       Stuffed Roasted Strawberries

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    extra-large strawberries
                        = (the bigger the better!)
  1              ounce  bittersweet chocolate - (to 2) -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  sugar -- (optional)
                        Spray whipping cream
                        = (the real kind in the can in the dairy
                        section)
                        Cocoa powder -- for garnishing

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Slice the tops of the berries off just below the stem.  Cut the tips off (about 1/4-inch), so that the berries will sit upright.  Next, use a small spoon or a melon ball scoop to hollow out the strawberries, working from their tops, in order to create a cavity in each one.  Stuff some chocolate into the cavity of each strawberry and place them upright in a baking dish.  Lightly sprinkle the berries with sugar, if using.  Roast the berries until soft and the chocolate is melted, about 10 to 12 minutes.

To serve, place 3 strawberries on a dessert plate in a triangle.  If the berries have given off liquid in the baking dish, spoon it over them.  Spray a small mound of cream in the center of the berries, and top each berry with a rosette of cream.  Sift a little cocoa powder over the plate, and serve!

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is an inside-out version of chocolate dipped strawberries.  Roasting the fruit brings out even more flavor and juiciness.  You'll never settle for plain old dipped berries again!  You can use any type of chocolate (milk, white, or semi-sweet), but remember bittersweet chocolate has less sugar and is lower in carbs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bag corn tortilla chips -- any brand or
                        color will do
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef
  2                     jalapeÒo peppers -- seeded, chopped fine
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  water
  2                     firm Haas avocados
  3                     plum tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  1                     handful cilantro leaves -- chopped
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  2               cups  shredded Monterey Jack cheese
                        = (or shredded sharp Cheddar cheese)

Lightly crush the chips by popping open the bag and giving the chips a few light whacks with a frying pan ñ careful that they don't fly out of the sack! Hold the bag loosely at the top with 1 hand while you crush the chips with the other.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add extra-virgin olive oil ñ 2 turns of the pan. Add the beef to the skillet, brown and crumble it, 5 minutes. To the browned meat, add half the jalapeno peppers, 3/4 of the chopped onions and all of the garlic. Season the meat with cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper. Cook together 5 minutes more, then add the water and reduce heat to low. Adjust salt, to taste.

Halve and separate the avocados. Remove pit with a spoon. With the skin in tact, using a small knife, dice the avocado while still in the skin. Scoop out the diced flesh and place in a bowl. Combine tomatoes, remaining onions, jalapeÒos, and cilantro gently with avocado and dress the salad with the juice of 1 lemon, extra-virgin olive oil, and salt, to your taste.

Layer a 1 or 2 handfuls of chips in soup or chili bowls and top with a handful of cheese. Fill bowls with taco meat and top with more cheese, then mound up some salad on top and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === STEAKS ===
  2             pounds  shell steaks 1/2" thick
                        = (3 large but very thin-cut steaks)
  4              large  garlic cloves -- cracked from skins

     1/4           cup  flat-leaf parsley
  1                     lemon -- zested
  1         tablespoon  steak seasoning or salt and pepper - -- (rounded)
                        = (Montreal Seasoning for Steak by
                        McCormick recommended)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
                        === SALAD ===
  2              large  golden beets
  1                     fresh fennel bulb
  1                     romaine heart -- chopped
  1                     bundle arugula -- chopped
  4               cups  chopped spinach - (1/2 a sack)
                        Olive Oil cooking spray -- for grill or grill
                        pan
     1/2         pound  ricotta salata -- crumbled
                        === DRESSING ===
  2                     scallions -- finely chopped
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  3         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Let steaks rest to take the chill off.  Preheat the grill or a grill pan or large skillet to medium-high to high heat.

Chop garlic, then finely chop herbs and mix together.  Add lemon zest over the herb mixture and toss to combine.  Add grill seasoning or salt and pepper to the pile and combine.  Drizzle steaks with extra-virgin olive oil and rub liberally with herb mixture on all sides.

Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a medium pan.  Peel and slice beets 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick.  Simmer beets until just tender, 6 to 7 minutes.  Drain beets, cold shock them.  Pat beets dry.  Trim and slice the fennel into 1/2-inch thick pieces.

Combine greens in a large shallow bowl or platter.

Spray grill or grill pan with cooking spray.  Grill beets, fennel and steaks 2 minutes on each side until evenly marked.  Meat should still be pink inside.  Allow meat to rest a few minutes.

Whisk together the scallions, lemon juice, mustard, cumin, vinegar and stream in extra-virgin olive oil.  Dress and season the salad greens.  Slice the veggies and scatter over salad.  Crumble cheese and arrange over vegetables.  Serve salad, slice steak very thin on an angle and arrange meat over individual portions of salad and veggies.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts - -- (6 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  chopped thyme leaves - (abt 6 sprigs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  pignoli (pine nuts)
  3               cups  chicken stock -- divided
  4        tablespoons  cold butter -- divided
  1             medium  red onion -- finely chopped
  3                     celery ribs -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  dried cherries
  2               cups  plain couscous
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4           cup  honey
  2                     scallions -- finely chopped
                        A generous handful flat-leaf parsley -- finely chopped

Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat with the 3 turns of the pan of extra-virgin olive oil, about 3 tablespoons.  Season chicken liberally with half of the thyme, salt and pepper and add to the hot skillet.  Cook the chicken for 5 to 6 minutes on each side.  Remove the chicken from the pan to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.

In the bottom of a medium sauce pot, heat and toast pine nuts over moderate heat and remove.  Add 2 cups stock and 1 tablespoon butter to the pot and bring to a boil.

Return the chicken skillet to the burner over medium-high heat, add 1 turn of the pan of extra-virgin olive oil, add the onion, celery, crushed red pepper flakes, nutmeg, salt and pepper, cook for 3 to 4 or until the celery and onions are tender.  Add the white wine, and cook until the pan is almost dry, 1 minute.  Add 2 cups chicken stock, dried cherries and continue to cook for about 5 to 6 minutes or until there is only about 1/2 cup of liquid left in the pan.  Turn the heat off the under the pan.  Add the remaining 3 tablespoons cold butter in small pieces and whisk until it has completely melted.

To remaining 1 cup of boiling stock add couscous, allspice, cinnamon and a little salt.  Cover pot and remove from heat.  Let stand 5 minutes.  Drizzle honey over the couscous and add the pine nuts, scallions and parsley.  Toss and fluff with a fork to combine.

Serve the chicken whole or sliced with cherry sauce poured over it and couscous alongside.  Dark seared greens or simple salad complete the meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            pieces  turkey cutlets - (2 pkgs)
  6             slices  prosciutto di Parma -- cut in half across
                        the center of the ham
  12             whole  fresh sage leaves -- plus
  2        tablespoons  finely chopped sage
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling, plus
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  poultry seasoning
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  chicken stock -- divided
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1              pound  crimini (baby portobello) mushrooms -- wiped clean, sliced
  1                can  white cannellini beans - (15 oz) -- drained
  2        tablespoons  wine vinegar -- white or red
     1/8         pound  pancetta - (3 slices) -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  triple washed spinach -- stems removed and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg

Top each turkey cutlet with half a slice of prosciutto and a whole leaf of sage.  Roll up the cutlets and drizzle them with extra-virgin olive oil, then season with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan.  Arrange the roll-ups seam-side down and cook 6 minutes on each side.  Continue with the side dishes, see below, while turkey cooks.

After roll-ups have cooked on both sides, transfer to a platter and reserve.  Add butter to the skillet and reduce heat to medium-low.  Add flour to melted butter and combine with a whisk.  Whisk in wine and cook out, 30 seconds.  Whisk in 1 1/2 cups of stock and form a gravy.  Add remaining chopped sage to gravy, salt and pepper to taste.  Slide roll-ups back into gravy and simmer over low heat until ready to serve.

For mushrooms and white beans, heat a medium skillet over medium heat.  Add 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, then add garlic, red pepper flakes and mushrooms and cook 5 minutes to deepen color.  Stir in cannelloni and season the mixture with salt and pepper, to taste.  When beans heat through, a minute or 2, add the vinegar and stir in to cook out then add 1/2 cup stock to deglaze the pan.  Turn off heat and serve.

For the spinach, heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add a tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, then the chopped pancetta.  Brown the pancetta 1 minute then add onions and cook together 5 minutes, until they are just tender and pancetta bits are crisp.  Add spinach to the pan and turn to wilt it while combining with onions.  Season the spinach with nutmeg, salt and pepper.

Serve 3 roll-ups in gravy with mushrooms and beans and spinach with onions alongside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1 1/2         pounds  asparagus
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided

     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  2             pounds  chicken tenders
     1/2           cup  white wine
  2 1/2           cups  chicken stock -- divided
                        = (available on soup aisle in paper boxes)
  1                cup  heavy cream

  1 1/2           cups  seedless red grapes - (abt 1/2 lb) -- halved
  2               cups  couscous

Heat oven to 400 degrees.

Trim tough ends of asparagus and save for soup.  Place asparagus in a large bowl and toss with about 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 tablespoons of chopped thyme leaves and salt and pepper.

Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat; add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, and 2 tablespoons butter to the pan.  Place flour in a shallow dish.  Season chicken with salt and pepper then dredge the tenders in flour and add it to the pan.  Cook chicken 7 to 8 minutes until browned.  Add wine and scrape up browned bits as wine cooks down and bubbles, 30 seconds.  Add 1/2 cup stock to skillet.  Combine cream and mustard and add to stock.  Add grapes to the pan and turn chicken and grapes to coat and combine with the sauce.  Simmer 5 minutes over low heat.

Bring remaining 2 cups chicken stock and remaining tablespoon of fresh thyme to a boil in a small pot.  Add couscous.  Put a tight fitting lid on pot and remove from heat.  Let stand 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.

Serve tenders and grapes on couscous alongside asparagus.
