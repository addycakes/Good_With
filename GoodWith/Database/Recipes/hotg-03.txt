Recipe By     :Bobby Flay
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  leek, white and pale green parts only -- finely chopped
  1                     fennel bulb -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  2 1/2           cups  pearl barley
  7               cups  vegetable stock
  1              pinch  saffron threads
  10                    asparagus spears -- trimmed, and
                        sliced into 1/4" pieces on bias
  1                cup  fresh or frozen lime beans
                        = (thawed if frozen, blanched and
                        drained if fresh)
     1/2         pound  baby spinach -- trimmed, and
                        cut into chiffonade
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat grill.  Using side burner or top of grill.  Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan.  Add 1/2 of the leeks and fennel and cook until soft.  Add the thyme and barley and cook for 1 minute.  Place the broth and saffron in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer.

Begin by adding 2 cups of the stock and stir until the barley has absorbed the stock.  Add the remaining leeks and fennel and 4 cups of the broth.  Cook until barley is tender and the mixture is creamy, stirring often, about 30 minutes.  During the last 10 minutes add the asparagus.  If the mixture appears dry, add the remaining 1 cup of stock.

Add the lima beans and spinach and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and add cheese, salt and pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  2               cups  coarsely-ground blue cornmeal
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  baking powder
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  buttermilk
                        === RED CHILE BUTTER ===
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1                     canned chipotle

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRILLED TOMATO VINAIGRETTE ===
  5                     plum tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped red onion
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  basil chiffonade
  1                cup  olive oil
                        === POLENTA ===
  8               cups  chicken stock or water
  2               cups  polenta
  2          teaspoons  coarse kosher salt
  1                cup  fresh corn kernels
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley
     1/4           cup  olive oil

Grilled Tomato Vinaigrette:  Preheat the grill.  Toss the tomatoes with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Grill the tomatoes, until the skins are blackened.  Remove and chop coarsely.

Place the tomatoes in a blender and add the garlic, onion, balsamic vinegar and basil and blend until smooth.  Slowly add the olive oil until emulsified and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Reserve

Polenta:  Butter a large shallow baking dish generously with butter, set aside.

Place the chicken stock in large saucepan and bring to a boil.  Slowly add the polenta, whisking constantly with a wire whisk.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until thickened and smooth.

Fold in the corn, Parmesan cheese and parsley and pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish.  Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 4 hours or overnight.

Preheat the grill.  Cut the chilled polenta into 2-inch circles, brush with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill on both sides until golden brown.  Drizzle with vinaigrette.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === WALNUT ROMESCO ===
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  8                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1                     red bell pepper -- roasted, peeled,
                        and coarsely chopped
  2                     ancho chiles -- soaked in boiling
                        water until soft, seeded
  1              slice  white bread -- crust removed,
                        cut into small cubes
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  walnuts -- divided
     1/4           cup  golden raisins -- divided
     1/4           cup  dried apricots -- coarsely chopped
                        === GRILLED PORK TENDERLOIN ===
  2                     pork tenderloin - (1 1/2 lbs ea) -- butterflied
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Walnut Romesco -- from above
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === CARAMELIZED DATE-SHALLOT SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced shallots
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  red wine
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1                cup  coarsely chopped dates
  5               cups  home-made chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  molasses

Walnut Romesco:  Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over high heat, until smoking.  Separately saute the garlic, bell pepper, chiles, and bread cubes until lightly browned, about 2 minutes each.  Remove each ingredient with a slotted spoon as it is done.

Deglaze the pan with the vinegar.  Place all sauteed ingredients and the deglazing liquied into a food processor and blend until smooth.  Add half of the walnuts and process until finely chopped.  Remove 1/4 cup of the mixture and set aside.  Add the remaining walnuts, raisins and apricots and puree until smooth and thickened, season with salt and pepper.

Grilled Pork Tenderloin:  Preheat grill or oven to 400 degrees.  Season both sides of the pork tenderloin with salt and pepper.  Spread a thin layer of the Walnut Remesco down the center, fold each side over the filling, and tie with butercher's twine.  Brush each tenderloin with oil and grill for 4 to 5 minutes on each side or until just cooked through.

If using oven, heat oil in a large oven-proof saute pan over high heat.  Sear the meat on both sides, until golden brown, place in oven and roast for 10 minutes.  Let rest 10 minutes before slicing.

Caramelized Date-Shallot Sauce:  Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the shallots and the sugar and cook until caramelized, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Increase the heat to medium-high.  Add both wines and reduce the mixture to 1/4 cup.  Add the dates and the stock and continue cooking until reduced to 2 cups, and reaches the consistency of a slighly thick sauce, about 30 minutes, keep warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALSA VERDE ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3                     tomatillos -- papery skins
                        removed, roughly chopped
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped basil
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped tarragon
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  white wine
  4               cups  clam juice
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        === SPICY TOMATO RELISH ===
  2             medium  ripe tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely-diced Spanish onion
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  pure olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === LOBSTERS AND POTATOES ===
  8                     live lobsters - (1 1/2 lbs ea)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  16                    new potatoes -- roasted, halved

Salsa Verde:  Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a medium saute pan over high heat until almost smoking and saute the tomatillos 3 minutes.  Place the tomatillos in a food processor, add the parsley, basil, tarragon and water and puree.

Place the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and the garlic in a medium saute pan over low heat and cook the garlic until cooked through.  Raise the heat to medium, add the wine, and reduce the mixture to almost dry, 3 to 4 minutes.

Add the clam juice and reduce by four-fifths, an additional 5 minutes.

Add the lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Add the butter and the tomatillo-herb puree, taste, and reseason if necessary.  The salsa should be full flavored.

Spicy Tomato Relish:  Combine the tomatoes, onion, parsley, red pepper flakes, vinegar, and oil in a mixing bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Lobsters And Potatoes:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Kill the lobsters by inserting a sharp knife into the cross mark on the top shell between the head and the body.  Pull or cut off the claws.  Pull or cut off the tails and cut in half lengthwise.  Discard the bodies.

Heat the olive oil in a large ovenproof saute pan over medium-high heat until smoking.  Season the lobster pieces to taste with salt and pepper and sear 3 minutes.

Pour off excess oil.  Add the Salsa Verde and potatoes to the pan and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Place the pan in the oven and roast until the lobster is cooked through, 15 minutes.  Reseason if necessary.

Arrange the lobsters on a platter with the potatoes and sauce and spoon the relish over them.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                        shells reserved
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  8                     wooden skewers - (6" long) -- soaked in water

Strain the reduced orange juice into a blender and add the roasted garlic and olive oil and blend until smooth.  Let cool completely.

Place shrimp in a large baking dish, pour the orange/garlic marinade over and toss to coat.  Let marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Thread 5 shrimp onto each skewer, season with salt and pepper to taste and grill for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through.  Remove to a platter and sprinkle with chopped parsley and basil.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Green Onion Smashed Potatoes -- (see recipe)
                        === ANCHO PUREE ===
  3                     ancho chiles
  4               cups  boiling water
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro
                        === BLACKBERRY ANCHO SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     celery stalks -- diced fine
  1             medium  carrot -- diced fine
  2              small  yellow onions -- diced fine
  2        tablespoons  black peppercorns
  1                cup  port wine
  1                cup  red wine
  1                cup  cranberry juice concentrate
     1/2           cup  Ancho Puree -- (see above)
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar
  4               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  fresh blackberries
                        === CHICKEN ===
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  cascabel chile powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     French-cut chicken breasts
  1              pound  fresh spinach -- washed, and
                        tough stems removed
     1/4           cup  olive oil

Ancho Puree:  Combine the ancho and water in a small bowl and let stand 30 minutes.  Drain well, reserving the soaking liquid.  Remove the seeds and stems and puree in a food processor with the garlic, cilantro and 1/2 cup of the liquid, adding more if needed.

Blackberry Ancho Sauce:  Melt the butter in a medium or large nonreactive saucepan over medium heat.  Saute the celery, carrot and onions until the celery and carrot are tender and the onions are translucent, about 7 minutes.  Add the peppercorns and continue cooking 2 more minutes.

Add the port, red wine, cranberry juice concentrate, Ancho Puree, sugar and stock, stirring constantly and making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan.  Cook until the mixture is reduced by half, strain, season to taste with salt and pepper and fold in the blackberries.

Chicken:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  In a mixing bowl, combine flour, chile powder and season with salt and pepper.  Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.

Saute 2 cloves of garlic and spinach.  Cool down over ice.  Divide the spinach among the chicken breasts, placing it in the center of each.  Roll up the meat and tie with kitchen string.

Dredge the rolls in the flour mixture and shake off the excess.

In a large ovenproof saute pan over medium-high heat, heat the oil until almost smoking and sear the rolls until slightly crusty, about 1 minute on each side.  Place the pan in the oven and cook the meat an additional 8 minutes for medium.  Let rest before slicing.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Long Island ducklings - (4 to 5 lbs ea)
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  ground cinnamon
  2        tablespoons  ground ginger
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
     1/2           cup  peanut oil
  2        tablespoons  ground fennel seed
  1         tablespoon  pureed canned chipotles
  2        tablespoons  ancho chile powder
                        === PINEAPPLE-RED ONION RELISH ===
     1/2           cup  medium-diced fresh pineapple
     1/4           cup  finely-sliced red onion
     1/2                jalapeÒo -- minced
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-chopped cilantro
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  1         tablespoon  rice wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR ASSEMBLY ===
                        Flour tortillas -- warmed
                        Green onions

About 8 hours or 1 day before serving, prick the skin of the duck all over with a fork.  In a large pot over high heat, bring 8 quarts of water to a rapid boil and blanch the ducks for 5 minutes.  Remove the ducks from the water and set aside.

Combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl.  Brush on duck and let marinate at least 4 hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Roast the ducks, breast-side up, for 20 minutes, reduce the heat to 350 and continue cooking for another 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let rest at room temperature for about 20 minutes.

For the Pineapple-Red Onion Relish:  Combine all in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste.

To Assemble:  Carve the breast from each duck and slice very thin on the bias, allowing half a breast per person.  Take a tortilla, spread a little relish on it and place the sliced duck over that, top with a green onion, roll and eat.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === ROASTED CHICKEN ===
  1                cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  roughly-chopped garlic
     1/4           cup  roughly-chopped fresh thyme leave
     1/4           cup  roughly-chopped fresh tarragon

                        === ROASTED GARLIC SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2                     shallots -- roughly chopped
  1                cup  port wine
  8               cups  chicken stock
  2              heads  roasted garlic -- cloves removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2        tablespoons  white truffle oil
                        === HERBED POTATO PUREE ===
  1                cup  basil leaves - (tightly packed)
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
  2                     garlic cloves
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     red potatoes -- peeled, cut into
  1                     chunks and cooked until soft
     1/2           cup  milk -- scalded
  3        tablespoons  butter

For the Roasted Chicken:  Combine the olive oil, garlic and herbs in a very large bowl.  Add the chicken and coat with the marinade.  Cover and refrigerate 2 hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Truss the chickens and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Brush with the marinade.

In a hot skillet, sear the breast sides 3 to 5 minutes until golden.  Place in the oven and roast for 10 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and continue roasting, basting with the marinade and pan juices, until the chicken is cooked through and browned, about 30 minutes more.  Remove from the oven and let rest.

For the Roasted Garlic Sauce:  In large saute pan, heat the butter and olive oil over high heat until almost smoking and saute the shallot until caramelized, about 3 minutes.  Add the wine and reduce until almost dry.  Add the stock and the roasted garlic and cook until reduced by half.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and strain into a saucepan.  Whisk in the butter.  Spoon over chicken and drizzle with truffle oil.

For the Herbed Potato Puree:  Place basil, pine nuts and garlic and oil in a food processor and process until smooth.  Add the cheese and salt and pepper to taste.  Pass the warm cooked potatoes through a ricer into a large bowl.  Add 1/4 cup of the herb puree, milk and butter.  Mix until smooth, season with salt and pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2               cups  roasted corn kernels
  3        tablespoons  finely-diced red onion
  1         tablespoon  minced jalapeÒo
  3        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped cilantro
  3         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  finely-diced roasted red bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste

Red Curry Sauce:  In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and sweat the ginger, garlic, curry paste and onion for 3 minutes.

                        === HERBED POTATO GLAETTE ===
  4              large  Idaho potatoes
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped rosemary
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped flat leaf parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  olive oil

Chicken:  Combine oil, rosemary, garlic and onion in a large bowl.  Add the chickens and turn to coat, cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Remove chicken from marinade, truss, and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Heat roasting pan over high heat and sear bird.  Place in the oven and roast for 10 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and continue roasting, basting with the pan juices until the chicken is cooked through and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes more.

Roasted Lemon And Caper Sauce:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Heat a medium saute pan over high heat until almost smoking.  Rub the cut side of the lemon with olive oil and sear in the hot pan cut-side down.  Turn the lemons over and place the pan in the oven and cook until almost soft.  Reserve and serve as a garnish.

Place lemon juice in a nonreactive pan over high heat and reduce to 1/4 cup.

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the carrots, celery and onions and cook until soft.  Raise the heat to high and add the wine and the port and cook until dry.  Add the chicken stock and cook to a sauce consistency.  Strain through a fine strainer into a clean saucepan.  Add the reduced lemon juice and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the capers and butter and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Herbed Potato Galette:  Coarsely grate the potatoes.  Dry thoroughly by rubbing them between two clean kitchen towels.  Place the grated potatoes in a large bowl, mix in the herbs and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Heat the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium high heat until almost smoking.  Add the potatoes in a flat even layer.  Shake the pan frequently to prevent the galette from sticking.  After 3 to 4 minutes, invert the potatoes onto a plate and carefully slide them back into the pan, reduce the heat to low and continue cooking for another 20 to 30 minutes.  Cut into wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Herbed Potato Galette:  Coarsely grate the potatoes.  Dry thoroughly by rubbing them between two clean kitchen towels.  Place the grated potatoes in a large bowl, mix in the herbs and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Heat the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium high heat until almost smoking.  Add the potatoes in a flat even layer.  Shake the pan frequently to prevent the galette from sticking.  After 3 to 4 minutes, invert the potatoes onto a plate and carefully slide them back into the pan, reduce the heat to low and continue cooking for another 20 to 30 minutes.  Cut into wedges.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RISOTTO ===
  5               cups  lobster or shrimp stock
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2        medium  Spanish onion
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2                cup  white wine
  2               cups  arborio rice
  1         tablespoon  saffron threads
  1         tablespoon  honey
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped fresh tarragon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GREEN ONION VINAIGRETTE ===
  8                     scallions
     1/2         large  white onion -- cut into chunks
  3                     garlic cloves
     1/3           cup  rice wine vinegar
  1                cup  pure olive oil
  1           teaspoon  honey
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GRILLED SHRIMP ===
  12             large  shrimp -- shelled, deveined
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Risotto:  Bring stock to a simmer in a saucepan.  Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and sweat the onion and garlic until softened but not colored.  Raise the heat to high add the wine, and reduce until dry.  Reduce the heat, add the rice and saffron and stir until the rice is coated with the oil.  Cook 2 minutes.

Add 1 cup of the stock and cook, stirring, until absorbed.  Repeat with a second cup.  As the rice becomes dry, add stock in 1/2 cup increments, cooking and stirring until it is absorbed.  Add the honey and tarragon and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Green Onion Vinaigrette:  Blanch the scallions for 30 seconds in a large pot of boiling salted water over high heat.  Drain and shock in cold water.

Combine the scallions, onion, garlic, and vinegar in a blender and process until pureed.  With the motor running, slowly add the oil until emulsified.  Add the honey, season to taste with salt and pepper and pour into a squeeze bottle.

Grilled Shrimp:  Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat.  Season the shrimp with salt and pepper to taste.  Saute 2 to 3 minutes on each side.  Spoon risotto into large serving bowl, arrange shrimp on top.

     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  toasted almonds
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1         tablespoon  chipotle
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  fish stock
                        === SALT COD/SHRIMP FILLING ===
  1              pound  salt cod
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
  2                     shallots -- finely sliced
  8              large  shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  2                     baking potatoes -- cooked, pureed,
                        and kept warm
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  4                     sheets pasta dough
  2                     eggs -- mixed with
  2        tablespoons  water

Yellow Pepper Romesco Sauce:  Heat the oil in a large sautÈ pan over high heat until smoking.  Separately sautÈ the garlic, bell pepper, tomatoes, chiles and bread cubes until lightly browned, about 2 to 3 minutes each.  Remove each ingredient with a slotted spoon as it is done.

Deglaze the pan with the vinegar.  Place all sautÈed ingredients and the deglazing liquid into a food processor and blend until smooth.  Add the almonds and process until finely chopped.  Add the honey and chipotle and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Add fish stock to thin.

Salt Cod/Shrimp Filling:  In a large bowl cover the dried cod with cold water and let soak 12 to 48 hours (depending on the saltiness of the cod) changing the water frequently.

Bring a medium pot of water to a simmer.  Remove the salt cod from the soaking water and place in the simmering water.  Poach for 8 to 10 minutes, let cool in liquid for another 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from poaching liquid, remove any bones and coarsely chop.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a medium sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and shallots to the pan and cook until soft.  Remove the garlic and shallots to a plate.  Add the remaining oil to the pan and lightly sautÈ the shrimp for 1 to 2 minutes on each side.  Remove the shrimp and slice in half lengthwise.

Place cream in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Place the poached and chopped cod in a food processor, add shallot-garlic mixer and half of the warm cream and process until smooth.  Add the pureed potatoes, remaining cream and process until just combined.  With motor running add the oil.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Assembly:  Lay a sheet of pasta dough on a lightly floured work surface and distribute a heaping teaspoon-sized portion of the filling at least 2 inches apart, place 1/2 of a shrimp on top of the filling.

Use your fingertip or a brush to moisten the edges of the pasta sheet with the egg wash.  Carefully place a second sheet of the pasta dough on top of the first and press with your fingertips to separate the rows of filling.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

With a ravioli cutter or pastry wheel, cut along straight lines on the vertical and horizontal to form each ravioli square.  Press the edges closed with your fingertips to seal well.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Carefully drop in the ravioli and cook for about 5 minutes.  Drain and serve immediately.

To serve:  Place 2 ravioli for appetizer portion or 4 ravioli for entree portion in a shallow bowl.  Toss lightly with a few tablespoons of the Yellow Pepper Romesco Sauce and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings as an appetizer, 4 as an entree.

Yellow Pepper Romesco Sauce:  Heat the oil in a large sautÈ pan over high heat until smoking.  Separately sautÈ the garlic, bell pepper, tomatoes, chiles and bread cubes until lightly browned, about 2 to 3 minutes each.  Remove each ingredient with a slotted spoon as it is done.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Deglaze the pan with the vinegar.  Place all sautÈed ingredients and the deglazing liquid into a food processor and blend until smooth.  Add the almonds and process until finely chopped.  Add the honey and chipotle and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Add fish stock to thin.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Salt Cod/Shrimp Filling:  In a large bowl cover the dried cod with cold water and let soak 12 to 48 hours (depending on the saltiness of the cod) changing the water frequently.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring a medium pot of water to a simmer.  Remove the salt cod from the soaking water and place in the simmering water.  Poach for 8 to 10 minutes, let cool in liquid for another 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from poaching liquid, remove any bones and coarsely chop.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a medium sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and shallots to the pan and cook until soft.  Remove the garlic and shallots to a plate.  Add the remaining oil to the pan and lightly sautÈ the shrimp for 1 to 2 minutes on each side.  Remove the shrimp and slice in half lengthwise.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place cream in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Place the poached and chopped cod in a food processor, add shallot-garlic mixer and half of the warm cream and process until smooth.  Add the pureed potatoes, remaining cream and process until just combined.  With motor running add the oil.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Assembly:  Lay a sheet of pasta dough on a lightly floured work surface and distribute a heaping teaspoon-sized portion of the filling at least 2 inches apart, place 1/2 of a shrimp on top of the filling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Use your fingertip or a brush to moisten the edges of the pasta sheet with the egg wash.  Carefully place a second sheet of the pasta dough on top of the first and press with your fingertips to separate the rows of filling.  Repeat with the remaining dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With a ravioli cutter or pastry wheel, cut along straight lines on the vertical and horizontal to form each ravioli square.  Press the edges closed with your fingertips to seal well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Carefully drop in the ravioli and cook for about 5 minutes.  Drain and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve:  Place 2 ravioli for appetizer portion or 4 ravioli for entree portion in a shallow bowl.  Toss lightly with a few tablespoons of the Yellow Pepper Romesco Sauce and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings as an appetizer, 4 as an entree.
