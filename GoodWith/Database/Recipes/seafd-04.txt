                         Alaska Snow Crab Crisps

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  Italian peasant bread, 1/2" thick
  2               cups  snow crab meat - (abt 4 oz)
  2        tablespoons  regular or low-fat mayonnaise
  2          teaspoons  sour cream
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
  4          teaspoons  finely-chopped chives
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Grill the bread, or toast it in a 350 degree oven until the bread is golden brown. 

Using a fork, in a bowl, combine the crab meat, mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, and 2 teaspoons of the chives.  Season to taste with pepper. 

Spread each crisp with one-eighth of the crabmeat mixture.  Sprinkle with the remaining chives, and serve. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  Blending snow crab with a minimum of seasonings -- just a bit of mayonnaise and sour cream, and a touch of mustard -- shows off its fresh, briny sweetness.  These crisps heaped with snow crab, will disappear quickly at your next party.

Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small red-skinned potatoes
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  snow crab meat
  3                     scallions, white part only -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Shredded iceberg lettuce -- for garnish
                        Sliced seedless cucumber -- for garnish

Cut the potatoes, with their skins, in half or quarter them, making roughly 1-inch pieces.  Put the potatoes in a deep pot.  Add cold water to a depth of 2 inches over the potatoes.  Over high heat, bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-high, and cook until the potatoes are easily pierced with the tip of a knife, about 15 minutes. 

Drain the potatoes and transfer to a mixing bowl.  Add the crabmeat, scallion, parsley and lemon zest to the potatoes.  Toss with a fork to combine.  Mix in the oil and lemon juice to coat the potatoes.  Season the salad to taste with pepper.  (Note:  Snow crab can be salty.  But if you wish, season the salad with additional salt to taste when adding the ground pepper.) 

Serve, mounded on a bed of shredded lettuce, surrounded by sliced cucumbers. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Everyone loves sweet snow crab and everyone likes potatoes.  This salad pairs them in a fresh salad brightened with lemon zest.  Serving it in crisp cups of iceberg lettuce to show off its appealing colors.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  uncooked fettuccine
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/4         pound  asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        sliced into 2" pieces

     1/4           cup  ripe olives -- sliced

           Halibut And Tomato Bell Pepper Sauce With Fettuccine

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  dry fettuccine or linguine
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1              large  red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- sliced (abt 2 cups)
  1 1/4         pounds  boneless skinless halibut -- cut in 1" chunks
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1 1/2         pounds  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and coarsely chopped - (abt 2 cups)
                        (or 14 1/2-oz can diced tomatoes, drained)
  2        tablespoons  vodka -- (optional)
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh basil
                        (or 2 tspns dried basil)
                        Grated parmesan cheese -- (optional)

Seafood Alternatives:  swordfish, Chilean sea bass, shark, scallops 

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the fettuccine and cook until just tender, 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain well and pour into a large warm bowl.  Toss with  1 teaspoon of the olive oil to prevent sticking. 

Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic and red pepper flakes with a pinch of salt and pepper. 

Cook until the vegetables are almost tender, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer to a bowl.  Heat another tablespoon oil in the skillet.  Add the mushrooms and cook until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add to the vegetables in the bowl and set aside. 

Pat the halibut dry and season lightly with salt and pepper.  In the same skillet, heat the remaining olive oil over medium-high heat.  Saute the halibut until barely cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.  Add to the vegetable mixture. 

Add the wine to the skillet and bring to a boil, stirring up any browned bits from the bottom.  Add the tomatoes and vodka, and cook just until hot, about 3 minutes.  Return the halibut and vegetables to the skillet along with the basil.  Cook and stir gently until thoroughly heated, 3 to 5 minutes. 

Check the sauce for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper to taste.  Pour the mixture over the fettuccine.  Toss well and serve immediately with Parmesan cheese, if desired. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  If you can find fragrant, tasty, fresh tomatoes, by all means use them.  Otherwise, substitute well-drained canned diced tomatoes.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     3/4         pound  carrots -- cut in 1/4" dice
  2               cups  chopped leeks and onions
  4                     celery ribs -- cut in 1/4" dice
  6             ounces  arugula or spinach -- washed, stemmed,
                        and coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  minced thyme or parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  vegetable broth or clam juice
  1 1/2         pounds  halibut -- cut into 4 portions
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika

Seafood Alternatives:  salmon, swordfish, grouper, mahi-mahi, shrimp, clams 

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the carrots, leeks and celery and sautÈ until tender-crisp, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring.  Stir in the arugula, garlic, thyme, salt and pepper.  Continue cooking until the vegetables soften, stirring, 2 minutes longer. 

Add the vegetable broth and set the halibut on top of the vegetables.  Season the fish with the paprika, the remaining thyme, salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer until the halibut is opaque in the center, 4 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillet.  Spoon the vegetables and fish onto warm dinner plates and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Colorful and chunky, this pretty vegetable medley is the perfect partner for almost any fish or shellfish.  Keep in mind that a thicker fish will need an extra minute or two to cook.  Serve with piping hot baked potatoes.

                     Halibut With Lentils And Greens

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  lentils
  1                can  reduced-sodium chicken broth - (14.5 oz) -- more if needed
     1/2           cup  water
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
                        (or 1 tspn dried thyme)
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2         pound  hardy greens - (to 3/4 lb) -- rinsed, and
                        tough stalks removed - (mustard,
                        kale, turnip)
  2                     halibut steaks - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  1              pinch  ground cloves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2           teaspoon  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  dry red wine

Put the lentils in a medium saucepan with the chicken broth, water, thyme and bay leaf.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer until the lentils are just tender, 15 to 20 minutes.  Add a little more water during cooking if necessary to keep the lentils covered with liquid.  Drain the lentils and set aside. 

Stack the greens and loosely roll up the leaves, then cut across into about 1-inch strips. 

Rinse the halibut in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Season the fish with a pinch of cloves, salt and pepper.  Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed skillet, preferably nonstick.  Add the halibut and cook over medium-high heat until browned, about 5 minutes.  Turn the halibut and continue cooking until the fish is opaque through the thickest part, 3 to 5 minutes longer.  Transfer the fish to warmed plates and cover to keep warm. 

Add the red wine to the skillet, bring to a boil and boil for 1 minute.  Add the shredded greens and cook over high heat, stirring, until the greens are wilted.  Add the lentils and toss just until heated.  Season to taste with a pinch of cloves, salt and pepper.  Spoon the lentil mixture over and alongside the halibut steaks and serve. 

This recipe yields 2 servings. 

Comments:  Common brown lentils are perfectly suited for this recipe, but you can also use other varieties, such as red or green.  Other lentils may require different cooking times, however, so note package instructions before cooking.

                           Hand Rolls Primavera

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  soft cream cheese
  2        tablespoons  nonfat plain yogurt or sour cream
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     3/4      teaspoon  dry dill weed
     1/2      teaspoon  Dijon-style mustard
  8                     flour tortillas - (7" dia)
  1              small  cucumber -- very thinly sliced
  2               cups  spicy sprouts, such as
                        alfalfa, clover or radish
     3/4         pound  tiny cooked shrimp
     3/4           cup  thawed frozen peas
  1                can  sliced ripe olives - (3.8 oz)

Seafood Alternatives:  smoked salmon 

In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese, yogurt, lemon juice, dill and mustard.  Lay the tortillas flat on a work surface.  Spread 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture over each tortilla, covering them completely. 

Evenly layer the cucumber and sprouts over the cheese, leaving about 1 inch clear along the bottom and right sides.  Lay the shrimp, peas and olives side by side down the center to within 1 inch of the bottom. 

Fold the left side over the center, then the right side over, to form a cone. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  These hand rolls -- full of fresh colors and flavors -- are easy and quick to assemble.  The same ingredients can also be stuffed into pocket bread or layered between thick slices of whole grain bread.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7                     eggs
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs or fine cracker crumbs -- more if needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     extra-small or small shucked oysters -- (to 8), drained
  2        tablespoons  butter or canola oil - (to 3 tbspns)
  3        tablespoons  cream -- (optional)
  3        tablespoons  minced parsley or basil

Crack one of the eggs into a shallow bowl and stir with a fork to mix.  Put the breadcrumbs in another shallow bowl and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Dip the oysters in the beaten egg, allow the excess to drip off and thoroughly coat in breadcrumbs. 

Heat the butter in a large skillet, add the oysters and fry over medium heat until crisp and lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes on each side. 

Meanwhile, crack the remaining eggs into a medium bowl, add the cream, if using, and salt and pepper to taste.  Stir with a fork to thoroughly mix. 

When the oysters are crisp and brown, pour the egg mixture over and cook, gently stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the eggs are set and cooked to your liking.  Sprinkle the herbs over, fold the omelet in half and cut into serving pieces.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 2 servings. 

Comments:  The original recipe surely did not include fresh herbs, but they make a nice addition, pleasing to both the eye and the palate.  Serve the hangtown fry with crisp bacon, fried potatoes, chilled juice and a steaming cup of coffee -- a breakfast that will really get you going in the morning!  The number of oysters suggested here offers a couple per serving; if you are a gung-ho oyster lover, you may want to use more!

                        Herb Crusted Salmon Fillet

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  salmon fillet
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh herbs, such as thyme,
                        tarragon, chives, rosemary and/or sage
  1         tablespoon  freshly-grated lime zest
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Rinse the salmon fillet in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 

In a small bowl, combine the chopped parsley, herbs, lime zest, salt and pepper.  Sprinkle the herb mixture evenly over the flesh side of the fish, pressing the mixture slightly so it clings to the fish. 

Brush a large piece of foil lightly with melted butter or oil.  Lay the salmon fillet on the foil and wrap it securely so that moisture doesn't escape during cooking. 

Lay the salmon package on a shallow baking pan and bake in the heated oven until the salmon is just opaque through the thickest portion (cut with the tip of a knife to test), 15 to 20 minutes. 

Open the foil package carefully to allow steam to escape, then transfer the fillet to a platter for serving. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Chopped fresh herbs enhance fresh salmon fillet with flavor and color.  If fresh parsley is all you can find, it'll be delicious too; you can add a pinch or two of dried herbs if you like. 

This is also a great recipe for the outdoor grill during warm weather.  Alderwood or hickory chips tossed on the coals will add extra flavor. 

Accompany the salmon with corn on the cob and baked potato and you've got one exquisite meal.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1                cup  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon zest
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white or black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  flaked crabmeat
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh herbs - (to 3 tbspns)
                        (flat-leaf parsley, chives, thyme)
  2                     egg yolks
  4                     egg whites

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Generously butter a 1 1/2-quart soufflÈ dish. 

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan, add the flour and cook over medium heat until the flour foams, stirring often with a whisk, 2 to 3 minutes.  Slowly pour in the milk and whisk to mix well.  Continue cooking until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. 

Whisk in the lemon zest and salt and pepper to taste.  Take the pan from the heat, stir in the crabmeat, herbs and egg yolks and set aside. 

Beat the egg whites until stiff; do not overbeat or they will become grainy.  Add 1/4 of the egg whites to the crabmeat mixture and stir to mix.  Add to remaining egg whites and gently fold in to thoroughly mix. 

Pour the soufflÈ mixture into the prepared dish, smoothing the top.  Bake in the preheated oven until puffed up tall and nicely browned on top, 30 to 40 minutes.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Souffles really aren't difficult to prepare and they make a flavorful first course or light supper.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lobster meat
  8             ounces  cream cheese
     1/2           cup  low-fat mayonnaise
  1                cup  coarsely-chopped parsley leaves
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4               long  hard rolls - (5 to 6 oz ea)

Seafood Alternatives:  bay shrimp, crabmeat 

Pick over the lobster meat to remove any membrane or shell and set aside in a medium bowl. 

In the work bowl, of a food processor, combine the cream cheese, mayonnaise, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.  Puree the mixture and taste for seasoning. 

Add the cream cheese mixture to the lobster and stir or combine.  Split the rolls lengthwise, leaving one long side attached, and spoon in the lobster filling.  Wrap securely in plastic wrap followed by foil to pack for a picnic, or enjoy right away. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This is a multi-purpose sandwich idea that is just as delicious -- and simple -- with shrimp or crabmeat.  For varied flavor, replace some of the parsley with other fresh herbs such as tarragon, chervil, basil or chives.

                      Herbed Salmon Mousse Sausages

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  red bell peppers
  1 1/2         pounds  salmon fillet -- skin and pin
                        bones removed
  1              whole  egg or 2 egg whites
     1/2           cup  half-and-half
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  minced chives
  3        tablespoons  minced flat-leaf (Italian) parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced thyme
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil - (to 2 tspns)
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
                        Herb sprigs -- for garnish

Preheat the broiler.  Roast the bell peppers 4 to 5 inches below the broiler until the skin blackens, turning occasionally to roast evenly, 10 to 15 minutes.  Put the peppers in a plastic bag and securely close it.  Set aside to cool. 

Meanwhile, cut enough of the salmon into fine dice to make 1 cup; set aside.  Cut the remaining salmon into larger chunks, put it in a food processor with the egg and coarsely chop.  Add the half-and-half with a good pinch of salt and pepper and process until fine in texture.  Stir in the diced salmon along with half of the chives, parsley and thyme. 

Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a large, deep skillet or sautÈ pan.  Add about 1 teaspoon of the mousse mixture and simmer until cooked through, about 1 minute.  Taste the mousse, then adjust the seasoning in the remaining mousse if necessary. 

Cut 4 pieces of foil about 12 inches long.  Lightly brush the foil with oil, leaving 2 inches free on each end.  Spoon 1/4 of the salmon mousse down the center of each.  Wrap the foil around the mousse to form a cylinder about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, twisting the ends to tighten. 

Return the water to a boil.  Add the mousse cylinders, lower the heat to a simmer and poach the "sausages," uncovered, for 20 minutes. 

Meanwhile, finish the sauce.  Peel the skin from the roasted peppers and remove the core and seeds.  Coarsely chop the peppers and put them in the food processor.  Process until smoooth, then add the balsamic vinegar and the remaining herbs with the salt and pepper to taste.  Spoon the sauce onto 4 plates. 

When the salmon sausages are cooked, take them from the pan and carefully unwrap them over the sink (liquid may have accumulated inside the foil).  Cut each sausage into 1-inch slices and arrange in a circle over the roasted red pepper sauce.  Arrange herb sprigs in the center and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  These elaborate-looking "sausages" are really quite easy to make -- you'll be surprised.  And the flavor is wonderful, with fresh herbs enticing both the eyes and the palate.  Any type of salmon can be used for this recipe.  Served in half-size portions, this recipe makes a great appetizer as well.

<DirS>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Preheat the broiler.  Roast the bell peppers 4 to 5 inches below the broiler until the skin blackens, turning occasionally to roast evenly, 10 to 15 minutes.  Put the peppers in a plastic bag and securely close it.  Set aside to cool. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Meanwhile, cut enough of the salmon into fine dice to make 1 cup; set aside.  Cut the remaining salmon into larger chunks, put it in a food processor with the egg and coarsely chop.  Add the half-and-half with a good pinch of salt and pepper and process until fine in texture.  Stir in the diced salmon along with half of the chives, parsley and thyme. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a large, deep skillet or sautÈ pan.  Add about 1 teaspoon of the mousse mixture and simmer until cooked through, about 1 minute.  Taste the mousse, then adjust the seasoning in the remaining mousse if necessary. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Cut 4 pieces of foil about 12 inches long.  Lightly brush the foil with oil, leaving 2 inches free on each end.  Spoon 1/4 of the salmon mousse down the center of each.  Wrap the foil around the mousse to form a cylinder about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, twisting the ends to tighten. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Return the water to a boil.  Add the mousse cylinders, lower the heat to a simmer and poach the &quot;sausages,&quot; uncovered, for 20 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Meanwhile, finish the sauce.  Peel the skin from the roasted peppers and remove the core and seeds.  Coarsely chop the peppers and put them in the food processor.  Process until smoooth, then add the balsamic vinegar and the remaining herbs with the salt and pepper to taste.  Spoon the sauce onto 4 plates. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;When the salmon sausages are cooked, take them from the pan and carefully unwrap them over the sink (liquid may have accumulated inside the foil).  Cut each sausage into 1-inch slices and arrange in a circle over the roasted red pepper sauce.  Arrange herb sprigs in the center and serve. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  These elaborate-looking &quot;sausages&quot; are really quite easy to make -- you&apos;ll be surprised.  And the flavor is wonderful, with fresh herbs enticing both the eyes and the palate.  Any type of salmon can be used for this recipe.  Served in half-size portions, this recipe makes a great appetizer as well.

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Fish (Ocean)
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  tuna steak about 3/4" thick
  2        tablespoons  hoisin sauce
  2        tablespoons  reduced-sodium soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame seeds -- more or less

Seafood Alternatives:  swordfish 

If using bamboo skewers, soak them in a bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes before using. 

Cut the tuna into strips 1/8-inch wide and 3 to 5 inches long.  Combine the hoisin, soy, vinegar, honey and ginger in a small bowl.  Stir in the tuna strips, cover and refrigerate 1 hour or overnight. 

Thread the tuna onto skewers, piercing each piece several times to make a wavy strip.  Arrange the skewers in a single layer on an oiled rack of a broiler pan.  Brush the fish with some of the marinade; discard the remaining marinade. 

Broil the skewers 4 inches from heat until the tuna is just opaque in center, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Sprinkle the skewers with sesame seeds, transfer to a platter and serve right away. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 appetizer servings. 

Comments:  Tuna strips in sweet marinade take only a minute or two to cook.

       Huachinango A La Veracruzana - {Red Snapper Veracruz Style}

Recipe By     :Chef Ricardo MuÒoz
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  virgin olive oil
  18             small  potatoes - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled
  1                cup  chopped onion
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  4             pounds  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely chopped
                        (or 8 cups canned chopped tomatoes,
                        drained)
     1/2           cup  pitted green olives
     1/2           cup  dark raisins
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained
  1         tablespoon  minced Italian (flat-leaf) parsley
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2                     bay leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
  6                     red snapper fillet pieces - (abt 6 oz ea)
  6                     canned guero chiles -- (optional)

Heat the oil in a large sautÈ pan or deep skillet until it just begins to smoke.  Add the potatoes and fry them until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes, stirring often.  Scoop out the potatoes with a slotted spoon and set aside; they will be fully cooked later. 

Add the onion to the skillet and fry over medium-high heat until transluscent, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and continue cooking for 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes and cook over medium-low heat until tender and the mixture has thickened slightly, about 20 minutes. 

Add the potatoes and remaining ingredients except the fish and chiles.  Continue cooking, uncovered, until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes longer.  If the sauce becomes quite dry, add a cup or so of water. 

Check the sauce for seasoning, adding more salt to taste.  Arrange the fillets over the sauce, folding the thin ends under, and press down gently so they are fully submerged.  Cook until the fish is just opaque through, 7 to 10 minutes. 

Carefully lift the fillets from the sauce and arrange them on individual plates.  Spoon some potatoes alongside and top the fish with plenty of sauce.  Top each fillet with a chile guero, if using, and serve right away. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  This is it -- the classic.  It's not difficult to prepare, and the richly blended flavors are outstanding.  The guero chiles that garnish the fish add a little punch of heat.  Guero, which means "blond," refers to yellow-colored chiles, often available canned. 

You'll want to serve this with white rice prepared in the Mexican style: sautÈ the rice first in good olive oil, then add flavorful chicken broth instead of water for cooking.

                            Jamaican Jerk Tuna

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8          teaspoons  allspice berries ground
  2        tablespoons  dry mustard
  4          teaspoons  paprika
  2          teaspoons  granulated onion
  2          teaspoons  lemon pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  ground white or black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  dry thyme
  1 1/2         pounds  tuna steaks 1" thick -- cut into 4
                        equal portions
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

Seafood Alternatives:  swordfish, halibut, mahi-mahi 

For the jerk seasoning, in a small bowl combine the allspice, mustard, paprika, granulated onion, lemon pepper, dried red pepper flakes, ground pepper, cayenne, granulated garlic, cinnamon, salt and thyme. 

Rinse the tuna with cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Rub each side of the tuna pieces with a little of the olive oil.  Sprinkle one side of each portion with 1 1/2 teaspoons jerk mixture; pat the seasoning onto the fish, turn and repeat with the second side.  Let stand for 1 hour, until the seasoning is moistened, turning once.  Store extra jerk blend in a sealed jar for up to 6 months. 

Grill the tuna over moderately-hot fire for 4 to 5 minutes, turning once.  Do not overcook, since the seafood will continue to cook once taken from the fire. 

Serve with grilled plantains and a salad of chayote, orange and sweet onion, if you like. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Capture the beat of the festive Island lifestyle with lusty Jamaican jerk, a favorite cooking method that seasons pork, chicken, seafood or beef with the customary highly spiced seasoning blend before grilling over a hot fire. 

Spicy, sweet, seductive and hot, this jerk is a dry blend that keeps well.  Jerk blends can also include fresh ingredients; if substituting fresh garlic, onion or herbs for dried, finely mince them before adding.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;For the jerk seasoning, in a small bowl combine the allspice, mustard, paprika, granulated onion, lemon pepper, dried red pepper flakes, ground pepper, cayenne, granulated garlic, cinnamon, salt and thyme. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Rinse the tuna with cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Rub each side of the tuna pieces with a little of the olive oil.  Sprinkle one side of each portion with 1 1/2 teaspoons jerk mixture; pat the seasoning onto the fish, turn and repeat with the second side.  Let stand for 1 hour, until the seasoning is moistened, turning once.  Store extra jerk blend in a sealed jar for up to 6 months. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Grill the tuna over moderately-hot fire for 4 to 5 minutes, turning once.  Do not overcook, since the seafood will continue to cook once taken from the fire. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Serve with grilled plantains and a salad of chayote, orange and sweet onion, if you like. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Capture the beat of the festive Island lifestyle with lusty Jamaican jerk, a favorite cooking method that seasons pork, chicken, seafood or beef with the customary highly spiced seasoning blend before grilling over a hot fire. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Spicy, sweet, seductive and hot, this jerk is a dry blend that keeps well.  Jerk blends can also include fresh ingredients; if substituting fresh garlic, onion or herbs for dried, finely mince them before adding.

                         Jamaican Orange Sea Bass

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  allspice berries
  2                     jalapeÒo or serrano chiles -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced (more or less to taste)
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  3                     green onions -- minced
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  sea bass fillets - (to 2 lbs) -- cut serving portions
  2                     navel oranges -- cut in 1" slices

Seafood Alternatives:  snapper, rockfish, halibut 

Finely crush the allspice berries with a mortar and pestle, or grind them in a spice grinder.  In a small bowl, combine the allspice with the chiles, garlic, onions, orange juice, orange zest, oil, salt and pepper.  Stir to mix well. 

Preheat the grill. 

Set the sea bass fillets in a shallow dish and lightly spoon the marinade mixture over.  Turn the fillets so they are evenly coated in the marinade and set aside for 10 to 15 minutes (chill if the ambient temperature is quite warm). 

Put the fish fillets on the hot grill, with the orange slices alongside.  Cook until the fish is just opaque through, 3 to 4 minutes per side.  Turn the orange slices occasionally, so they brown evenly. 

Serve the grilled sea bass with grilled orange slices alongside. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Based on the classic jerk seasonings, this marinade adds distinctive flavor from orange zest to balance with the zesty spice from fresh chiles.  Ground allspice can be used in place of the freshly ground whole berries, but the flavor will not be as pronounced. 

A simple salad of cooked rice tossed with black beans, lime juice and minced cilantro is an ideal accompaniment, along with sliced fresh mangoes.

                          Jamaican Seafood Soup

Recipe By     :Chef Dawn Sieber, Cheeca Lodge, Islamorada
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood
                Shellfish                       Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             slices  apple-smoked or regular bacon -- chopped
     1/2           cup  diced onion
     1/2           cup  diced celery
     1/2           cup  diced leeks
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  Jamaican jerk seasoning
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  2               cups  fish stock
  1              pound  plum tomatoes -- diced
  2        tablespoons  minced tarragon
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  butter - (to 2 tbspns)
  3             ounces  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        and coarsely chopped
  3             ounces  snapper, mahi-mahi or grouper -- coarsely chopped
  3             ounces  stone crab meat or other crab -- flaked
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
                        Small-size croutons
                        Sliced green onions

In a large saucepan, cook the bacon until lightly crisped.  Add the onions, celery and leeks and cook over  medium-low heat until translucent, 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the brown sugar and cook 3 minutes longer. 

Stir in the jerk seasoning and cayenne.  Cook, stirring, for 1 minute, then add the fish stock and tomatoes.  Bring just to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.  Add the tarragon and salt to taste; cover to keep hot. 

Heat the butter in a medium skillet, add the shrimp and fish and cook over medium heat until just opaque through.  Add the crab and stir gently until heated. 

Distribute the seafood among shallow soup bowls.  Ladle the hot soup base over and garnish with croutons and green onions, if desired. 

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings. 

Comments:  This recipe is chef Sieber's alternative to conch chowder, a hallmark Keys dish.  Abundant shrimp, snapper and stone crab replace the over-fished conch, which is no longer caught in Florida waters. 

Jerk seasoning -- a quintessential element of Jamaican cooking -- is becoming more commonly available throughout the country.  Look for it in the gourmet spice section of the supermarket or in specialty shops.

Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  cooked and peeled langostinos
  1                     avocado -- sliced
  2                     plum tomatoes -- diced
     1/2           cup  diced red onion
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1               head  green leaf lettuce -- trimmed, rinsed,
                        and dried
                        === DRESSING ===
  1                     garlic clove -- minced or pressed
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  olive oil

To make the dressing, combine the garlic, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper in a small bowl.  Whisk to mix well, then add the olive oil and whisk until thoroughly mixed and emulsified.  Taste the dressing for seasoning and set aside. 

In a medium bowl, combine the langostinos, avocado, tomatoes and onion.  Drizzle the lemon juice over and stir gently to thoroughly mix the ingredients. 

Stack a few of the lettuce leaves on a chopping board and loosely roll them up.  Cut across the leaves to form strips.  Repeat with the remaining lettuce.  Arrange the lettuce on individual plates. 

Whisk the dressing to remix and pour it over the langostino salad.  Stir to evenly coat the ingredients in dressing.  Spoon the langostino salad over the lettuce and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This recipe serves well as either a first course or a light main course salad.  The dressing can easily be varied, using red wine vinegar or citrus juice in place of the balsamic vinegar.

                           Layered Pesto Pasta

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  dry penne or rotini pasta
  5        tablespoons  pesto - (to 7 tbspns)
  1                jar  roasted sweet red bell peppers - (7 oz) -- drained
  1                cup  grated mozzarella cheese
  6        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
  1                can  sliced ripe olives - (2 1/4 oz) -- drained
  1         tablespoon  drained capers -- (optional)
     3/4         pound  sole or flounder fillets
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice

Seafood Alternatives:  orange roughy, tilapia, cod, snapper 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 

Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil in a large pan.  Stir in the pasta and 1 teaspoon salt, if desired.  Boil uncovered until the pasta is tender, 8 to 10 minutes; drain well.  Put the pasta in a large bowl and stir in the pesto.  Slice the peppers into thin strips and stir them into the pasta along with the mozzarella, 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan, olives and capers. 

Spray the bottom and sides of a 2- to 2 1/2-quart casserole with nonstick cooking spray.  Spoon half of the pasta mixture into the casserole.  Rinse the sole fillets and pat dry.  Layer the fish evenly over the pasta and drizzle with the lemon juice.  Spoon the remaining pasta over the fish and sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan. 

Cover and bake 30 to 35 minutes, until the fish is nearly opaque in the center.  Uncover and bake until the cheese is golden, 5 to 10 minutes longer.  Cut into servings and carefully lift each out with a wide spatula. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  You've got to love a meal that finishes in the oven.  It offers a chance to relax and feel human again after a busy day.  This casserole requires almost no preparation, so while you're waiting for the pasta to cook, toss together a salad or fresh vegetables to steam. 

If you are using an alternate fish rather than sole, you may need to cut it in thin pieces so you can arrange it in an even layer over the pasta.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice -- (abt 3 limes)
     1/4           cup  reduced-fat coconut milk
     1/4           cup  rum
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  grated lime zest
  2             pounds  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1                     red onion -- cut in 3/4" pieces

Seafood Alternatives:  scallops, cubed halibut 

In a large bowl, combine the lime juice, coconut milk, rum, honey and lime zest; stir to mix.  Add the shrimp and toss to evenly coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 

If using bamboo skewers, soak them in a bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes before grilling.  Preheat the grill to high, or heat coals until they glow red, with white ash around the edges. 

Take the shrimp from the marinade, allowing excess to drip off, and thread them onto the skewers, alternating with pieces of red onion; you should have about 12 skewers.  Avoid crowding shrimp on the skewers or they will cook unevenly.  Reserve the marinade. 

Rub a lightly oiled towel or cloth over the grill, add the shrimp skewers and cook until pink and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  Brush the tops with more marinade, turn the skewers and continue cooking until the shrimp are opaque through the thickest part, 1 to 2 minutes longer. 

If you like, bring the remaining marinade to a boil for 1 minute and drizzle it over the shrimp before serving. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments  Inspired tropical flavors in this marinade make a grilled shrimp without peer.  No more humdrum grilling!  The marinade may sound good enough to drink, but save it for the shrimp.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove - (to 3) -- minced or pressed
     1/2           cup  dry red wine, such as Zinfandel
                        or Chianti
  1                can  chopped tomatoes in purÈe - (28 oz)
  2          teaspoons  dried basil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12            ounces  dry linguine
  1 1/4         pounds  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        and coarsely chopped
                        Grated Parmesan cheese -- (optional)

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and garlic and sautÈ until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the wine and simmer 2 minutes.  Stir in the tomatoes and basil, return to a boil and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. 

Meanwhile add the remaining teaspoon of olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the boiling water.  Stir in the linguine and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, about 10 minutes. 

Add the shrimp and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to the tomato mixture.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until the shrimp are pink and cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Taste the sauce for seasoning. 

Drain the pasta and transfer to a large bowl.  Add the red sauce and toss well.  Divide the pasta and sauce among 4 dinner plates and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, if desired. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  The brilliant red tomato sauce, with a touch of spirit from red wine, dresses up pasta with ease -- a perfect setting for shrimp.  Choose a nice red wine that you will want to drink with the meal.

            Lobster And Fennel Salad With Carrot Ginger Sauce

Recipe By     :Chef Ed Brown, The Sea Grill
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              bulbs  fennel -- trimmed, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/2                red onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     orange -- peeled, sectioned
  4                     lobsters - (1 1/4 lbs ea) -- cooked and shelled
  1         tablespoon  grated ginger
                        === LEMON OIL ===
     1/2           cup  virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === CARROT GINGER SAUCE ===
  4             ounces  ginger
  2               cups  carrot juice
  2        tablespoons  carrot juice -- stirred with
  4          teaspoons  arrowroot or cornstarch
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
                        Salt -- to taste

For the carrot sauce:  Grate the ginger and squeeze to extract the juice (you should have 2 to 3 tablespoons juice).  Discard the pulp and set aside the juice. 

Put the 2 cups carrot juice in a small pan and bring to a boil.  Stir the carrot juice-cornstarch mixture and whisk it into the boiling carrot juice.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 1 minute.  Take the pan from the heat, add the ginger juice, vinegar and cayenne and set aside to cool.  When cool, stir in the lime juice and season to taste with salt. 

To make the lemon oil, combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and stir to mix well.  Set aside. 

In a large bowl, combine the fennel, red onion and orange.  Sprinkle lemon oil over to taste and toss gently to coat.  Set aside. 

Cut the lobster tail pieces into slices (medallions) and put them in another large bowl with the rest of the lobster, ginger, lemon oil and salt to taste.  Toss to coat. 

Arrange the fennel salad in the center of large individual plates.  Top the salad with the lobster pieces and drizzle the sauce around.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Carrot juice is the base for the sauce, full of sweet flavor that beautifully complements the lobster.  If you do not have a juicer, carrot juice is available in many grocery stores and health food shops, although the fresher the juice, the better the flavor. 

The lemon oil is used as a seasoning here, so drizzle it on the salad and lobster to taste.  Store the rest in the refrigerator and use it to perk up salads or other seafood dishes. 

This recipe calls for one lobster per person, but you can use fewer lobsters and distribute the meat among the salads.  Served in smaller portions, this salad makes a luxurious first course.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;For the carrot sauce:  Grate the ginger and squeeze to extract the juice (you should have 2 to 3 tablespoons juice).  Discard the pulp and set aside the juice. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Put the 2 cups carrot juice in a small pan and bring to a boil.  Stir the carrot juice-cornstarch mixture and whisk it into the boiling carrot juice.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 1 minute.  Take the pan from the heat, add the ginger juice, vinegar and cayenne and set aside to cool.  When cool, stir in the lime juice and season to taste with salt. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To make the lemon oil, combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and stir to mix well.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a large bowl, combine the fennel, red onion and orange.  Sprinkle lemon oil over to taste and toss gently to coat.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Cut the lobster tail pieces into slices (medallions) and put them in another large bowl with the rest of the lobster, ginger, lemon oil and salt to taste.  Toss to coat. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Arrange the fennel salad in the center of large individual plates.  Top the salad with the lobster pieces and drizzle the sauce around.  Serve immediately. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Carrot juice is the base for the sauce, full of sweet flavor that beautifully complements the lobster.  If you do not have a juicer, carrot juice is available in many grocery stores and health food shops, although the fresher the juice, the better the flavor. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;The lemon oil is used as a seasoning here, so drizzle it on the salad and lobster to taste.  Store the rest in the refrigerator and use it to perk up salads or other seafood dishes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe calls for one lobster per person, but you can use fewer lobsters and distribute the meat among the salads.  Served in smaller portions, this salad makes a luxurious first course.

                    Lobster With Tropical Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     spiny lobster tails - (8 oz ea)
                        (or four 1 1/2-lb lobsters)
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === TROPICAL VINAIGRETTE ===
  1                     English long seedless or regular cucumber
  1                cup  mango purÈe - (abt 1 lb mango
                        pitted, peeled and purÈed)
  2          teaspoons  freshly-grated or minced ginger
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced or pressed garlic
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  rum
  2          teaspoons  grated orange zest
  6        tablespoons  fresh orange juice
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes - (to 1 tspn)
                        (or 1 1/2 tspns minced fresh chile pepper)
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh thyme
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried thyme)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil

If using live American lobsters, kill them immediately before cooking.  Remove the stomach and discard; remove the claws and legs and reserve; split the tail as directed.  Place claws, legs and body on grill over a medium-hot fire and cover with foil.  Place the tail meat-side up.  Grill until the shells are bright red, turning the claws and tail once.  Grill the legs 4 to 6 minutes, claws about 8 minutes, tail and body 8 to 10 minutes. 

If frozen, thaw the lobster in the refrigerator overnight. 

To make the vinaigrette, halve the cucumber and reserve half for another use.  If using regular waxed cucumbers, scrub the skin to remove wax and remove seeds before dicing.  With a vegetable peeler, remove 4 lengthwise strips of skin and discard.  Cut the cucumber in half lengthwise and then into 1/8-inch dice. 

In a medium bowl, whisk together the mango purÈe, ginger, garlic, salt, rum, orange zest, orange juice, chile, thyme and vegetable oil; stir in the cucumber.  Taste the vinaigrette for seasoning and chill until needed. 

Set each lobster tail with the transluscent membrane down and curved shell facing up.  With kitchen shears or a heavy, sharp knife cut through the curved shell and meat, leaving the membrane intact.  Open the tail gently like a book so its hinged in the center.  Pour 1/2 teaspoon of the olive oil over each tail; season lightly with salt and pepper. 

Place the lobster meat-side up over a medium-hot fire and grill until opaque, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once.  Serve with Tropical Vinaigrette and grilled garlic bread. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  One taste of this vibrant, golden sauce will transport you to the sunny shores of Martinique.  Flecked with peppers and crunchy cucumbers, this silky sauce complements the rich lobster.  Whether you grill spiny lobster tails or familiar American (Maine) lobsters, this simple, succulent seafood will be an instant hit with your guests.

                   Mahi-Mahi Saute With Grapefruit Mojo

Recipe By     :Chef Marty Blitz, Mise en Place and Mojo
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     mahi-mahi fillets - (8 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (to 2 tbspns)
  1                     grapefruit -- peeled, and
                        cut into sections for serving
                        === GRAPEFRUIT MOJO ===
                        Zest and juice of 2 grapefruits
                        Zest and juice of 2 limes
  1              small  white onion -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  minced or pressed garlic
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SHRIMP MOFONGO ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil - (to 3 tbspns)
  2                     green plantains -- peeled, and
                        sliced 1/4" thick
  2             slices  bacon -- coarsely chopped
  4              large  shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        and chopped
  1           teaspoon  minced or pressed garlic
                        === BLACK BEAN SCOTCH BONNET PUREE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- minced or pressed
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1                     Scotch bonnet -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced
  1                cup  cooked black beans -- (canned or
                        freshly cooked)
  1                cup  chicken broth

For the mojo:  Combine the citrus zests and juices with the onion, garlic, vinegar and olive oil in a medium nonreactive bowl and stir to mix.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 

Arrange the mahi-mahi fillets in a shallow dish and spoon half of the grapefruit mojo over the fish.  Reserve the remaining mojo for serving.  Marinate the fish in the refrigerator for 2 hours. 

For the mofongo:  Heat the oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick.  Fry the plantain slices in batches over medium-high heat until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels and set aside. 

Wipe out the skillet, add the bacon and fry until crisp.  Add the shrimp and garlic and continue cooking for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Put the mixture in a food processor, add the plantain slices and pulse just until coarsely chopped.  Transfer the mofongo to a bowl, season to taste with salt and pepper, cover to keep warm and set aside. 

For the black bean purÈe:  Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet, add the garlic, onion and Scotch bonnet and sautÈ over medium heat until tender and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.  Stir in the black beans and chicken broth and cook, uncovered, over medium heat for 15 minutes.  Puree the mixture in blender or food processor until smooth, season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.  Cover to keep warm. 

Heat the oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick.  Take the fish from the mojo marinade and sautÈ over medium-high heat until just opaque through, about 3 to 5 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fish. 

To serve, ladle the warm black bean purÈe onto individual plates and mound the shrimp mofongo in the center.  Lean the fish fillets against the mofongo and drizzle the remaining mojo sauce over the fish.  Garnish the plates with grapefruit slices and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Chef Blitz has made a culinary splash in Tampa on the Gulf Coast.  His first restaurant, Mise en Place, grew out of what started as a catering/take-out operation.  Now in its second location, with seating for 200, the restaurant is prospering. 

Along with his wife, Maryann, Chef Blitz recently opened a second, more casual restaurant, called Mojo, refering to the Cuban sauce/marinade of the same name.  Mojo is traditionally made with sour oranges, garlic, onions and olive oil, but here the chef interprets the sauce with grapefruit and lime.  Mofongo is a Puerto Rican dish based on plantains (starchy cooking bananas), usually with fried pork rinds, here with shrimp and a touch of bacon.

     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced leeks (white part only)
  6                     sole or flounder fillets (4 to 6 oz ea)
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  low-salt chicken broth or clam juice
     1/2           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  6             ounces  shrimp meat or crabmeat
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh dill weed
                        (or 1/2 tspn dry dill weed)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  shredded Swiss cheese - (2 oz)
                        (or 1/4 cup shredded or grated Parmesan
                        cheese)
                        Dry dill weed or sprigs of fresh dill -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Arrange an even layer of mushrooms and leeks in a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.  Rinse the fish and pat dry.  Tuck thin tail ends under to make each fillet an even thickness and place them on top of the vegetables.  Combine wine and broth and pour over fish.  Cover the pan with foil and bake until the fish is opaque on surface but does not flake, about 10 minutes. 

Carefully drain the liquid from the baking dish into a medium-size saucepan; set the baking dish with fish and vegetables aside.  Boil the liquid until reduced to 2/3 cup.  Meanwhile, whisk the milk into the flour in a small bowl.  When liquid is reduced, whisk in flour mixture over medium heat and stir until the sauce bubbles, 2 to 3 minutes.  (If making ahead, see note.) 

Stir the shrimp and dill into the sauce; season with salt and pepper if desired.  Spoon the sauce over the fish, covering it completely.  Return to the oven and bake, uncovered, until the sauce is bubbly and fish is opaque through the thickest part, 12 to 15 minutes more.  Sprinkle the cheese on top and return to oven until melted, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to warm plates and garnish with a sprinkling of dill. 

Note:  If making ahead, cook the fish and sauce to this point, then cover separately and refrigerate for up to 24 hours.  To finish the dish, stir the shrimp, dill, salt and pepper into sauce.  Spoon over fish, covering completely.  Cover with foil and bake 10 minutes.  Uncover and continue baking until hot throughout, about 8 to 10 minutes more.  Sprinkle cheese on top and return to oven until melted, about 2 minutes.  To serve, see above. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  An easy and elegant make-ahead dish for company.

                            Mardi Gras Shrimp

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  shell-on medium shrimp
     1/2           cup  butter
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  4          teaspoons  minced or pressed garlic
  4          teaspoons  paprika
  4          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  2                     bay leaves
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh rosemary
  2          teaspoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     3/4           cup  beer -- at room temperature

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Cut each shrimp lengthwise through the curved part of the shell and devein, leaving the shell on. 

In a 10-inch ovenproof skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, garlic, paprika, lemon juice, bay leave, rosemary, pepper, basil, oregano and cayenne.  Cook, uncovered, until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the shrimp and toss to coat with the seasoning mixture. 

Place the pan in the oven and bake, uncovered, for 10 minutes.  Pour in the beer, shake pan to mix, and continue baking until the shrimp are firm and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes longer. 

Serve the shrimp in bowls with bread to dunk into the sauce. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  Messy, fun -- and a great excuse for a Mardi Gras party.  Shell-on, garlic-baked shrimp swim in a decadent herb butter.  Serve with lots of crusty bread to soak up the juices and a Caesar salad chock-full of jumbo Parmesan cheese croutons.

Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  sea bass fillet
     1/2         pound  medium shrimp
     1/2         pound  scallops
  2             medium  red bell peppers -- seeded, julienned
  2             medium  tomatoes -- coarsely diced
  1              small  red onion -- thinly sliced
  1               head  romaine lettuce -- leaves washed,
                        and torn
  1                     lemon -- cut into wedges
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
     1/2      teaspoon  ground pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1                     garlic clove -- minced or pressed

Seafood Alternatives:  cod, rockfish, mussels, clams, squid 

Fill a medium saucepan three-quarters full with water.  Bring to a boil.  Add the fish and scallops; simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and quickly rinse with cold water to stop the cooking.  Repeat with the shrimp, cooking for 2 to 3 minutes.  Chill, covered in the refrigerator. 

In a small bowl, combine the marinade ingredients.  Whisk to mix completely.  In a medium bowl, combine the poached seafood, bell peppers, tomatoes and onion.  Pour the marinade over, toss to mix and refrigerate for 20 minutes; drain.  Serve the marinated seafood on a bed of romaine lettuce, with lemon wedges alongside. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  This simple but elegant salad combines the varied textures and flavors of poached sea bass, shrimp and scallops, with a tangy vinaigrette marinade.  Rinse the seafood and pat dry with paper towels.  Cut the sea bass into 1-inch cubes.  Peel and devein the shrimp.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 

Rinse the cod in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Arrange the fillets in a 2- to 3-quart baking pan or casserole, folding thin tail ends under to give the fillets even thickness.  Pour the tomatoes and their juice over the fish.  Sprinkle with capers and/or olives, followed by the Parmesan cheese. 

Bake the fish uncovered in the heated oven until just opaque in center, 20 to 25 minutes for fillets about 1-inch thick.  (The pan juices are tasty poured over rice, orzo or couscous.) 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  No chopping, slicing or sautÈing -- this is simplicity at its best.  Take five minutes to assemble this dish, put some rice on to steam, then go put your feet up and relax until the timer calls you to the table.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped drained sun-dried
                        tomatoes in oil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced or pressed garlic
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced Kalamata olives -- (optional)
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped capers
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar -- (optional)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper

Mix all ingredients.  Store covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.  (The oil will become opaque in the cold of the refrigerator, but will become clear again at room temperature.) 

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 cups. 

Comments:  A little of this flavored oil goes a long way.  Use it as a marinade (try Grilled Swordfish, for example), or drizzle it on as a robust seasoning...and just imagine what it would do for a bowl of fresh pasta!

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     garlic clove -- minced or pressed
  1                cup  thinly-sliced mushrooms - (abt 1/4 lb)
  2         tablespoon  finely-chopped onion
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  grated or shredded Parmesan cheese
  2          teaspoons  Dijon-style mustard
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed, squeezed dry
  4               thin  flounder or sole fillets (abt 4 oz ea)

Combine the garlic, mushrooms, onion and olive oil in a medium-size microwave-safe bowl.  Cover with a lid or vented plastic wrap.  Microwave on High (100% power) 2 minutes, stirring once.  Carefully drain the liquid from the bowl.  Add the Parmesan cheese, mustard, salt, pepper and spinach to the mushroom mixture and mix well. 

Rinse the fish and pat dry.  Lay the fillets with their nicest-looking sides down on a work surface.  Lightly press an equal amount of spinach mixture on each fillet, leaving about 1 inch clear at both ends.  Roll up the fillets beginning at the thicker end.  Place the rolls seam-side down in a microwave-safe baking dish lightly coated with cooking spray or salad oil.  Cover with a lid or vented plastic wrap.  (At this point you can refrigerate the dish up to 24 hours.) 

Microwave on High (100% power) until the fish is opaque throughout (test by cutting one roll at the center) and just begins to flake, 4 to 5 minutes, or up to 6 minutes if the rolls have been refrigerated.  Rotate the dish a quarter turn halfway through cooking.  Let the fish stand, covered, 5 minutes before serving. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This quick and easy recipe is for guests as well as family.  Choose fillets less than 1/2-inch thick so they are flexible enough for rolling and at least 1/4-inch thick so they can hold together after cooking.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  minced or pressed garlic
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2         pounds  catfish fillet about 1" thick
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Plain yogurt
                        Lemon wedges
                        Chopped cilantro/ basil or mint

Seafood Alternatives:  cod, orange roughy 

Adjust the oven rack to 3 to 4 inches below the broiling element.  In a small bowl combine the garlic, oil, cumin, cinnamon, allspice and salt.  Preheat the broiler. 

Rinse the fish and pat dry.  With a sharp knife, trim white or grayish fat from skin side and edges of each fillet.  Rub the top of fillets with the spice mixture, then arrange on a broiler pan. 

Broil the fish, without turning it, until opaque in the center, 10 to 12 minutes.  Serve with dollops of plain yogurt, wedges of lemon and chopped fresh cilantro, basil or mint, if you like. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Choose catfish fillets at least 3/4-inch thick (or other fish steaks or fillets 1 to 1 1/4 inches thick) so they'll be under the broiler long enough to cook the spices without over-cooking the fish.  Catfish is the perfect choice because it is best when thoroughy cooked, so benefits more from longer cooking than other fish. 

For truly Moroccan flare, serve with couscous made with chicken broth, raisins and cinnamon.

                              Mu Shu Salmon

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             small  or 8 large flour tortillas
  6                     dried shiitake mushrooms - (to 8)
     3/4         pound  salmon fillet
  1         tablespoon  reduced-sodium soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  Oriental sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3              large  eggs -- slightly beaten
  4                     green onions -- shredded
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  4               cups  shredded Napa cabbage
                        (abt half of a 2-lb cabbage)
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/4           cup  hoisin sauce/ duck sauce or
                        plum sauce - (to 1/3 cup)

Seafood Alternatives:  snapper, sea bass, swordfish, tuna, shrimp 

Soak the dried mushrooms in a bowl of hot water until tender, 15 to 30 minutes.  Drain and gently squeeze the mushrooms.  Discard the tough stems, then cut the caps in slivers.  Set aside in a large bowl. 

Remove the skin from the salmon.  With your fingers, feel for the tips of tiny bones; pull out with tweezers or needle-nose pliers.  Rinse the fish in cold water and pat dry.  Slice the salmon crosswise into strips 1/4-inch thick and set aside.  Combine the soy sauce and sesame oil in small bowl and set aside. 

Heat a wok or a large frying pan over high heat.  Add 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil and swirl to coat the sides of the wok.  When the oil is hot, add the eggs and cook until set, stirring constantly to break up the eggs, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to the bowl with the mushrooms. 

Add another 2 teaspoons of oil to the wok.  Add the salmon and stir gently until just opaque on the outside, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add to mushrooms. 

Scrape any cooked bits of fish from the wok and discard (drizzle a little water into pan to loosen cooked-on bits).  Turn the heat to medium and add the remaining tablespoon oil.  When the oil is hot, add the green onions, garlic and ginger and stir until fragrant and the onion is bright green, about 1 minute.  Add the cabbage and water and stir until cabbage wilts, 1 to 2 minutes.  Return the mushrooms, egg and salmon to the wok.  Pour in the soy mixture and toss the ingredients to thoroughly combine and heat through.  Taste the mixture for seasoning, adding more soy sauce or sesame oil to taste. 

To eat, spoon 1/2 to 1 teaspoon hoisin sauce down the center of a small tortilla (1 to 1 1/2 teaspoon for a large).  Spoon about 1/3 cup of the filling (1/2 cup for a large tortilla) over the sauce, then fold three sides of tortilla over the filling to enclose, leaving one end open. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Salmon's full flavor combines well with rich Asian ingredients -- hoisin sauce, sesame oil and shiitake mushrooms.  Fold the mixture into flour tortillas for a fun hands-on meal. 

Stack the tortillas and wrap in foil.  Just before serving, heat in a 350 degrees oven until hot, 15 minutes.

          Mussels With Root Vegetables, Thyme And Vermouth Cream

Recipe By     :Kathy Casey
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  matchstick-cut or small-diced parsnips
     1/4           cup  matchstick-cut or small-diced leeks
     1/4           cup  matchstick-cut or small-diced red onion
     1/4           cup  matchstick-cut or small-diced celery
  1 1/2         pounds  live blue mussels - (to 2 lbs) -- scrubbed, debearded
     1/3           cup  dry vermouth
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        Fennel sprigs or celery leaves -- for garnish
                        Lemon wedges -- (optional)

Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat, then add the vegetables.  Lightly saute, stirring, until they just begin to soften, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. 

Add the mussels.  Increase the heat to high, add the vermouth and bring to a boil.  Add the cream and thyme.  Cover and cook until the mussels open, 3 to 4 minutes; discard any mussels that do not open. 

Transfer the mussels, vegetables and broth to serving bowls, garnish with fennel sprigs and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing. 

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings. 

Comments:  Mussels have gained a lot of appreciation in recent years, and are no longer just "those blue things that grow on rocks and pilings."  Who'd have thought they'd be so delicious!  Like clams, mussels are commonly steamed with white wine, garlic and fresh herbs, but you'll love this variation with aromatic, earthy vegetables and a splash of vermouth. 

To make matchsticks, simply cut the vegetables first into thin (about 1/4 inch) lengthwise slices, then cut across the slices to make thin strips -- or matchsticks.  Cut the matchsticks into about 3-inch lengths.

          Open Faced Catfish Sandwich With JalapeÒo Tartar Sauce

Recipe By     :Susan Volland

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Sandwiches                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4       thick slices  sourdough bread
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine
  1                     garlic clove - (to 2)
  1                cup  buttermilk
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     catfish fillets - (abt 6 oz ea)
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil - (to 4 tbspns) -- for frying
  2               cups  arugula, escarole or other greens -- rinsed and dried
                        === JALAPE—O TARTAR SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced onion
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  prepared horseradish
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Prepare the tartar sauce by mixing all the ingredients together in a small bowl.  Refrigerate until needed. 

Toast the sourdough slices, spread lightly with butter and rub them with the whole garlic clove.  Cover to keep the toast warm. 

Put the buttermilk in a large, shallow bowl.  On a large plate, stir together the flour, cornmeal, cayenne, thyme, salt and pepper.  Dip each catfish fillet into the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off, then thoroughly coat in the flour mixture, patting to remove excess. 

Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy skillet.  Add the catfish fillets and cook over medium-high heat until well browned and just opaque through, about 3 minutes on each side. 

Arrange the garlic toast on individual plates and top the toast with the arugula leaves.  Set the catfish fillets on the greens and top with a dollop of jalapeÒo tartar sauce.  Serve right away. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Breaded and pan-fried is the classic way to prepare catfish.  This recipe does just that -- with a classic Southern buttermilk and cornmeal breading -- then tops off the fillet with a dollop of zippy jalapeÒo tartar sauce.  Served on a piece of garlic toast, its a meal-in-a-sandwich.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Put the buttermilk in a large, shallow bowl.  On a large plate, stir together the flour, cornmeal, cayenne, thyme, salt and pepper.  Dip each catfish fillet into the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off, then thoroughly coat in the flour mixture, patting to remove excess.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy skillet.  Add the catfish fillets and cook over medium-high heat until well browned and just opaque through, about 3 minutes on each side. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Arrange the garlic toast on individual plates and top the toast with the arugula leaves.  Set the catfish fillets on the greens and top with a dollop of jalapeÒo tartar sauce.  Serve right away. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Breaded and pan-fried is the classic way to prepare catfish.  This recipe does just that -- with a classic Southern buttermilk and cornmeal breading -- then tops off the fillet with a dollop of zippy jalapeÒo tartar sauce.  Served on a piece of garlic toast, its a meal-in-a-sandwich.

                                Orange Oil

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Juice of 4 oranges - (abt 2 cups)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  roasted peanut oil
                        (or use regular peanut oil)

Put the orange juice in a small pan over low heat and simmer to reduce to about 1/4 cup.  Strain the juice through a fine sieve and whisk in both oils.  Transfer to a small bowl and refrigerate until needed. 

This recipe yields about 1/2 cup. 

Comments:  This distinctive oil is one of the finishing touches to chef Fred Halpert's "Rock Shrimp Martini" (see recipe).  Reducing the orange juice slowly will concentrate and intensify the flavor.  The extra orange oil will keep for 2 weeks refrigerated; use it in salads or stir-fries.

                  Orzo With Spinach, Shrimp And Scallops

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  frozen spinach - (10 oz ea) -- thawed
  8             ounces  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  8             ounces  bay scallops
  1 1/2           cups  orzo pasta
  3        tablespoons  pine nuts
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
     3/4           cup  shredded Parmesan cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Drain the spinach in a colander and press it with the back of a spoon or squeeze it to remove liquid.  (You should have about 1 1/2 cups spinach.)  Set aside. 

Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Add the shrimp and scallops, cover and let sit off the heat until the seafood is opaque in the center, about 8 minutes.  With a slotted spoon, transfer the seafood to a bowl and cover to keep warm. 

Return the water to a boil and stir in the orzo with 1 teaspoon of salt, if desired.  Boil uncovered until tender, 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain.  Cover and set aside if not yet ready to use. 

Meanwhile, heat a large saucepan over medium heat.  Add the pine nuts and cook, stirring often, until golden, about 6 minutes.  Pour from the pan and set aside. 

Heat the oil in the pan, add the garlic and cook until tender, about 1 minute.  Add the spinach and orzo and stir until heated through.  Stir in the seafood, pine nuts and cheese.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Orzo, tiny rice-shaped pasta, is generally served as a side dish but by adding lots of spinach and a variety of seafood, you have a quick one-dish meal.

                      Pacific Steamed Whole Tilapia

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  tilapia - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- scaled and gutted
     1/4           cup  soy sauce, preferably reduced sodium
  3        tablespoons  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic -- or to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes -- or to taste
  2               cups  shredded Napa cabbage
  4                     green onions -- sliced
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds -- toasted

Seafood Alternatives:  trout, small rockfish, small striped bass 

Thoroughly rinse the fish inside and out and pat dry with paper towels.  Make 3 to 4 shallow slashes on each side of the fish. 

In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil, garlic and red pepper flakes.  Stir to mix well.  Drizzle about 1 tablespoon of the mixture over each side of the tilapia and use your hands to rub the sauce evenly over the fish and into the slashes. 

Add the cabbage and green onions to the remaining sauce and toss to coat.  Arrange the cabbage on a heat-proof plate that will fit inside your steamer and set the tilapia on the bed of cabbage.  Put the plate in the top portion of a steamer; if the fish is a little too large for the steamer, trim the tail. 

Bring about 3 inches of water to a boil in the bottom of the steamer.  When the water boils, set the steamer basket above and cover with the lid.  Steam until the cabbage is tender and the fish is just opaque through the thickest part, 15 to 20 minutes. 

Transfer the fish and cabbage to a serving platter, sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds over and serve. 

This recipe yields 2 servings. 

Comments:  About the best, and easiest, way to steam whole fish is in a bamboo steamer basket over a wok or deep skillet.  The steaming baskets are reasonably priced and often can be used with other pans you already have in your kitchen.  The standard-sized bamboo steamer will hold a fish up to about 2 pounds.  Some fish poachers can double as steamers for larger fish.

           Pan Fried Peppered Halibut With Pears And Watercress

Recipe By     :Betsy Kuhn
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  ripe pears -- cored, and
                        thinly sliced
  1              bunch  watercress - (abt 6 oz) -- rinsed, tough
                        stems removed
  4                     halibut fillet pieces - (6 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (to 2 tbspns)
  1                cup  pear juice or apple juice
  2          teaspoons  red or white wine vinegar

Seafood Alternatives:  grouper, Chilean sea bass 

Combine the pear slices and watercress in a large bowl.  Rinse the halibut, pat dry with paper towels and lay it on a plate, skin-side down.  Crush the peppercorns with a mortar and pestle.  Press the crushed pepper evenly onto the halibut. 

In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  When hot, add the halibut, skin-side up.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, turn the fish and continue cooking until the fish is just opaque in the center, 3 minutes longer.  (If the halibut is thick and not yet cooked through, lower the heat, cover the pan and continue cooking for a few minutes.)  Transfer the fish to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. 

Add the pear juice to the skillet, increase the heat to medium-high and cook until reduced by about half, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally and incorporating bits of fish and pepper from the bottom of the pan.  Turn off the heat and stir in the vinegar.  Pour the hot mixture over the pears and watercress and toss to evenly coat. 

Divide the pears and watercress among individual plates, set a piece of fish on top and drizzle the fish with the juices remaining in the bowl. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  The peppery tang of the watercress underscores the bite of the peppercorns, while the pears set it off with their mild sweetness.

(If the halibut is thick and not yet cooked through, lower the heat, cover the pan and continue cooking for a few minutes.)  Transfer the fish to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Add the pear juice to the skillet, increase the heat to medium-high and cook until reduced by about half, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally and incorporating bits of fish and pepper from the bottom of the pan.  Turn off the heat and stir in the vinegar.  Pour the hot mixture over the pears and watercress and toss to evenly coat. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Divide the pears and watercress among individual plates, set a piece of fish on top and drizzle the fish with the juices remaining in the bowl. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  The peppery tang of the watercress underscores the bite of the peppercorns, while the pears set it off with their mild sweetness.

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  sole fillets, about 1/4" thick
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  fine dry bread crumbs
                        (or use all-purpose flour)
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  1                     lemon
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

Seafood Alternatives:  flounder, catfish, tilapia, trout fillets 

Combine the crumbs and paprika in a shallow dish.  Dip the fillets into the crumb mixture and turn to thoroughly coat; shake off excess.  Squeeze the juice from half of the lemon (you should have about 2 tablespoons); cut the remaining lemon half into wedges. 

Heat the frying pan (preferably nonstick) over medium-high heat.  Add the oil and heat.  Lay the fish pieces in the pan without overlapping and cook until the edges turn opaque and the bottom is browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  Carefully turn the fish over and cook until the fish flakes in the center when gently prodded with the tip of a knife, 1 to 2 minutes more.  Transfer the fillets to plates and cover to keep warm. 

Add the lemon juice to the pan and scrape cooked bits from pan bottom; boil to thicken, about 30 seconds.  Pour the sauce over fish, garnish the plates with lemon wedges and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 2 servings. 

Comments:  Add asparagus, green beans or sugar snap peas and rice or pasta seasoned with butter and Parmesan cheese to make a well-rounded but simple meal.  Rinse the fish in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Cut the fillets in half if necessary so that they will fit in your frying pan.  Lightly season the fish with salt and pepper.

                Pan Fried Sole With Tomatoes And Pine Nuts

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
  1              whole  sole or small flounder (1 1/2 to 2 lbs)
                        (or 10 to 12 oz sole fillets)
     1/2           cup  flour -- seasoned with
                        Salt -- and also
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil - (to 3 tbspns)
  1                cup  diced tomato
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
     1/4           cup  white wine
                        (or freshly-squeezed lemon juice)
                        Parsley sprigs -- for garnish

Seafood Alternatives:  flounder, small trout 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Put the pine nuts in a shallow baking pan and toast in the oven until lightly browned and aromatic, 5 to 7 minutes.  Set aside to cool. 

Coat the sole with seasoned flour, patting to remove excess.  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet, add the sole and cook over medium heat until nicely browned, 3 to 4 minutes.  Carefully turn the fish and continue cooking until just opaque through, about 5 minutes longer.  (Less cooking time will be needed for fillets.)  Transfer the fish to a platter and cover to keep warm. 

Add the tomato, parsley and wine to the skillet and cook over medium-high heat until the sauce lightly thickens, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Pour the sauce over the sole, scatter the pine nuts on top and garnish with sprigs of parsley. 

This recipe yields 2 servings. 

Comments:  Whole sole, lightly floured and pan-fried with a squeeze of lemon, is one of the simplest and most delicious ways to prepare fish.  This recipe goes a couple steps further, with fresh tomato and a splash of white wine.

               Pan Fried Trout With Green Peppercorn Sauce

Recipe By     :Betsy Kuhn
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     trout - (8 to 12 oz ea) -- with or without
                        the heads or tails
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  flour -- more if needed
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  green peppercorns - (to 2 tbspns)
                        (in brine or freeze-dried and
                        reconstituted)

Seafood Alternatives:  rockfish, catfish fillet, cod 

Rinse the trout, pat dry with paper towels and lightly salt inside and out.  Put the flour on a plate and dredge the trout in it, patting to remove the excess. 

In a skillet large enough to hold the fish, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  When hot, add the trout and cook until nicely browned, 3 to 5 minutes, on one side.  Turn the fish and continue cooking intil the fish is just opaque through the thickest part, 3 to 5 minutes longer.  Transfer the fish to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. 

Drain excess oil from skillet and add the wine, lemon juice and peppercorns.  Stir with a fork or whisk, scraping up bits of the fish and floury residue.  Cook the sauce until slightly reduced, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Spoon the sauce over the fish and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 2 servings. 

Comments:  This dish comes together quickly but delivers a classic French bistro-type flavor.  Note that green peppercorns are milder than black or white, so don't be afraid to use them liberally.

             Pan-Roasted Sage-Tattooed Atlantic Salmon Fillet

Recipe By     :Chef Glenn Mayers, Glenn's Restaurant
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  Yukon gold potatoes
  4                     Atlantic salmon fillet pieces (6 oz ea)
  8                     fresh sage leaves
  2         tablespoon  canola oil - (to 3 tbspns)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  field greens or other tender lettuce
                        === ROASTED PEPPER-SAGE VINAIGRETTE ===
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh sage
     1/4           cup  roasted sweet red pepper
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh sage
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped garlic
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  brown sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  canola oil

To make the dressing:  Combine the vinaigrette ingredients (with exception of the oil) in a food processor.  Process to blend, then slowly add the oil in a steady stream while the blades are running, to emulsify the sauce.  Set aside. 

Cut the potatoes into 1/4-inch slices.  Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to a boil, add the potato slices and simmer just until soft, about 8 minutes.  Drain well, then return the potatoes to the warm pan and cover to keep warm. 

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and set the oven rack in the center. 

Press 2 sage leaves onto the flesh side of each salmon fillet.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Heat a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat.  Add the oil and heat until almost smoking.  Add the salmon fillets flesh-side down and sear for 2 minutes.  (If your skillet is not large enough to hold 4 fillet pieces comfortable, sear the salmon in 2 batches.) 

With all 4 fillet pieces in the skillet, flesh-side down, transfer it to the oven and continue cooking until the salmon is just opaque in the center, 3 to 6 minutes longer. 

Spoon some of the vinaigrette on individual warmed plates.  Place the field greens in the center of each plate and top with the salmon fillet.  Surround the salmon with potato coins and drizzle more vinaigrette over if desired. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;To make the dressing:  Combine the vinaigrette ingredients (with exception of the oil) in a food processor.  Process to blend, then slowly add the oil in a steady stream while the blades are running, to emulsify the sauce.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Cut the potatoes into 1/4-inch slices.  Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to a boil, add the potato slices and simmer just until soft, about 8 minutes.  Drain well, then return the potatoes to the warm pan and cover to keep warm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and set the oven rack in the center. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Press 2 sage leaves onto the flesh side of each salmon fillet.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Heat a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat.  Add the oil and heat until almost smoking.  Add the salmon fillets flesh-side down and sear for 2 minutes.  (If your skillet is not large enough to hold 4 fillet pieces comfortable, sear the salmon in 2 batches.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;With all 4 fillet pieces in the skillet, flesh-side down, transfer it to the oven and continue cooking until the salmon is just opaque in the center, 3 to 6 minutes longer. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Spoon some of the vinaigrette on individual warmed plates.  Place the field greens in the center of each plate and top with the salmon fillet.  Surround the salmon with potato coins and drizzle more vinaigrette over if desired.

                  Parmesan Fillet With Skinny Dill Sauce

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  low-fat plain yogurt
     1/4           cup  reduced-calorie mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  dill pickle relish
                        or finely-chopped dill pickle
  1           teaspoon  dried dillweed
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  yellow cornmeal
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
  1 1/3         pounds  white fish fillets -- cut 4 serving pieces

To make the dill sauce, combine the yogurt, mayonnaise, pickle relish and dill in a small bowl; mix well.  Set aside.  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. 

Combine the lemon juice and oil in a shallow dish.  Combine the cornmeal, Parmesan cheese, salt and paprika in another dish.  Dip the fish pieces in the lemon juice mixture to moisten, then into the cornmeal mixture to evenly coat. 

Put the fish on a slightly oiled baking pan and bake until the fish is just opaque through the thickest part, 6 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish.  Serve the fish with the dill sauce. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Instead of the typical deep-fried fish -- laden with calories and a mess to clean up -- these light, cornmeal-coated strips are baked quickly in a hot oven.

                  Pasta Salad NiÁoise With Broiled Tuna

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  fresh green beans -- trimmed
  12            ounces  tri-shaped pasta (mixture of penne,
                        rotini and shells) or any 1 shape
  10            ounces  tuna steak -- 3/4" thick
     1/2           cup  crumbled Feta cheese or grated
                        Parmasan cheese
     1/2           cup  slivered fresh basil leaves
     2/3           cup  thinly-sliced green onions
  12                    pitted Kalamata olives -- coarsely chopped
  12                    cherry tomatoes -- halved
                        === MUSTARD VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  Dijon-style mustard
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  honey
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Seafood Alternatives:  salmon, cooked shrimp, grilled scallops, smoked trout 

Combine all the vinaigrette ingredients in a small bowl and whisk well; pour all but 2 tablespoons into a large serving bowl and set aside. 

Preheat the broiler or grill.  Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pan.  Add the beans and boil 4 minutes.  Remove the beans with a slotted spoon and run under cold water to chill.  Cut the beans into 1-inch pieces and set aside. 

Bring the water back to a boil (add 1 teaspoon salt to water if desired), add the pasta and boil uncovered until tender, 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain; run under cold water until completely chilled.  Drain well. 

Brush the tuna with 1 tablespoon of the remaining vinaigrette.  Broil 1 to 2 inches from the heat for 3 minutes.  Turn and broil until the tuna is light pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes longer.  (Alternatively, grill 6 to 8 inches above hot coals, turning once, 2 to 3 minutes per side).  Set aside to cool. 

Add the pasta to the bowl with the vinaigrette.  Stir in the beans, cheese, basil, green onions and olives.  Slice the tuna into very thin strips and toss with the remaining tablespoon of vinaigrette.  Very gently stir the tuna into the salad, then spoon the salad onto a serving platter or individual plates.  Garnish with the cherry tomatoes. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Seafood in this salad can be either hot or chilled, so its a great way to use leftover seafood.  Why not plan to cook extra seafood one night, so that you can make this easy recipe next?

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  Emeril's Creole Seasoning
  4                     snapper fillets - (5 to 6 oz ea)
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  ground pecans
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  milk
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        === PECAN CRAB RELISH ===
  1                cup  lump crabmeat -- picked over for
                        shells and cartilage
     3/4           cup  pecan halves -- roasted
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  2        tablespoons  minced red bell peppers
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6                     turns freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
                        === CREOLE MEUNI»RE SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  white wine
  2                     lemons -- peel and pith cut
                        away, chopped
  1         tablespoon  garlic
  1         tablespoon  shallots
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
     1/2           cup  cream
     1/2           cup  butter
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce

For the Creole MeuniËre Sauce, combine the wine, lemons, garlic, shallots, salt and pepper in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and heat just to boiling.  Add the Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and cream and simmer for 3 minutes.  Take off the heat and slowly whisk in the butter until incorporated.  Strain the sauce and stir in the chopped parsley. 

To prepare the Pecan Crab Relish, combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and toss gently to keep from breaking up the crabmeat lumps.  Set aside until ready to serve. 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Sprinkle 3/4 teaspoon of the Creole seasoning over each fish fillet and pat it in with your hands. 

Combine 1 cup of the flour with 1 tablespoon Creole seasoning in a bowl and stir to mix.  In another bowl, combine the ground pecans, remaining 1 cup flour and remaining 1 tablespoon Creole seasoning; stir to mix.  In a third bowl, beat the eggs with the milk. 

Dredge the seasoned fillets first in the seasoned flour, then in the egg mixture and finally in the pecan/flour mixture.  Gently shake off the excess. 

Heat the oil in a large ovenproof skillet over high heat.  When the oil is hot and almost smoking, add the fish and sautÈ until golden, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side.  Turn the fish back onto the first side and place the skillet in the oven until the fish is brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. 

To serve, place a fillet on each individual dinner plate and top with 1/2 cup each of the pecan crab relish and the Creole meuniËre sauce. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Dredge the seasoned fillets first in the seasoned flour, then in the egg mixture and finally in the pecan/flour mixture.  Gently shake off the excess. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Heat the oil in a large ovenproof skillet over high heat.  When the oil is hot and almost smoking, add the fish and sautÈ until golden, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side.  Turn the fish back onto the first side and place the skillet in the oven until the fish is brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To serve, place a fillet on each individual dinner plate and top with 1/2 cup each of the pecan crab relish and the Creole meuniËre sauce.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  halibut fillet or steak 1" thick -- cut 4 serving pieces
  1                     lemon
  2             ounces  fresh herb sprigs (parsley, dill,
                        chives and/or chervil)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  black peppercorns
  1                     bay leaf

Seafood Alternatives:  snapper, grouper, tilapia 

Rinse the fish and pat dry.  Cut about 1 inch off the end of the lemon and reserve; squeeze the juice from the rest of the lemon.  Mince enough of the herb leaves to make about 1/3 cup; reserve the remaining sprigs. 

Put 2 to 3 inches of water in a broad, shallow pan.  Add the lemon piece, reserved herb sprigs, salt, peppercorns and bay leaf to the water and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, add the fish pieces and simmer until the fish is opaque through the thickest part (cut to test), 8 to 10 minutes for fish 1 inch thick.  Tranfer the fish to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. 

Ladle 1 cup of the poaching liquid into a small saucepan and boil over high heat until reduced by half, 1 to 2 minutes.  (Remaining cooking liquids can be frozen for up to 3 months.)  Stir in the lemon juice and chopped herbs and taste the sauce for seasoning, adding more salt or pepper to taste. 

Arrange the halibut on 4 plates, spoon the lemon herb sauce over and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  nonfat plain yogurt or sour cream
  1         tablespoon  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  Dijon-style mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  minced or grated fresh ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  honey or sugar
  1 1/2         pounds  salmon fillet
                        Minced fresh chives or parsley -- for garnish

Seafood Alternatives:  swordfish, trout fillets, cod, orange roughy 

In a small bowl combine the yogurt, mayonnaise, mustard, ginger and honey.  Set aside while the fish cooks. 

Rinse the salmon in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Cut the salmon into serving-size pieces.  Lay the fish in a single layer in a pan at least 2 inches deep.  Add cold water to just cover fish.  Lift out the fish and bring the water to a boil. 

Return the fish to the pan and reduce the heat to keep water just barely simmering (a bubble every 5 to 10 seconds).  Simmer until the fish is just slightly translucent in the center, about 8 minutes for fish 1 inch thick. 

Take the fish from the pan, let drain and pat dry gently with paper towels.  Set the fish on plates and spoon the sauce over the top.  Garnish with minced chives or parsley. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Poaching is so fast and simple you'll want to have side dishes ready to finish before dipping the salmon into the bubbling water.

          Poached Salmon With Old Fashioned Egg And Chive Sauce

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  white wine
  1                cup  water
  3                     garlic cloves -- halved
  3              large  shallots -- quartered
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1 1/2         pounds  salmon fillet -- skinned
  1                cup  heavy whipping cream not ultra-pasteurized
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  4                     hard-cooked eggs -- halved, yolks
                        and whites separated
  2        tablespoons  Dijon-mustard
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
     1/2           cup  minced chives

Seafood Alternatives:  trout 

For easy removal of poached salmon, place foil strips at right angles in a large shallow pan or poacher.  Add the wine, water, garlic, shallots, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to the pot and bring to a boil.  Boil, uncovered, for 5 minutes. 

Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently add the salmon skinned-side down over foil strips.  Press a separate piece of foil over and around fillet.  Cover the pot and simmer until the salmon is just opaque in the center, 6 to 8 minutes.  Lift the salmon with the foil strips, let drain and place in a serving dish. 

If cooking the salmon ahead, let it cool completely, wrap in plastic and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature before serving and drain any accumulated liquid. 

Boil the poaching liquid, uncovered, until reduced to 1 cup; strain.  There should then be about 3/4 cup liquid.  Slowly stir 1/4 cup of the cream and the cornstarch. 

Finely chop the egg white and reserve.  In a small bowl, mash the yolks, mustard and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a smooth paste; slowly stir in the cooking liquid and vinegar.  Return the liquid to the pot and place over medium heat.  Stir in the remaining cream and bring to a boil; stir in the cornstarch-cream mixture and boil, uncovered, for 1 minute, until slightly thickened.  Stir the egg whites into the sauce and remove from the heat. 

If cooking the sauce ahead, place plastic wrap against the top of the cooled sauce to prevent a skin forming.  Refrigerate. 

To serve, heat the sauce over medium heat until hot, stirring.  Don't worry if sauce appears to separate; as it gets hotter, it will become smooth. 

Add the chives just before serving, reserving some to sprinkle over salmon.  Spoon some sauce over the salmon and sprinkle with reserved chives.  Pass remaining sauce separately. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  Pale pink salmon makes a colorful backdrop for this chunky egg and chive sauce.

                 Poisson Cru - {Tahitian Raw Fish Salad}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Salads/Dressings
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  yellowfin tuna
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/3           cup  coconut milk
  1              large  pinch salt
     1/2           cup  shredded or grated carrot
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced cucumber
  1              large  or 2 small vine-ripe tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
     1/2         bunch  green onions -- trimmed and sliced
  2        tablespoons  minced chives or parsley
  2          teaspoons  grated lime zest

Seafood Alternatives:  halibut, snapper 

Cut the tuna into 1/2-inch thick strips about 2 inches long. 

In a large, non-reactive bowl (such as glass), combine the lime juice, coconut milk and salt and stir to mix.  Add the tuna, carrot, cucumber, tomato, green onions, chives and lime zest.  Stir to mix and taste for seasoning.  Serve right away. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Like many traditional ethnic preparations, poisson cru is not so much a recipe as a style of preparation.  It is a no-frills, beach-side style of recipe that takes advantage of just-caught, just-picked, ingredients: fish, a squeeze of lime juice, crisp vegetables.  But with top quality ingredients enjoyed at their peak, a casual recipe like this can be a ticket to the tropics. 

Always start with the best fish available-often tuna, but it could also be halibut or rockfish-and add fresh and colorful vegetables and herbs.  The Tahitian addition of coconut milk is a distinctive touch that separates it from other raw fish dishes such as Hawaii's poke and the Latin American ceviche. 

Unlike a ceviche that sits long enough for the citrus juice to penetrate the fish and "cook" it through, poisson cru is assembled quickly and enjoyed right away.  The lime juice will turn the surface of the fish an opaque color, but the inside will remain raw. 

Feel free to alter this recipe for your own tastes and ingredients that are at their bests.  If red and yellow tomatoes are available, for example, use some of each in this recipe.  Other herbs, red onions, slivered lettuces, diced bell peppers and minced hot chiles are a few other ideas for additions or alterations. 

Sometimes a pinch of sugar is added to poisson cru to enhance the sweetness of the dish, but this can be done to taste.  The recipe we suggest here does not include sugar.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;In a large, non-reactive bowl (such as glass), combine the lime juice, coconut milk and salt and stir to mix.  Add the tuna, carrot, cucumber, tomato, green onions, chives and lime zest.  Stir to mix and taste for seasoning.  Serve right away. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Like many traditional ethnic preparations, poisson cru is not so much a recipe as a style of preparation.  It is a no-frills, beach-side style of recipe that takes advantage of just-caught, just-picked, ingredients: fish, a squeeze of lime juice, crisp vegetables.  But with top quality ingredients enjoyed at their peak, a casual recipe like this can be a ticket to the tropics. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Always start with the best fish available-often tuna, but it could also be halibut or rockfish-and add fresh and colorful vegetables and herbs.  The Tahitian addition of coconut milk is a distinctive touch that separates it from other raw fish dishes such as Hawaii&apos;s poke and the Latin American ceviche. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Unlike a ceviche that sits long enough for the citrus juice to penetrate the fish and &quot;cook&quot; it through, poisson cru is assembled quickly and enjoyed right away.  The lime juice will turn the surface of the fish an opaque color, but the inside will remain raw. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Feel free to alter this recipe for your own tastes and ingredients that are at their bests.  If red and yellow tomatoes are available, for example, use some of each in this recipe.  Other herbs, red onions, slivered lettuces, diced bell peppers and minced hot chiles are a few other ideas for additions or alterations. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Sometimes a pinch of sugar is added to poisson cru to enhance the sweetness of the dish, but this can be done to taste.  The recipe we suggest here does not include sugar.

Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  asparagus spears
     1/4         pound  snow peas or green peas
  2              small  carrots -- sliced
  3               cups  cooked long-grain rice
  1             medium  ripe tomato or 2 plum tomatoes -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley
     1/2         pound  crabmeat - (to 3/4 lb)
                        Fresh herb sprigs -- for garnish
                        (thyme, chives, parsley, basil)

Seafood Alternatives: tiny cooked shrimp, surimi crab, cooked salmon 

In a small bowl, combine the dressing ingredients, whisk to mix and taste for seasoning; set aside. 

Bring a small pan of water to a boil.  Trim the asparagus spears and cut them into 2-inch lengths.  Trim the snow peas.  When the water boils, add the asparagus, return the water to a boil and cook for about 1 minute.  Scoop out the asparagus with a slotted spoon and submerge in a bowl of ice water. 

Repeat with the peas and carrots, cooking each until just tender but still crunchy, about 30 seconds for peas, 1 1/2 minutes for carrots. 

Drain the cooled vegetables well and put them in a large bowl with the rice, tomato, parsley and crab.  Pour the dressing over and stir gently to mix.  Transfer to individual plates and garnish with herb sprigs. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  Rice, whether left over or freshly cooked, is an ideal base for a variety of salads.  Here flaked crab is added with fresh spring vegetables for a beautiful and tasty treatment.

                        Steamed Clams And Mussels

Recipe By     :Kathy Casey
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  small live hardshell clams -- scrubbed
                        (such as cherry stones or Manila)
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2           cup  clam juice
  2        tablespoons  minced or pressed garlic
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh basil
                        (or 1/2 tspn dry basil)
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh dill
                        (or 1/4 tspn dry dill weed)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
                        (or 1/4 tspn dry thyme)
  1              pound  small live blue mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
  1              small  tomato -- diced
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Lemon wedges
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley
                        or other fresh herbs

Place the clams, butter, wine, lemon juice, clam juice, garlic and herbs in a large deep pot.  Bring to a boil over high heat, uncovered.  As soon as it comes to a boil, add the mussels and cover the pot. 

Boil until the mussels and clams are open, 3 to 4 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally; discard any clams or mussels that do not open.  Remove from the heat and toss in the diced tomato. 

Divide the shellfish and broth into serving bowl(s) and garnish with chopped herbs and lemon wedges. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Mussels and clams are popular because they are fast, fast, fast to cook.  They need steaming only until their shells pop open and the meat is plumped.  If overcooked, they will be tough.  There's nothing better than sticking a big hunk of crusty French bread into that rich and garlicky broth to soak up all that goodness.  Be sure to put out plenty of bowls for collecting the empty shells.

                   Steamed Fish With Celery And Orange

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  white fish fillets, 3/4" to 1" thick
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced celery
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  4        thin slices  orange

Rinse the fish fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Arrange the fillets in an even layer on a heatproof plate or platter that will fit inside the steamer.  Season the fish lightly with salt and pepper.  Scatter the sliced celery evenly over the fish and spoon the orange juice over.  Top with the orange slices. 

Bring about 2 inches of water to a rolling boil in the broad, shallow pan you will be using for steaming.  Set the plate of fish on the steamer rack, put the rack over the boiling water and cover tightly with the lid.  Steam the fish until it is opaque through to the center of the thickest part 6 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillet. 

Take care when removing the lid from the steamer, as the steam is very hot.  Tip the lid away from you to let the first billow of steam escape before removing the lid completely.  Using a slotted spatula, transfer the steamed fish and celery to individual plates and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Using a slotted spatula, transfer the steamed fish and celery to individual plates and serve immediately.

                    Steamed Ginger Fish With Mushrooms

Recipe By     :Susan Fuller Slack, CCP
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3         pound  mixed fresh mushrooms - (oyster
                        mushrooms, shiitakes, straw mushrooms,
                        common white mushrooms)
  2             pounds  skinless red snapper fillets
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  Oriental sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  Oriental chili paste
  1           teaspoon  rice vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  3                     green onions -- smashed and slivered
  3                     quarter-size ginger slices -- peeled, and
                        cut in very thin strips
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1         tablespoon  minced lemongrass - (abt 1 stalk)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        Fresh cilantro sprigs
  1                     lime -- thinly sliced

Seafood Alternatives:  rockfish, flounder 

If necessary, quickly rinse the mushrooms in cold water and dry well.  Thinly slice the mushrooms and set aside. 

Rinse the fish well under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Score lightly 3 to 4 times on each side with shallow diagonal cuts.  Put the fish on a heatproof platter or plate. 

In a small bowl, combine the wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, chili paste, rice vinegar and sugar.  Pour the mixture over the fish.  Scatter the green onion, ginger, garlic and lemongrass over the fish. 

In a wok or deep pot, bring 6 cups of water to a boil.  Put the platter of fish on a steamer tray, cover and place over boiling water.  Steam until flesh is firm and white at the base of the cuts, 12 to 15 minutes. 

Just before the fish is done, heat the oil in a medium skillet over high heat.  Stir-fry the mushrooms for 30 seconds.  Lift the covered steamer rack off the wok and remove the platter.  Garnish the fish with mushrooms, cilantro sprigs and lime slices. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  The "Garden Isle" of Singapore is an exotic land of enchantment.  For the food-oriented, Singapore is a culinary fantasy where eating seems to be the national pastime.  From the "wok and roll" food stalls in hawker centers to the world-class restaurants in luxury hotels, Singapore serves up the most fabulous seafood feast in the East! 

This steamed fish is reminiscent of elegant Nonya cooking, the cuisine of the Straits Chinese.  Nonya cooking is an innovative blending of Chinese techniques and Malay spicing.

       Steamed Mussels, Potatoes, Rosemary, Roasted Garlic Sabayon

Recipe By     :Chef Jerry Traunfeld, The Herbfarm
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  small new red potatoes
  1         tablespoon  white vinegar
  2             pounds  mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
     1/2           cup  white wine -- more if needed
  4                     fresh rosemary sprigs - (3" long)
  5                     egg yolks
  1 1/2    tablespoons  roasted garlic paste
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Juice of 1 lemon
                        Rosemary sprigs and blossoms if available -- for garnish

Seafood Alternatives:  clams 

Wash the potatoes and cut them in half if they are larger than a walnut.  Fill a large pot with cool salted water and add the potatoes and vinegar.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to a low boil and continue to cook until tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain and keep the potatoes warm. 

Put the mussels, wine and rosemary in a large pan and cover tightly.  Set the pan over high heat and steam just until the mussels open, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer the mussels to a large bowl and cover to keep warm; discard any mussels that do not open. 

Pour the mussel nectar from the pan through a fine sieve; discard the rosemary sprigs.  Also strain any mussel nectar that has collected in the bottom of the bowl.  Measure 1 1/2 cups of nectar, adding white wine if there is not enough nectar. 

Combine the egg yolks, roasted garlic paste, salt and pepper in a medium stainless steel bowl and whisk until smooth.  Add the measured mussel nectar with the lemon juice.  Set the bowl on top of a saucepan of boiling water (the water should not touch the bottom of the bowl).  Whisk vigorously until the sabayon is frothy and thickened and there is no trace of liquid at the bottom of the bowl, about 3 to 5 minutes.  (It should register 160 degrees on an instant-read thermometer.) 

Put the potatoes in the middle of four large, shallow soup plates.  Arrange the mussels, hinge-down, in a circle around the potatoes.  Spoon the sabayon over the mussels and potatoes.  Sprinkle with rosemary blossoms, if available, and serve immediately. 

CHEF'S NOTE:  To make garlic paste, bake whole heads of garlic (wrapped in foil) at 400 degrees for 45 minutes.  Let cool slightly, then separate the cloves, squeeze out the tender garlic and mash it with a fork in a small bowl.  One large head of garlic will roughly yield the 1 1/2 tablespoons needed in this recipe. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This is a good year-round recipe, thanks to mussel farms that provide us with fresh mussels throughout the year.  And the starring herb, rosemary, is a hardy perennial that is also consistently available.  In place of the rosemary blossoms, which appear in early spring, you can garnish this dish with other edible flowers or simply garnish with sprigs of rosemary. 

A fresh garden salad and crusty bread are ideal partners to this rich-tasting supper dish.  You can also serve this as an appetizer, omitting the red potatoes.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  sliced water chestnuts -- slivered
  3        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  3        tablespoons  minced green onions or chives

  1         tablespoon  finely minced or grated ginger
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame oil

     1/2         pound  cooked salmon
  20                    rice paper rounds - (7" dia)
  20             small  lettuce leaves
                        (or 10 large leaves, halved)
  3        tablespoons  toasted sesame seeds -- (optional)
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  reduced-sodium soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced green onion or cilantro
  1         tablespoon  mirin (sweet rice cooking wine)
  1           teaspoon  minced or grated ginger

Seafood Alternatives:  cooked shrimp, crabmeat 

To make the dipping sauce, combine all the ingredients in a small bowl.  Set aside. 

In a medium bowl, combine the water chestnuts, vinegar, onion, cilantro, ginger, sesame oil and garlic.  Break the salmon into flakes, discarding any skin or bone, and gently stir it into the water chestnut mixture.

Spoon a generous tablespoon of the filling in the center of each paper and fold all four sides over the filling.  Repeat with the remaining filling and rice paper. 

Lay a single layer of the packets, seam-side down, on an oiled steaming rack.  Steam, covered, over boiling water until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Serve warm or tepid. 

To eat, roll each packet in a lettuce leaf, then dip it in sauce and sesame seeds. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  These packets are easy to make and cook in 3 minutes.  Serve as an appetizer or light entree.

  2                     garlic cloves - (to 3) -- minced or pressed
     1/4           cup  minced green onion
  1              large  green bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut in 1/2" strips
  1              large  red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut in 1/2" strips
     1/8      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce, preferably reduced-sodium
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil

Seafood Alternatives:  shrimp, squid rings 

If using large sea scallops, halve or quarter them.  Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat, add 2 teaspoons of the oil and turn the pan to coat the sides.  Allow the oil to heat briefly, then add the garlic and green onion and cook, stirring, until fragrant and very lightly colored, about 30 seconds. 

Add the bell pepper strips and continue stir-frying until they begin to soften but are not limp, 2 to 3 minutes.  Transfer the vegetables to a bowl and set aside. 

Heat another teaspoon of oil in the pan.  Add half the scallops and cook, stirring, until lightly browned and opaque in the center, 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer the scallops to the bowl with the bell peppers, heat the remaining oil and cook the remaining scallops. 

Return the vegetables and scallops to the pan and add the dried red pepper flakes, if using, with the soy sauce and sesame oil.  Stir just to thoroughly mix and coat, then transfer the stir-fry to individual plates and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Here soy sauce and sesame oil finish the stir-fry, but you could instead use a favorite teriyaki sauce or other stir-fry sauce.  White or brown rice is the perfect accompaniment.

            Sunshine Shrimp With Spicy Chipotle Cocktail Sauce

Recipe By     :Kathy Casey
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHIPOTLE COCKTAIL SAUCE ===
  1             bottle  chili sauce - (12 fl oz)
  1         tablespoon  very finely-minced canned chipotle
                        chiles in sauce
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  1           teaspoon  finely-minced or grated lime zest
  1           teaspoon  finely-minced or grated orange zest
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        === SHRIMP ===
  1 1/2         pounds  large in-shell shrimp
  1 1/2           cups  orange juice
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-squeezed lime or lemon juice
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  3                     leaves 22k gold and/or fine silver -- (optional)
                        Lime wedges -- for garnish

To make the cocktail sauce, combine all the ingredients and mix well.  Refrigerate until needed.  The sauce can be prepared up to 5 days in advance.  (Note:  To store remaining chipotle chiles, purÈe in a blender and refrigerate or freeze; use in barbecue sauce or to make spicy ketchup.) 

Peel and devein the shrimp, reserving the shells.  Combine the orange juice, lime juice, zests, cumin, salt, cinnamon, cayenne and the shrimp shells in a medium saucepan.  Bring the mixture to a rapid boil over high heat.  Stir in the shrimp, cover tightly and cook for 1 minute.  Remove the lid, stir well and immediately replace the cover.  Cook 30 seconds longer. 

Remove the pan from the heat, stir the shrimp again and let cool 30 minutes in the cooking liquid, uncovered; the shrimp should be just cooked through when cooled.  Chill the shrimp in the liquid, covered.  (The shrimp can be prepared 2 to 3 days in advance.) 

Toss the shrimp in the liquid, then use a slotted spoon to scoop the shrimp onto a serving platter or over ice, discarding the remaining liquid and shells.  Press small pieces of gold or silver onto the shrimp, if desired, and serve with the chilled chipotle cocktail sauce and lime wedges alongside. 

Note:  If you are multiplying the recipe for a large party, do not cook more than 5 pounds of shrimp in a batch.  Cooking time may need to be adjusted for large batches. 

This recipe yields 8 to 12 servings. 

Comments:  This makes bountiful, fun party food.  The shrimp acquire hints of citrus and spice flavors from the poaching liquid, but take care not to overcook them.  The cocktail sauce gets its spicy kick from chipotle pepper, now widely available in supermarkets.  Serve the shrimp very cold or on ice. 

For a glittering, festive presentation, press small pieces of edible gold (22k or above) or fine silver foil leaf onto the shrimp.  Both are available in art supply stores and are fully safe to eat.  A touch of glittering gold can be added to the shrimp for about 25 cents per serving.

                           Swordfish Au Poivre

Recipe By     :Betsy Kuhn
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     swordfish steaks, 1" thick -- (6 to 8 oz ea)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  whole white peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt (fine or coarse) -- to taste

Seafood Alternatives:  tuna 

Rinse the fish under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  With a mortar and pestle, crack the peppercorns until they are a coarsely and finely cracked mixture.  Evenly coat both sides of the swordfish steaks with the crushed peppercorns. 

Heat the olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium high heat.  Add the fish and immediately reduce the heat to medium.  Season to taste with salt.  Cook for 5 minutes, then turn and cook on the other side until the center of the fish is just opaque, 4 to 5 minutes longer. 

This recipe yields 2 servings. 

Comments:  Pepper, the "master spice," struts its pungent stuff in this simple dish.  This recipe uses white pepper for a sharper bite, but black peppercorns can be used instead. 

If you don't have a mortar and pestle, pour the peppercorns into a plastic bag, then slip the plastic bag into a paper bag.  Place the bag on a hard surface and use a heavy skillet, a sturdy rolling pin or a heavy can to crush the peppercorns.

     1/2           cup  white wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  dry sherry
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8                     quarter-size slices ginger
  1         tablespoon  allspice berries
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme
                        (or 1 tspn dry thyme)
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh chile pepper -- (to 1 1/2 tspns)
                        (or 1/2 to 1 tspn dried red pepper flakes)
  12                    queen-size Spanish olives -- sliced
                        (or other large green olives)
     1/2           cup  flour
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- peeled, halved
                        lengthwise, very thinly sliced crosswise
  1         tablespoon  minced or pressed garlic

Seafood Alternatives:  mackerel, mahi-mahi, tuna, snapper, grouper 

Rinse the swordfish with cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Set aside. 

Cut the bell peppers in half lengthwise; remove the stem and seeds.  Set the peppers cut-side up and slice crosswise very thinly.  Peel four thin strips of skin from the cucumber using a vegetable peeler or channel cutter; remove and discard the seeds. Cut the cucumber on the diagonal into 1/8-inch-thick slices. 

In a small glass bowl, combine the vinegar, sherry, 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, ginger, allspice, thyme, chiles and olives.  Mix the flour and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper on a dinner plate. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium heat. 

Just before cooking, lightly coat the swordfish on both sides with the seasoned flour, patting to remove excess.  Saute until golden brown, 4 minutes, shaking the pan to prevent sticking.  Turn and continue cooking until barely opaque, 2 minutes longer; the hot vinaigrette will finish cooking the fish.  Place the swordfish in a shallow serving dish.  If your frying pan is small, cook the swordfish in two batches.  Scrape the pan and wipe dry with paper towels. 

In the same frying pan, heat the remaining teaspoon oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and saute, partly covered, until lightly colored and softened, about 3 minutes, stirring.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, pour the vinegar mixture over the vegetables, cover and cook until softened, about 5 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally.  Pour the marinade and vegetables over the fish and cover; refrigerate overnight. 

Serve at room temperature or warmed; discard the ginger before serving and remind guests that allspice berries are too tart to eat. 

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings. 

Comments:  Swordfish pickled with peppers and onions makes a great do-ahead first course or buffet dish.  Derived from the Spanish "Pescado en Escabeche," sauteed seafood smothered in a pickled marinade is popular in the Dominican Republic and throughout the Caribbean. 

Tasting aromatic Carribean spices such as allspice in a tart, savory dish rather than in a dessert may surprise your guests, so serve small portions to start.  Crusty bread and boiled potatoes tossed with parsley are tasty accompaniments.

                  Swordfish Salad And Pesto Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Salads/Dressings
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  romaine -- rinsed, and torn
                        into bite-size pieces
     3/4         pound  cucumbers
  1                can  hearts of palm - (14 oz) -- drained
  16                    cherry tomatoes -- quartered
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1              pound  skin-on swordfish steak
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  pesto - (abt one 7-oz container)
     1/4           cup  raspberry vinegar or red wine vinegar

Seafood Alternatives:  shrimp, sea bass, tuna, cod 

Place the romaine in a large bowl.  Peel the cucumbers, leaving four thin lengthwise strips of skin.  Halve the cucumber length-wise, scoop out and discard the seeds; slice on the diagonal into half-moons.  Slice the hearts of palm on the diagonal into 1/4-inch-thick ovals.  Add the cucumber, hearts of palm, tomatoes and shallots to the romaine and toss. 

Rub both sides of the swordfish with oil and season each side with salt and pepper.  Grill or broil the swordfish until it is just opaque through, 8 to 10 minutes per inch thickness.  Remove the swordfish from the heat and let stand 1 to 2 minutes to cool slightly. 

In a small bowl, combine the pesto and vinegar, stir to mix and set aside.  Discard the swordfish skin and cut or break the fish into 3/4-inch chunks.  Add the swordfish to the salad and spoon the pesto vinaigrette over.  Gently toss and taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  A refreshing, satisfying salad for balmy summer evenings.  Grill corn on the cob while youre grilling the swordfish and dinners ready!

                  Tacos With Fresh Tuna And Black Beans

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  tuna loin or steaks, 1" thick
  4          teaspoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  minced cilantro
  8                     fresh tomatillos - (to 9)
  4                     green onions -- minced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
     3/4           cup  finely-diced red bell pepper
  2                     fresh or pickled jalapeÒo chiles -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced - (2 to 4)
  1                can  black beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  8                     crisp taco shells -- warmed
  1                cup  plain nonfat yogurt or reduced-calorie
                        sour cream -- for garnish

Seafood Alternatives:  swordfish, monkfish, catfish, cod, shrimp 

Rub both sides of the tuna steaks with 2 teaspoons of the olive oil and sprinkle with chili powder.  Sprinkle lightly with salt just before cooking.  Grill over hot coals, or broil about 2 inches from heat, turning once, until the fish is just barely opaque in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Break the tuna into flakes and toss with half the cilantro; cover and keep warm. 

Discard the husks from the tomatillos, wash them and cut into 1/2-inch dice. 

In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan, heat the remaining 2 teaspoons oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and garlic and stir until softened, about 4 minutes.  Increase the heat to medium-high.  Add the tomatillos and red pepper and stir until warm, about 2 minutes more. 

Add the jalapeÒos, beans, lime juice and remaining cilantro; stir until warmed, about 2 minutes.  (Do not overcook or the tomatillos will become soupy.)  Add salt to taste. 

Place the tomatillo mixture into a shallow serving dish and sprinkle with the tuna.  Let each diner spoon the filling into their taco shells, passing the yogurt around separately to add to taste. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Teenagers love these hearty tacos for supper -- and the filling reheats well for a quick snack.  Tart-tasting tomatillos from Mexico look like small green tomatoes wrapped in crackling, papery husks.  Use tomatoes if tomatillos are hard to find.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  1             medium  zucchini -- sliced

Seafood Alternatives:  cod, flounder 

Rinse the halibut with cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Set aside. 

In a small bowl, combine the mushrooms, chopped tarragon (or half the dried tarragon), lemon juice, salt and pepper; stir to coat the mushrooms.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 

Fold a 15- by 13-inch piece of parchment paper in half crosswise to make a rectangle 13 inches by 7 1/2 inches.  Draw a half-heart, beginning and ending at the folded edge, and cut along the line.  Open the paper and brush one half with some of the melted butter, leaving a 1-inch border unbuttered.  Repeat with another sheet of parchment. 

Arrange the mushroom mixture over the buttered portion and set a halibut steak on each.  Season the halibut with salt and pepper and arrange the zucchini slices, slightly overlapping, lengthwise along the center of the fish.  Top with the reserved tarragon sprig tops (or sprinkle with the remaining dried tarragon). 

Fold the other half of the paper over the fish.  Beginning at the top of the heart (the wide end), make small overlapping folds in the paper at about 1-inch intervals, following the curve around to the base of the heart.  At the tail end, make a slight twist in the paper to seal.  Transfer the paper packages to a baking sheet.  (The halibut can be prepared to this point up to 2 hours in advance and refrigerated.) 

Bake the packages in the heated oven until puffed and lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.  Transfer to warmed dinner plates and serve immediately.  At the table, pinch the top of the package and rip open the paper, allowing the savory steam to escape before you begin. 

This recipe yields 2 servings. 

Comments:  The sweet herbal flavor of tarragon is delicious with halibut and makes for a truly wonderful aroma when these paper packages are opened at the table.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped dill pickle
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped onion
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh dill
                        (or 2 tspns dried dill)

Combine all the ingredients and stir to blend.  Refrigerate until needed. 

This recipe yields about 1 cup. 

Comments:  Any number of variations are possible on the tartar sauce theme.  If you like a more piquant flavor, add a dash of vinegar, Dijon mustard or even a bit of horseradish.  Starting with homemade mayonnaise raises good old tartar sauce to a higher plane.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  medium to large shrimp
     1/2         pound  firm white fish fillets,
                        such as halibut or cod
  4             ounces  fresh green beans or snow peas
  4             ounces  fresh shiitake or common mushrooms -- halved if large
  2               cups  broccoli florets - (abt 1 small head)
  1        small bunch  green onions or 1 medium onion -- halved, and
                        cut into 1/4" slices
  3              small  Japanese eggplants -- halved, or
                        quartered if large, cut 1/4" slices
  2             quarts  vegetable oil -- for frying
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- for dusting
                        === BATTER ===
  1                     egg yolk
  1                cup  ice-cold water
  1                cup  rice flour or all-purpose flour
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  mirin (a sweet rice wine) or sake
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  grated white radish (daikon)
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger -- (optional)

Combine the dipping sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. 

Peel and devein the shrimp, leaving the last bit of shell and tail attached.  Squeeze the tail to extract as much water as possible.  Cut the fish fillets into even 1-inch pieces.  Dry the shrimp and fish well on paper towels. 

Trim the ends from the beans or snow peas, cutting the green beans in half if long.  Cut the broccoli florets into even bite-size pieces and trim away any tough stalk.  Trim the green onions and cut them into about 2-inch lengths. 

Heat about 2 inches of oil to 375 degrees in a wok or deep-fryer.  While the oil is heating, put the flour in a shallow dish.  Combine the egg yolk, ice-cold water and rice flour in a medium bowl.  Stir to combine with chopsticks or a fork.  The batter should be thin enough to lightly coat the food; add a little more water if needed. 

Dust the shrimp, fish and vegetables lightly in flour, shaking to remove the excess.  Using the chopsticks or fork, dip the shrimp, fish and vegetables into the batter one at a time, allowing excess batter to drip off, and immerse in the hot fat.  (Fry 5 or 6 pieces at a time; do not crowd the pan.)  Fry, turning once or twice as they cook, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. 

Transfer to a draining rack or paper towels and keep warm in a low oven while you fry the remaining ingredients.  Serve immediately, with individual bowls of the dipping sauce for each diner. 

This recipe yields 6 servings. 

Comments:  Tempura is the ubiquitous Japanese fritter that everyone seems to love.  In a traditional setting, the wok might sit over a burner in the center of the dinner table, for diners to dip and fry their own ingredients.  Part of the beauty of tempura is its versatility, since a wide variety of vegetables can be dipped and fried with the same lacy results.  Rice flour is available in Asian markets and many large supermarkets.  One common eggplant can be used in place of smaller Japanese eggplants.

Categories    : Condiments                      Marinades

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  lemon juice
     1/3           cup  tequila
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh rosemary
  2        tablespoons  chopped basil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Blend all ingredients. 

This recipe yields about 1 cup. 

Comments:  The distinctive flavors of fresh rosemary and fresh basil tame the wild taste of tequila in this south-of-the-border approach to marinades.  We call it "pescadero borracho", or drunken fish!  Use it to souse shrimp, scallops or any fish but salmon.

  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     2/3           cup  slivered fresh basil leaves
     1/3           cup  slivered fresh mint leaves
  2                     green onions -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  Thai red curry paste - (to 1 tspn)
                        (or use Asian chili paste)
  1              pound  medium shrimp -- peeled and deveined
     1/2           cup  roasted peanuts
                        (or diced red bell pepper)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice

Seafood Alternatives:  scallops, tuna, crabmeat, lobster 

If using the coconut, scatter it in a pie tin or baking pan and bake in a 350 degree oven, stirring often, until golden, 6 to 8 minutes.  Pour into a small bowl and set aside. 

Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pan.  Stir in the pasta with 1 teaspoon of salt, if desired.  Boil uncovered until tender, about 12 minutes.  Drain. 

While the pasta cooks, combine the coconut milk, fish sauce, brown sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl; set aside.  In another bowl combine the basil, mint and green onions; set aside. 

Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat.  Add the ginger and curry paste and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the coconut milk mixture and bring to a boil.  Add the shrimp and peanuts and simmer until the shrimp is opaque in the center, about 3 minutes.  Set aside 3 tablespoons of the basil mixture; gently stir the rest into the sauce along with the lime juice. 

Put the pasta in a large serving bowl.  Pour the seafood and sauce over the pasta and gently toss to coat with sauce.  Sprinkle with the toasted coconut and reserved basil mixture and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Don't let a long list of ingredients intimidate you -- making this dish is quite simple and quick.  For a special meal, combine two seafoods such as salmon and shrimp.  An ideal accompaniment to this aromatic dish would be fresh mango or papaya slices squeezed with lime juice.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2        medium  yellow bell pepper -- cored, sliced
     1/2        medium  green bell pepper -- cored, sliced
     1/2        medium  red bell pepper -- cored, sliced
  1           teaspoon  cumin seed
                        (or 1/2 tspn ground cumin)
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1              pinch  ground cloves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              large  trout fillets - (abt 1 1/2 lbs total)

Heat half the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the garlic and sautÈ until soft and fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the bell peppers and sautÈ over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes.  Stir in the cumin, coriander, cloves, salt and pepper.  Transfer to a bowl and set aside. 

Add the remaining olive oil to the pan and fry the trout fillets skin-side down for 3 to 4 minutes.  Turn the fillets and spoon the bell pepper mixture over them.  Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until the trout is opaque through the thickest part, 6 to 8 minutes longer. 

Transfer the trout fillets and bell pepper garnish to warmed dinner plates and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Flavors from the Mediterranean coast -- olive oil, bell peppers, cumin and garlic -- are a delightful foil for the delicate flesh of trout.  If you like, you can replace the trio of bell peppers with a single large red, green or yellow bell pepper.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  tomatillos -- husks removed,
                        quartered
  1                     green bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut in chunks
  1                cup  cilantro leaves - (loosely packed)
  4                     green onions -- coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  pumpkin seeds or pine nuts -- toasted
  1                     serrano chiles - (to 2) -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1              pinch  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a food processor or blender, purÈe the tomatillos with the bell pepper, cilantro, green onions, pumpkin seeds and chiles until smooth.  If using a blender, you will need to purÈe the ingredients in 2 to 3 batches.  Pour the salsa into a bowl and stir in the cumin with salt and pepper to taste. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This smooth, versatile salsa packs a subtle punch from serrano chiles.  Pumpkin seeds contribute richness and body.  You can heat the salsa and gently simmer it with shrimp, scallops, or pieces of fish for a stewlike result.

                     Tomato And White Fish Bruschetta

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Fish (Ocean)
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  24            slices  crusty Italian or French bread -- (1/2"-thick)
                        (each about 2" by 4")
     1/4           cup  diced onion
     1/4           cup  diced red bell pepper
  2               cups  chopped -- peeled tomatoes
                        (fresh or canned and drained)
     1/3           cup  drained sliced ripe olives
  1              pound  cod or other mild white fish fillet -- skin and bones
                        removed, cut into 3/4" cubes
  2        tablespoons  minced flat-leaf parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh basil
                        (or 2 tspns dried basil)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  24                    parsley or basil leaves -- for garnish

Combine the garlic and olive oil in a small bowl.  Stir to mix and let stand 10 to 30 minutes.  Preheat the broiler. 

Put the bread slices on a broiler pan or baking sheet and broil about 4 inches from the heat until golden, 1 to 2 minutes.  Turn the bread and toast the second side.  (You may need to toast the bread in two batches.) 

Brush 1 side of each toast lightly with the garlic oil and reserve the remaining oil.  The toasts can be cooled, then stored airtight for up to 24 hours.  If desired, reheat the toasts for 1 to 2 minutes in a 400 degree oven before serving. 

Heat the remaining garlic oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat.  Add the onion and red pepper and sautÈ until soft, about 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and olives and cook, stirring for 2 minutes.  Add the cod and cook until the fish is opaque through, 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain off and discard excess liquid. 

Add the parsley and basil with salt and pepper to taste and transfer to a bowl.  The fish topping can be cooled, covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours at this point.  Reheat in a microwave oven or saucepan before assembling the bruschetta. 

To assemble the bruschetta, mound about 1 generous tablespoon of warm fish topping on each toasted bread slice.  Garnish with parsley or basil leaf. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  These Italian-inspired toasts make a great do-ahead first course -- tasty finger food to feed a crowd.

<DirS>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Combine the garlic and olive oil in a small bowl.  Stir to mix and let stand 10 to 30 minutes.  Preheat the broiler. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Put the bread slices on a broiler pan or baking sheet and broil about 4 inches from the heat until golden, 1 to 2 minutes.  Turn the bread and toast the second side.  (You may need to toast the bread in two batches.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Brush 1 side of each toast lightly with the garlic oil and reserve the remaining oil.  The toasts can be cooled, then stored airtight for up to 24 hours.  If desired, reheat the toasts for 1 to 2 minutes in a 400 degree oven before serving. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Heat the remaining garlic oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat.  Add the onion and red pepper and sautÈ until soft, about 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and olives and cook, stirring for 2 minutes.  Add the cod and cook until the fish is opaque through, 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain off and discard excess liquid. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Add the parsley and basil with salt and pepper to taste and transfer to a bowl.  The fish topping can be cooled, covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours at this point.  Reheat in a microwave oven or saucepan before assembling the bruschetta. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;To assemble the bruschetta, mound about 1 generous tablespoon of warm fish topping on each toasted bread slice.  Garnish with parsley or basil leaf. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 8 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  These Italian-inspired toasts make a great do-ahead first course -- tasty finger food to feed a crowd.

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  When vine-ripe tomatoes begin appearing, they add a special touch to this recipe, but canned tomatoes are fine during the rest of the year.

                       Triple Citrus Dilled Catfish

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  minced fresh dill
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  skinless catfish fillet
                        Thinly-sliced orange, grapefruit and lime -- for serving
                        Dill sprigs -- for serving

Seafood Alternatives:  halibut, mahi-mahi, sea bass 

Preheat the grill to high, or heat coals until they glow red, with white ash around the edges.  In a shallow dish, combine the citrus juices, olive oil, dill, salt and pepper. 

Rinse the catfish and pat dry.  With a sharp knife, trim the white or grayish fat from the skin side and edges of each fillet.  Add the catfish to the marinade, turning the fillets so they are evenly coated.  Let sit in the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes (do not marinate longer or acid from the juices will alter the texture of the fish). 

Rub a lightly oiled towel or cloth over the grill.  Take the catfish from the marinade, allowing excess to drip off, and put the fillets on the hot grill.  Cook until browned on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes, brush the top with more marinade, then turn the fillets. 

Continue cooking until the fish is opaque through the thickest part, 4 to 5 minutes longer, depending on the thickness of the fillet.  Transfer the fish to plates and garnish with slices of fruit and sprigs of dill. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Lemons are outstanding with seafood, but don't forget about the other citrus fruits.  The tangy-sweet combination of grapefruit, lime and orange, with a generous handful of fresh dill, makes a fabulous marinade for catfish.  If you have some extra-long sprigs of dill, use them here to baste the fish with marinade as it cooks.

                             Tropical Ceviche

Recipe By     :Kathy Casey
Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Fish (Ocean)
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  boneless skinless firm fish,
                        such as snapper, halibut, flounder
  1              pound  whole bay scallops
                        (or sea scallops, quartered)
  1              small  red onion -- halved crosswise,
                        and thinly sliced lengthwise
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped cilantro
  2               cups  diced mango or papaya or a mixture -- (abt 1/2" pieces)
  1 1/2           cups  diced fresh pineapple -- (abt 1/2" pieces)
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced or grated lime zest
  1                cup  rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes -- or more to taste
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  coriander seed -- crushed, or
                        coarsely ground in a mortar and pestle

Combine the marinade ingredients in a large glass or stainless steel mixing bowl.  Whisk together and set aside. 

Rinse the fish and scallops in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Add the scallops to the marinade and refrigerate.  Dice the fish into 1/2 inch pieces and add the marinade with the onions.  Gently stir, cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving.  Stir occcasionally to ensure that the marinade penetrates the seafood evenly.  The ceviche may be prepared to this point up to 2 days in advance. 

About 30 minutes before serving, stir in the cilantro and fruits and return the dish to the refrigerator until ready to serve.  Serve in small chilled bowls or plates, or for a more festive look, shot glasses or cocktail tumblers. 

This recipe yields 16 servings. 

Comments:  This colorful ceviche makes good use of the tropical fruits available in fall and winter.  Typically made with fresh-from-the-sea fish, it can also be done with high-quality frozen fish.  It's fun to present individual servings in shot glasses or small cocktail glasses.

                    Tropical Mahi-Mahi Salad In A Pita

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Sandwiches                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  honey mustard
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  plain yogurt
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1              pound  skin-on mahi-mahi fillet 3/4" thick
     3/4         pound  pickling-size cucumbers -- skin on,
                        washed, and dried
  2                     mangoes - (10 oz ea) -- 1/2" diced (2 cups)
  2               cups  very thinly-sliced radishes
  1                cup  minced cilantro or parsley
  4              large  pita breads -- halved and warmed
  2               cups  onion or spicy sprouts - (abt 3 oz)

Seafood Alternatives: salmon, snapper, grouper, sea bass, swordfish, tuna 

Preheat the broiler.  In a small bowl, mix the honey mustard, vinegar, yogurt, ginger and salt until smooth. 

Put the mahi-mahi skin-side down on broiler rack and spread 2 tablespoons of the mustard mixture on top; reserve the rest for dressing the salad. 

Broil the mahimahi 4 to 5 inches from the heat until the fish is just opaque through, 6 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness.  Remove from the oven and let stand while preparing the salad. 

Halve the small cucumbers lengthwise and slice crosswise 1/8-inch thick.  In a large bowl, toss the cucumbers, mangoes, radishes and cilantro.  Peel the skin from the mahi-mahi and break the flesh into chunks.  Add the mahi-mahi to the salad mixture, pour the reserved dressing on top and gently mix.  Taste and adjust seasonings. 

Half-fill each pita bread with sprouts and spoon in the mahi-mahi salad on top. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Messy but fun, these pita pockets are brimming with tangy onion sprouts and the tropical beat of mango, mahi-mahi, cilantro and ginger.  Add zest with habanero hot sauce, if you like.  Nectarines, papayas or peaches are a sweet substitute for mangoes. 

Take care when cooking mahi-mahi that it doesnt overcook and become dry.  In fact, this fish is also delicious cooked "medium," which retains all its moisture and flavor.  If the small cucumbers for pickling are not available, use one larger English cucumber, seeded and finely diced.

                 Trout And Prosciutto Wrapped In Lettuce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              whole  pan-dressed trout - (3/4 lb ea) -- head and tail
                        removed
  8              large  lettuce leaves -- more if needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Fresh thyme sprigs
  4        thin slices  prosciutto or other salted ham
                        Vegetable oil -- for fish and grill

Preheat the grill to high, or heat coals until they glow red, with white ash around the edges.  Rinse the trout and pat dry with paper towels. 

Lay 2 lettuce leaves on the work surface, slightly overlapping.  Lay a trout in the center and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper inside and out.  Top the fish with a few sprigs of thyme and lay a piece of prosciutto over them.  Fold the lettuce leaves over the fish and tie 2 or 3 strings around the fish to hold the lettuce secure.  Depending on the size of your lettuce leaves, you may need to use another one to enclose the fish.  Don't worry about small gaps or splits in the lettuce; just cover the fish as well as you can. 

Lightly brush the out side of the trout packets with oil and rub a lightly oiled towel or cloth over the grill.  Set the packages on the grill and cook until the lettuce is well browned, 5 to 7 minutes.  Turn and continue grilling until the outside is evenly browned and the fish is cooked through the thickest part (cut to test), about 7 minutes longer. 

Transfer to plates and allow your guests to open their own trout packets; discard the string and lettuce. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Wrapping fish in leaves before grilling not only helps hold the fish together as it cooks, but also keeps it succulent and moist.  You can use the less-than-perfect outer leaves from a couple of heads of lettuce, saving the tender inner leaves for a salad to serve alongside.  Use kitchen string to secure the lettuce leaves: soak about a dozen 8-inch lengths in water for 10 minutes first, to keep them from burning on the grill.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Salads/Dressings
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1           teaspoon  black peppercorns
  1                     bay leaf -- crushed
                        Salt -- to taste
  4                     trout fillets - (1 1/2 lbs total)
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
  1               head  romaine or red leaf lettuce -- washed, and
                        torn into bite-size pieces
  1              small  red onion -- sliced thin rings
  2        tablespoons  capers
                        === SUN-DRIED TOMATO DRESSING ===
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  minced sun-dried tomatoes
     1/2      teaspoon  Dijon mustard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  olive oil

Make the dressing:  In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice, sun-dried tomato, mustard, salt and pepper.  Whisk to mix until the salt has dissolved.  Slowly add the olive oil, whisking constantly so that the dressing thickens slightly.  Taste for seasoning and set aside. 

Pour about 1 1/2 inches of water in a large sautÈ or frying pan and add the wine, peppercorns, bay leaf and a 1 pinch of salt.  Bring to a boil and simmer 2 miutes.  Add the trout fillets and poach over medium heat until the trout is opaque through the thickest part, 5 to 7 minutes.  Drain the fillets on paper towels and set aside to cool. 

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Scatter the pine nuts in a cake pan and toast in the oven until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally so the nuts brown evenly.  Set aside. 

Whisk the salad dressing to mix and toss with the lettuce in a large bowl.  Taste the salad for seasoning and arrange on 4 chilled plates.  Discard the skin from the trout fillets, divide the trout into large pieces and arrange them over the greens.  Scatter the red onion rings, pine nuts and capers over the salad and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This recipe takes advantage of trouts versatility.  Poached fillets are paired with crisp greens, toasted pine nuts and a sun-dried tomato dressing.  Any of your favorite seasonal vegetables can be added.  Slivered almonds can take the place of nuts.

                       Trout Stuffed With Wild Rice

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  orange
     1/2           cup  wild rice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
  1                cup  finely-diced crustless day-old bread
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
  3        tablespoons  reduced-sodium chicken broth or water
  4              whole  cleaned trout - (abt 3/4 lb ea)

Finely grate 2 teaspoons of zest from the orange; cut the orange in half and squeeze the juice.  Add enough water to the orange juice to make 1 1/2 cups liquid. 

Bring the liquid to a boil with a 1 pinch of salt.  Stir in the wild rice, return to a boil, cover the pan and simmer over low heat until tender to the bite, about 40 minutes.  Carefully drain off any remaining liquid. 

Heat half the butter in a medium frying pan, add the onion and cook, stirring until soft, 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the bread and parsley, sautÈ for another 2 to 3 minutes, then remove from the heat.  Add the wild rice, orange zest, salt and pepper and enough chicken broth to moisten.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 

Rinse the trout and wipe dry with paper towels.  Sprinkle inside and out with salt and pepper.  Spoon one-quarter of the stuffing into each trout.  Lay the trout in a lightly buttered baking dish and brush the fish with the remaining butter. 

Bake in the oven until the fish is opaque through the thickest part (just behind the head), 18 to 20 minutes.  Transfer to warmed dinner plates and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Stuffed trout recipes may be a dime a dozen, but this one stands out from the crowd with nutty wild rice and zesty orange.  If you like, you can remove the trout heads and tails before stuffing.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Bake in the oven until the fish is opaque through the thickest part (just behind the head), 18 to 20 minutes.  Transfer to warmed dinner plates and serve immediately. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Stuffed trout recipes may be a dime a dozen, but this one stands out from the crowd with nutty wild rice and zesty orange.  If you like, you can remove the trout heads and tails before stuffing.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     pan-dressed trout - (abt 3/4 lb ea)
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  4             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  1                     lemon -- quartered

Preheat a charcoal grill until the coals glow red with white ash on the edges.  Rinse the trout inside and out; pat dry with paper towel. 

Using your fingers, rub the olive oil over the inside and outside surface of each fish.  Next, gently rub one quarter of the crushed garlic inside the body cavity of each trout, distributing the garlic throughout.  Place one sprig of rosemary inside each fish. 

Grill the fish until opaque through the thickest part (cut along back to test), 3 to 4 minutes per side.  Serve with lemon wedges.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     tuna steaks 3/4" to 1" thick -- (abt 6 oz ea)
  1                     lime
  2          teaspoons  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil - (to 2 tbspns)

Rinse the tuna steaks and pat dry with paper towels.  Grate the zest from the lime (you should have about 1 1/2 teaspoons), then squeeze the juice and set aside. 

In a small bowl, combine the lime zest, thyme, pepper and salt; stir to mix.  Lightly rub both sides of the tuna steaks with oil and set on a broiler pan.  Sprinkle the tops of the steaks evenly with about half of the lime zest mixture and let sit for 10 minutes. 

Preheat the broiler and set the rack 2 to 3 inches from the heat source.  For medium-done steaks, broil the tuna for 1 to 2 minutes, turn and sprinkle with the remaining lime zest mixture.  Continue broiling until just pink in the center (cut to test), 1 to 2 minutes longer.  For well-done steaks, broil about 3 minutes on each side.  Do not overcook the tuna or the meat will become dry and lose its flavor. 

Pour the lime juice over the tuna steaks right after you take them from the oven, then serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  You can use 1 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest and 2 tablespoon lemon juice in place of the lime if you like.
