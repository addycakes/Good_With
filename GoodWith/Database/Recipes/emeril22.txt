  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  unsalted butter - (3 sticks) -- at room temperature
  1                cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  6              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  3               cups  bleached all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  bleached all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  almond slices

Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle, on medium speed.  Scrape down the bowl as necessary.  Cream the mixture until it is smooth and fluffy. 
Add the egg yolks one at a time, mixing between each addition.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Beat for 1 minute and add the vanilla.  Add the flour and salt to the butter mixture and beat on low speed until it is fully incorporated. 
Increase the speed to medium and mix until the batter is thick and creamy, about 2 minutes.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle. 
Generously dust a large sheet of parchment or waxed paper with the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour.  Spoon the dough down the center of the paper, fold the paper tightly over the dough, and roll into a cylinder about 3 inches in diameter and 12 to 14 inches long.  Refrigerate for 8 hours. 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and peel away the paper.  Using a sharp knife, cut the dough crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Place them 2 inches apart on a baking sheet.  Generously sprinkle the top of each cookie with almonds, lightly pressing them into the dough. 
Bake until lightly golden, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool completely in the pan. 
This recipe yields 2 1/2 dozen cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PASTRY CREAM ===
  15             large  egg yolks
  2 1/4           cups  cornstarch
  10              cups  heavy cream
  6               cups  sugar
  3                     vanilla beans -- split and scraped
                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
  1                cup  milk
  8        tablespoons  butter -- plus
  8          teaspoons  butter
  32                    eggs
  8               cups  sugar -- plus
  8        tablespoons  sugar
  4               cups  flour
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
  4          teaspoons  salt
  4          teaspoons  vanilla
                        === TO FINISH ===
  6             pounds  bananas -- peeled, and
                        cut crosswise into 1/2" slices
  10                    egg whites
  1                cup  sugar

For the pastry:  In a large mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, 1 1/2 cups sugar, cornstarch and 4 cups of the heavy cream.  Whisk to blend.  Set aside. 
Combine the remaining 6 cups of cream, 4 1/2 cups of the sugar, and the vanilla in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.  Whisk to dissolve the sugar and bring to a gentle boil, about 10 minutes.  Slowly add the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly until it thickens, about 5 minutes.  Be forewarned: the mixture will break, don't be alarmed. 
Pour the mixture into a large bowl.  Press a piece of plastic wrap over the surface of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming.  Let cool completely at room temperature. 
When cooled, remove the vanilla bean and pour the mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer with a wire whip.  Beat at medium speed to combine the mixture.  If the mixture will not combine, warm another cup of heavy cream and slowly add it to the mixture.  Whip until you have a thick and creamy custard. 
For the cake:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a small saucepan, heat 1 cup of the milk and 8 tablespoons of the butter together.  Using an electric mixer with a wire whip, combine the 32 eggs and 8 cups of sugar together.  Beat on medium-high speed for about 8 minutes, or until the mixture is pale yellow, thick and has tripled in volume.  With the machine running, slowly add the heated milk. 
In a mixing bowl, sift 4 cups flour, 4 teaspoons baking powder and 4 teaspoons salt together.  Fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture and mix thoroughly so that there are no lumps and the mixture is smooth.  Fold in the vanilla. 
Grease 4 (1/2-sheet) pans with 8 teaspoons of the butter.  Sprinkle each with 2 tablespoons of sugar.  Pour the cake batter evenly into the pans and bake for about 25 minutes, or until the cakes spring back when touched.  Cool for about 2 minutes.  Using a thin knife, loosen the edges of the cakes, and then flip onto a wire rack. 
To assemble:  Spread 1/2 cup of the custard over one cake.  Arrange 1/3 of the banana slices, crowding them close together, over the custard.  Place a second cake on top of the bananas.  Next, spread 2 cups of the custard over the cake.  Arrange another third of the banana slices over the custard.  Top with another cake.  Spread another 2 cups of the custard over the cake.  Arrange the remaining third of bananas over the custard.  Top with the remaining cake.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 4 hours. 
To finish:  Whip the egg whites and sugar, in two batches, to stiff peaks.  Remove the cake from the refrigerator and discard the plastic wrap.  Spread the whipped egg whites evenly over the sides and top of the cake.  Using a small blowtorch, torch the sides and top of the cake evenly.  Slice the cake into individual servings. 
This recipe yields 20 to 25 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active yeast
  2                     teaspoons sugar
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
     1/4           cup  lard
  3               cups  flour - (to 4 cups)
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        Olive oil

In an electric mixing bowl, whisk the yeast, sugar, water and lard together to make a paste.  Add the flour and salt and mix, using a dough hook, until the dough comes away from the sides and crawls up the dough hook.  Remove the dough from the bowl.  Grease the bowl with olive oil and place the dough back in the bowl.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until double in size, about an hour. 
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and divide dough in half.  Roll the dough into balls, cover and let the dough rest for 15 to 20 minutes.  The dough is ready to be shaped. 
This recipe yields dough for 2 (12-inch) pizzas.

In an electric mixing bowl, whisk the yeast, sugar, water and lard together to make a paste.  Add the flour and salt and mix, using a dough hook, until the dough comes away from the sides and crawls up the dough hook.  Remove the dough from the bowl.  Grease the bowl with olive oil and place the dough back in the bowl.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until double in size, about an hour.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and divide dough in half.  Roll the dough into balls, cover and let the dough rest for 15 to 20 minutes.  The dough is ready to be shaped.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  flour
  4              large  eggs -- at room temperature
     1/4         pound  Gruyere cheese -- grated
     1/4         pound  Jambon de Bayonne -- finely chopped

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
In a large saucepan, combine the milk, butter, salt, and black pepper over medium-high heat.  Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat, add the flour, and with a wooden spoon, stir briskly for about 1 minute to incorporate.  Return to the heat and continue stirring for 1 minute, over medium-high heat. 
Remove from the heat and add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition.  Add the cheese and ham and beat until it is incorporated and a slightly soft dough forms.  Drop the dough by the spoonful onto the prepared baking sheet to form a ring (about 12 to 14 spoonfuls). 
Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve warm on a platter. 
This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              dozen  fresh mussels -- steamed, and
                        removed from the shell
                        Creole seasoning -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped onions
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/2         pound  shrimp shells
  3                     bay leaves
  3                     lemons -- peeled, sectioned
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2                     French bread loaves -- cut in half,

In a large saute pan, add the cream and all of the barbecue base.  Stir and simmer for 3 minutes.  Add the cooked mussels to the sauce.  Toss quickly. 
To serve, slice the French bread lengthwise and open.  Spoon the BBQ mussels into the bread.  Slice and serve.

                Salmon                          Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  kosher salt
  2               cups  Sweet Barbecue Sauce -- see * Note
  2             pounds  fresh skin-on salmon fillet -- pin bones removed,
                        and rinsed under cold water
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2         pound  ground fresh andouille sausage
                        or other smoked sausage
     1/2           cup  minced onions
  1              pound  Idaho potatoes -- peeled, diced small,
                        and cooked until tender
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions, green part only
  3                     hard-boiled eggs -- chopped
  16                    toasted cornbread crouton rounds

* Note:  See the "Sweet Barbecue Sauce" recipe which is included in this collection. 
In a mixing bowl, combine the salt and the Sweet Barbecue Sauce.  Place the salmon, skin-side down, on several large sheets of plastic wrap.  Cover the entire salmon with the curing mixture, packing the cure into the salmon.  Wrap the salmon completely and tightly in the plastic wrap and place the salmon, skin-side down on a 1/2 sheet pan.  Place something heavy like a skillet, weights, or a brick wrapped in plastic wrap on top of the salmon.  This will help infuse the salmon into the mixture.  Refrigerate the salmon for 24 hours. 
In a large saute pan, heat the oil.  Add the sausage and brown for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the onions.  Continue to cook for 1 minute.  Add the potatoes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Saute for 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the garlic, green onions and chopped egg.  Set aside and keep warm. 
Remove the salmon from the refrigerator and wipe off the salt mixture.  Rinse the salmon under cold water, removing all the cure.  Using a sharp knife, slice the salmon diagonally paper thin. 
To serve, mound some of the potato mixture in the center of the plate.  Place the BBQ salmon gravlax on the croutons and place around the potato mixture. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     vanilla bean
  4               cups  milk
     1/2           cup  butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  buckwheat
  4                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest

Using a sharp knife, split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise.  With the back of the knife, scrape the pulp away from the bean.  Discard the bean. 
In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the milk, vanilla bean pulp, and 1/2 cup of the butter.  Bring to a boil.  Stir in the buckwheat and continue to cook until tender, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.

Butter a shallow baking pan (8- by 8- by 2-inch, square) with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.  Pour the buckwheat mixture into the prepared pan.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. 
Serve warm in individual serving bowls with cherry jam.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE DOUGH ===
  1           envelope  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  warm water -- (abt 110 degrees)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  Kosher salt

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
In a large sautÈ pan, over medium heat, add the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ until caramelized, about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat and cool completely. 
Using an electric mixer with a dough hook, whisk the yeast, sugar, garlic, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, warm water, and caramelized onions together for 2 minutes to dissolve the yeast.  Add the salt and flour.  With the mixer on low, mix until the dough starts to come together.  Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl and crawls up to dough hook. 
Grease a mixing bowl with 1 teaspoon of the oil.  Place the dough in the greased bowl and turn once.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft free place until the dough doubles in size about 1 1/2 hours. 
Grease a half baking sheet pan (17- by 12-inch) with 2 teaspoons of the oil.  Turn the dough out onto a baking sheet.  Punch the dough down and press the dough out to form the pan.  Brush the dough with remaining 1/4 cup of the olive oil.  Sprinkle the dough with kosher salt and coarse black pepper.  Lightly cover the pan with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 1 hour. 
Bake the dough for 30 to 35 minutes or until the dough is golden brown.  Slice the bread into individual pieces or into sandwich slices. 
This recipe yields 24 individual pieces or 12 sandwich slices.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CREPES ===
  1 1/2           cups  flour
     1/2           cup  cocoa powder
  6        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  2               cups  milk
  2              large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
  16           squares  parchment or waxed paper - (6")
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  1              pound  cream cheese -- at room temperature
     1/2           cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar
     1/2           cup  pureed fresh strawberries
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/2         stick  butter
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1              pound  fresh strawberries -- washed, stemmed,
                        and quartered
     1/4           cup  strawberry liqueur
  1                cup  chocolate sauce -- store bought
                        or home made

For the crepes:  Combine the flour, cocoa powder, sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl.  In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine the butter, milk, eggs and vanilla and whisk until blended.  Add the liquid mixture a little at a time to the dry mixture, whisking to dissolve any lumps.  Whisk until smooth.  Refrigerate for 1 hour. 
Lightly brush a 6-inch skillet with vegetable oil and heat over medium heat.  When the pan is hot, remove from the heat and pour in 1/4 cup of the batter.  Swirl the pan around to spread the batter evenly over the bottom.  Return the pan to the heat and cook until lightly golden, 30 to 40 seconds.  Turn the crepe over and cook the second side for about 15 seconds.  Remove from the pan. 
Repeat the process until all of the batter is used, stacking the crepes between the squares of parchment or waxed paper to prevent them from sticking together.  Set the crepes aside. 
For the filling:  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the cream cheese until smooth.  Add the sour cream, sugar, strawberries and vanilla.  Beat until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. 
Put 3 tablespoons of the filling in the center of the lower third of each crepe.  Fold the bottom of the crepe over the filling and roll up gently but firmly.  Place the filled crepes on a large platter or baking sheet, cover lightly and refrigerate for 1 hour. 
In a large saute pan, over medium-high heat, melt the butter.  Add the sugar and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the strawberries and continue to cook for 1 minute.  Add the liqueur and simmer for 2 minutes.  Add the chocolate sauce and continue to cook for 1 minute. 
Add 8 of the filled crepes to the pan and cook for 1 minute, basting with the sauce.  Remove the crepes from the pan, set aside and keep warm.  Add the remaining crepes and cook for 1 minute, basting with the sauce. 
To serve, crisscross 2 crepes on each dessert plate and drizzle with the sauce. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE COOKIES ===
  1              stick  butter -- at room temperature
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
     1/2           cup  peanut butter
  1                     egg
  1                cup  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped roasted peanuts
                        === FOR THE ICE CREAM ===
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  1                cup  smooth peanut butter
  1              quart  heavy cream
  8                     egg yolks
                        === TO FINISH ===
  6             ounces  semi-sweet chocolate -- melted

For the cookies:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
Using an electric mixer, combine the butter and the sugars.  Beat until smooth.  Add the peanut butter and continue to beat until smooth.  Add the egg and mix well.  Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, vanilla and peanuts.  Mix well. 
Shape the dough into 2-inch balls.  Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, 2 inches apart.  Using the tines of a fork, flatten the balls making a criss-cross pattern.  Bake until lightly browned, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool completely.  (Yield: 2 dozen cookies) 
For the ice cream:  In a saucepan over medium heat, add the sugar, peanut butter and cream, whisk well.  Bring the liquid to a gentle boil.  Whisk the egg yolks together.  Whisk 1 cup of the hot cream into the egg yolks.  Mix thoroughly.  In a steady stream, slowly add the egg mixture into the hot cream.  Continue to cook for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat and cool completely. 
Strain the mixture.  Add the mixture to an electric ice cream maker.  Process according to manufacturer's directions.  (Yield: 1 quart) 
To finish:  Place a scoop of the ice cream in between two cookies and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Freeze until firm.  Dip half of each sandwich into the melted chocolate.  Place back on the baking sheet and freeze until firm.  Remove and serve. 
This recipe yields 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
  8                     eggs
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1                cup  bleached flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        === TO FINISH ===
  1              pound  confectioners' sugar
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1              stick  butter -- at room temperature
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/3           cup  boiling water
  2               cups  heavy cream
  8             ounces  semi-sweet chocolate -- melted
     3/4           cup  simple syrup - (equal amounts of sugar
                        and water, simmered till sugar dissolves)
  3             ounces  semi-sweet chocolate -- shaved into curls
  10            scoops  vanilla bean ice cream - (to 12 scoops)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
For the cake:  Put the eggs and 1 cup of the sugar in a large mixing bowl and, with an electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk, beat on medium-high speed until the mixture is pale yellow, thick and has tripled in volume, about 8 minutes.  Sift the cocoa, flour and baking powder together in another large mixing bowl.  Add the egg mixture and fold to mix thoroughly. 
Grease 2 (9- by 2-inch) round cake pans with the butter.  Sprinkle each with a tablespoon of the remaining sugar.  Pour the cake batter evenly into the pans and bake until the cake springs back when touched, about 25 minutes.  Let cool for about 2 minutes.  Using a thin knife, loosen the edges of the cakes and flip onto a wire rack.  Let cool completely. 
Sift together the confectioners' sugar and cocoa powder into a medium-size bowl.  Add the butter and mix with an electric mixer until incorporated.  Add the vanilla and boiling water and mix until smooth.  Let cool. 
In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the cream and the chocolate.  On medium speed.  Whip until stiff peaks form, set aside. 
To assemble the cake:  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place a wire rack over it.  Using a serrated knife, cut each cake in half horizontally.  Brush the tops of three of the layers with 1/4 cup of the simple syrup.  Place the bottom layer on a 9-inch round of cardboard and set it on the wire rack.  Spread 3/4 cup of the mousse evenly on top of the cake.  Top with a second layer of cake.  Spread another 3/4 cup of the mousse over the top of the cake.  Repeat the same process with the third layer.  Top with the fourth layer.  If necessary, shave off any uneven pieces of the cake with a serrated knife so that it is smooth and even on all sides.  Chill for 2 hours. 
Spread the frosting evenly over the sides and top of the cake.  Refrigerate until the frosting sets.  Place the chocolate curls on top of the cake.  Slice and serve with the ice cream. 
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

     1/2         pound  Louisiana crawfish tails
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced onion
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped parsley
     1/4           cup  butter -- room temperature

     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1               dash  Crystal Hot Sauce
  10                    zucchini flowers - (to 12)
  1                cup  flour
                        Creole seasoning
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  milk
  1                cup  dried fine bread crumbs
  2               cups  Lemon Butter Sauce -- warm, see * Note
                        Oil -- for frying

Add the garlic, onion, parsley, butter, brandy and lemon juice.  Process until the mixture is smooth again, another minute.  Season with salt, white pepper and hot sauce. 
Spoon the mixture into the pastry bag.  Pipe the filling into the center of each flower, pressing the flower firmly into the filling and sealing completely.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. 
Place the flour in a shallow bowl and season with Creole seasoning.  Place the egg and milk in a shallow bowl.  Season with Creole seasoning and mix well.  Place the bread crumbs in a shallow bowl and season with Creole seasoning. 
Carefully dredge each zucchini flower in the flour.  Dip each flower in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off.  Dredge the flowers in the bread crumbs, coating completely.  Fry the flowers in batches until golden.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with Creole seasoning. 
To serve, spoon the Lemon Butter Sauce in the center of each plate.  Place the flowers in the center of the sauce.  Garnish with parsley.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  flour
  1              pinch  salt
     2/3           cup  lard
  3        tablespoons  ice water - (to 4 tbspns)
  1               pint  raspberries
  1               pint  blueberries
  1               pint  blackberries
  1               pint  strawberries
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
  8             scoops  vanilla bean ice cream

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
In a mixing bowl combine the flour and salt.  Add the lard and work it in with your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Form the dough into 2 smooth balls.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 
In a saucepan combine the berries, water and sugar, over medium-high heat.  Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes.  In a small bowl combine the cornstarch with the remaining 1/4 cup of water.  Stir until the cornstarch dissolves and the mixture is smooth.  Stir the cornstarch mixture into the berry mixture.  Bring the mixture back to a boil and continue to cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool. 
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured surface.  Roll out each dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick.  Fold one of the dough into fourths and carefully remove the dough from the surface. 
Unfold the dough into a 9-inch by 2-inch deep-dish pie pan.  Pour the berry filling into the pastry shell.  Place the remaining circle of dough over the filling.  Lightly press the pastry into the berry mixture.  Using a small knife trim off any excess and crimp the edges. 
Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Place in the oven and bake for about 45 minutes or until the crust is golden.  Remove and cool for 20 minutes before slicing.  Serve each slice with a scoop of ice cream. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  1                cup  Herbsaint liqueur
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         sticks  cold butter -- cut into pieces
     1/4      teaspoon  hot sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        === TO FINISH ===

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  Zatarains Concentrated Shrimp and Crab
                        Boil
     1/4           cup  apple cider
     3/4           cup  honey
  1             bottle  Abita Amber Beer - (12 oz)
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  ground allspice
     1/2           cup  Creole seasoning
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1              pinch  ground cloves
                        === FOR THE SEASONING MIX ===
  1                cup  salt
  1         tablespoon  cayenne
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === TO ROAST ===
  4              whole  roasting chickens - (4 to 5 lbs ea)

To make the marinade, combine all of the ingredients in a food processor or blender.  Process for 5 minutes.  Fill a syringe with the marinade and inject each chicken breast, back, wings and legs.  You will have to fill the syringe several times. 
Next, combine the seasoning ingredients and rub the mixture evenly over each chicken.  Place them in large plastic bags, seal and refrigerate for 24 hours. 
Remove from the refrigerator and place on a spit.  Place the spit over the fire.  Slow cook the chickens over the fire for about 4 hours or until the chickens are golden brown and the juices run clear.  The internal temperature of the chickens should reach 170 to 180 degrees on an instant read thermometer. 
Remove the chickens from the spit and transfer to large platters.  Allow the chickens to rest for 10 minutes before carving. 
This recipe yields 16 to 20 servings.

     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1                cup  dried white beans -- picked over, rinsed,
                        cooked in salted water to cover until
                        tender, drained, and cooled
  2 1/2         pounds  new potatoes -- washed, sliced thin
     1/2         pound  Maytag Blue Cheese -- crumbled
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley leaves

In a large, heavy pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, season with 1 teaspoon of salt and the cayenne, and cook, stirring, until they are wilted and golden, about 4 minutes. 
Season the meat with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and add to the pot.  Cook, stirring, until the beef is browned evenly on all sides, about 4 minutes.  Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, beef broth, garlic, chili powder, cumin, oregano, red pepper flakes, and beans.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the beef is tender, about 2 hours.  Skim off the fat that rises to the surface. 
Preheat the fryer to 360 degrees.  Fry the potatoes in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt and pepper. 
To serve, mound the potatoes over the bottom of each serving bowl.  Ladle the chili over the potatoes.  Sprinkle the cheese over the top.  Garnish with parsley. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  shredded duck confit
  1 1/2           cups  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  minced red onions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12            slices  Caramelized Onion Focaccia -- see * Note
  12            slices  fresh tomato, about 1/4" thick
  1              pound  fresh Mozzarella cheese -- cut 12 slices

Preheat the fryer.

Slice each sandwich in half diagonally and serve with the sweet potato chips.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  new potatoes -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/4"-thick slices
                        Salt -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1             recipe  Basic Pizza Dough II -- see * Note
  1         tablespoon  truffle oil
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  thinly-sliced red onions
  2                     confit duck legs (abt 7 oz ea) -- shredded
     1/4         pound  Fontina cheese -- grated
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves

* Note:  See the "Basic Pizza Dough II" recipe which is included in this collection. 
Put the potatoes in a medium-size saucepan and add enough water to cover.  Season with salt.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook until fork tender, 10 to 12 minutes.  Drain and cool under cold water.  Arrange in a shallow dish and allow to come to room temperature. 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly oil two baking sheets with olive oil. 
Divide the pizza dough into 4 equal portions.  With your fingers, dusted with flour, pat the dough into free-form circles, each 8 to 10 inches in diameter, and put them on the prepared baking sheets.  Prick each randomly with a fork.  Brush each dough circle with 1/2 teaspoon of the truffle oil and top each with equal amounts of the potatoes.  Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Continue layering with the onions, shredded duck confit and cheese.  Drizzle the remaining teaspoon of truffle oil evenly over the pizzas. 
Bake on the middle rack of the oven and bake until the crust is golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes before slicing into 8 slices.  Garnish with parsley and serve. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

Sprinkle it with a little water to prevent a crust from forming and leave to cool for 2 to 3 minutes. 
Using a triangular scraper work the sugar syrup scraping it from the slab and turning the sides to the center.  Alternatively, work the fondant in an electric mixer with a dough hook.  Work vigorously particularly when the fondant starts to thicken and become creamy.  After 3 to 5 minutes it will suddenly become stiff. 
Break off one piece of fondant at a time and work it by pinching it hard in your fingers until pliable and smooth.  Press all the pieces of pliable fondant together and knead in any flavoring or coloring.  Pack into an airtight container and leave in the refrigerator or a cool place at least 1 hour, preferably 1 day to mellow.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  2             pounds  fresh peaches -- peeled, pitted,
                        and sliced
  1              quart  heavy cream
  6                     egg yolks -- beaten
     1/2         pound  Rainier cherries
                        Dark rum -- to taste
  2              dozen  butter cookies

In a large saute pan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Stir in 3/4 cup of the sugar until it dissolves.  Add the peaches and saute for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the peaches soften.  Remove from the heat and cool completely. 
In a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, puree the peach mixture until smooth.  In a medium saucepan, over medium heat, combine the peach mixture and heavy cream.  Bring the mixture up to a gentle boil.  Add 1 cup of the hot cream mixture to the beaten yolks and whisk well.  Add the yolk mixture back to the cream mixture and whisk well.  Continue to cook for 4 to 6 minutes, or until the mixture can coat the back of a spoon. 
Remove from the heat, and pour into a glass bowl.  Press a piece of plastic wrap to the cream mixture (this will prevent a film from forming) and cool completely.  Pour the cream mixture into a frozen ice-cream cylinder and process according to manufacturers directions. 
In a medium sized bowl, combine the cherries, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and rum (to taste).  Mix well and allow to sit for 10 minutes. 
To serve, place a couple scoops of ice cream in each serving bowl.  Spoon the cherries over the ice cream and serve with the butter cookies. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  wild ramps
                        Drizzle of olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
                        Hot sauce -- to taste
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  4              large  softshell crabs -- cleaned
  1                cup  flour
                        Creole seasoning
     1/2         pound  wild sorrel -- cleaned
     1/2         pound  watercress -- cleaned
  12                    fresh white asparagus spears -- cooked until tender
                        and chilled
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves

Preheat the grill. 
Season the ramps with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Place on the grill and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until wilted.  Remove and cool completely. 
In a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, combine the egg, mustard, lemon juice, garlic, hot sauce and grilled ramps.  Puree until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  With the machine running, add the oil very slowly in a steady stream.  Process until the mixture is thick and creamy.  Remove and chill completely. 
Preheat oil in the fryer to 360 degrees. 
Season the softshells and flour with Essence.  Dredge the softshells in the flour, coating completely.  Carefully holding the top of each crab, drag the legs through the oil for 5 seconds to allow the individual legs to fry separately.  Then carefully flip the crabs top-side down into the oil.  Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn the crabs over with tongs and continue frying for another 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.  Season with Creole seasoning. 
In a mixing bowl, combine the sorrel and watercress.  Season with salt and pepper.  Season the asparagus with a drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper. 
To serve, spoon some of the dressing in the center of each plate.  Form 3 spears of the asparagus into a triangle over each pool of dressing.  Mound the greens in the center of each triangle.  Lay each softshell on top of the greens.  Garnish with parsley. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Season the ramps with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Place on the grill and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until wilted.  Remove and cool completely. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, combine the egg, mustard, lemon juice, garlic, hot sauce and grilled ramps.  Puree until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  With the machine running, add the oil very slowly in a steady stream.  Process until the mixture is thick and creamy.  Remove and chill completely. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oil in the fryer to 360 degrees. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the softshells and flour with Essence.  Dredge the softshells in the flour, coating completely.  Carefully holding the top of each crab, drag the legs through the oil for 5 seconds to allow the individual legs to fry separately.  Then carefully flip the crabs top-side down into the oil.  Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn the crabs over with tongs and continue frying for another 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.  Season with Creole seasoning. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a mixing bowl, combine the sorrel and watercress.  Season with salt and pepper.  Season the asparagus with a drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, spoon some of the dressing in the center of each plate.  Form 3 spears of the asparagus into a triangle over each pool of dressing.  Mound the greens in the center of each triangle.  Lay each softshell on top of the greens.  Garnish with parsley.

  1                cup  chopped onions
  2               cups  cooked long-grain white rice
  1                     egg
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped parsley leaves
     1/4           cup  water
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1                cup  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1              pinch  sugar

  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme

Cut the cabbage in half lengthwise and remove the core.  Peel a couple of the outer leaves away from the cabbage halves and discard.  Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the cabbage and cook for 20 minutes or until tender.  Remove from the water and cool completely.  Carefully divide into individual leaves (eight whole leaves are needed).  Set aside. 
In a large sautÈ pan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the meat.  Season with salt and pepper.  Brown the meat for 5 minutes.  Add the onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  Continue to cook for 4 minutes, or until the onions are translucent.  Remove from the heat and turn into a mixing bowl.  Cool slightly.  Stir in the rice, egg and parsley.  Mix well.  Season with salt and pepper. 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
Place 1/2 cup of the meat and rice mixture in the center of each cabbage leaf.  Roll up each leaf tightly.  Place in a shallow baking pan, add the water and cover with foil.  Bake for 30 minutes. 
In a saucepan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  Stir in the flour and cook for 4 minutes for a blonde roux.  Stir in the tomatoes, garlic and sugar.  Season with salt and pepper.  Continue to cook for 2 minutes.  Stir in the stock and the thyme.  Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce to a simmer and continue to cook for 15 minutes or until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. 
To serve, spoon the sauce in the center of each plate.  Arrange two of the stuffed cabbage leaves in the center of the sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5              large  Idaho baking potatoes
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
     1/2         pound  bacon -- chopped
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  sour cream
  8             ounces  grated sharp Cheddar cheese
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  4                     Porterhouse steaks - (12 to 14 oz ea)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
Season the potatoes with 1 tablespoon of the oil and kosher salt.  Place on a baking sheet and place in the oven.  Cook until fork tender, about 1 hour.  Remove and cool. 
In a saute pan, over medium heat, render the bacon until crispy, about 6 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels. 
Peel one potato completely and slice 1/4 of the top off each of the remaining potatoes.  Using a spoon, scrape out the flesh of each potato into a mixing bowl.  Add the whole peeled potato to the mixing bowl.  Using a hand held masher, mash the potatoes until smooth.  Add the butter, sour cream, half of the cheese and the chives.  Season with salt and pepper and mix well.  Spoon the potato mixture back into the potato shells.  Top the potatoes with the remaining cheese and the bacon.  Place back on the baking sheet and bake until the cheese melts, about 8 to 10 minutes. 
Preheat the grill.  Season the steaks with the remaining olive oil, salt and pepper.  Place the steaks on the grill and cook for 4 to 6 minutes on each side for medium-rare.  Remove from the grill and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving.  Remove the potatoes from the oven.  Serve the steaks with the potatoes. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Peel one potato completely and slice 1/4 of the top off each of the remaining potatoes.  Using a spoon, scrape out the flesh of each potato into a mixing bowl.  Add the whole peeled potato to the mixing bowl.  Using a hand held masher, mash the potatoes until smooth.  Add the butter, sour cream, half of the cheese and the chives.  Season with salt and pepper and mix well.  Spoon the potato mixture back into the potato shells.  Top the potatoes with the remaining cheese and the bacon.  Place back on the baking sheet and bake until the cheese melts, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Preheat the grill.  Season the steaks with the remaining olive oil, salt and pepper.  Place the steaks on the grill and cook for 4 to 6 minutes on each side for medium-rare.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh tomatoes -- halved, seeded
                        Drizzle of olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             medium  portobello mushrooms -- stemmed, cleaned
  1              pound  fresh mozzarella cheese -- sliced 1/2" thick
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped onions
  6               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1              pound  Arborio rice
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  3        tablespoons  chopped green onions, green parts only

Preheat the grill to 400 degrees. 
In a mixing bowl, toss the tomatoes with the olive oil, salt and pepper.  Place on the grill and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side.  Remove from the grill and set aside. 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the portobello mushroom on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cavity up.  Drizzle both sides of the mushrooms with the olive oil.  Season both sides with salt and pepper.  Fan a quarter of the cheese over each cavity of the mushroom.  Place in the oven and cook until the mushrooms are tender and the cheese is bubbly, about 10 minutes. 
Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.  Add the onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  Saute until the onions are slightly soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the water and garlic.  Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer for about 6 minutes.  Add the rice and simmer, stirring constantly until the mixture is creamy and bubbly, about 18 minutes.  Stir in the butter, cream, cheese, and green onions.  Simmer for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from the heat and stir in the tomatoes. 
To serve, slice each portobello into quarters.  Spoon the risotto into each serving dish.  Lay 2 slices of the portobello on top of the risotto. Garnish with parsley. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh Mozzarella curd -- at room temperature
  2             quarts  simmering water
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4             medium  rubber gloves
  1              quart  ice water
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  water

In a medium stainless mixing bowl, crumble the curd into small pieces.  Season the simmering water with 1 tablespoon of the salt.  Pour 4 cups of the simmering water over the curd, 1 cup at a time.  Place two rubber gloves over each hand.  Using your hands, carefully press the curd together, about 15 seconds.  Allow the curd to sit for 30 seconds.  Using your hands, sort of knead the curd together to form a ball.  Pull the curd for a couple of minutes under the warm water.  Form the cheese into either 1 log about 3 inches thick or 2 smaller ones. 
** If the cheese starts to cool down and is hard to shape or pull, add some more simmering water and let the cheese sit for about 10 seconds and then start shaping or pulling again. ** 
Remove the cheese and place in an ice bath.  Allow the cheese to cool for a couple of minutes.  In a second mixing bowl, combine the milk, water and remaining teaspoon of salt.  Place the cheese in the liquid and let sit for 2 hours.  Remove the cheese from the liquid and wrap tightly in plastic wrap.  The cheese will keep for up to 2 weeks. 
This recipe yields 1/2 to 3/4 pound cheese.

Place two rubber gloves over each hand.  Using your hands, carefully press the curd together, about 15 seconds.  Allow the curd to sit for 30 seconds.  Using your hands, sort of knead the curd together to form a ball.  Pull the curd for a couple of minutes under the warm water.  Form the cheese into either 1 log about 3 inches thick or 2 smaller ones. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
** If the cheese starts to cool down and is hard to shape or pull, add some more simmering water and let the cheese sit for about 10 seconds and then start shaping or pulling again. ** 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the cheese and place in an ice bath.  Allow the cheese to cool for a couple of minutes.  In a second mixing bowl, combine the milk, water and remaining teaspoon of salt.  Place the cheese in the liquid and let sit for 2 hours.  Remove the cheese from the liquid and wrap tightly in plastic wrap.  The cheese will keep for up to 2 weeks. 
</DirT>

This recipe yields 1/2 to 3/4 pound cheese.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted for brushing
  1             medium  onion -- finely diced
  2             sprigs  tarragon -- leaves picked,
                        and coarsely chopped - (2 tspns)
  2             sprigs  Italian parsley -- leaves picked,
                        and coarsely chopped - (2 tbspns)
  2             ounces  peeled raw shrimp -- cut into " pieces
  2             ounces  raw scallops -- cut into 1/2" pieces
  2             ounces  crabmeat -- picked for cartilage
                        Kosher or sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     live hard-shell select lobsters -- (1 1/2 to 2 1/2 lbs ea)
     1/4           cup  dried cornbread -- crumbled

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. 
Melt 8 tablespoons butter in a saute pan over medium heat.  Add the onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cook for 5 minutes, or until soft, but not browned.  Stir in the tarragon and the parsley.  Add the seafood.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cook for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and cool. 
With a cleaver or a chef's knife, split the lobsters in half lengthwise.  Remove and discard the sac and the intestine.  Remove the tomalley and roe, if present and place in a small bowl.  Break into small pieces with a fork.  With the back side of a knife crack the center of each claw, on one side only.  Season the lobsters lightly with salt and pepper.  On a baking sheet, place the halves together to resemble a butterfly. 
Mix the tomalley and roe into the seafood mixture.  Gently fold in the cornbread.  Season with salt and pepper.  Divivde the mixture evenly between the two lobsters.  Do not pack the stuffing tightly or it will affect the even baking of the lobster.  Brush the 3 tablespoons melted butter over the exposed tail meat, stuffing and claws.  Bake until the lobster is cooked through and the stuffing is crispy and golden, about 20 to 24 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve at once. 
This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

  8              large  Creole or beefsteak tomatoes -- cored
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  honey
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  liquid crab boil
  2                     lemons -- halved
  2             pounds  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1                     sweet corn ear -- blanched, and
                        kernels removed
     1/2           cup  small-diced tomatoes

     1/4           cup  black olives -- pitted, halved
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh chervil leaves
  8                     fresh chervil sprigs

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.  Using a sharp knife, make a small X on the bottom of each whole tomato.  Place the tomatoes in the boiling water and cook for 1 minute.  Remove and place in a bowl of ice water.  Cool the tomatoes completely. 
Remove from the water and peel the skin off each tomato.  Quarter each tomato 3/4 of the way to the bottom.  Remove the seeds.  Place the tomatoes in a large glass pan.  Season the tomatoes with salt and pepper. 
In a small mixing bowl whisk together the oil, mustard and honey.  Season with salt and pepper.  Pour the marinade over each tomato.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours.  Remove from the refrigerator and pour off the marinade into a medium-size bowl. 
In a saucepan, add the crab boil and lemons.  Bring the mixture to a boil.  Add the shrimp.  Cover and remove from the heat.  Allow the shrimp to sit in the water for 8 minutes or until the shrimp turn pink and tails curl completely.  Remove from the water and cool completely. 
Add the shrimp, corn, diced tomatoes, onions, olives, chervil and garlic to the bowl of marinade.  Mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place the tomato in the center of each serving plate.  Spoon the shrimp salad in the center of each tomato.  Garnish with sprigs of fresh chervil.

  1         tablespoon  Creole or whole grain mustard
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions
  1                cup  vegetable oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6             ounces  bacon -- chopped
  2               cups  cubed cornbread in 1/2" cubes
  2               cups  small-diced seeded fresh tomatoes
     1/2           cup  small-diced Vidalia onions
  4                     catfish fillets - (abt 6 oz ea)
                        Creole seasoning
  1                cup  flour
  1                cup  masa flour
  4                     fresh lemon wedges

For the tartar sauce:  Put the egg, garlic, lemon juice, mustard, 1 tablespoon of the parsley, and green onions in a food processor and puree for 15 seconds.  With the processor running, slowly pour the oil through the feed tube in a steady stream.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover and let sit for 1 hour in the refrigerator before using.  Best if used within 24 hours. 
For the cornbread salad:  In a large skillet, over medium heat, render the bacon until crispy, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Add the cornbread to the bacon fat and fry until golden, about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  In a mixing bowl, combine the crispy bacon, cornbread, tomatoes and onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  Mix well. 
For the catfish:  Season the fillets with Creole seasoning.  In a shallow bowl, combine the flour and masa.  Season with Creole seasoning.  Dip fillets in flour mixture.  In another skillet, heat the remaining oil.  When the oil is hot, pan-fry for 4 to 6 minutes on each side until golden brown.  Remove the fillets and drain on paper towels. 
To serve, spoon the cornbread salad in the center of 4 plates.  Lay the catfish on top of the salad.  Place a spoonful of the tartar sauce on top of the fish.  Garnish with a lemon wedge and parsley. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
  8              large  eggs
  1                cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1                cup  bleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter -- at room temperature
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  5              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  cornstarch
  2 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
                        === FOR THE PEACHES ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  4             medium  fresh peaches -- peeled, pitted,
                        and cut into 1/4" wedges
     1/4           cup  rum
                        === TO FINISH ===
  1                cup  sweetened whipped cream
  8                     fresh mint sprigs
                        Shaker of confectioners' sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
For the Cake:  With an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip, beat the eggs and 1 cup of the sugar on medium-high speed in a large mixing bowl until the mixture is pale yellow and thick and has tripled in volume, about 8 minutes.  Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium-size mixing bowl.  Fold into the egg mixture and blend thoroughly until smooth.  Add the vanilla and 2 tablespoons of the butter.  Mix gently. 
Grease a 17- by 12-inch baking pan (or jelly-roll pan) with the remaining 2 teaspoons of the butter.  Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.  Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly.  Bake until the cake springs back when touched, about 15 minutes.  Cool for about 2 minutes, then gently flip it out onto a large piece of parchment paper. 
For the Filling:   In a mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, cornstarch, and 1 cup of the heavy cream.  Whisk to blend well.  Set aside. 
Combine the remaining 1 1/2 cups cream and sugar in a large heavy-bottom saucepan over medium heat.  Whisk to dissolve the sugar and bring to a gentle boil, about 10 minutes.  Slowly add the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly and cook until it thickens, about 5 minutes.  Be forewarned: the mixture will break.  Don't be alarmed.  Pour it into a glass bowl.  Press a piece of plastic wrap down over the surface of the mixture to prevent a skin from forming.  Let cool completely at room temperature. 
When cooled pour the mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip.  Beat at a medium speed to combine the mixture.  If it will not combine, warm another 1/2 cup heavy cream and slowly add it to the mixture.  Whip until you have a thick and creamy custard. 
For the Peaches:  Heat the butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the light brown sugar and cinnamon, stir until it dissolves.  Add the peaches and cook, stirring, until the sugar starts to turn dark amber in color, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the rum, carefully ignite it, and flambe the peaches. 
Remove from the heat and allow to cool for about 10 minutes.  Place in the bowl of a food processor, pulse several times or until the peach mixture is spreadable. 
To Assemble:  Place the parchment-lined cake on a work surface.  Peel off the cooking paper and roll (lengthwise) and unroll the cake in the paper several times.  Using a small pallet knife, spread the peach mixture evenly over the cake.  Spread the pastry cream evenly over the peaches.  Starting at one end (lengthwise) and using the paper underneath, roll the filled cake as tightly as possible. 
Wrap the entire jelly roll in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Remove from the refrigerator and slice diagonally 2 inches thick.  Place on each serving plate.  Garnish with whipped cream, mint and powdered sugar. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
     1/4           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
  8              large  eggs
  1                cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1                cup  bleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        === TO FINISH ===
  3               cups  semisweet chocolate - (abt 1 lb) -- melted
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1               pint  chocolate ice cream
  1               pint  Peppermint Ice Cream -- see * Note
  2               cups  chocolate sauce -- warm
  12                    fresh mint sprigs

* Note:  See the "Peppermint Ice Cream" recipe which is included in this collection. 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
In a small saucepan, warm the milk and 2 teaspoons of the butter over medium-low heat.  With an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip, beat the eggs and 1 cup of the sugar on medium-high speed in a large mixing bowl until the mixture is pale yellow and thick and has tripled in volume, about 8 minutes. 
With the mixer on low, beat in the warm milk mixture.  Sift the flour, baking powder, cocoa, and salt together in a medium-size mixing bowl.  Fold into the egg mixture and blend thoroughly until smooth.  Add the vanilla and mix gently. 
Grease a 17- by 12-inch baking pan (or jelly-roll pan) with 2 tablespoons butter.  Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.  Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly.  Bake until the cake springs back when touched, about 15 minutes.  Cool for about 2 minutes, then gently flip it out onto a large wire rack or a large piece of parchment paper.  Let cool completely. 
In an electric mixer, fitted with a wire whip, combine 1 cup of the melted chocolate and cream.  Whisk on medium speed until firm peaks form.  Remove, cover and refrigerate until ready to use. 
Place a 1 1/2 quart mixing bowl upside down on the sponge cake.  Using a knife, cut out a circle of the cake the size of the bowl, discarding the trimmings.  Line the mixing bowl with plastic wrap.  Spoon and spread the bottom and sides of the mixing bowl evenly, about 3 inches deep, with the chocolate ice cream.  Place the bowl in the freezer and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes. 
Spread the Peppermint Ice Cream evenly over the bottom and sides, about 3 inches deep.  Spoon the chocolate mousse evenly in the center of the ice cream.  Place the circle of sponge cake on top of the filled bowl.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, place in the freezer, and freeze until firm, about 2 hours. 
Remove from the freezer and remove the plastic wrap.  Unmold onto a wire rack.  Pour the remaining 2 cups of melted chocolate over the entire mold, covering completely.  Place back in the freezer for about 30 minutes, or until the chocolate is firm to the touch. 
To serve, using a hot knife, slice the bomb into 12 equal servings.  Place each slice on a serving plate and garnish with a drizzle of the chocolate sauce and a sprig of mint. 
This recipe yields 12 servings.

With the mixer on low, beat in the warm milk mixture.  Sift the flour, baking powder, cocoa, and salt together in a medium-size mixing bowl.  Fold into the egg mixture and blend thoroughly until smooth.  Add the vanilla and mix gently. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grease a 17- by 12-inch baking pan (or jelly-roll pan) with 2 tablespoons butter.  Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.  Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly.  Bake until the cake springs back when touched, about 15 minutes.  Cool for about 2 minutes, then gently flip it out onto a large wire rack or a large piece of parchment paper.  Let cool completely. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In an electric mixer, fitted with a wire whip, combine 1 cup of the melted chocolate and cream.  Whisk on medium speed until firm peaks form.  Remove, cover and refrigerate until ready to use. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a 1 1/2 quart mixing bowl upside down on the sponge cake.  Using a knife, cut out a circle of the cake the size of the bowl, discarding the trimmings.  Line the mixing bowl with plastic wrap.  Spoon and spread the bottom and sides of the mixing bowl evenly, about 3 inches deep, with the chocolate ice cream.  Place the bowl in the freezer and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the Peppermint Ice Cream evenly over the bottom and sides, about 3 inches deep.  Spoon the chocolate mousse evenly in the center of the ice cream.  Place the circle of sponge cake on top of the filled bowl.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, place in the freezer, and freeze until firm, about 2 hours. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the freezer and remove the plastic wrap.  Unmold onto a wire rack.  Pour the remaining 2 cups of melted chocolate over the entire mold, covering completely.  Place back in the freezer for about 30 minutes, or until the chocolate is firm to the touch. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, using a hot knife, slice the bomb into 12 equal servings.  Place each slice on a serving plate and garnish with a drizzle of the chocolate sauce and a sprig of mint.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

         Roasted Eggplant Stuffed With A Portugese Rice Dressing

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  eggplants -- halved
  7        tablespoons  Portuguese olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1                cup  chopped green onions
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
  3             medium  tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  2          teaspoons  crushed red pepper
  1              pound  salt cod -- soaked, rinsed,
                        patted dry and julienned
     1/2         pound  cooked long-grain white rice
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        Drizzle of Portuguese olive oil
  3                     hard-boiled eggs -- chopped
     1/2           cup  sliced Queen-Stuffed Green Olives

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
Cut each eggplant in half, crosswise.  Drizzle each half with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper.  Place the halves on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Place in the oven and roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the center is slightly tender.  Remove and cool completely. 
Using a spoon, scoop out the center flesh of each eggplant, leaving a 1-inch border on the side.  Small dice the reserved eggplant flesh and set aside. 
In a large saute pan, heat the remaining oil.  When the oil is hot, add the onions.  Season with salt and pepper.  SautÈ until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, green onions, 2 tablespoons of the parsley, and tomatoes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Continue to cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft.  Add the crushed red pepper and salt cod.  Continue to cook for 3 minutes stirring constantly.  Remove from the heat and turn into a mixing bowl.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     veal loin -- boned
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  Fontina cheese -- cut thin slices
  1             medium  black truffle
                        Butcher's twine
                        Drizzle of olive oil
  1              pound  baby morels -- cleaned
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
     1/4           cup  Cognac
  2               cups  veal reduction
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh thyme leaves

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
Place the veal loin on a cutting board.  Cover with pieces of plastic wrap.  Lightly pound the meat to 1/2-inch thick.  Season both sides with salt and pepper.  Place the slices of cheese over the pounded meat.  Shave the truffles over the cheese.  Roll the veal up tightly and secure with separate pieces of string at 1-inch intervals. 
In a large saute pan, over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of the oil.  When the oil is hot, sear the veal for a couple of minutes on all sides.  Remove from the heat and place in the oven.  Roast for about 20 to 25 minutes for medium-rare.  Remove the veal from the pan and set aside to rest. 
Place the saute pan back over the heat.  Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Add the mushrooms and shallots.  Season with salt and pepper.  Saute for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and continue to saute for 1 minute.  Deglaze the pan with the Cognac.  Add the reduction and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the thyme.  Set aside. 
Using a carving knife, remove the string from the veal.  Slice the veal into 1/2-inch slices. 
To serve, arrange the slices in the center of each plate.  Spoon some of the mushroom sauce over each slice.  Serve immediately.  Garnish with fresh thyme leaves. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
     1/2           cup  chopped green peppers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              dozen  fresh mussels
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
  4                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- roasted, peeled,
                        and seeded
                        Juice from one lemon
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1                cup  vegetable oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  3 1/4           cups  flour
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
                        Crystal Hot Sauce -- to taste
                        Worcestershire Sauce -- to taste
                        Solid vegetable shortening -- for deep-frying
                        Creole seasoning

Prepare the smoker. 
Season the mussels with salt.  Place on the smoking rack and close tightly.  Smoke for about 6 to 8 minutes or until the mussels open.  Remove the mussels from the smoker and remove the meat from the shells.  Season with cayenne pepper.  Set aside. 
In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of the garlic, roasted red pepper, lemon juice and mustard.  Puree until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  With the machine running, add 1 cup of oil in a steady stream.  Process until the mixture is thick and creamy.  Season with salt and pepper.  Remove and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.  The aioli can be made one day in advance. 
Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and season with salt and cayenne.  Saute for about 3 minutes or until slightly wilted.  Add the remaining tablespoon of garlic and continue to saute for 1 minute.  Remove and set aside to cool. 
Make a batter by combining the remaining 3 eggs, milk, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne.  Add the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, beating and incorporating until all is used and the batter is smooth.  Stir in the parsley.  Season with hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce to taste.  Roughly chop the mussels and fold into the batter.  Mix well. 
Heat the shortening to 360 degrees.  Drop the batter, a heaping tablespoon at a time, into the hot oil.  When the fritters pop to the surface, roll them around with a slotted spoon in the oil to brown evenly.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with Creole seasoning.  Serve the fritters hot with the aioli. 
This recipe yields about 2 dozen.

  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions, green parts only
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley

* Note:  See the "Southern Cooked Greens" recipe which is included in this collection 
In a mixing bowl, add the veal.  Season with Creole seasoning.  Toss the meat in flour, coating completely.  Turn the meat out onto a floured surface and lightly pound the meat with a meat mallet.  Turn the meat over and lightly pound again. 
In a large, cast-iron pot, heat the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the veal.  Brown the meat evenly on both sides for 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the onions, bell peppers and celery.  Season with salt and cayenne.  Continue stirring, scraping the bottom and sides of the pot to loosen any browned particles.  Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the vegetables are wilted. 
Add the tomatoes and garlic.  Cook, stirring often and scraping the bottom and sides of the pot, for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the bay leaves, thyme, oregano, basil, beef broth and wine.  Season with salt, cayenne pepper and black pepper. 
Bring the liquid to a simmer, and cook for about 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is very tender, stirring occasionally and keeping the pot partially covered.  Remove the bay leaves. 
For the grits:  In a saucepan, over medium heat, add the milk, salt, cayenne and butter and bring to a boil.  Stir in the grits and reduce the heat to medium.  Stir for 30 seconds, then add 1 cup of the cheese and stir until the cheese melts.  Cook, uncovered, for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until the grits are tender and creamy. 
Pour the grits into a greased square glass pan.  Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the grits.  Place pan in oven and bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and slightly golden. 
To serve, spoon the grits in the center of each plate.  Spoon the Southern Cooked Greens around the grits.  Spoon the veal mixture over the grits.  Garnish with green onions. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  veal stew meat
  1              quart  veal oil - (veal deckle fat
                        rendered down with pomace oil)
  6                     garlic cloves
  3             sprigs  fresh rosemary
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  minced shallots
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  2             ounces  dried morel mushrooms
                        Warm water
                        Heavy cream
  2                     fresh pasta sheets - (11" by 14") -- cut into 2" squares
                        for about 64 squares
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. 
For the veal ravioli filling:  Season the meat with salt and pepper.  Place the meat in an oven-proof pan and cover with the veal oil.  Add the garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs to the pan and season with salt and pepper.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil and place in the oven.  Slow cook the meat for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until the meat is very tender.  Remove from the oven and strain.  Reserve the veal oil for future use.  Discard the rosemary. 
In a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, add the veal meat, 1/4 cup of the reserved oil, 1/2 cup of the shallots, garlic, rosemary and parsley.  Season with salt and black pepper.  Pulse until the mixture is finely chopped.  If the rillette is not moist enough, add some of the remaining veal oil.  Cover the rillette and store in the refrigerator.  The rillette will keep for up to 2 weeks.  (Makes about 3/4 pound) 
For the Morel Cream Sauce:  Place the dried morels in a shallow bowl.  Pour the warm water over the morels.  Allow to sit for at least 1 hour.  Strain the morels, reserving the liquid.  Cut the rehydrated morels into 1/4-inch thick rings. 
In a saucepan, over medium heat, add 2 teaspoons of the oil.  Add the morels and the remaining 1/2 cup of shallots.  Season with salt and pepper.  Saute for 6 minutes.  Add the reserved and strained morel liquid.  Bring the mixture to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and cook for 4 minutes.  Add the cream and continue to cook for 6 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and keep warm. 
To make the ravioli's:  Place 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of 32 pasta squares.  Lightly wet the edges of the pasta with water.  Place 1 pasta square on top of the filled square.  Press the edges of the square firmly to seal the square.  Repeat the procedure until all the squares are sealed. 
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the pasta and cook until tender, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Drain.  Toss the raviolis with the warm mushroom sauce and garnish with the grated cheese. 
This recipe yields 4 appetizer servings.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the veal ravioli filling:  Season the meat with salt and pepper.  Place the meat in an oven-proof pan and cover with the veal oil.  Add the garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs to the pan and season with salt and pepper.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil and place in the oven.  Slow cook the meat for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until the meat is very tender.  Remove from the oven and strain.  Reserve the veal oil for future use.  Discard the rosemary. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, add the veal meat, 1/4 cup of the reserved oil, 1/2 cup of the shallots, garlic, rosemary and parsley.  Season with salt and black pepper.  Pulse until the mixture is finely chopped.  If the rillette is not moist enough, add some of the remaining veal oil.  Cover the rillette and store in the refrigerator.  The rillette will keep for up to 2 weeks.  (Makes about 3/4 pound) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Morel Cream Sauce:  Place the dried morels in a shallow bowl.  Pour the warm water over the morels.  Allow to sit for at least 1 hour.  Strain the morels, reserving the liquid.  Cut the rehydrated morels into 1/4-inch thick rings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a saucepan, over medium heat, add 2 teaspoons of the oil.  Add the morels and the remaining 1/2 cup of shallots.  Season with salt and pepper.  Saute for 6 minutes.  Add the reserved and strained morel liquid.  Bring the mixture to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and cook for 4 minutes.  Add the cream and continue to cook for 6 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and keep warm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the ravioli&apos;s:  Place 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of 32 pasta squares.  Lightly wet the edges of the pasta with water.  Place 1 pasta square on top of the filled square.  Press the edges of the square firmly to seal the square.  Repeat the procedure until all the squares are sealed. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the pasta and cook until tender, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Drain.  Toss the raviolis with the warm mushroom sauce and garnish with the grated cheese.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     veal rib chops, bone-in - (10 to 12 oz ea)
                        Creole seasoning
  2               cups  flour
  2               cups  fine dried bread crumbs
  2                     eggs -- beaten with
  2        tablespoons  milk
  2        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2         pound  baby carrots -- peeled, blanched
     1/2         pound  small red potatoes -- quartered, blanched
  4             medium  plum tomatoes -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1                cup  red onion -- julienned
  2               cups  baby arugula -- washed, patted dry
                        Drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Using a sharp knife, butterfly each chop.  Cover each chop with a large piece of plastic wrap.  Using a meat mallet, pound out each chop, about 1/2-inch thick.  Season the chops with Creole seasoning. 
In a shallow bowl, season the flour with Creole seasoning.  In another shallow bowl, season the bread crumbs with Creole seasoning. 
Dredge the veal in the flour.  Dip each veal chop in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off.  Dredge each chop in the seasoned bread crumbs, coating each chop completely. 
In a large saute pan or skillet, heat the butter and 2 tablespoons of the oil.  When the oil is hot, pan-fry each chop for about 4 minutes on each side.  Remove from the pan and drain the chops on a paper-lined plate.  Season the chops with Creole seasoning. 
In another saute pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Saute blanched carrots and potatoes until tender, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper. 
In a mixing bowl, combine the tomatoes, red onion and arugula.  Season with a drizzle of oil, salt and pepper.  Mix well. 
To serve, place the veal in the center of each plate.  Spoon some of the tomato mixture on top of the veal.  Garnish with parsley.  Serve with the vegetables. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface.  Roll the dough out on the floured surface into a rectangle 16 by 12 inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick.  Cut the dough into 3-inch by 1-inch strips.  Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake until golden brown and crispy, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool completely. 
This recipe yields about 4 dozen.

  3              pints  wild strawberries -- cleaned, halved
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1                     orange -- juiced
  2               cups  water
