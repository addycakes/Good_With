         'Burned Fingers' Lamb Chops - {Lamb Chops 'Scottadita'}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     lemons -- zested
  2            bunches  mint leaves -- divided
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt and pepper
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  24                    baby lamb chops
  2               cups  lemon balm leaves
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

In the bowl of a food processor, combine lemon zest, 1 bunch mint, sugar and 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper, and buzz until mixture is the texture of coarse sand.  Rub each chop well with a small amount of the mixture, cover chops and set aside.

Bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil.  Set up an ice bath large enough to hold all of the mint and lemon balm and set it next to the stove.  Blanch the mint and lemon balm in the boiling water until tender, about 45 seconds.  Remove from water and immediately immerse in the ice bath.  When completely cooled, remove herbs and drain well.  Place herbs in the bowl of a food processor and pulse 15 seconds.  Slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup olive oil and pulse until emulsified.  Do not over-process.

Preheat the grill.

Grill each chop until medium-rare, about 5 minutes on each side.  Serve with the lemon balm pesto.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  green zucchini - (abt 1 lb)
  3             medium  yellow zucchini - (abt 1 lb)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  12                    zucchini flowers
  6             medium  garlic cloves -- peeled, chopped fine
  2            bunches  fresh basil -- cut into chiffonade
  2        tablespoons  Kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     porcelain or glass deep dish pie pan
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
                        Freshly-grilled bread

Trim the green and yellow zucchini at both ends and slice lengthwise into pieces 1/4-inch thick.  Heat the olive oil in a deep frying pan until just smoking.  Cook 5 or 6 pieces of zucchini at a time until golden brown, turning once, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove the pieces and drain on paper towels.  Continue with the remaining zucchini until finished.  Then cook the flowers in the same way.

In a mixing bowl, lightly stir together the garlic, basil, salt and pepper until well-mixed.  Place several pieces of zucchini on the bottom of the pie dish until the base is covered.  Sprinkle the zucchini with 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of the herb mixture as evenly as possible and spritz with 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar.  Continue layering the zucchini and herb mixture until the zucchini is finished, top with the flowers and cover with plastic.  Refrigerate 2 hours before serving.  Serve over freshly grilled bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  10                    baby artichokes -- cleaned, choke
                        removed, cut into thin slices and
                        held in acidulated water
  1                     garlic clove -- roughly chopped
  5                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a 10-inch, ovenproof skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat until almost smoking.  Drain the artichokes and pat dry, then add to the pan with the garlic.  Cook over high heat 5 to 8 minutes.  Set aside.

In a medium bowl, beat the eggs until frothy, then add the parsley, flour, salt and pepper to taste and the cheese and mix well to combine.  Pour this mixture over the artichokes in the pan and return to the stove, cooking 4 to 5 minutes over medium heat to let the bottom set.

Transfer to the oven and cook 15 to 20 minutes, until the edges set and the top begins to brown.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  cardoons -- trimmed, scraped,
                        cut 4" lengths, and soaked in
                        acidulated water
  2                     lemons -- juiced
                        Flour -- for dredging
  2                     eggs -- beaten
                        Olive oil -- for frying
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cut small pieces

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil, add 2 tablespoons salt and lemon juice.

Remove the cardoons from the acidulated water, rinse and cook in the boiling water until tender but not fully cooked, about 30 minutes.  Drain well and dry on paper towels.  Dredge each cardoon in the flour, then the eggs.

In a 14-inch saute pan, heat about 1/2 cup of oil over high heat until almost smoking.  Fry the cardoon pieces in the oil until golden brown, working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.  Drain the cardoons on a plate lined with paper towels.  Season with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, heat the Basic Tomato Sauce in a small saucepan until bubbling.  When all cardoons are cooked, place in a casserole with the hot sauce and the grated cheese.  Distribute the butter evenly across the top of the dish and bake in the oven 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  cardoons
  10              cups  water
  2                     lemons
  2               cups  Bechamel Sauce - {Besciamella} -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  freshly-grated pecorino fresco
  1                cup  fresh bread crumbs

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Trim the top leaves and stalks off the cardoons until they resemble a celery-sized plant about 14 to 16 inches in length.  Remove each stalk and peel off the outer fibrous ribs and hard green skin, using a paring knife.

Fill a stock or pasta pot 2/3 to 3/4 full (about 10 cups) with water and add lemons, which have been halved and squeezed into the water.  Cut each cardoon into 3 pieces, approximately 5 to 6 inches in length, placing immediately into the acidulated water to avoid discoloration.  Place on medium-high heat and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium and simmer for 1 hour.  Remove, drain and rinse.  Allow to cool.

Lay the cardoon pieces in an oven-proof casserole and cover with 2 cups besciamela sauce.  Sprinkle with the grated cheese and bread crumbs and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until dark golden brown and very bubbly.  Serve immediately.

                        and juices reserved
                        Salt -- to taste

In a 3-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and garlic and cook until soft and light golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the thyme and carrot and cook 5 minutes more, until the carrot is quite soft.

Add the tomatoes and juice and bring to a boil, stirring often.  Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes until as thick as hot cereal.  Season with salt and serve.  This sauce holds 1 week in the refrigerator or up to 6 months in the freezer.

This recipe yields about 4 cups of sauce.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             medium  onions -- chopped
  2              large  garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1              ounce  thinly-sliced prosciutto di Parma - (to 2  -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley -- plus
  6        tablespoons  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  8              large  whole scallions, greens and whites -- chopped
  1                cup  tightly-packed fresh herbs -- roughly chopped
                        (basil, parsley and marjoram)
  2               cups  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Heat the oil in a large heavy saute pan over medium heat.  Add the onions, garlic and a light sprinkling of salt and pepper.  Stir them lightly to coat in the oil, then cover the pan and lower the heat to the lowest possible setting.  Cook 10 to 15 minutes, or until the onions are soft and almost transparent.  Once the onionsí natural sweetness has been accentuated by the slow cooking, you can bring out their rich savory side with browning.

Uncover and raise the heat to medium-high or high.  Saute the onions to deep golden brown, stirring often with a wooden spatula and scraping up the brown glaze collecting on the bottom of the pan.  Take care not to let the glaze burn.  If necessary, lower the heat slightly.  Onions will resemble a thick, dark amber marmalade.  Set aside.

Roll the pasta dough out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut the sheet of pasta into rectangles that are 1-inch by 2-inches.  Pinch the long center of each square to form the strichettoni, or bow ties.  Place the pasta on a sheet tray dusted with semolina until ready to cook, and cover with damp, clean kitchen towels.

Bring 6 quarts of salted water to a fierce boil.  To finish the sauce, reheat the onion mixture over medium-high to high heat and add the cream.  Stir until the cream begins to bubble.  Drop the pasta in the boiling water and cook until tender yet still firm, about 3 to 4 minutes.

Stir the prosciutto, parsley, scallions and herbs into the sauce.  Cook only long enough to heat through -- the fresh, uncooked taste of the herbs is important here.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Drain the pasta, reserving the cooking liquid, and add it to the pan with the sauce.  Add the cheese and toss over high heat 1 minute, adding a splash of pasta cooking water if necessary to keep the sauce from being too "tight".  Serve in warmed pasta dishes, passing the remaining cheese separately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  bones-in veal breast - (to 6 lbs) -- fat trimmed
  1        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  dried thyme
  1         tablespoon  dried rosemary
  1         tablespoon  dried parsley
     1/2         pound  cippolline -- peeled, and an X
                        cut into the base of each
     1/2           cup  red wine
     1/2           cup  fresh mint leaves
  5                     red jalapeÒos -- split, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/4" half moons

Lightly oil a pot large enough for the breast to fit it, cutting the meat into 2 or 3 pieces if necessary.  Pour in water to cover.  Add the salt and pepper, the oil and the herbs and cover.  Cook over medium-low heat until the water has evaporated and the meat has started to brown, about 2 hours.  Turn the meat and continue cooking until second side is deep golden brown adding more water if necessary.  When very tender, remove to a serving platter.

Degrease the pan and add the cippolline.  Saute over high heat until lightly browned.  Return the meat to the pan and add the wine.  Cover and simmer until the onions are cooked, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Let the meat rest 5 minutes before slicing.  Finish with mint leaves and chilis and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Lightly oil a pot large enough for the breast to fit it, cutting the meat into 2 or 3 pieces if necessary.  Pour in water to cover.  Add the salt and pepper, the oil and the herbs and cover.  Cook over medium-low heat until the water has evaporated and the meat has started to brown, about 2 hours.  Turn the meat and continue cooking until second side is deep golden brown adding more water if necessary.  When very tender, remove to a serving platter.

          Cheese Filled Little Hats - {Cappelletti Al Formaggi}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  creamy fresh whole-milk ricotta
     1/2           cup  fresh squaquerone cheese
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus a piece
                        to grate over finished dish
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated lemon zest
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
  1                     egg yolk
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
  1              quart  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)

In a large bowl, blend the ricotta, the squaquerone, the Parmigiano-Reggiano, the lemon zest, the pepper, nutmeg and salt to taste.  Check the seasoning, stir in the egg yolk, cover and chill 2 hours or overnight before proceeding.

Remove the filling from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature 10 minutes.

Divide the pasta dough into 3 equally-sized balls and roll them out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut each sheet into 2-inch squares.

In the center of each square, place tablespoons of the filling.  Fold diagonally-opposite corners to meet each other to form the cappelletti.  Place the cappelletti on a sheet tray dusted with semolina flour, and cover with clean, damp dish towels or hold in the freezer until ready to use.

Bring the chicken stock to a boil and add salt if necessary.  Drop the capellatti in the chicken stock, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pot.  Cook for 2 minutes, remove from heat and serve immediately with a ladle of the broth spooned over, and topped with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  superfine sugar
  1              pinch  fine sea salt
  1                     lemon -- zested
  2             sticks  chilled sweet butter -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  vin santo -- cold, plus
                        a bottle for your friends
  2               cups  red cherry jam
  2                     or 3 turns of the peppermill

Pulse the flour, sugar, salt and zest 2 or 3 times in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade.  Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks together with the cold vin santo.  With the machine running, add the egg/sherry mixture to the dough through the feed tube.  Process 5 to 6 seconds or until the mass combines and leaves the sides of the bowl.  Permit the pastry to rest for 30 minutes, wrapped securely in plastic, in a cool place.

Thin the cherry jam a bit with a little hot water, stirring well to combine.  Add a few grindings of pepper to heighten the flavor of the cherries and stir again.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Roll out the dough in a free-form circle of about 12 inches, and transfer it to a buttered baking sheet or a sheet lined with parchment.  Leaving a 2-inch border uncovered, spread the cherry mixture over the dough, folding, pleating, and tucking the border of the dough up over the fruit.

Bake the tart for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pastry is deeply golden and the fruit is glossy.  Cool on a rack for several minutes and serve warm with a glass of the vin santo.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried chestnuts -- soaked overnight
                        in cold water
  2               cups  milk
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3              heads  treviso radicchio -- cut 1/4" pieces
  1                cup  ricotta
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano -- plus
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
  8        tablespoons  sweet butter

Place the drained chestnuts in a 2-quart pot with the milk and bring to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer until very soft, about 1 hour.  Remove the chestnuts and set aside the cooking liquid.  Mash the chestnut thoroughly with a fork or puree until smooth in a food processor.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan heat the oil until smoking.  Add the treviso and cook until soft and quite dark, about 8 minutes.  In a large mixing bowl stir together the chestnut puree, the cooked treviso, the ricotta and the Parmigiano until well blended.

Roll the Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough on the thinnest setting and cut the dough into 2-inch squares.  Place a teaspoon of the filling in the center of half of the squares and place the remaining squares over the top to form square ravioli.  Press the edges carefully to close and set aside until ready to eat.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  In a 12- or 14-inch saute pan melt the butter over medium heat.  Drop the ravioli into the boiling water and cook until tender, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the treviso to the butter and stir to mix.  Remove the ravioli from the boiling water and carefully place in the pan with the butter.  Toss gently over medium heat until the pasta is well dressed and serve immediately with grated Parmigiano on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Place the drained chestnuts in a 2-quart pot with the milk and bring to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer until very soft, about 1 hour.  Remove the chestnuts and set aside the cooking liquid.  Mash the chestnut thoroughly with a fork or puree until smooth in a food processor.

<DirT>
In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan heat the oil until smoking.  Add the treviso and cook until soft and quite dark, about 8 minutes.  In a large mixing bowl stir together the chestnut puree, the cooked treviso, the ricotta and the Parmigiano until well blended.

Roll the Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough on the thinnest setting and cut the dough into 2-inch squares.  Place a teaspoon of the filling in the center of half of the squares and place the remaining squares over the top to form square ravioli.  Press the edges carefully to close and set aside until ready to eat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  In a 12- or 14-inch saute pan melt the butter over medium heat.  Drop the ravioli into the boiling water and cook until tender, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the treviso to the butter and stir to mix.  Remove the ravioli from the boiling water and carefully place in the pan with the butter.  Toss gently over medium heat until the pasta is well dressed and serve immediately with grated Parmigiano on the side.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  chestnut flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  walnut pieces
  2               cups  milk
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves -- divided
     1/4         pound  lardo, pork fatback -- finely chopped
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- finely chopped
  2                     fresh garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a large mixing bowl, place flour, sugar and walnuts.  Add 1/2 cup cold milk and slowly add the rest of the milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps forming in the batter.

Grease a 9-inch, non-stick baking pan with 1 tablespoon oil and pour in the batter.  Drizzle the top with the remaining oil and distribute 2 tablespoons rosemary evenly over the top.  Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

While castagnaccio is cooking, combine the lardo, the remaining 1 tablespoon rosemary, prosciutto, garlic and freshly ground black pepper to taste.  Stir well to combine and set aside.  Remove castagnaccio and serve warm with a thin layer of lardo spread on top.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     chicken breasts - (8 oz ea)
  4                     large slices prosciutto
  4              large  sage leaves -- plus
  20             small  sage leaves
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     shallots -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  oyster mushrooms -- sliced 1/4" pieces
  1                cup  Marsala wine
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley

Season the flour with salt and pepper.

With a meat mallet, pound the chicken breasts to 1/4-inch thickness.  Season each breast with salt and pepper and lay 1 sage leaf on each breast.  Lay 1 slice prosciutto over each piece and fold in half like a book.  Secure the two sides with a toothpick and dredge each breast in the seasoned flour.

In a heavy-bottomed pot with high sides, heat the 2 cups olive oil to 375 degrees.  Make sure that you have a slotted spoon or spider close by.  Working in a few batches, fry the small sage leaves in the oil, removing with the slotted spoon after 30 seconds.  Season with salt, set on a plate lined with paper towels to drain, and set aside.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the remaining olive oil until smoking.  Add the chicken and saute until golden brown on both sides.  Add the shallots and mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms have sweated, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the Marsala and chicken stock and cook over high heat until reduce by half.  Swirl the butter into the pan, add the parsley and serve on 4 warmed dinner plates, topped with the fried sage leaves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  3        tablespoons  canola oil
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             ounces  pancetta -- diced
  2             ounces  dried porcini mushrooms -- soaked until tender
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  1                     celery rib -- finely chopped
  1                     carrot -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
  4                     sweet Italian sausage links -- removed from casing
  1                cup  red wine
  1                can  San Marzano tomatoes - (16 oz)
  1           teaspoon  red chili flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-grated pecorino romano

Place the whole potatoes in a saucepan with water to cover.  Bring to a boil and cook at a low boil until they are soft, about 45 minutes.  While still warm, peel the potatoes and pass them through a vegetable mill onto a clean pasta board.

Bring about 6 quarts to a boil.  Set up an ice bath with 6 cups ice water and 6 cups water nearby.

Make a well in the center of the potatoes and sprinkle all over with the flour.  Break the egg into the center of the well, add the salt, and, using a fork, stir into the flour and potatoes as if you were making pasta.  Once the egg is mixed in, bring the dough together, kneading gently until a ball is formed.  Knead gently another 4 minutes, until ball is dry to the touch.

Divide the dough into 2 large balls.  Roll each ball into 3/4-inch-diameter ropes and cut the ropes into 1-inch-long pieces.  Flick the pieces off of a fork or along the concave side of a cheese grater to score the sides.  Drop the dough pieces into the boiling water and cook until they float to the surface, about 1 minute.  Use a slotted spoon to transfer the gnocchi to the ice bath.  Meanwhile, continue with the remaining dough, forming ropes, cutting 1-inch pieces, and flicking them off a fork.  Continue until all the gnocchi have been cooked and allow them to sit several minutes in the ice bath.

Drain the gnocchi and transfer to a mixing bowl.  Toss with the canola oil and store covered in the refrigerator for up to 48 hours or until ready to serve.

In a 12- to 14-inch skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat until almost smoking.  Add the pancetta, porcini, garlic, onion, celery, carrot, parsley and the sausage meat and cook over high heat until sausage and vegetables are browned.  Add the red wine, let it evaporate, then add the tomatoes and the pepper flakes.  Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper and lower heat to a simmer.  Let cook for 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Once the sauce is thickened to the proper consistency, remove the gnocchi from their container and cook in the boiling water until they float aggressively.  Drain the gnocchi and add to the simmering sauce.  Toss very gently over heat 30 seconds to coat, then divide evenly among 4 warmed pasta bowls.  Top with freshly grated pecorino and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

        Deep-Fried Cauliflower - {Cavolofiore Fritto In Pastella}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  yeast
  2        tablespoons  white wine
  1                cup  flour
  1              whole  egg -- plus
  1                     egg yolk
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1              quart  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 3/4         pounds  cauliflower florets
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Dissolve the yeast in the wine, then, in a large mixing bowl, combine it with the egg, flour, yolk, 2 tablespoons oil, and salt and pepper.  Let the batter rest for 2 hours.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the cauliflower in the boiling water until tender yet al dente, about 8 minutes.  Drain, refresh in an ice bath, then drain and pat dry with paper towels.  Set aside.

Place the quart of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot with tall sides and heat to 375 degrees.  Dip the cauliflower into the batter, letting the excess drip off, and fry the battered pieces in the hot oil until golden brown.  Work in batches to avoid lowering the temperature of the oil.  Sprinkle the pieces with salt as soon as they are removed from the oil, let drain on paper towels, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Dissolve the yeast in the wine, then, in a large mixing bowl, combine it with the egg, flour, yolk, 2 tablespoons oil, and salt and pepper.  Let the batter rest for 2 hours.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the cauliflower in the boiling water until tender yet al dente, about 8 minutes.  Drain, refresh in an ice bath, then drain and pat dry with paper towels.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the quart of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot with tall sides and heat to 375 degrees.  Dip the cauliflower into the batter, letting the excess drip off, and fry the battered pieces in the hot oil until golden brown.  Work in batches to avoid lowering the temperature of the oil.  Sprinkle the pieces with salt as soon as they are removed from the oil, let drain on paper towels, and serve.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley

Add the vinegar, cherry tomatoes, peperoncino, canned whole tomato, cuttlefish and wine.  Allow to come up to a simmer and then cook for 10 minutes.

Add the Branzino (sea or stripped bass) by placing on top of the broth and very gently pushing the fish down.  Allow to cook 5 minutes.  Add the mussels, razor clams, langoustine, shrimp, and squid by placing on top of broth and fish gently pushing down with a large ladle and basting the shell fish with the hot broth.

Cover stockpot with a lid and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until mussels and clams are all open and langoustine shrimp and squid are cooked through.  Taste and season with salt and pepper.  Carefully remove to serving platter and sprinkle parsley on top.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                         Gnocchi With Prosciutto

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     thin slices prosciutto di Parma -- roughly sliced
                        into 1/4" ribbons
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        === GNOCCHI ===
  3             pounds  baking potatoes, like russets
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1                     extra-large egg
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  canola oil

For the Gnocchi:  Boil the whole potatoes until they are soft (about 45 minutes).  While still warm, peel and pass through vegetable mill onto clean pasta board.

Boil 6 quarts of water in a large stock pot.

Make well in center of potatoes and sprinkle with the salt and all the flour.  Crack the egg into the center of well and using a fork, incorporate the potatoes, salt, flour and egg.  Once egg is mixed in, bring dough together, kneading gently until a ball is formed.  Knead gently another 4 minutes until ball is dry to touch.

Roll baseball-sized balls of dough into 3/4-inch diameter rods.  With a knife, cut the rods into 1-inch long pieces.  Lightly roll pieces off of the back end of a fork, or the concave side of cheese grater, until all the pieces are finished.  Drop these finished pieces into boiling water and cook until they float (about 1 minute).

Meanwhile, continue with remaining dough, forming rods, cutting into 1-inch pieces and flicking off of fork.  As gnocchi float to top of boiling water, remove them with a spider or skimmer and place them in a bowl with a 1/2-cup of canola, tossing to coat so they donít stick together.

Gnocchi can be made up to 48 hours ahead.  Before cooking the gnocchi, set up ice bath with 6 cups ice and 6 cups water.  As the gnocchi cook and are floating in the boiling water, remove them with a spider or skimmer and place them into the to ice bath.  Let sit several minutes in bath and drain from ice and water.  Toss with 1/2-cup canola oil and store covered in refrigerator up to 48 hours until ready to serve.

In a large saute pan heat the butter, add the cooked gnocchi tossing gently in the butter.  Add the Parmigiano-Reggiano tossing to combine, once the gnocchi are coated with the butter and cheese remove the pan from the heat and add the prosciutto tossing to combine.  Finish the dish with a small dusting of freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

For the Gnocchi:  Boil the whole potatoes until they are soft (about 45 minutes).  While still warm, peel and pass through vegetable mill onto clean pasta board.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Boil 6 quarts of water in a large stock pot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make well in center of potatoes and sprinkle with the salt and all the flour.  Crack the egg into the center of well and using a fork, incorporate the potatoes, salt, flour and egg.  Once egg is mixed in, bring dough together, kneading gently until a ball is formed.  Knead gently another 4 minutes until ball is dry to touch.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll baseball-sized balls of dough into 3/4-inch diameter rods.  With a knife, cut the rods into 1-inch long pieces.  Lightly roll pieces off of the back end of a fork, or the concave side of cheese grater, until all the pieces are finished.  Drop these finished pieces into boiling water and cook until they float (about 1 minute).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, continue with remaining dough, forming rods, cutting into 1-inch pieces and flicking off of fork.  As gnocchi float to top of boiling water, remove them with a spider or skimmer and place them in a bowl with a 1/2-cup of canola, tossing to coat so they donít stick together.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Gnocchi can be made up to 48 hours ahead.  Before cooking the gnocchi, set up ice bath with 6 cups ice and 6 cups water.  As the gnocchi cook and are floating in the boiling water, remove them with a spider or skimmer and place them into the to ice bath.  Let sit several minutes in bath and drain from ice and water.  Toss with 1/2-cup canola oil and store covered in refrigerator up to 48 hours until ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large saute pan heat the butter, add the cooked gnocchi tossing gently in the butter.  Add the Parmigiano-Reggiano tossing to combine, once the gnocchi are coated with the butter and cheese remove the pan from the heat and add the prosciutto tossing to combine.  Finish the dish with a small dusting of freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  baby spinach leaves -- washed
  4                     extra-large eggs
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour - (to 4 cups)
     1/2      teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil

Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil.  Place a bowl filled with water and ice next to the stove top.  Plunge the spinach into the boiling water and blanch for 1 minute.  Remove from the boiling water with a slotted spoon and immerse in the ice water.  When cooled, remove from the water, squeeze in a towel to dry and place in the bowl of a food processor.  Puree until a very fine paste forms.

In a bowl, combine the spinach puree and the eggs and stir well to combine.  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and spinach and the olive oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly re-flour the board and continue kneading for six more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Roll out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut the pasta into 1/4-inch wide ribbons, place on a sheet tray that has been liberally sprinkled with semolina flour, cover with clean towels and set aside.

This recipe yields 1 pound of pasta, enough for 4 servings.

Comments:  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are essential for a light pasta.  Mario's earlier recipe from 1996 called for 6 ounces of frozen spinach that was thawed, drained, and squeezed very dry in place of the fresh baby spinach.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus more for
                        coating and frying
  3               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  finely-ground polenta
  11                    salt-packed anchovies
  6                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  capers -- rinsed, drained
     1/2           cup  flour
  3                     eggs -- beaten
  1                     puntarelle head -- cut 1/8" strips,
                        in ice water 10 minutes, drained, dried
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Brush a large cookie sheet with olive oil and set aside.

In a medium saucepan, heat the water to a boil and add the salt.  Whisking vigorously, pour in the polenta, slowly, in a thin stream, and cook until quite thick, about 1 minute, switching to a wooden spoon to stir as the polenta thickens.  Pour the polenta out onto a cookie sheet and spread out flat until it covers the sheet, about 1/8-inch to 1/4-inch thick.  Allow to cool 1 hour.

Rinse the anchovies and remove the heads, fins and bones.  In a small saucepan, heat 1/4-cup olive oil over medium heat with the garlic and cook until just light brown.  Add the anchovies and capers and stir until broken up into a paste.  Remove from heat and set aside.

Pour 3 inches of oil into a 6-inch tall frying pan and heat to 360 degrees.  While the oil is heating, cut the polenta into 2-inch rounds, using a grappa glass or cookie cutter, yielding about 40 pieces.

Place 1/4-teaspoon anchovy mixture on 1 polenta disk and make a sandwich by covering it with a second polenta disk.  Dredge each sandwich in flour, then in egg and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Continue until all the sandwiches are finished.

In a medium bowl, combine the puntarelle, remaining 1/4-cup olive oil, lemon juice and the remainder of the anchovy mixture.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and toss well to coat.  Serve with the little sandwiches.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Brush a large cookie sheet with olive oil and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium saucepan, heat the water to a boil and add the salt.  Whisking vigorously, pour in the polenta, slowly, in a thin stream, and cook until quite thick, about 1 minute, switching to a wooden spoon to stir as the polenta thickens.  Pour the polenta out onto a cookie sheet and spread out flat until it covers the sheet, about 1/8-inch to 1/4-inch thick.  Allow to cool 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rinse the anchovies and remove the heads, fins and bones.  In a small saucepan, heat 1/4-cup olive oil over medium heat with the garlic and cook until just light brown.  Add the anchovies and capers and stir until broken up into a paste.  Remove from heat and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour 3 inches of oil into a 6-inch tall frying pan and heat to 360 degrees.  While the oil is heating, cut the polenta into 2-inch rounds, using a grappa glass or cookie cutter, yielding about 40 pieces.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 1/4-teaspoon anchovy mixture on 1 polenta disk and make a sandwich by covering it with a second polenta disk.  Dredge each sandwich in flour, then in egg and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Continue until all the sandwiches are finished.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium bowl, combine the puntarelle, remaining 1/4-cup olive oil, lemon juice and the remainder of the anchovy mixture.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and toss well to coat.  Serve with the little sandwiches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            pounds  lamb shoulder -- cut small pieces
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  dry red wine
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary
  1                cup  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  6              large  eggs
     2/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1                     lemon -- juiced
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley

Rinse the meat, pat dry and set aside.

In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and cook over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes.  Season the meat with salt and pepper and add to the skillet to brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Work in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan.

Add the rosemary and wine and let the wine evaporate.  Add 1/4 cup of the Brown Chicken Stock, cover and reduce the heat to low.  Moisten with the chicken stock as necessary to avoid scorching.  Cook for 1 to 2 hours, until the meat is very tender.

In a medium bowl, beat the eggs, cheese, a pinch of pepper, the lemon juice and parsley and pour the mixture over the cooked meat.  Stir and cook over medium heat a few minutes, until the eggs coagulate.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

        Little Pies With Wild Mushrooms - {Panzerotti Ai Finferli}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Mushrooms

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus more for frying
     3/4         pound  chanterelles mushrooms -- cleaned, and
                        roughly chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
     1/2           cup  mascarpone
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === PASTRY DOUGH ===
     1/4           cup  light red or white wine, such as
                        Fiano del Avellino
     3/4           cup  warm water
  1 1/2         ounces  yeast cake
  1         tablespoon  honey
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided

Prepare the Pastry Dough:  In a large bowl, combine wine, water and yeast and stir until dissolved.  Add the honey, salt and olive oil and mix thoroughly.  Add 1 cup of flour and mix with a wooden spoon until it becomes a loose batter.  Add 2 more cups of flour and stir with the spoon for another 2 to 3 minutes, to incorporate as much of the flour as possible.

Bring the dough together with your hands and turn it out onto a floured board or marble surface.  Knead for about 6 to 8 minutes, until you have made a firm, smooth dough.  Place it in a clean, lightly-oiled bowl and cover it with a towel.  Let it rise in the warmest part of the kitchen for 45 minutes.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the oil over high heat until smoking.  Add the mushrooms and saute over high heat until browned.  Add the garlic, parsley, mascarpone and salt and pepper to taste, stir in, and remove from heat.

Roll pastry dough out to an even thickness.  With a water glass or cookie cutter, cut into 2 1/2-inch diameter circles.

Spoon some of the filling onto one half of each of the pastry circles.  Fold each circle over on itself and press the edges to make a seal.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat about 1/2 cup olive oil over high heat until almost smoking.  Fry the pastries in the oil until golden-browned on both sides.  Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels, then serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Prepare the Pastry Dough:  In a large bowl, combine wine, water and yeast and stir until dissolved.  Add the honey, salt and olive oil and mix thoroughly.  Add 1 cup of flour and mix with a wooden spoon until it becomes a loose batter.  Add 2 more cups of flour and stir with the spoon for another 2 to 3 minutes, to incorporate as much of the flour as possible.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring the dough together with your hands and turn it out onto a floured board or marble surface.  Knead for about 6 to 8 minutes, until you have made a firm, smooth dough.  Place it in a clean, lightly-oiled bowl and cover it with a towel.  Let it rise in the warmest part of the kitchen for 45 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the oil over high heat until smoking.  Add the mushrooms and saute over high heat until browned.  Add the garlic, parsley, mascarpone and salt and pepper to taste, stir in, and remove from heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll pastry dough out to an even thickness.  With a water glass or cookie cutter, cut into 2 1/2-inch diameter circles.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon some of the filling onto one half of each of the pastry circles.  Fold each circle over on itself and press the edges to make a seal.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat about 1/2 cup olive oil over high heat until almost smoking.  Fry the pastries in the oil until golden-browned on both sides.  Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels, then serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh anchovies
  2               cups  white wine vinegar
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano
  2        tablespoons  red chili flakes
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
  4                     garlic cloves -- sliced paper thin
  2        tablespoons  sea salt

Using scissors, trim the fins off of all the anchovies.  Using a sharp paring knife, gut the fish and rinse well.  Cut off the heads and carefully remove the spine and pin bones by pulling from the top with the index finger and thumbnail.  Separate the 2 fillets and rinse again.

Lay 1 layer of the fillets in a deep oval quiche plate and sprinkle over with vinegar.  Continue until all the fish fillets are in the plate and pour over the rest of the vinegar.  Let sit to marinate for at least 4 hours in the refrigerator.

Drain each anchovy from the vinegar, rinse and pat dry with a kitchen towel.  Wash out the oval quiche plate and dry well.  Lay the cured anchovies into the quiche plate one layer at a time with 2 or 3 tablespoons olive oil, a pinch of oregano, a sprinkle of chili flakes, a sprinkle of parsley, a couple of garlic slices and a sprinkle of salt.  Layer until all of the anchovies are finished and allow to marinate at least 2 hours, refrigerated.

To serve, bring anchovies to cellar temperature, just about 58 degrees, and place 8 or 9 on each plate drained of oil.  The cured anchovies will last like this for 1 week in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  prosciutto fat -- half cut in strips,
                        the other half diced
  3             pounds  beef topside (top round)
  6                     whole cloves
  2             ounces  prosciutto rind -- scraped, cleaned,
                        and diced
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                     scallion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     celery rib -- coarsely chopped
  1                     carrot -- coarsely chopped
     1/2         bunch  Italian parsley -- tied to
  2                     bay leaves -- with kitchen string
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed flat
  1                cup  red wine
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Season the strips of prosciutto fat with salt and pepper and use them to lard the beef.  Stick the cloves in the meat.

Combine the remaining fat and the rind in a pan that just holds the meat.  Add the butter, scallion, celery, carrot, parsley bundle and garlic and cook over high heat for a few minutes, until the vegetables begin to brown.  Add the meat and brown it over high heat.  Add the wine and let it evaporate.

Meanwhile, dissolve the tomato paste in 1/2 cup boiling water and add it to the pot.  Add enough additional boiling water so that the meat is just barely covered.  Cover and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes, or until the meat is very tender.  Remove the meat and set aside.  Reduce the sauce for another 30 minutes, uncovered.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  oxtail -- cut 1/2-lb chunks
                        by your butcher, and rinsed
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             ounces  pancetta -- cut into lardons
  2                     carrots -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1                cup  dry white wine -- divided
  5                     celery stalks -- ribs finely chopped,
                        leaves removed and finely chopped
  1              pinch  red chili flakes
  1              pinch  cinnamon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Lemon -- for garnish

Bring 6 cups of water to a boil and add the oxtails.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook 10 minutes.  Drain the oxtail, reserving the broth, and set the meat aside.  Measure out 2 cups of the broth and discard the rest.  Dissolve the tomato paste in the 2 cups of broth and set aside.

In a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over high heat until smoking.  Add the pancetta and saute until golden brown.  Add the oxtails, 1 or 2 pieces at a time, and brown on all sides.  Add the chopped carrots, half the parsley, onion and garlic and saute until vegetables are browned.  Add 1/2 cup of the white wine and reduce the heat to a simmer.  Cook, uncovered, until the wine is reduced by half.  Add the remaining wine and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Pour the tomato paste-broth mixture over the meat.  Cover and simmer for 2 hours.

After 2 hours, add the celery ribs and cook, covered, for 15 minutes more.  Remove from heat.  Make a salad with the chopped celery leaves, the remaining parsley, the chili flakes, cinnamon and salt and pepper to taste.  Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and lemon.  Divide the oxtails evenly among 6 warmed pasta bowls and top with salad.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1 1/2           cups  dried green or brown lentils, preferably

                        for several hours

  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
                        === MEATBALLS ===
  3               cups  day-old bread cut in 1" cubes
     3/4         pound  ground pork
     1/4         pound  ground beef
  3                     eggs -- beaten
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     3/4           cup  Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

For the Pie Crust:  In a large bowl combine the flour, lemon zest and butter with a pastry blender, your finger, or in a food processor until it resembles a coarse meal.  Add enough water so that the dough just comes together, divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and wrap each piece in plastic.  Allow to rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

For the Tortellini:  Make the Pasta Dough.  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and the olive oil.  Using a fork beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly re-flour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 1 hour in the refrigerator.

For the Tortellini Filling:  In a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed, large saucepan, heat the butter and oil until it foams and subsides.  Add the turkey, veal and pork shoulder and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the meat is well-browned and begins to release some of its juices.  Add the prosciutto and mortadella and cook for 5 minutes more.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.  Place in a food processor and mix to combine.  Add the egg and the Parmigiano-Reggiano and mix well to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and add at least 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg and mix again.  Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.

To make the Tortellini:  Roll the tortellini pasta into sheets using a pasta machine.  For the desired pasta sheet thickness, gradually pass the dough through the settings starting with the widest and continuing to the number 9 setting.

With a pasta cutter or a knife, cut the pasta into 1 1/2-inch squares.  Place 3/4 teaspoon of filling in the center of each square.  Fold into triangles, press out any air around the filling, and press to seal the edges.  Bring the points of the long side together to form a ring, and seal between your fingers.

Set the tortellini aside on a sheet pan, wrap well with plastic wrap and refrigerate.  Reserve for later assembly.

For the Ragu Bolognesi:  In a 6- to 8-quart, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat.  Add onion, celery, carrot and garlic and sweat over medium heat until vegetables are translucent.  Add veal, pork, beef and pancetta and stir into vegetables.  Brown over high heat, stirring to keep meat from sticking together.  This should take 15 to 20 minutes.

Add tomatoes and simmer 15 minutes.  Add the milk and simmer until reduced to nothing, about 10 minutes.  Add the wine and brodo, bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer over for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  Season with salt and pepper to taste and remove from heat.  (Makes 6 1/2 cups)

For the Besciamela:  In a medium saucepan, heat butter until melted.  Add flour and stir until smooth.  Over medium heat, cook until light golden brown, about 6 to 7 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat milk in separate pan until just about to boil.  Add milk to butter mixture 1 cup at a time, whisking continuously until very smooth and bring to a boil.  Cook 10 minutes and remove from heat.  Season with salt and nutmeg and set aside.  (Makes 3 cups)

For the Brown Chicken Stock:  In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil until smoking.  Add the chicken bones and scraps and brown all over, stirring to avoid burning.  Remove the chicken parts and reserve.  Add the carrots, onions and celery and cook until soft and browned.  Return the chicken bones to the pot and add 3 quarts of water, the tomato paste, peppercorns, and parsley, stirring to dislodge the browned chicken and vegetables bits from the bottom of the pan.  Bring almost to a boil, reduce to a simmer and allow to cook at a low simmer for 2 hours, until reduced by half, occasionally skimming excess fat.  After cooking, remove from heat and strain out all solids, pressing them with the bottom of a ladle to extract out all liquids.  Stir the stock to facilitate cooling and set aside to be used to cook the tortellini.

For Meat Balls:  In a shallow bowl, soak the bread cubes in enough water to cover.  Remove the bread cubes and squeeze by hand to remove excess moisture.

In a large bowl, combine the bread, pork, beef, eggs, garlic, Parmigiano, parsley, salt and pepper and mix by hand to incorporate bread into meat.  With wet hands, form the mixture into 25 to 28 meatballs, each about golf ball size.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet heat the oil until almost smoking.  Add the meatballs.  Working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan, and cook until deep golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.  Reserve browned meatballs for assembly.

To assemble the Pasticcio:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Roll out the pie crust dough to 2 (14-inch) ovals, and each 1/8-inch thick.  Wrap in plastic and reserve both crusts in the refrigerator.

Bring the chicken stock to a rapid boil.  Cook all of the tortellini in the stock for about 4 to 5 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente.  Drain the tortellini and gently toss with the Ragu Bolognesi, just to coat.  Add 3 whole eggs to the tortellini mixture so as to bind.  Carefully incorporate the eggs so as not to damage the integrity of the tortellini.  Reserve this mixture for the assembly.

Working in layers, place 1 of the crusts in the bottom of a 2 1/2-quart, oval casserole dish.  Allow the edge of the crust to drape over the sides of the dish.  Place 1/2 of the meatballs on the bottom of the casserole dish.  Spoon 1/2 of the tortellini mixture on top of the meatballs.  Drizzle 1 cup of the besciamela sauce on top of the pasta.  Next, sprinkle 1/2 of the cheese on top.  Pour the rest of the tortellini mixture into the casserole dish.  Place the rest of the meatballs on top of the pasta.  Drizzle the remaining besciamela on top of the meatballs.  Sprinkle the remaining Parmigiano on the top.

Top the casserole with the second pie crust.  Crimp the top and bottom piecrust edges together.  Create a vent on the top layer of crust with a sharp knife.  Brush the top of the pasticcio with an egg wash made from one beaten egg and 1 teaspoon of milk.

Bake in the oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until the crust is a deep golden brown.  Let rest 15 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

<DirS>
<DirT>
For the Pie Crust:  In a large bowl combine the flour, lemon zest and butter with a pastry blender, your finger, or in a food processor until it resembles a coarse meal.  Add enough water so that the dough just comes together, divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and wrap each piece in plastic.  Allow to rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Tortellini:  Make the Pasta Dough.  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and the olive oil.  Using a fork beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly re-flour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 1 hour in the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Tortellini Filling:  In a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed, large saucepan, heat the butter and oil until it foams and subsides.  Add the turkey, veal and pork shoulder and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the meat is well-browned and begins to release some of its juices.  Add the prosciutto and mortadella and cook for 5 minutes more.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.  Place in a food processor and mix to combine.  Add the egg and the Parmigiano-Reggiano and mix well to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and add at least 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg and mix again.  Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Tortellini:  Roll the tortellini pasta into sheets using a pasta machine.  For the desired pasta sheet thickness, gradually pass the dough through the settings starting with the widest and continuing to the number 9 setting.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With a pasta cutter or a knife, cut the pasta into 1 1/2-inch squares.  Place 3/4 teaspoon of filling in the center of each square.  Fold into triangles, press out any air around the filling, and press to seal the edges.  Bring the points of the long side together to form a ring, and seal between your fingers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set the tortellini aside on a sheet pan, wrap well with plastic wrap and refrigerate.  Reserve for later assembly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Ragu Bolognesi:  In a 6- to 8-quart, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat.  Add onion, celery, carrot and garlic and sweat over medium heat until vegetables are translucent.  Add veal, pork, beef and pancetta and stir into vegetables.  Brown over high heat, stirring to keep meat from sticking together.  This should take 15 to 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add tomatoes and simmer 15 minutes.  Add the milk and simmer until reduced to nothing, about 10 minutes.  Add the wine and brodo, bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer over for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  Season with salt and pepper to taste and remove from heat.  (Makes 6 1/2 cups)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Besciamela:  In a medium saucepan, heat butter until melted.  Add flour and stir until smooth.  Over medium heat, cook until light golden brown, about 6 to 7 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, heat milk in separate pan until just about to boil.  Add milk to butter mixture 1 cup at a time, whisking continuously until very smooth and bring to a boil.  Cook 10 minutes and remove from heat.  Season with salt and nutmeg and set aside.  (Makes 3 cups)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Brown Chicken Stock:  In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil until smoking.  Add the chicken bones and scraps and brown all over, stirring to avoid burning.  Remove the chicken parts and reserve.  Add the carrots, onions and celery and cook until soft and browned.  Return the chicken bones to the pot and add 3 quarts of water, the tomato paste, peppercorns, and parsley, stirring to dislodge the browned chicken and vegetables bits from the bottom of the pan.  Bring almost to a boil, reduce to a simmer and allow to cook at a low simmer for 2 hours, until reduced by half, occasionally skimming excess fat.  After cooking, remove from heat and strain out all solids, pressing them with the bottom of a ladle to extract out all liquids.  Stir the stock to facilitate cooling and set aside to be used to cook the tortellini.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Meat Balls:  In a shallow bowl, soak the bread cubes in enough water to cover.  Remove the bread cubes and squeeze by hand to remove excess moisture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, combine the bread, pork, beef, eggs, garlic, Parmigiano, parsley, salt and pepper and mix by hand to incorporate bread into meat.  With wet hands, form the mixture into 25 to 28 meatballs, each about golf ball size.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet heat the oil until almost smoking.  Add the meatballs.  Working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan, and cook until deep golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.  Reserve browned meatballs for assembly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble the Pasticcio:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out the pie crust dough to 2 (14-inch) ovals, and each 1/8-inch thick.  Wrap in plastic and reserve both crusts in the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring the chicken stock to a rapid boil.  Cook all of the tortellini in the stock for about 4 to 5 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente.  Drain the tortellini and gently toss with the Ragu Bolognesi, just to coat.  Add 3 whole eggs to the tortellini mixture so as to bind.  Carefully incorporate the eggs so as not to damage the integrity of the tortellini.  Reserve this mixture for the assembly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Working in layers, place 1 of the crusts in the bottom of a 2 1/2-quart, oval casserole dish.  Allow the edge of the crust to drape over the sides of the dish.  Place 1/2 of the meatballs on the bottom of the casserole dish.  Spoon 1/2 of the tortellini mixture on top of the meatballs.  Drizzle 1 cup of the besciamela sauce on top of the pasta.  Next, sprinkle 1/2 of the cheese on top.  Pour the rest of the tortellini mixture into the casserole dish.  Place the rest of the meatballs on top of the pasta.  Drizzle the remaining besciamela on top of the meatballs.  Sprinkle the remaining Parmigiano on the top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Top the casserole with the second pie crust.  Crimp the top and bottom piecrust edges together.  Create a vent on the top layer of crust with a sharp knife.  Brush the top of the pasticcio with an egg wash made from one beaten egg and 1 teaspoon of milk.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake in the oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until the crust is a deep golden brown.  Let rest 15 minutes before serving.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Categories    : Mushrooms                       Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1              small  onion -- finely diced
  1              pound  porcini mushrooms -- stems roughly choppe
                        and caps cut into thin strips
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
  4               cups  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  mascarpone
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  12                    thin baguette slices -- toasted

Stir in the remaining chicken broth and season with salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, add the reserved porcini caps and simmer 20 minutes.

In a small mixing bowl mix the mascarpone with the rosemary and the pepper.  Smear the mascarpone mixture on to the baguette slices and place 3 smeared slices in each of 4 bowls.  Ladle the soup over the crostini serve immediately.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  2               cups  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1           teaspoon  aceto balsamico -- plus
  1         tablespoon  aceto balsamico
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper
  1              pound  mortadella -- cut into 1/2" dice
  2               cups  red wine
     1/2           cup  brandied cherries drained of most of
                        their juices, or dried cherries, raisins
                        or slivers of candied orange zest
  1         tablespoon  sweet butter
  2        tablespoons  Nocino, or other walnut liqueur
  1                cup  walnut halves
                        Thin slices coarse-textured bread -- lightly oven-toasted

Warm the cream in a saucepan over low heat until it approaches a simmer.  Add the Parmigiano, stirring constantly to melt it completely.  Remove the cream and cheese mixture from the heat and add 1 teaspoon of the vinegar and a few generous grindings of pepper.

Place the mortadella pieces into a food processor and pulse until finely chopped.  With the motor on add the cream mixture in a slow steady stream until all cream has been taken in.  Taste for seasoning and pour into 6 or 8 individual dishes -- the white-fluted soufflÈ type or any "pudding" dish.  Cover tightly with plastic and refrigerate for several hours to set.

Meanwhile, build the sauce.  In a medium saucepan, reduce the red wine by half its volume; lower the flame and add the cherries, gently simmering together for 5 minutes.  Add the butter and simmer for another minute.

Off the heat, add the remaining tablespoon of vinegar and the walnut liqueur, stirring well to blend.  Set aside.

Remove the mousse from the refrigerator 1/2 hour before serving.  Place the individual dishes on large, flat plates.  Place some walnut halves and a few pieces of toast on each plate and drizzle the warm cherry sauce over the mousse.

At the table, a little of the mousse and its sauce is spread on toast and topped with a piece of walnut.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

         Pork Ribs With Polenta - {Puntine Di Maiale Con Polenta}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  lean country-style pork spare ribs
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  4        tablespoons  chopped Italian parsley
  2              large  bay leaves
                        Generous pinch ground cloves
                        Generous pinch ground cinnamon
                        Generous pinch ground allspice
  1                cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  small Ligurian or Nicoise black olives -- pitted
  1              bunch  fresh basil -- cut into chiffonade
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GRILLED POLENTA ===
  3               cups  water
  1                cup  quick-cooking polenta or yellow cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Trim the excess fat from the meat.  If the pork is in 1 piece, separate it into pieces by cutting between the ribs.

Heat the oil in a 12-inch saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the meat in a single layer.  Take about 20 minutes to brown it slowly, until dark brown and crusty on all sides.  Remove the meat to a platter.

Keep the heat at medium as you stir in the onion and parsley.  Cook 10 minutes, or until golden brown, taking care not to burn the glaze in the bottom of the pan.  Stir frequently.  Stir in the bay leaves and spices.

Return the meat to the pan, turning to coat it with the vegetables and seasonings.  Pour in the wine, adjusting the heat so that it bubbles slowly.  As the wine cooks down over 10 to 15 minutes, use a wooden spatula to scrape up the browned bits at the bottom of the pan.

Add the tomato sauce.  Stir in the olives, and bring the mixture to a very slow bubble over low heat.  Cover tightly and cook over low heat 1 hour.  Season with salt and pepper.  Skim any fat from the surface of the sauce.  Sprinkle basil over and serve with grilled polenta.

For the Grilled Polenta:  In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil.  Add the polenta, gradually, stirring constantly with a whisk.  Lower heat to a simmer, season with salt, and cook 5 to 7 minutes, until the consistency of thick oatmeal.

Pour the polenta into a clean, but not greased 9- by 13-inch baking dish and allow to cool for 30 minutes.

Preheat the grill or broiler.  Cut the polenta into quarters, then halve each quarter diagonally to make 8 wedges.  Brush the wedges with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, set over the grill, and cook until slightly charred and crispy, about 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  5              large  red beets
  12                    jumbo asparagus spears
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1                cup  frisee salad -- washed, spun dry
  1              piece  Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for shaving

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Spread the kosher salt on a cookie sheet large enough to hold the beets and place the unpeeled beets on the salt.  Place in the oven and cook for 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, cut off the woody bottom inch of the asparagus and peel the last three inches of the bottom of the stalk and set aside.

When the 45 minutes have passed, open the oven door and carefully lay the asparagus around the beets on top of the salt.  Return to oven and cook 15 minutes more.  Remove from the oven and remove the asparagus to a platter.  Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with a bit of the salt in the roasting pan.

Allow the beets to cool 5 minutes and then peel them.  Cut the peeled beets into 1/4-inch dice and place in a kitchen bowl.  Dress the beets with the vinegar and remaining oil and season them with salt and pepper.  Add the frisee to the beet bowl and toss to mix well.

Arrange the beet and frisee mixture over the asparagus, shave shards of Parmigiano over and serve.

     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             ounces  pancetta -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1                     chicken - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs) -- cut 8 pieces

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta                           Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/4           cups  flour
  3                     eggs -- lightly beaten, plus
  1                     egg
     1/4           cup  water
  6             quarts  water
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1              large  green cabbage head -- cored, and
                        roughly chopped
  2        tablespoons  butter
  4             ounces  fresh salami -- casing removed
     2/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To make the dough, mound the flour in the center of the work surface.  Make a well in the center of the flour.  Add the 3 beaten eggs and 1/4 cup water to the center of the well and begin to incorporate the liquid into the flour with a fork, a little at a time, until all liquid is incorporated.  Work the dough until it comes together in 1 mass.  Knead the dough for 10 minutes, then allow it to rest for 30 minutes.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the cabbage in the boiling water until it is tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain the cabbage and refresh in an ice bath.  Once the cabbage is cooled, drain again and press between clean kitchen towels or paper towels to absorb all excess moisture.  Finely chop the blanched cabbage and set aside.

In a 14- to 16-inch skillet, heat the butter until it foams and subsides.  Add the salami and cook over high heat 5 minutes, until the meat is well-browned.  Add the cabbage and cook over medium heat, stirring to keep the meat or cabbage from sticking, until the cabbage is of an almost creamy consistency.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Once the mixture is cooled, stir in the grated cheese and the remaining 1 egg.  Season with salt and pepper and refrigerate, covered, until ready to stuff the pastry.

Roll the dough out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut the dough into 3-inch squares.  On half of the squares, place a tablespoon of the cabbage and salami mixture.  Cover each filled square with another square, brush with water and press around the edges to seal.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Cook the pastries in the boiling water for 5 minutes.  Remove from the water, drain and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  4                     fennel bulbs -- fronds removed,
                        finely chopped and set aside
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced

  4             ounces  Sambuca or other anise liqueur

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried chestnuts -- soaked overnight
                        in cool water
  2               cups  milk
  5                     eggs -- separated, plus
  2                     egg yolks
  4             ounces  fontina -- grated
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus a piece
                        for grating over the top
  1 1/4           cups  fresh bread crumbs -- toasted, divided
                        Several gratings fresh nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place puree in a large mixing bowl and add the 7 yolks, the fontina the Parmigiano, 1 cup of the breadcrumbs and the nutmeg and season with salt and pepper.  Butter a bundt pan and sprinkle with remaining bread crumbs.

Whip the egg whites to soft peaks and carefully fold into the chestnut mixture.  Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and place pan in the oven for 40 to 45 minutes, until a tooothpick pierced at the thickest part leaves just clean.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool 5 minutes.  Using a sharp knife, carefully loosen the edges around the outside and inside perimeters and invert onto a plate.  Grate Parmigiano over and serve warm.

                Stuffed Artichokes - {Carciofi Ripieni} II

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              slice  day-old bread
  6             medium  artichokes -- cleaned, and
                        choke removed
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1              pound  lean ground beef
  3                     eggs
  2                     garlic cloves -- divided, and
                        finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/4            cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1                can  San Marzano tomatoes - (16 oz) -- with their juices
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley

Soak the bread in water, then remove from the water and squeeze out remaining liquid.  Set aside.

Cut each trimmed artichoke into 2 pieces and hold in a water bath to which the lemon juice has been added until ready to use.

In a medium-sized bowl, combine the beef, soaked bread, 1 egg, 1 clove garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and a pinch of freshly ground black pepper and mix well to combine.  Form the mixture into 24 oval-shaped balls of about 1-inch diameter.

Remove the artichoke pieces from the acidulated water and pat dry with a paper towel.  Place 1 meatball between 2 pieces of artichoke, pressing to hold together.  Roll each "sandwich" in flour, patting off the excess, and lay each on a sheet tray.

In a small bowl, beat the remaining 2 eggs and add a pinch of salt.

In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 1 cup of the olive oil over high heat until just smoking.  Dip the artichokes in the egg mixture, let the excess drip off, and cook in the hot oil until they are golden brown on all sides.  Work in batches if necessary, to avoid lowering the temperature of the oil.  Remove the artichokes from the oil with a spider or slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

In a skillet large enough to hold the artichokes in a single layer, arrange the artichokes and add the tomatoes and their juices, the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, the remaining clove of garlic, the onion, parsley and salt and pepper, to taste.  Cook over medium heat, lowering if necessary to avoid scorching, for 20 to 30 minutes, until the liquids are of a fairly thick consistency.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Soak the bread in water, then remove from the water and squeeze out remaining liquid.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut each trimmed artichoke into 2 pieces and hold in a water bath to which the lemon juice has been added until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium-sized bowl, combine the beef, soaked bread, 1 egg, 1 clove garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and a pinch of freshly ground black pepper and mix well to combine.  Form the mixture into 24 oval-shaped balls of about 1-inch diameter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the artichoke pieces from the acidulated water and pat dry with a paper towel.  Place 1 meatball between 2 pieces of artichoke, pressing to hold together.  Roll each &quot;sandwich&quot; in flour, patting off the excess, and lay each on a sheet tray.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, beat the remaining 2 eggs and add a pinch of salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 1 cup of the olive oil over high heat until just smoking.  Dip the artichokes in the egg mixture, let the excess drip off, and cook in the hot oil until they are golden brown on all sides.  Work in batches if necessary, to avoid lowering the temperature of the oil.  Remove the artichokes from the oil with a spider or slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a skillet large enough to hold the artichokes in a single layer, arrange the artichokes and add the tomatoes and their juices, the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, the remaining clove of garlic, the onion, parsley and salt and pepper, to taste.  Cook over medium heat, lowering if necessary to avoid scorching, for 20 to 30 minutes, until the liquids are of a fairly thick consistency.  Serve immediately.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  green cabbage head
  1 1/2         pounds  ground turkey
  1                cup  fresh breadcrumbs -- toasted, divided
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley -- divided
     1/2        medium  red onion -- finely chopped
  10                    sage leaves -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  3                     eggs
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1              bunch  mint leaves -- finely chopped

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Remove whole leaves from the cabbage to yield 14 large leaves and plunge into the boiling water.  Cook until soft enough to fold, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Drain and rinse with cool water and lay out on clean kitchen towels to continue cooling.

Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, place the ground turkey, 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs, 1/2 cup of the parsley, red onion, sage, salt and pepper and eggs and mix well with hands.  Lay out the cabbage leaves on a cutting board and place a medium-sized handful of the turkey mixture in the lower center of each leaf.  Fold the lateral sides inward and roll from the base to form a closed pocket out of each stuffed leaf.

In an ovenproof casserole large enough to hold all the cabbage rolls, place half the tomato sauce and all the wine.  Lay the cabbage rolls atop the sauce.  Spoon the remaining sauce over and bake 1 hour.  Remove and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup bread crumbs, 1/4 cup parsley and chopped mint.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2                     fresh dinner rolls -- outside grated off,
                        inside shredded by hand
  7        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
  4                     canned anchovy fillets -- rinsed, drained,
                        and finely chopped
  4        tablespoons  freshly-grated pecorino romano -- divided
  2        tablespoons  pickled capers
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a medium bowl, place the shredded bread and drizzle with 3 tablespoons of the extra virgin olive oil.  Add the parsley, anchovies, 2 tablespoons of the cheese, capers and garlic and mix well to combine.  Season aggressively with pepper and timidly with salt, then slowly mix in the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil to form a fairly soft paste.

Divide the mixture evenly among the 4 hollowed peppers (do not pack the mixture in too tightly) and top with the remaining 2 tablespoons of cheese.  Replace the top of each pepper and place each pepper in a baking dish that has been brushed with extra virgin olive oil.  Bake in the oven for 20 minutes.  Serve hot or cold.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  dried porcini mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2               cups  beef stock
  1                can  peeled San Marzano tomatoes - (16 oz) -- with their juices,
                        crushed by hand
  4        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  1 2/3           cups  Vialone, Avorio or Arborio rice
  2                     eggs
     2/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2             ounces  prosciutto -- finely chopped
  7             ounces  ground beef
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5             ounces  mozzarella -- cut 1/4" dice
     3/4           cup  unseasoned bread crumbs
  1              liter  extra-virgin olive oil

Soak the mushrooms in 1/2 cup water for 2 hours.  Drain the mushrooms, reserving the mushroom water, and chop finely.  Dissolve the tomato paste in the mushroom water and set aside.

Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, combine the beef stock, crushed tomatoes and 3 tablespoons of the butter, mix well and bring to a boil.  Add the rice, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the rice is done, stirring occasionally.  Turn the rice mixture out into a serving bowl and gradually stir in the eggs and Parmigiano.  Set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, melt the remaining tablespoon of butter over low heat.  Add the onion and prosciutto and cook over high heat 3 minutes.  Add the ground beef and cook until well browned.  Add the mushrooms, mushroom water-tomato paste mixture, and salt and pepper to taste, and keep at a simmer.

With a spoon, make egg-shaped portions of the rice, and make an indentation in the center of each one.  Place a teaspoon of filling in the center of each ball of rice, along with a few cubes of the cheese.  Roll each ball in the bread crumbs so that it is completely coated, and set aside.

In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil over high heat until it is almost smoking, in batches, fry the balls in the hot oil until they are golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and allow to drain on paper towels while seasoning with salt and pepper.  Serve with tomato sauce, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     chicken livers -- diced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1              pinch  cinnamon
  1              pound  chicken breasts -- diced
  2                     hard-boiled eggs -- whites cut strips,
                        and the yolks crumbled
  1                     carrot -- finely chopped
  1                     turkey neck -- boned, skin reserved
  2             quarts  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over high heat until almost smoking.  Add the chicken livers and brown over high heat.  Season with the salt, pepper, nutmeg and cinnamon.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the cooked livers and the chicken breast and process into a fine paste, adding 1 or 2 drizzles of olive oil if necessary to achieve the correct consistency.  Place the mixture in a bowl and add the egg whites, the yolks, and the carrot.  Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix well to combine.

Stuff this mixture into the turkey neck skin using a spoon or pastry bag.  Sew the ends of the neck shut with a trussing needle and butcherís twine.  Prick the neck in 10 to 12 places and set aside.

Bring the chicken stock to a boil and add the turkey neck.  Reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 1 hour.  Remove from the stock, allow to cool for a few minutes, and serve in thin slices.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  boneless turkey breast - (5 to 6 lbs) -- halved, and
                        butterflied by your butcher
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         pound  pancetta -- cut 1/2" dice
  1 1/2         pounds  ground pork shoulder
  10                    Italian prunes -- pits removed,
                        cut into quarters
  12                    chestnuts -- roasted, peeled,
                        and halved
  2               cups  fresh bread crumbs
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  2                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Freshly-grated nutmeg -- to taste
  1        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
  1        tablespoons  chopped fresh sage
  2               cups  dry white wine -- plus
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)

Season the butterflied breast with salt and pepper and set into the refrigerator.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until smoking.  Add the pancetta pieces and cook until golden brown, about 7 to 9 minutes.  Add the ground pork and cook until starting to brown in its own fat, stirring regularly.  Drain all but 4 tablespoons of the fat from the pan, then add the prunes and chestnut and continue cooking for 8 minutes, until the prunes start to really soften.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool, about 20 minutes.

Add the bread crumbs, the Parmigiano the eggs, the pepper, nutmeg and herbs and just bring together, stirring with your hand.  Overmixing here can result in a lead torpedo for a stuffing, so donít.

Place the 2 turkey pieces on a cutting board and divide the stuffing between them.  Roll each of the breasts like a jelly roll and tie them firmly with butchers twine.  Place the 2 breasts, skin-side up, on a roasting rack in a roasting pan and pour 2 cups wine over them.  Season with salt and pepper and place into preheated oven and cook uncovered until dark golden brown outside and a meat thermometer reads 165 at the thickest part of the breast, about 1 hour, plus or minus 10 minutes.

Remove and allow to rest 15 minutes before carving.  Add remaining 1 cup of wine to the roasting pan and deglaze, scraping with a wooden spoon.  Add chicken stock and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the 1/4 cup remaining oil and season with salt and pepper.  Carve turkey into 1-inch slices and serve with pan sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  zucchini
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- finely chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  ground lamb -- crumbled
  2                     eggs
  1              bunch  fresh mint leaves -- picked, but
                        the leaves left whole
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Trim the zucchini and cut in half lengthwise.  Using a spoon or melon baller, remove the flesh making a canal down the center of each zucchini half, leaving 1/4-inch all around and the ends closed.  Roughly chop the excess zucchini flesh and set aside.

In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil until just smoking.  Add the onion and garlic and cook over medium-high heat until softened, about 6 to 7 minutes.  Add the zucchini pieces and crumbled lamb and cook until the lamb is cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Drain the fat from the lamb mixture and place in a large mixing bowl.  Add the eggs, half of the mint leaves and the Basic Tomato Sauce and mix well.

Season both the mixture and the zucchini boats with salt and pepper.  Stuff the lamb mixture into the zucchini boats and pile it high.  Place in an oven-proof baking dish just large enough to hold all the zucchini and sprinkle with bread crumbs.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until crisp on top, and remove.  Serve warm or at room temperature and sprinkle with remaining mint leaves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2              large  calvesí tongues - (abt 3 lbs)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  pearl onions -- peeled
                        (or cipolline, unpeeled)
  2             medium  carrots -- cut 1/4" disks
  2                     celery ribs -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3                     oranges -- zested and juiced
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     chickens - (2 1/2 to 3 lbs ea) -- cleaned, trimmed
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  4        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper -- plus more to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2            bunches  Italian parsley -- leaves only
  1                     red onion -- thinly sliced
  12                    cherry tomatoes -- cut in half
  1         tablespoon  sherry vinegar
                        Hot Chili Oil -- (see recipe)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Season the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper.  Truss the chickens and brush each one with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Place in 1 or 2 roasting pans and roast until browned but only half-cooked, about 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the 4 tablespoons black pepper, a pinch of salt and the mustard and stir well to combine.  Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and mix well.

Once the chickens are half-cooked, remove from the oven and brush each with the black pepper and mustard mixture.  Return to the oven and continue roasting until the juices run clear from a pricked spot, about another 30 minutes.  Let rest 10 minutes before carving.

While the chicken rests, in a medium-sized bowl, combine the parsley, red onion, tomatoes, remaining 3 tablespoons oil, sherry vinegar and salt and pepper, to taste, and toss well to combine.

Allow 1 breast and 1 leg per portion.  Drizzle each portion with the pan juices and Hot Chili Oil, top with the parsley salad and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  Tortellini -- (see below)
  6               cups  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see below)
                        Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- as needed
                        === TORTELLINI PASTA DOUGH ===
  3 1/2           cups  flour - (to 4 cups)
  4                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === TORTELLINI FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             ounces  ground turkey
  4             ounces  ground veal
  4             ounces  ground pork shoulder
  4             ounces  prosciutto -- finely diced
  4             ounces  mortadella -- finely diced
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1               cups  Parmigiano-Reggiano -- grated
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg
                        === BROWN CHICKEN STOCK ===
                        Bones, wings, scraps of 3 whole chickens -- excess fat removed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     carrots -- coarsely chopped
  2                     onions -- coarsely chopped
  4                     celery ribs -- coarsely chopped
  1        tablespoons  black peppercorns
  1              bunch  parsley stems
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste

For the Tortellini Pasta Dough:  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and the olive oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly re-flour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 1 hour in the refrigerator.

For the Tortellini Filling:  In a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed, large saucepan, heat the butter and oil until it foams and subsides.  Add the turkey, veal and pork shoulder and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the meat is well-browned and begins to release some of its juices.  Add the prosciutto and mortadella and cook for 5 minutes more.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Place in a food processor and mix to combine.  Add the egg and the Parmigiano-Reggiano and mix well to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and add at least 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg and mix again.  Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.

Roll the pasta into sheets using a pasta machine.  For the desired pasta sheet thickness, gradually pass the dough through the settings starting with the widest and continuing to the number 9 setting.

With a pasta cutter or a knife, cut the pasta into 1 1/2-inch squares.  Place 3/4 teaspoon of filling in the center of each square.  Fold into triangles, press out any air around the filling, and press to seal the edges.  Bring the points of the long side together to form a ring, and seal between your fingers.

Set the tortellini aside on a sheet pan, wrap well with plastic wrap and refrigerate.  Unused tortellini may be stored frozen for up to 2 months.  (Makes 1 1/4 pounds)

For the Brown Chicken Stock:  In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil until smoking.  Add the chicken bones and scraps and brown all over, stirring to avoid burning.  Remove the chicken parts and reserve.  Add the carrots, onions and celery and cook until soft and browned.  Return the chicken bones to the pot and add 3 quarts of water, the tomato paste, peppercorns, and parsley, stirring to dislodge the browned chicken and vegetables bits from the bottom of the pan.  Bring almost to a boil, reduce to a simmer and allow to cook at a low simmer for 2 hours, until reduced by half, occasionally skimming excess fat.  After cooking, remove from heat and strain out all solids, pressing them with the bottom of a ladle to extract out all liquids.

Bring the brown chicken stock to a boil.  Add the tortellini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until all the tortellini are floating to the top of the pot.  Ladle equal portions of tortellini into 4 warmed pasta bowls.  Ladle the hot broth on top of the tortellini, top with grated Parmigiano.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- as needed
                        === TORTELLINI PASTA DOUGH ===
  3 1/2           cups  flour - (to 4 cups)
  4                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === TORTELLINI FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             ounces  ground turkey
  4             ounces  ground veal
  4             ounces  ground pork shoulder
  4             ounces  prosciutto -- finely diced
  4             ounces  mortadella -- finely diced
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1               cups  Parmigiano-Reggiano -- grated
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg
                        === BASIC TOMATO SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     Spanish onion -- chopped 1/4" dice
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled, sliced thin
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
                        (or 1 tbspn dried thyme)
     1/2        medium  carrot -- finely shredded
  2               cans  peeled whole tomatoes - (28 oz ea) -- crushed by hand,
                        and juices reserved
                        Salt -- to taste

For the Tortellini Pasta Dough:  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and the olive oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly re-flour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 1 hour in the refrigerator.

For the Tortellini Filling:  In a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed, large saucepan, heat the butter and oil until it foams and subsides.  Add the turkey, veal and pork shoulder and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the meat is well-browned and begins to release some of its juices.  Add the prosciutto and mortadella and cook for 5 minutes more.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Place in a food processor and mix to combine.  Add the egg and the Parmigiano-Reggiano and mix well to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and add at least 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg and mix again.  Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.

Roll the pasta into sheets using a pasta machine.  For the desired pasta sheet thickness, gradually pass the dough through the settings starting with the widest and continuing to the number 9 setting.

With a pasta cutter or a knife, cut the pasta into 1 1/2-inch squares.  Place 3/4 teaspoon of filling in the center of each square.  Fold into triangles, press out any air around the filling, and press to seal the edges.  Bring the points of the long side together to form a ring, and seal between your fingers.

Set the tortellini aside on a sheet pan, wrap well with plastic wrap and refrigerate.  Unused tortellini may be stored frozen for up to 2 months.  (Makes 1 1/4 pounds)

For the Basic Tomato Sauce:  In a 3-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and garlic and cook until soft and light golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the thyme and carrot and cook 5 minutes more, until the carrot is quite soft.  Add the tomatoes and juice and bring to a boil, stirring often.  Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes until as thick as hot cereal.  Season with salt and serve.  This sauce holds 1 week in the refrigerator or up to 6 months in the freezer.  Serve over tortellini.  (Makes 4 cups)

Cook tortellini in boiling salted water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until all the tortellini are floating on top of the pot.  While the tortellini are cooking, slowly heat the tomato sauce.  Ladle equal portions of tortellini into 4 warmed pasta bowls.  Ladle the tomato sauce onto the warm tortellini, and top with grated Parmigiano.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (16 oz) -- crushed by hand,

     1/2           cup  milk

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the Tortellini Pasta Dough:  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and the olive oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

Lightly re-flour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 1 hour in the refrigerator.

For the Tortellini Filling:  In a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed, large saucepan, heat the butter and oil until it foams and subsides.  Add the turkey, veal and pork shoulder and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the meat is well-browned and begins to release some of its juices.  Add the prosciutto and mortadella and cook for 5 minutes more.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Place in a food processor and mix to combine.  Add the egg and the Parmigiano-Reggiano and mix well to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and add at least 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg and mix again.  Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.

Fold into triangles, press out any air around the filling, and press to seal the edges.  Bring the points of the long side together to form a ring, and seal between your fingers.

Set the tortellini aside on a sheet pan, wrap well with plastic wrap and refrigerate.  Unused tortellini may be stored frozen for up to 2 months.  (Makes 1 1/4 pounds)

For the Ragu Bolognesi:  In a 6- to 8-quart, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat.  Add onion, celery, carrot and garlic and sweat over medium heat until vegetables are translucent.  Add veal, pork, beef and pancetta and stir into vegetables.  Brown over high heat, stirring to keep meat from sticking together.  This should take 15 to 20 minutes.

Add tomatoes and simmer 15 minutes.  Add the milk and simmer until reduced to nothing, about 10 minutes.  Add the wine and brodo, bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  Season with salt and pepper to taste and remove from heat.  Serve over tortellini.  (Makes 6 1/2 cups)

Cook tortellini in boiling salted water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until all the tortellini are floating on top of the pot.  While the tortellini are cooking, slowly heat the Bolognesi sauce.  Ladle equal portions of tortellini into 4 warmed pasta bowls.  Ladle the Bolognesi sauce onto the warm tortellini, and top with grated Parmigiano.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

For the Tortellini Pasta Dough:  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and the olive oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly re-flour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 1 hour in the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Tortellini Filling:  In a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed, large saucepan, heat the butter and oil until it foams and subsides.  Add the turkey, veal and pork shoulder and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the meat is well-browned and begins to release some of its juices.  Add the prosciutto and mortadella and cook for 5 minutes more.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place in a food processor and mix to combine.  Add the egg and the Parmigiano-Reggiano and mix well to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and add at least 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg and mix again.  Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.

<DirT>
Roll the pasta into sheets using a pasta machine.  For the desired pasta sheet thickness, gradually pass the dough through the settings starting with the widest and continuing to the number 9 setting.
</DirT>

With a pasta cutter or a knife, cut the pasta into 1 1/2-inch squares.  Place 3/4 teaspoon of filling in the center of each square.  Fold into triangles, press out any air around the filling, and press to seal the edges.  Bring the points of the long side together to form a ring, and seal between your fingers.

Set the tortellini aside on a sheet pan, wrap well with plastic wrap and refrigerate.  Unused tortellini may be stored frozen for up to 2 months.  (Makes 1 1/4 pounds)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Ragu Bolognesi:  In a 6- to 8-quart, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat.  Add onion, celery, carrot and garlic and sweat over medium heat until vegetables are translucent.  Add veal, pork, beef and pancetta and stir into vegetables.  Brown over high heat, stirring to keep meat from sticking together.  This should take 15 to 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add tomatoes and simmer 15 minutes.  Add the milk and simmer until reduced to nothing, about 10 minutes.  Add the wine and brodo, bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  Season with salt and pepper to taste and remove from heat.  Serve over tortellini.  (Makes 6 1/2 cups)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook tortellini in boiling salted water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until all the tortellini are floating on top of the pot.  While the tortellini are cooking, slowly heat the Bolognesi sauce.  Ladle equal portions of tortellini into 4 warmed pasta bowls.  Ladle the Bolognesi sauce onto the warm tortellini, and top with grated Parmigiano.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4          pound  Tortellini -- (see below)
                        === TORTELLINI PASTA DOUGH ===
  3 1/2           cups  flour - (to 4 cups)
  4                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === TORTELLINI FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             ounces  ground turkey
  4             ounces  ground veal
  4             ounces  ground pork shoulder
  4             ounces  prosciutto -- finely diced
  4             ounces  mortadella -- finely diced
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1               cups  Parmigiano-Reggiano -- grated
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg
                        === BUTTER SAGE SAUCE ===
  6                     sage leaves
  5        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  finely-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

For the Tortellini Pasta Dough:  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and the olive oil.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly re-flour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 1 hour in the refrigerator.

For the Tortellini Filling:  In a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed, large saucepan, heat the butter and oil until it foams and subsides.  Add the turkey, veal and pork shoulder and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the meat is well-browned and begins to release some of its juices.  Add the prosciutto and mortadella and cook for 5 minutes more.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Place in a food processor and mix to combine.  Add the egg and the Parmigiano-Reggiano and mix well to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and add at least 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg and mix again.  Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.

Roll the pasta into sheets using a pasta machine.  For the desired pasta sheet thickness, gradually pass the dough through the settings starting with the widest and continuing to the number 9 setting.

With a pasta cutter or a knife, cut the pasta into 1 1/2-inch squares.  Place 3/4 teaspoon of filling in the center of each square.  Fold into triangles, press out any air around the filling, and press to seal the edges.  Bring the points of the long side together to form a ring, and seal between your fingers.

Set the tortellini aside on a sheet pan, wrap well with plastic wrap and refrigerate.  Unused tortellini may be stored frozen for up to 2 months.  (Makes 1 1/4 pounds)

For the Butter Sage Sauce:  In a medium saute pan on medium-low flame combine the butter and sage slowly melting them to combine the flavors.

Cook tortellini in boiling salted water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until all the tortellini are floating on top of the pot.  Once tortellini are done drain pasta reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta water.  Place tortellini in the saute pan with the melted butter and sage.  Add the reserved pasta cooking water and toss to combine.  Cook for about 30 seconds, check seasoning and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  veal shoulder -- finely ground
  1                cup  ricotta cheese -- plus
  2        tablespoons  ricotta cheese -- drained for 1 hour
  1                     egg -- beaten
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        A few gratings nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat until just smoking.  Add the fennel and cook, stirring often until soft and golden, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from the pan and set aside.

Slice the veal into 1/8-inch thick slices (or arrange to have your butcher do this for you).  Pound each piece of veal with a meat hammer until nearly paper-thin.  Season each piece with salt and pepper and dredge in flour.

Heat the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan until smoking.  Add 4 pieces of the dredged veal and cook until light golden brown on each side, about 2 minutes per side.  Remove to a plate and continue with the remaining pieces.

When the second batch is browned, add the first batch back to the pan and add the wine, chicken broth and lemon juice and cook 2 to 3 minutes, until the liquid is nearly gone.  Add the butter, then remove the veal to a platter with the fennel, add the parsley to the sauce and pour it over the meat.  Sprinkle with lemon zest and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2        tablespoons  lard
  2             ounces  prosciutto -- finely diced
  1                     scallion

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Several gratings of fresh nutmeg
     1/3           cup  dry white wine

  1              small  zucchini
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2        medium  red onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, sliced thin
  1              bunch  fresh oregano -- leaves removed
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  ricotta
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated pecorino
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
  4        tablespoons  butter

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop the panzotti into the water and cook until the pasta is tender, about 3 to 4 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan and add the sage leaves.  Drain the pasta in a colander and pour into the butter mixture.  Toss to coat well and pour into a heated pasta dish.  Shave cacio over the pasta, using a vegetable peeler, and serve.
