--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3           servings  olive oil cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/8      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
  2              large  Spanish onions -- sliced 1/4"-thk
                        rounds, and separated into rings
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
  1                cup  seasoned bread crumbs

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.

In a large bowl, combine flour, garlic powder, dry mustard and salt.  Add onions and toss to coat.

Pour buttermilk into another large bowl, add onions and toss to coat (use your hands for the best result).

Place bread crumbs in another large bowl, add onions and toss to coat.  Transfer onions to prepared baking sheet and spray with cooking spray.

Bake until golden brown, about 35 minutes.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1/2 an onion per serving.

PointsÆ Value:  4

Comments:  The secret to tasty oven-fried food is well-seasoned coatings and a hot oven. Yes, you can still indulge!

Flavor Booster:  Give onion rings more crunch and fiber by using homemade multi-grain bread crumbs.  Place 2 slices of toasted multi-grain bread in a food processor or blender and mince using on/off pulses.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  reduced-calorie margarine -- chilled, cut up
  2        tablespoons  water -- or more if necessary
  4             medium  McIntosh apples -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/3           cup  uncooked old-fashioned oats
  5        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  reduced-calorie margarine -- melted

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

To make the crust, combine 1 cup of flour and 2 teaspoons of sugar in a large bowl or food processor.  Add 3 tablespoons of chilled margarine and process (or mix together with your fingers if you do not have a food processor) until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, and process or mix until a manageable dough forms.  Press dough into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie plate.  Pinch the edges to form a decorative rim; set aside.

To make the filling, combine apples, 1/4 cup of sugar, cornstarch and cinnamon in a large bowl; toss to coat apples.  Arrange mixture in prepared piecrust.

To make the topping, combine oats, 5 tablespoons of flour, 2 tablespoons of sugar and melted margarine in a small bowl; sprinkle over apples.

Bake until apples are tender and crumb topping is golden brown, about 45 to 50 minutes.  Allow to cool for 30 minutes before slicing into 8 pieces.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           servings  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1              pound  lean veal loin
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  3              small  sweet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  2             medium  McIntosh apples -- cored, diced
  1                cup  unsweetened applesauce
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Coat a shallow roasting pan with cooking spray.

Season veal all over with salt and black pepper.  Place veal in prepared pan and arrange sweet potatoes and apples alongside.  Spray apples and sweet potatoes with cooking spray.

In a small bowl, combine applesauce, vinegar, mustard and cumin; pour over veal.

Roast veal until cooked through (or a thermometer inserted in center reads 160 degrees) and sweet potatoes are fork-tender, about 40 minutes.  Let veal stand 10 minutes before slicing crosswise into thin slices.  Serve veal with apples and sweet potatoes on the side.  (Note: Feel free to substitute a pork tenderloin for the veal if desired.)

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 3 ounces of veal and 1 cup of vegetable-fruit mixture per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  The sweet yet tangy coating created by applesauce, vinegar, mustard and cumin make this dish a sensation.  It's perfect for a festive fall meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1                cup  canned chickpeas -- rinsed, drained
  1           teaspoon  Adobo seasoning
                        = (or ground cumin)
  4        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped fresh mint leaves
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  2               cups  broccoli florets
  2               cups  cauliflower florets
  1                cup  chopped or shredded carrot
  6             ounces  cubed or shredded cooked boneless
                        skinless chicken breast
     1/2           cup  Kraft Free Shredded Cheddar Cheese
                        = (or other brand)
  4               cups  romaine lettuce -- chopped
  8        tablespoons  fat-free balsamic vinaigrette dressing
                        = (or other fat-free dressing)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.

In a medium bowl, combine chickpeas and Adobo seasoning; toss to coat.  Transfer chickpeas to prepared baking sheet and bake, shaking pan every 5 minutes to promote even cooking, for 20 minutes.  Remove from oven, coat with cooking spray and bake until chickpeas are golden brown, about 10 minutes more.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together vinegar, fresh herbs and oil.  Add broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, chicken and cheese and toss to coat.

Divide lettuce among four plates.  Top each serving with 1/4 each vegetable-chicken mixture and chickpea "croutons."  Drizzle each salad with 2 tablespoons of dressing.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  ripe bananas
  2              large  egg yolks
  6           teaspoon  Splenda No Calorie Sweetener
     1/4           cup  brewed black coffee -- cooled
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Peel bananas, slice and divide between two individual serving bowls.

Bring 1 inch of water to a simmer over medium heat in a high saucepan.  Meanwhile, whisk yolks and Splenda together in a medium bowl that will fit snugly over saucepan; whisk in coffee and vanilla.

Place bowl over saucepan and reduce heat so water simmers slowly.  Continue whisking egg mixture over simmering water until thick, foamy and doubled in volume, about 3 minutes.  Remove bowl from saucepan (be careful of escaping steam) and continue whisking off heat for 1 minute.  Divide sauce between serving bowls.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  paprika
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
     1/2    tablespoon  ground cumin
     1/2    tablespoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2    tablespoon  garlic powder
     1/2    tablespoon  dry mustard
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts - -- (four 4-oz pieces)
  2              large  sweet potatoes
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (or enough to coat potatoes)
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste

Mix paprika through to sugar.  A few hours before you plan to grill, rub chicken breasts with seasoning mixture.  Cover and refrigerate until 15 minutes before you grill.

Peel sweet potatoes and slice into 1/3-inch discs.  Place in a pot with enough cold, salted water to cover, and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Boil for 3 to 4 minutes, then drain and cool.

When it's time to grill, preheat grill, then spray potatoes with cooking spray or olive oil spray and salt them.  Salt chicken breasts.  Place potatoes and chicken on grill and cook until done.  The seasoning mixture makes the chicken very reddish in color, so be careful not to cook the chicken too long.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Peel sweet potatoes and slice into 1/3-inch discs.  Place in a pot with enough cold, salted water to cover, and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Boil for 3 to 4 minutes, then drain and cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When it&apos;s time to grill, preheat grill, then spray potatoes with cooking spray or olive oil spray and salt them.  Salt chicken breasts.  Place potatoes and chicken on grill and cook until done.  The seasoning mixture makes the chicken very reddish in color, so be careful not to cook the chicken too long.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3          head  savoy cabbage - (abt 8 whole leaves)
     1/2         pound  uncooked lean ground beef (with 7% fat)
     1/2           cup  uncooked white rice
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  seasoned bread crumbs
  1             medium  carrot -- grated
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1             medium  garlic clove -- minced
  1              large  egg white
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2           teaspoon  olive oil
  29            ounces  canned diced tomatoes with basil, garlic
                        and oregano

Wrap cabbage leaves in plastic wrap or moist paper towels and microwave on HIGH for 2 minutes, until soft.  Cut off the thickest, white portion of the spine of each leaf to make leaves pliable and easy to fold; set aside.

Combine beef, rice, water, bread crumbs, carrot, onion, garlic, egg white, salt and pepper in a large bowl; mix well.

Spoon about 1/4 cup of beef mixture onto the center of each leaf.  Fold up bottom of leaf to cover filling, tuck in sides and then continue rolling to make loose rolls (rice will expand during cooking so it is important not to roll them too tightly).

Heat oil in a large stock pot over medium-high heat; add rolls and sautÈ until golden brown on all sides, turning frequently, about 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes and bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat to low, cover and cook until cooked through, checking the pan every 15 minutes and stirring to prevent sticking, about 1 hour.  (If sauce thickens or reduces, add water.)

This recipe yields 4 servings; 2 rolls per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 6

Comments:  We revised this classic dish by slashing the amount of oil and opting for lean beef.  It'll provide true comfort, any night of the week.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1              small  onion -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped sweet red pepper
  1                     average red jalapeno pepper or
                        other hot chile -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced (do not touch seeds with bare
                        hands)
  1              pound  snapper or cod fillets -- skinned, and
                        cut into bite-size pieces
  2             medium  tomatoes -- cored, chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  fat-free chicken broth
     1/2           cup  cooked pearl-variety couscous
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh chives
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice

Freezing and thawing instructions:  Prepare stew recipe and place cooled product in a freezer-safe container, cover tightly and freeze.

PointsÆ Value:  3

Comments:  Red snapper lends excellent flavor to this hearty stew.  You could use cod to save a few dollars if you don't mind a softer texture.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           servings  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  Splenda No Calorie Sweetener
  1                cup  unsweetened cocoa
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  table salt
  1                cup  fat-free egg substitute
  2               cups  water
  1                cup  light corn syrup
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
  2             medium  egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4          teaspoons  orange decorating icing

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat two 12-hole muffin tins with cooking spray and line with cupcake wrappers.  (Note: We use both cooking spray and muffin wrappers to prevent any batter from sticking to the top of the pan.  Alternatively, use nonstick pans.)

Combine flour, Splenda, cocoa, cornstarch, baking soda and 1 teaspoon of salt in a large bowl; set aside.

Whisk egg substitute, 2 cups of water and 1 cup of light corn syrup together in a medium bowl.

Add egg mixture into flour mixture and mix until completely smooth and incorporated.

Pour batter into muffin tins until each hole is completely full.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.  Allow to cool completely.

While cupcakes cool, make frosting: Heat a medium pot of water to boiling.

In a medium metal or glass bowl, using a hand mixer, beat sugar, 1/2 cup of water, egg whites, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of corn syrup and vanilla extract at high speed for 1 minute.

Place bowl of frosting over rapidly boiling water (you are creating a double boiler) and beat at high speed until the mixture forms soft peaks, about 7 to 10 minutes.

Remove frosting from heat and beat until the mixture is thick enough to spread, about 5 minutes.  Frost muffins, create a spider web-like design on each with icing and decorate as desired.

This recipe yields 24 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  spaghetti squash
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  sliced scallions
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  14 1/2        ounces  canned diced tomatoes -- undrained
  1                cup  canned chickpeas -- drained, rinsed
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated lemon zest
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill or mint
     1/4           cup  pot cheese
                        = (or fat-free crumbled feta)

Pierce squash with a fork in several places.  Place on a microwave-safe plate in microwave.  Microwave on high, turning squash over every 3 minutes, until tender, about 12 to 15 minutes; let stand 5 minutes.  (Or, to bake squash, preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Halve squash lengthwise and scoop out seeds.  Place squash, cut-sides down, in a large baking dish and prick skin all over with a fork.  Bake until tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.)

Meanwhile, heat oil in a large nonstick skillet.  Add scallions and garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add diced tomatoes, chickpeas, oregano, lemon zest, salt and pepper; bring to a boil.

Cut cooked squash in half lengthwise; scrape out seeds and then scrape strands of squash into skillet with a fork.  Cook, stirring, until squash strands are well coated.  Remove from heat and stir in dill or mint.  Top each serving with feta cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 cup of squash and 1 tablespoon of cheese per serving.

PointsÆ Value:  3

Comments:  This unusual and delicious take on spaghetti squash is great as a main dish, or as a side dish paired with grilled or broiled fish or chicken, or roast leg of lamb.  Red pepper flakes will add an extra kick.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fat-free skim milk
  4        tablespoons  reduced-calorie margarine
     1/2         ounce  yeast
                        = (use two 1/4-oz packets)
     2/3           cup  warm water -- (abt 110 degrees)
     1/2           cup  sugar -- granulated
     1/2           cup  fat-free egg substitute
  1           teaspoon  table salt
  1           teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  5               cups  all-purpose flour
                        = (or as little as 4 cups [see
                        instructions])
  2           servings  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  raisins
     1/2           cup  pecan halves -- chopped
                        = (or walnuts)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  reduced-calorie margarine -- melted
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  3        tablespoons  water
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
                        = (use 1 tbspn each purple/ green and
                        gold decorating sugar)

To make dough, combine milk and 4 tablespoons of margarine in a small saucepan; set pan over medium-low heat.  Heat mixture until tiny bubbles appear around edges of pan.  Remove pan from heat and set aside to cool slightly.

Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, combine yeast, 2/3 cup of warm water and 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar; let stand 5 minutes.  Beat in egg substitute.  Beat in cooled milk mixture.  Beat in remaining granulated sugar, salt and nutmeg.

Add flour, 1 cup at a time, and mix until blended and no longer sticky (this will take 4 to 5 cups).  Using dough hook attachment on your mixer, or your hands, knead dough until smooth and elastic (about 2 minutes with dough hook and 8 minutes by hand).  Shape dough into a ball.

Coat a large bowl with cooking spray.  Add dough and turn to coat all sides.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

When dough has risen, punch dough down with your fists to let air out.  Roll into a large rectangle, about 14 by 18 inches; set aside.

To make filling, combine brown sugar, raisins, nuts, cinnamon and melted margarine in a bowl; combine until mixture is crumbly.

Sprinkle filling evenly over dough, to within 1/4-inch of edges of rectangle.

Starting from wider side of rectangle, roll dough up tightly, like a jelly roll.  Bring ends of roll together to form an oval-shaped ring.

Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.  Place dough ring on baking sheet and pinch ends together to form a seal.

Cover dough with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Using a serrated knife, cut slits 1/3 of way through dough all around ring, 1 inch apart, to let steam vent.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden.  Remove from oven and insert plastic baby doll into bottom of cake so it is completely hidden.  (You can substitute a whole pecan or walnut for the doll.)

To make frosting, combine powdered sugar and 3 tablespoons of water in a small bowl; whisk until smooth.

While cake is still warm, spread frosting over top and sides.  Sprinkle colored sugar over cake, alternating colors.  Cut into 24 pieces and serve.  (Note: Our lightened up King Cake contains only a small amount of fat so it dries out quickly.  For the best results, prepare the cake the day you plan to serve it.)

This recipe yields 24 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  This cake has a surprise baked inside: a tiny plastic baby doll.  Find it in your slice and have the honor of hosting next year's Mardi Gras soiree.

<DirT>
To make dough, combine milk and 4 tablespoons of margarine in a small saucepan; set pan over medium-low heat.  Heat mixture until tiny bubbles appear around edges of pan.  Remove pan from heat and set aside to cool slightly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, combine yeast, 2/3 cup of warm water and 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar; let stand 5 minutes.  Beat in egg substitute.  Beat in cooled milk mixture.  Beat in remaining granulated sugar, salt and nutmeg.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add flour, 1 cup at a time, and mix until blended and no longer sticky (this will take 4 to 5 cups).  Using dough hook attachment on your mixer, or your hands, knead dough until smooth and elastic (about 2 minutes with dough hook and 8 minutes by hand).  Shape dough into a ball.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Coat a large bowl with cooking spray.  Add dough and turn to coat all sides.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When dough has risen, punch dough down with your fists to let air out.  Roll into a large rectangle, about 14 by 18 inches; set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make filling, combine brown sugar, raisins, nuts, cinnamon and melted margarine in a bowl; combine until mixture is crumbly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sprinkle filling evenly over dough, to within 1/4-inch of edges of rectangle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Starting from wider side of rectangle, roll dough up tightly, like a jelly roll.  Bring ends of roll together to form an oval-shaped ring.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.  Place dough ring on baking sheet and pinch ends together to form a seal.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cover dough with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a serrated knife, cut slits 1/3 of way through dough all around ring, 1 inch apart, to let steam vent.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden.  Remove from oven and insert plastic baby doll into bottom of cake so it is completely hidden.  (You can substitute a whole pecan or walnut for the doll.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make frosting, combine powdered sugar and 3 tablespoons of water in a small bowl; whisk until smooth.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While cake is still warm, spread frosting over top and sides.  Sprinkle colored sugar over cake, alternating colors.  Cut into 24 pieces and serve.  (Note: Our lightened up King Cake contains only a small amount of fat so it dries out quickly.  For the best results, prepare the cake the day you plan to serve it.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 24 servings.

  2          teaspoons  olive oil

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.

Heat oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat.  Add beef and cook until meat is browned, breaking up meat as it cooks, about 5 minutes.  Drain meat.  Add cheese, chilies, chili powder and cumin and cook until cheese melts, stirring frequently, about 1 minute.

Place wonton wrappers on a flat surface.  Drop meat mixture by teaspoonfuls onto center of each wrapper.  Moisten edges of wrapper with wet fingers, fold over to cover filling, press down firmly to seal and then gently twist ends to form a "firecracker" shape.  Transfer filled wrappers to prepared baking sheet and coat surface with cooking spray.

Bake until wontons are golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Serve with prepared salsa.

This recipe yields 6 servings; 5 wontons and 2 tablespoons of salsa per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  We go south of the border with this clever spin on nachos.  Dunk them in salsa and savor the beefy flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4            cup  reduced-sodium fat-free chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  Splenda No Calorie Sweetener
     1/2      teaspoon  orange extract -- (optional)
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated orange zest
                        = (or 1/4 cup fresh julienned orange peel)
     1/4           cup  julienned peeled fresh ginger root
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- slivered
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes -- crushed
  1              pound  lean boneless sirloin beef -- trimmed, and
                        sliced against grain 1/8"-thk strips
  4               cups  sugar snap peas
  1         tablespoon  arrowroot -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water

Whisk broth, soy sauce, Splenda, and orange extract (if using) in a small bowl; set aside.

Coat a large nonstick wok (or skillet) with cooking spray and set over medium-high heat.  Add orange peel, ginger and garlic; stir-fry until softened and aromatic, about 2 minutes.  Add red pepper flakes and stir-fry 20 seconds.  (NOTE: To julienne means to cut into thin matchsticks.  Peel an orange, press the rind sections as flat as you can on a cutting board, and slice them into long matchsticks.  For the ginger, cut the peeled stalk into thin, even slices, then cut each of these into matchsticks.)

Add beef; stir-fry until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.  Add sugar snap peas and continue stir-frying until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.

Pour in broth mixture and bring to a simmer.  Cover wok (or skillet) and cook 1 minute more.

Stir in arrowroot mixture; cook just until thickened, less than 10 seconds.  The moment sauce thickens, remove pan from heat and serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 1/2 cups per serving.

PointsÆ Value:  7

Comments:  Spice things up by adding 1 teaspoon of Szechwan peppercorn oil or Chinese red chile paste before serving. Lemon or grapefruit peel work just as well as orange.

  2           servings  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1             medium  baking potato -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  2             medium  garlic cloves

                        = (abt 1/2 cup)
  2         tablespoon  fat-free sour cream

     1/4           cup  fat-free sour cream
  1         tablespoon  chives -- fresh, minced

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.

Combine potato and garlic in a medium saucepan.  Cover with water and set pan over high heat.  Bring to a boil and boil until potato is fork-tender, about 8 minutes.  Drain and transfer potato and garlic to a large bowl; add cheese and 2 tablespoons of sour cream.  Mash mixture together with a fork until lumpy.

Place wonton wrappers on a flat surface.  Drop potato mixture by tablespoonfuls onto center of each wrapper.  Moisten edges of wrapper with wet fingers, fold over one side to make a half circle and press sides together to seal.  Transfer filled wrappers to prepared baking sheet and coat surface with cooking spray.

Bake until wontons are golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine remaining 1/4 cup of sour cream and chives.  Mix well and serve with potato dumplings.

This recipe yields 6 servings; 4 wontons and 1 tablespoon of dip per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  These pierogi-like dumplings are comfort food.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  uncooked brown rice -- (not instant)
  1                cup  chopped yellow onion
     1/4           cup  dill -- fresh, chopped
     1/4           cup  mint leaves -- fresh, chopped
  4               cups  reduced-sodium fat-free chicken broth
                        = (or vegetable broth)
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  4 1/2         ounces  grape leaves - (abt 32 leaves) -- rinsed if canned

Combine rice, onion, dill and mint in a large nonstick skillet and set pan over medium heat.  SautÈ until onion is soft, stirring frequently to prevent rice from burning, about 5 minutes.  Add 2 cups of broth, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until rice is tender, about 25 minutes.  Stir in lemon juice and remove from heat.

Place grape leaves, shiny-side down, on a flat surface.  Top each leaf with 1 heaping teaspoon of rice mixture, placing filling near stem end of leaf.  Fold in sides of leaf and then roll up from broad bottom to top.  Place stuffed leaves side by side in a large stockpot, leaving no gaps (this prevents leaves from opening while cooking).

Pour remaining broth over top of leaves.  Set pan over medium heat and bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 1 hour.  Remove from heat and let cool 30 minutes before serving.  (Note: Stuffed grape leaves may also be served chilled.)

This recipe yields 16 servings; 2 stuffed leaves per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 1

Comments:  Our version of these classic dolmas calls for brown rice, but sticks with tradition by infusing them with onion, dill, mint and lemon.  Great for appetizers or alongside soup or salad.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  eggplants -- sliced lengthwise
                        = (do not peel)
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1              large  onion -- chopped 1/4" pieces
  1              large  carrot -- chopped 1/4" pieces
  2             medium  sweet red peppers -- chopped 1/4" pieces
  3              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  3             medium  portobello mushroom caps -- chopped 1/2" dice
  2        tablespoons  parsley -- fresh, chopped
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme
                        = (or 1 tspn dried thyme)
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  15            ounces  canned tomato sauce
                        = (or 2 cups homemade tomato sauce)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Rub cut sides of eggplants with oil.  Place on a nonstick baking sheet cut-sides up.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes (eggplant should not be cooked entirely through).  Remove from oven and flip over with a spatula; let cool on baking sheet.  Leave oven on.

Meanwhile, coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat.  Add onions, carrot and peppers.  SautÈ until soft and slightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Add garlic and mushrooms.  Increase heat to high and continue to sautÈ until mushrooms soften and release their juices, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in parsley and thyme; season to taste with salt and pepper.

Scoop out flesh of cooled eggplant with a soup spoon, leaving about a 1/4-inch of eggplant flesh in skin.  Coarsely chop flesh and add to mushroom mixture; mix well.

Fill each eggplant shell with about 1 1/2 cups of filling.  Place stuffed eggplant shells in a nonstick 9- by 13-inch pan.  Spoon 1/2 cup of tomato sauce over each stuffed eggplant shell.  Bake for 15 minutes, remove from oven and let cool.

Freezing and thawing instructions:  Freeze each cooled eggplant half, topped with sauce, in individual containers.  When ready to eat, thaw and microwave.  Or, thaw and reheat for about 15 to 20 minutes in a 350 degrees oven.

This recipe yields 4 servings; one stuffed eggplant half per serving.

PointsÆ Value:  3

Comments:  This delicious vegetarian casserole comes ready in four portion-controlled packages.  Freeze them individually for sensational single meals.

  2          teaspoons  olive oil

             Spaghetti, Artichoke Heart And Zucchini Frittata

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Frittatas                       Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5              large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 3/4           cups  cooked whole-wheat spaghetti
                        = (made fresh or leftovers)
  14            ounces  canned artichoke hearts without oil -- drained, and
                        cut into wedges
     3/4           cup  Kraft Free Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
                        = (or other brand)
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1             medium  zucchini -- shredded
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  14 1/2        ounces  canned Italian-style tomato sauce

Place oven rack in top position in oven.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Beat eggs, salt and pepper together in a medium bowl.  Stir in spaghetti, artichoke hearts, cheese and parsley; set aside.

Heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a large nonstick skillet with an ovenproof handle over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.  Add zucchini and sautÈ until zucchini and onions are tender, about 3 minutes.  Stir in garlic; cook 30 seconds until fragrant.  Spoon vegetable mixture into bowl with egg mixture; wipe skillet clean.

Heat remaining 2 teaspoons of oil in skillet; swirl to coat pan.  Add egg-vegetable mixture; cover and cook over low heat, without stirring, until bottom is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.

Transfer skillet to oven and bake until frittata is completely set in center, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat sauce in microwave or in a small saucepan over low heat.

Loosen edges of frittata with a spatula and then invert frittata onto a serving platter; cut into 6 wedges.  Serve drizzled with warmed sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings; 1/6 of frittata and about 1/4 cup of sauce per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  This frittata makes great use of leftover pasta.  Toss in any vegetables you have on hand -- thin, fresh asparagus cut into small pieces is especially nice.

Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  apples -- cored
                        = (use Granny Smith for tart flavor; use
                        Gala for sweet flavor)
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
  12         teaspoons  Splenda No Calorie Sweetener
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1              ounce  fat-free sugar-free instant vanilla
                        pudding mix
     3/4           cup  fat-free skim milk

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Using a vegetable peeler, peel a 1/2-inch horizontal strip around apples to help release juices during baking.  Place apples in a 9- by 9-inch baking dish.

Combine cinnamon, ginger and Splenda in a small bowl.  Place 1 tablespoon of cinnamon mixture in cored-out center of each apple, then sprinkle with remaining cinnamon mixture.  Combine water and lemon juice in a cup.  Pour liquid around apples.

Bake until apples are soft when pierced with a knife, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and let cool.

Pour pudding mix into a medium bowl.  Whisk in milk to make a fairly thin sauce.  Place one apple on a plate and drizzle with sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 1 apple and about a scant 1/2 cup of sauce per serving.

PointsÆ Value:  2

Comments:  Dig your spoon into these sweet, juicy treats.  Nothing beats them on a cold, blustery day.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  green peppers
                        = (use green poblano peppers)
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  4               cups  baby spinach leaves -- coarsely chopped
  1             medium  scallion -- chopped
  1                cup  vegetable broth
     2/3           cup  uncooked couscous -- toasted variety
  1                cup  grated Parmesan cheese
                        = (Parmigianno-Reggiano recommended)
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  marinara sauce

Slice tops off peppers; set tops aside.  Remove seeds from peppers.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add peppers and cook until tender, about 7 to 10 minutes.  Drain well.

Meanwhile, coat a large skillet with cooking spray and set over medium-high heat.  Finely chop reserved pepper tops (not including stem) and sautÈ until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add spinach and scallion to pan and sautÈ until spinach is limp, about 3 minutes.

Add broth to skillet and bring to a boil.  Stir in couscous, cover and reduce heat to low.  Simmer until couscous is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.  Stir in Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.  (Note: You can find toasted couscous in the ethnic departments of most supermarkets.)

Spoon couscous mixture into peppers.  Arrange peppers in a small microwave-safe baking dish and top with marinara sauce.  Loosely cover dish with a microwave-safe cover or plastic wrap.  Microwave on high for 2 minutes or until hot.  Alternatively, you can bake peppers in a preheated 350 degrees oven for 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings; 1 stuffed pepper per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  Our version of chiles rellenos, stuffed poblano peppers, is full of flavor but light on fat and calories.

     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg

Coat a medium nonstick pot with cooking spray.  Add onion and spinach and sautÈ, stirring frequently, until spinach is limp, about 3 minutes.  Add broth.

PurÈe mixture in pot using an immersion blender (or pour soup into a blender and purÈe in batches, being careful not to splatter the hot liquid).

Add remaining ingredients.  Simmer 5 minutes to heat through.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 cup per serving.

PointsÆ Value:  2

Comments:  Fresh spinach gives this soup a gorgeous green color.  And the pungent nutmeg packs an alluring, spicy-sweet punch.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lean leg of lamb stew meat -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  4                cup  reduced-sodium fat-free chicken broth
  2 1/2         medium  leeks or 2 large -- sliced
                        = (white and pale green parts only)
  2             medium  celery stalks -- thinly sliced
  2             medium  carrots -- thinly sliced
  2           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  table salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1             medium  baking potato -- peeled

Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over high heat.  Add lamb and cook 10 minutes; drain and set lamb aside.

Pour broth in same saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.  Add leeks, celery and carrots.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, 10 minutes.

Return lamb to saucepan; add thyme, salt and pepper.  Simmer, covered, until lamb is very tender, about 45 minutes.

Grate potato into stew, using small holes of a box grater.  Stir well and reduce heat to lowest possible simmer.  Cook, uncovered, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 3/4 cup per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  Irish stews are known for their mouth-watering, tender meat and veggies -- and this stew is no exception!  Substitute two parsnips or one medium peeled turnip for the carrots, if desired.

  1            serving  cooking spray

  1             medium  garlic clove -- minced

     1/4           cup  chopped tomatillos - (abt 1 large)
  1             medium  jalapeÒo pepper -- cored, seeded,

  14 1/2        ounces  canned diced fire-roasted tomatoes
  2               cups  cooked whole hominy
                        = (or a 15.5-oz can drained hominy)
  1                cup  canned pinto beans -- drained, rinsed
  1              pound  uncooked boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut bite size

     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
  1                cup  fat-free chicken broth

Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray.  Add garlic, onion, tomatillo and jalapeÒo.  SautÈ for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  (If a tomatillo isn't available, substitute a red tomato and a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice.)

Stir in canned tomatoes, hominy, beans, chicken, cumin, oregano, pepper, salt and broth.  (Note: If desired, substitute 2 cups of diced cooked chicken breast for the raw chicken.  Reduce the cooking time to 5 to 10 minutes.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  baking potatoes -- peeled, sliced thin
                        = (use a food processor if possible)
  3              large  eggs
  3              large  egg whites
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  canola oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook for 5 minutes (potatoes should be about halfway done).  Drain and set aside.

Meanwhile, whisk eggs, egg whites, salt and pepper together in a large bowl; set aside.

Heat oil in a 10-inch frying pan over medium-high heat.  Add onions and potatoes; cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 5 minutes.

Spoon potato mixture into egg mixture and mix thoroughly.

Reheat frying pan over low-medium heat.  Add potato-egg mixture and let cook for 2 minutes.  Flip and cook on other side until eggs are set, about 2 minutes more.  Slice into 6 pieces and serve.  (Note: If you have trouble flipping the eggs, slide them onto a plate, turn the plate over ñ above pan ñ and settle eggs back into pan.)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Packed with hunger-fighting potatoes, this Spanish specialty is oh-so-much more than an ordinary omelet.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  uncooked ground turkey breast
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
     1/2           cup  sliced scallions
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1                cup  thick-and-chunky style salsa
  1 1/2         medium  mangoes or 1 large -- cubed
                        = (or 15 oz unsweetened frozen mango
                        chunks)
  2               cups  cooked brown rice -- kept hot

Cook turkey in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned, about 5 minutes.  Drain off any fat.

Add oil to skillet and heat over medium-high heat until sizzling.  Stir in scallions, garlic, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, oregano and thyme.  Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Gently stir in salsa and mango.  Cover and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes more.  Serve over brown rice.

Freezing and thawing instructions:  Prepare stew recipe and place cooled product in a freezer-safe container, cover tightly and freeze.  When ready to eat, thaw in refrigerator and then reheat in a large skillet over medium-heat for about 10 minutes.  You may need to add more salsa to prevent dryness.  Or, reheat thawed casserole in microwave.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 3/4 cup of stew and 1/2 cup of rice per serving.

PointsÆ Value:  7

Comments:  Go ahead and savor the slightly spicy Latin flavor of this traditional stew.  Made with turkey instead of beef, it's a real healthy delight.

                           Wasabi Roasted Peas

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           servings  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  3             pounds  frozen green peas -- thawed under hot
                        water and drained
  4        tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
  8          teaspoons  wasabi powder -- or to taste
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard

Preheat oven to 225 degrees.  Coat two large baking sheets with cooking spray.

Transfer peas to prepared baking sheets and bake 3 hours, or until dry, shaking pans every 30 minutes to promote even cooking.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together vinegar, wasabi powder and mustard.  When peas have roasted, add them to wasabi mixture and toss to coat.  Return peas to baking sheet and bake until coating is dry, about 20 minutes more.   (Note: To keep peas crisp, store in an airtight container or zip-top plastic bag for 3 days.  To re-crisp already cooked peas that have gone soft, cook on a baking sheet for 10 minutes at 250 degrees.)

This recipe yields 8 servings; about 1/2 cup per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 2

Comments:  These spicy peas are a great fix for snack attacks.  If you're feeling adventurous, turn up the heat by adding 1 to 2 more teaspoons of wasabi powder.

  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  2 1/2         pounds  lean beef round -- well trimmed
                        = (use boneless bottom round rump roast)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
  2              large  onions -- sliced
  1 3/4           cups  water
  1             packet  onion soup mix
  1 1/2     tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
                        = (or red wine vinegar)
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  8              large  red potatoes -- scrubbed, quartered
                        = (abt 1 3/4 lbs)
  1              pound  baby carrots
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat a Dutch oven (a large pot with a tight-fitting lid) with cooking spray.  Heat over medium-high heat.

Sprinkle roast with pepper and salt.  Place in pot and scatter onions around roast.  Cook, turning roast and stirring onions occasionally, until roast and onions are browned, about 8 minutes.  Pour water into pot; stir in soup mix, vinegar and thyme and bring to a boil.

Cover and cook 1 1/2 hours.  Place potatoes and carrots around roast; cover and bake until roast and vegetables are tender, about 2 hours more.  Remove one potato from pot and puree in a blender.  Stir into gravy to thicken.

Transfer roast to a cutting board and slice against grain into 16 slices.  Serve with vegetables and gravy.

This recipe yields 8 servings; about 2 slices of meat, 1 cup of vegetables and 1/4 cup of gravy per serving.

PointsÆ Value:  9

Comments:  Just like Mom used to make!  Make this dish on the weekend (when you have more time to let it simmer to succulent tenderness) and reheat it on a busy weeknight for a richly satisfying meal.
