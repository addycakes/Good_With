       'Right On The Grill' Corn On The Cob With Molasses-Chili But

Recipe By     :Tom Douglas
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               ears  corn -- shucked
                        === MOLASSES-CHILI BUTTER ===
  1                     ancho chili pepper -- pureed
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  unsulfured light molasses
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt -- or to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the Molasses-Chili Butter:  Split the chile open and discard the stems and seeds.  Place the chile in a small saucepan and cover with water.  Bring to a boil and remove the saucepan from the heat.

Allow the chile to soak for 10 minutes until soft.  Remove from the water and puree in a blender or food processor.  Use a little of the soaking water to help you puree it, if necessary.  Strain the ancho chili puree through a fine-mesh sieve.

In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, heat the orange juice until it is reduced to a thick syrup and yields 1 tablespoon, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat; let cool to room temperature.

In a food processor or by hand, combine the reduced orange juice, butter, ancho puree, molasses, orange zest and salt and pepper to taste.  Transfer the flavored butter to a small bowl; set aside.

Fire up the grill.

Grill the corn until done, about 8 minutes over medium heat, turning as necessary to brown evenly.  Remove the corn from the grill and slather with the flavored butter.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Wonderful fresh corn from all over Washington is delivered to our kitchens just about every day in season.  Most people don't realize they can put fresh corn on the cob right on the grill.  You don't have to leave the husks on or wrap the cobs in foil.  The corn comes out tender and sweet with an appealing smoky taste and just a little crunch from the grill marks.  After the cobs are grilled, rub them with a flavored butter like this one.  They are beautiful -- golden orange from the butter with patches of deep brown and bright yellow.  This corn makes a perfect side dish for any barbecue.  Serve it with everything from spit-roasted prime rib to grilled chicken or down-home ribs.

A step ahead:  The butter can be made a week ahead and held, tightly wrapped, in the refrigerator or for longer in the freezer.  It is also great spread on grilled halibut, grilled summer squash or corn bread.

                        washed, and spun dry
  1              small  sweet onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     cucumber -- seeded, and
                        thinly sliced
  1               pint  cherry tomatoes -- halved
     1/3           cup  fresh mint leaves -- plus
                        Mint sprigs -- for garnish
     1/3           cup  fresh cilantro leaves
     1/3           cup  fresh basil leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped dry-roasted peanuts

Score the steak on both sides.  Arrange on a nonreactive baking dish just large enough to hold it.

Place the garlic, ginger, scallion whites, chilies and sugar in a large nonreactive bowl and mash to a paste with the back of a spoon.  Add soy sauce, lime juice, sesame oil and 3 tablespoons of water and stir until sugar is dissolved.

Pour half the marinade over the steak and marinate for 1 to 2 hours in the refrigerator, covered, turning several times to ensure even marinating.  Reserve the rest of the marinade as a salad dressing.

Cover the noodles in cold water and soak for 1 hour.  Taste.  If tender, drain well.  If tough, cook in boiling water 1 to 3 minutes.  Drain, rinse in cold water, and drain well.

Set up grill for direct grilling and preheat to high.

Line salad plates with large lettuce leaves.  Tear smaller leaves to 2 inches.  Place the lettuce pieces, onion, cucumber, tomatoes, mint, cilantro and basil in mixing bowl with reserved dressing, but do not mix.

When fire is ready, brush and oil the grate.  Place the steak on hot grate and grill until cooked to taste (4 to 6 minutes per side for medium-rare).

Transfer to cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes.  Cut steak into paper-thin slices at a 45-degree angle.

Toss the salad and loosely mound on lettuce-lined plates.  Place a mound of rice noodles in center.  Arrange beef slices on top.  Sprinkle with peanuts and place a mint sprig on each salad.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     slabs pork spareribs
  1                cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
  1 1/2           cups  cherry cola soft drink

  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1             medium  onion -- chopped

These classically flavored spareribs are good any time year.  Serve ribs with corn on the cob, creamy cole slaw and corn muffins.

Prepare a medium-hot banked fire in covered kettle style grill.  Cut each slab of ribs between ribs into four pieces.  Place rib-side down over indirect heat and grill for 1 1/4 hours.

Meanwhile in a saucepan combine catsup, Worcestershire sauce, cherry cola, vinegar, paprika, chili powder, pepper and onion; simmer 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Brush ribs generously with sauce and continue to cook, about 20 to 30 minutes, basting and turning often, until ribs are nicely glazed.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              whole  chicken legs
                        = (or a 3 1/2- to-4 lb whole chicken
                        cut into 8 pieces)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  coriander seeds
  2          teaspoons  whole black peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds
  6                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (2" long) -- thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  water -- or as needed
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  cayenne pepper -- or to taste
                        = (or hot paprika)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
                        Thinly-sliced red onion -- for garnish
                        Lime or lemon wedges -- for garnish

Remove and discard the skin from the chicken legs, then rinse under cold running water.  Drain and blot dry with paper towels.  Place the legs in a baking dish large enough to hold them in one layer and set aside while you prepare the seasoning paste.

Heat a dry skillet over medium heat and add the coriander seeds, peppercorns, and cumin seeds.  Toast the spices until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes, shaking the skillet occasionally.  Let cool, then transfer to a spice mill and grind to a fine powder.

Combine the ground spices in a blender or mini chopper with the garlic, ginger, oil, 1/4 cup water, lemon juice, cayenne, and salt.  Process to a smooth paste, adding more water if necessary to obtain a pourable consistency.  Add the cilantro and process just to mix.

Using your fingers, spread the seasoning paste over the chicken legs to coat on both sides, then cover and let marinate, in the refrigerator, for 4 to 6 hours.

Preheat the grill to high.

When ready to cook, oil the grill grate.  Remove the chicken legs from the baking dish and arrange on the hot grate.  Grill, turning with tongs, until the juices run clear when the tip of the skewer or sharp knife is inserted in the thickest part of a thigh, 6 to 10 minutes per side (12 to 20 minutes in all).

Transfer the chicken legs to serving plates or a platter and serve immediately garnished with sliced red onion and lime or lemon wedges.

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  very lean beef tenderloin
                        = (filet mignon or top sirloin)
  8              whole  cherry tomatoes
                        = (or plum tomatoes, halved)" qty="4
  1             medium  onions - (to 2) -- peeled, cut into
                        quarters and separated into sections
  1              large  bell pepper -- trimmed, and cut
                        into twelve 1 1/4" squares

If using wooden or bamboo skewers, soak for 1 hour in water (this will prevent burning).

In a small bowl, make marinade:  Combine vinegar, oil, Worcestershire sauce and pepper to taste; mix well.  (This amount of marinade is enough for 1 1/2 pounds steak)

Cut meat into 16 (1-inch) cubes, removing any visible fat.  Arrange meat in a single layer in a glass, ceramic or other non-aluminum dish.  Add marinade; cover and refrigerate 30 minutes to 2 hours.  Drain, reserving marinade.

Prepare grill.

Thread 1 tomato and 1 onion section on each of 4 skewers.  Alternating meat and bell pepper, thread 4 pieces meat and 3 pieces pepper onto each skewer.  Top each skewer with onion and then tomato.

Add skewers to hot grill.  Cook 12 minutes or until done, turning skewers twice to cook evenly.  Baste several times with marinade.  (For food safety, do not baste during last 5 minutes of cooking.  Discard any remaining marinade.)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Kebabs often are all meat, but we think vegetables make a nice accompaniment.  To serve as a sandwich, wrap a piece of pita bread around a kebab; hold firmly as you pull out the skewer.

Categories    : Grilling                        Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24                    shrimp - (50-60 count) -- peeled, leaving
                        the tails on
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/8      teaspoon  cracked peppercorns
  6                     fresh basil leaves
  3             ounces  thinly-sliced prosciutto -- cut 2" lengths
     1/8           cup  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh garlic
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Bamboo skewers

Toss the peeled shrimp in the olive oil, peppercorns and garlic and allow to marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Meanwhile slice your prosciutto and cut the basil leaves into 3 to 4 strips each.  Soak the skewers for a good 30 minutes as well.

Place the prosciutto slices on a clean working surface.  Top a slice with a piece of basil and then put the shrimp on top and roll them up.  Thread them on the soaked skewer and repeat until done.

Fire up the grill and turn on the oven to 350 degrees.

Dipping Sauce:  Combine the vinegar, mustard, basil, garlic and salt and pepper to taste in your blender and pulse a few times.  Turn on high and slowly add the oil until it is blended well.  It should be thick like a mayonnaise.  Season with salt and pepper if desired.

Throw the skewers on the grill for a few minutes turning often.  Be careful as the prosciutto will flame up.  Only cook until the fat on the prosciutto is cooked off.  Finish them in the oven for 4 to 5 more minutes.

Serve with the dipping sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 3 servings.

                 Bastille Day Grilled Lamb With Rosemary

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     large  clove garlic, minced
  1         tablespoon  fresh rosemary, minced
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  white wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2         pounds  leg of lamb -- see * Note
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- as needed

* Note:  Brought to room temperature.  A butterflied leg of lamb has a center portion and two flaps.  This recipe uses only the center portion.  The remaining portions can be stored in the freezer for later use.  The larger flap (sirloin) can be grilled.  The smaller one is excellent to use for kebabs.  If you're cooking for a larger group, use the entire leg.

Prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire.  Or heat oven to 450 degrees and line jellyroll pan with aluminum foil.

Combine garlic, rosemary, oil, vinegar, mustard and salt in a small bowl.  Rub over entire surface of lamb.  (Can be done as long as 12 hours ahead of time, if desired.)

Place lamb on grill or baking sheet and sprinkle generously with ground pepper.  Grill or bake until it registers 120 degrees on an instant reading thermometer for rare, 22 to 25 minutes; or longer as desired.  Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing.

* Note:  Brought to room temperature.  A butterflied leg of lamb has a center portion and two flaps.  This recipe uses only the center portion.  The remaining portions can be stored in the freezer for later use.  The larger flap (sirloin) can be grilled.  The smaller one is excellent to use for kebabs.  If you&apos;re cooking for a larger group, use the entire leg.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire.  Or heat oven to 450 degrees and line jellyroll pan with aluminum foil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine garlic, rosemary, oil, vinegar, mustard and salt in a small bowl.  Rub over entire surface of lamb.  (Can be done as long as 12 hours ahead of time, if desired.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place lamb on grill or baking sheet and sprinkle generously with ground pepper.  Grill or bake until it registers 120 degrees on an instant reading thermometer for rare, 22 to 25 minutes; or longer as desired.  Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing.

Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish                       Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  lean ground beef
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                can  chopped chiles - (4 oz) -- drained
  3             ounces  Monterey Jack cheese -- cut 6 slices
  1                     round loaf sourdough bread
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened
  1                cup  shredded lettuce
  1              small  tomato -- coarsely chopped
  2                     green onions with tops -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  sliced ripe olives
     1/2           cup  sour cream
                        === GUACAMOLE ===
  1              large  ripe avocado -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into pieces
  1              small  onion -- quartered
  2          teaspoons  fresh lime juice
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Prepare Guacamole and set aside.  Place avocado, onion, lime juice, Tabasco and salt in a food processor fitted with the steel knife and process just until mixture is blended, not pureed.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.  (Makes about 1 cup)

Combine ground beef with cumin and salt, mixing lightly but thoroughly.  Line a 9-inch round baking pan with plastic or foil.  Divide beef mixture into 2 equal portions.

Shape one portion into a large patty by pressing meat lightly but firmly into baking pan.  Remove patty and place on a lightly greased flat baking sheet.  Sprinkle chiles evenly over patty and arrange cheese over chiles.

Shape the remaining beef into a second 9-inch patty and place on top of the first one.  Press edges together securely to seal.

Slide the burger onto a grid over medium-high coals; cover cooker and grill 7 minutes.  Turn, cover cooker again and cook for 7 minutes on other side, or until done as you like.  (To turn easily, slide a lightly greased flat baking sheet under burger.  Hold another flat sheet over it, flip over carefully and slide uncooked side back onto grid.)  Remove from grid with a baking sheet.  If cooked on an open grill, increase cooking time about 3 minutes.

Meanwhile, slice the bread crosswise in half; remove bread from top of bun, leaving a shell 1/2- to 1-inch thick.  Spread cut side with butter and toast on the grid for 1 minute.

Place the burger on the bottom half of the loaf, cover with lettuce, tomatoes, green onions and olives and the top of the loaf.  Cut in wedges to serve.  Accompany with Guacamole and sour cream.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  How about a super hamburger for a change?  This one is filled with cheese and chiles, grilled and placed in a toasted round loaf of sourdough bread, garnished, cut in wedges and served with guacamole and sour cream.

          Big Jim's Grilled Chicken Thighs With Garlic And Herbs

Recipe By     :Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     bone-in chicken thighs - (6 to 7 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  capers
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh herbs of your choice
                        = (rosemary, basil, oregano, or thyme,
                        alone or in combination)
                        Lemon quarters -- for garnish

Sprinkle the chicken thighs with salt and pepper and grill skin-side down, over medium-low fire for 8 to 10 minutes.

Flip the thighs and grill for additional 4 to 6 minutes.  To make sure they are done, make an incision close to the bone and check that there is no redness.

Meanwhile, combine the vinaigrette ingredients in a bowl and mix well.

Remove the thighs from the grill and ladle the vinaigrette over them.  Serve with lemon quarters for garnish.

This recipe yields 4 entree servings.

Comments:  Jimmy Burke, my longtime friend and the first real chef I worked for, taught me one of the golden rules of cooking:  Sometimes less is more.  From him I learned that simple flavors presented in a clear uncluttered way are really good.  He always said, "Whatever you're going to do, whether it's a hamburger or foie gras, use the best stuff and do it right."  Heading his advice, here we stay simple and feature the classic Italian combination of fresh herbs, garlic, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar.

Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  dark molasses
  2          teaspoons  pureed canned chipotle chilies in adobo
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  6                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
     3/4           cup  plain dry bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  sesame seeds
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
     1/3           cup  chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  creamy peanut butter

In small bowl, combine soy sauce, molasses, chilies and garlic, stirring to blend.  Remove 3 tablespoons mixture; refrigerate to use later.

Place chicken between sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap.  Pound with flat side of meat mallet until about 1/8-inch thick.  Set aside.

In shallow dish such as a glass pie pan, combine bread crumbs, sesame seeds and parsley.  Dip chicken pieces in soy sauce mixture, then coat with crumb mixture.  Roll up chicken jellyroll fashion, and secure with wooden picks.  Cover; refrigerate several hours or overnight, if desired (slices come out neater if chilled).

Cut each chicken piece crosswise into 4 thick slices.  Skewer crosswise onto 6 skewers, dividing chicken equally.  Place chicken on grid over medium-hot coals; grill about 5 minutes a side or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.

While chicken cooks, in small saucepan, combine chicken broth and peanut butter.  Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until smooth.  Remove from heat; stir in reserved 3 tablespoons soy sauce mixture.  Let cool to room temperature.  Serve sauce with chicken.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Chipotle chilies are smoked jalapeÒos.  They are available in most supermarkets packed in a tomato-based sauce (adobo).

                      Chicken Grilled Under A Brick

Recipe By     :Steven Raichlen
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     bricks
  4                     chicken breast halves - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  1           teaspoon  coarse sea salt
  1           teaspoon  cracked or coarsely-ground
                        black peppercorns
     1/2      teaspoon  hot-pepper flakes - (to 1)
  2                     garlic cloves - (to 3) -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Wrap bricks in aluminum foil (with shiny side out for better heat reflection).

Trim any sinews or excess fat off chicken.  Generously season breasts on both sides with salt, cracked black pepper and hot-pepper flakes.  Sprinkle breasts with garlic and rosemary, patting them in with your fingers.  Arrange breasts in baking dish.  Pour lemon juice and olive oil over them.  Cover and refrigerate 30 to 60 minutes, turning several times.

Set up grill for direct grilling, and preheat to high.  In best of all worlds, you'd build your fire with oak chunks.  Alternatively, you can toss some wood chips or chunks on the fire.

Brush and oil the grill grate.  Arrange chicken breasts on the grate, all going the same way, at a 45-degree angle to the bars of the grate.  Place 2 breast halves under each brick.  Grill chicken until done, 3 to 5 minutes a side, rotating each breast a quarter turn after 2 minutes to create an attractive cross-hatch of grill marks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe features traditional Italian seasonings: coarse sea salt, cracked black peppercorns, hot pepper flakes, fresh garlic, rosemary, fresh lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil.

To make a Mexican-style chicken under a brick, substitute sliced jalapeno or chipotle chilies for the hot-pepper flakes, cilantro for the rosemary and lime juice for the lemon juice.

To make an Asian-style chicken under a brick, use ginger, garlic, green onions and five-spice powder, substituting sesame oil for the olive oil.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     flank steak - (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
     1/4           cup  lime juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  onion -- peeled, and cut
                        into 1/2"-thk rounds
  2              large  red or green bell peppers -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into large wedges
  16                    flour tortillas - (10" dia)
                        Salsa -- for serving
                        Guacamole -- for serving

Preheat grill with all burners set to high and the lid down until the grill is very hot, about 15 minutes.

Sprinkle both sides of the steak with lime juice and salt and pepper to taste.  Grill steak, covered, until well seared and dark brown on one side, 4 to 6 minutes.  Flip steak using tongs; continue grilling on the other side until the interior of the meat is slightly less done than you want it to be when you eat it, 2 to 5 minutes more for rare or medium-rare.

Transfer meat to a cutting board; cover loosely with foil, and let rest for 5 minutes.

Reduce grill heat to medium.  While steak rests, grill onion and peppers, turning occasionally, until onion is lightly charred, about 6 minutes, and peppers are streaked with dark grill marks, about 10 minutes.  Remove vegetables from grill, and cut into long, thin strips; set aside.

Arrange tortillas around edge of grill; heat until just warmed, about 20 seconds per side.  (Take care not to dry out tortillas or they will become brittle.)  Wrap tortillas in a towel to keep warm.

Slice meat.  Arrange the sliced meat and vegetables on a large platter; serve immediately with the tortillas, salsa and guacamole passed separately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                            Creamy Corn Grits

Recipe By     :Tom Douglas
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  milk
  2               cups  water
  1                cup  grits - (not instant)
  1                cup  grated Cheddar cheese - (abt 4 oz)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a saucepan over high heat, bring the milk and water to a boil.  Whisking constantly, gradually add the grits.  Reduce the heat to medium-low; the grits should be at a slow simmer.  Cook, whisking occasionally, until the grits are soft and creamy, about 1 hour.

Add the cheese and butter and whisk to combine.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  If the grits are too thick, add water until they reach the desired consistency.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is a luscious, creamy dish similar to soft polenta.  Grits are made of coarsely ground hominy -- dried corn kernels from which the hull and germ have been removed.  I like to make this with real grits -- the slow-cooking kind, like Hoppin' John's from South Carolina.  These grits are perfect with maple-cured pork chops, but also would be delicious with roast chicken or grilled sausages.

In a saucepan over high heat, bring the milk and water to a boil.  Whisking constantly, gradually add the grits.  Reduce the heat to medium-low; the grits should be at a slow simmer.  Cook, whisking occasionally, until the grits are soft and creamy, about 1 hour.

<DirT>
Add the cheese and butter and whisk to combine.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  If the grits are too thick, add water until they reach the desired consistency.

Comments:  This is a luscious, creamy dish similar to soft polenta.  Grits are made of coarsely ground hominy -- dried corn kernels from which the hull and germ have been removed.  I like to make this with real grits -- the slow-cooking kind, like Hoppin&apos; John&apos;s from South Carolina.  These grits are perfect with maple-cured pork chops, but also would be delicious with roast chicken or grilled sausages.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    wooden skewers
                        === FOR THE CHICKEN ===
  2                     fresh lemon grass stems
                        = (or 2 finely-chopped medium shallots)
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1              piece  ginger root - (1/2" long) -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  five-spice powder
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  honey
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (1 1/2 to 2 lbs)
                        === PEANUT SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1                cup  skinned shelled raw peanuts
     1/2        medium  onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     garlic clove
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice -- or to taste
  1                cup  hot water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Fill a shallow tray with water and soak the skewers for at least 30 minutes.

For the Chicken:  In a shallow bowl, combine the lemon grass or shallots, garlic, ginger, five-spice powder, soy sauce, oil and honey and stir to combine.  Set aside.

Cut the chicken into about 12 long, thin strips, about 1/2-inch thick, add to the marinade and toss to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 3 hours.

For the Peanut Sauce:  In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the oil until hot.  Add the peanuts and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.

Transfer to a food processor or blender and add the onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, ginger, sugar and lemon juice and process until smooth.  With the blades running, slowly add just enough hot water to make the sauce pourable.  Start by adding just 1/2 cup, then process for a few seconds and adjust accordingly.  Taste and adjust the seasoning accordingly.

Transfer the sauce to a saucepan.  Place over medium heat, stirring frequently, until warmed through.  Remove the pan from the heat; cover to keep warm.

Preheat the grill.

Thread each piece of chicken onto a separate skewer, piercing the chicken strip in several places so the chicken is slightly pleated.  Discard the excess marinade.

Grill the satay until browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn and cook until the other side is browned and the chicken is cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more.

To serve, transfer the satay to a platters and pour the sauce into individual dishes for dipping.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The five-spice marinade clings to the chicken and provides a tasty buffer to the heat of the grill or broiler.  This recipe is also delicious with pork.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     flank steak - (abt 2 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ASIAN BARBECUE SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              small  onion -- minced
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh ginger
     1/4           cup  mirin wine or sake
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  hoisin sauce
     1/4           cup  rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  tomato puree
                        Soy sauce -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper flakes

Season the steak with salt and pepper and set aside.

To make the sauce, heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over high temperature.  Add the garlic, onion, and ginger and saute until they begin to give off their aroma, 2 or 3 minutes.  Add the mirin and brown sugar and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until half the liquid has evaporated.  Add the hoisin, vinegar, and tomato puree.  Simmer the mixture on low heat for another 5 minutes, or until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon.  Season with the soy sauce and hot pepper flakes.

Rub the steak with about 2 tablespoons of the barbecue sauce.  Set the steak aside in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Place the steak on the prepared grill (barbecue) and baste with the barbecue sauce while cooking.  Cook the steak about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare; no longer, or it will get tough.

Set the steak aside for 2 minutes before slicing.  Then serve on dinner plates accompanied by little dishes of the remaining barbecue sauce for dipping -- and plenty of napkins!

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Even though the days of inexpensive flank steak are over, it's still one of my favorite cuts of meat.  Add this piquant Barbecue Sauce and a good bottle of Zinfandel and you have the makings of a sensational summer barbecue with the best of friends.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  butter - (to 2)
     1/2         pound  shrimp - (36/40 count)
  1                jar  commercial Alfredo sauce, preferably
                        with roasted garlic - (16 oz)
                        = (or 1 3/4 cups  homemade sauce)
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2           cup  diced green and red bell peppers
     1/4           cup  diced green onions
                        = (green and white parts)
  4          teaspoons  Cajun spice

Prepare a hot grill and grill salmon until just done, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium saute pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add shrimp and cook just until it turns pink, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove shrimp and reserve.

In the same pan, combine the Alfredo sauce, Parmesan, peppers, green onions and Cajun spice.  Heat thoroughly, stirring until well-combined.  Place half the sauce on the serving plates, top with salmon and shrimp and cover with remaining sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  At American Cafe, half the sauce for each plate is spread on the plate.  The grilled salmon is arranged crosswise at one end and topped with sauteed shrimp and remaining sauce.  Spicy rice, a steamed vegetable and half a lemon complete the plate.  In adapting the recipe for home cooks, we reduced the size of the salmon fillets from the 10 ounces served at the restaurant.

       Garlic And Chile-Stabbed T-Bone Steaks With Grilled Corn Rel

Recipe By     :John Harrisson
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RELISH ===
  1                     red bell pepper
  4               ears  fresh sweet corn -- husked
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
     1/4           cup  diced onion
  3        tablespoons  diced oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
  2                     scallions -- sliced
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  1         tablespoon  sherry vinegar
     1/2    tablespoon  minced marjoram
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === STEAKS ===
  4                     T-bone steaks, 1" thk - (abt 1 lb ea)
                        = (prime or choice)
  6                     garlic cloves -- cut lengthwise
                        into thick slivers abt 3/8" long
  1                     serrano chile -- seeded, and cut
                        lengthwise in thick slivers abt 3/8" long
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To prepare the relish, roast the bell pepper on the grill and let steam.  When cool, peel, seed, and dice the pepper; and place in a mixing bowl.

While the pepper is cooling, brush the corn with 2 tablespoons of the oil and grill over indirect medium heat for about 15 minutes, turning frequently, until lightly browned on all sides.  Remove and, when cool enough to handle, cut the kernels from the cobs and add to the mixing bowl.

Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet and saute the onion over medium-high heat for 3 or 4 minutes, until soft.  Add the sauteed onions, sun-dried tomatoes, scallions, lime juice, vinegar; and marjoram to the bowl.  Season with salt, and toss to combine.

Using the tip of a sharp paring knife, make incisions in the steaks about 1/2 inch deep.  Insert the garlic and serrano slivers into the incisions, making sure they are embedded beneath the surface of the steaks.  Season with salt and pepper and bring the steaks to room temperature.

Grill over direct medium-high heat for 5 or 6 minutes per side for medium-rare, 7 to 8 minutes for medium, or to the desired doneness.  Serve with the relish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Besides achieving maximum flavor; making sure the garlic and chile slivers are beneath the surface of the steaks also ensures that they won't burn on the grill.  If you're not fond of the heat of chiles, by all means use just the garlic slivers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  chickens - (abt 3 1/2 lbs ea)
  1 1/2           cups  fresh orange juice
  1              small  white onion
  8                     garlic cloves -- roughly chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  marjoram
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano
  4                     bays leaves -- broken
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Spritzer of oil
                        Grilled green onions -- (optional), garnish

Use a large knife to split the chickens down the middle into two halves.  Rinse well and pat dry with paper towels.  Place the chickens in a large bowl or two large plastic food bags.

PurÈe the orange juice, onion, garlic, herbs and spices in a food processor or blender.  Pour over the chickens and rub to coat them thoroughly.  Cover tightly or close the bags and refrigerate at least 4 hours (or, preferably overnight), turning the chickens several times.

Prepare a charcoal grill or heat a gas grill to medium.  Remove the chickens from the marinade.  Lightly spray the chickens with oil and place them on the grill skin-side up.  Cover and grill for 20 minutes.

Baste chickens with marinade, then turn chickens over.  Continue grilling, basting occasionally with the remaining marinade, until thigh juices run clear when pierced with a knife, 15 to 25 minutes more.

Remove the chickens to a cutting board and cut each in half.  Serve garnished with grilled green onions, if you wish.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     beef tenderloin filets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  4             ounces  gorgonzola cheese -- crumbled

  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper

In a small bowl, combine stuffing ingredients: cheese, pepper, green onion, bread crumbs, and wine.

Place the beef filets on a work surface and make a side cut 2/3 of the way through the steak to form a pocket.  Divide the stuffing between the steaks and fill.  Wrap the bacon around the outside edge of steak to conceal stuffing cut and secure with wooden or metal skewer.  Rub the outside of the steak with the garlic and pepper.  Steaks may be assembled the day ahead and refrigerated until grilling.

Preheat grill to medium high heat.  Grill steaks 5 to 8 minutes per side, depending on desired doneness.  Serve immediately.

  2        tablespoons  sliced green onion
                        === CAESAR TOAST ===
  8             slices  French bread - (to 12)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Garlic salt -- to taste

For Caesar Toast:  Cut 8 to 12 slices of French bread 1/8-inch thick; brush both sides with olive oil and sprinkle with a little garlic salt; place bread on a baking sheet and bake in a 300 degree oven about 30 minutes or until slices are dry and crisp.

Hamburgers:  Drain anchovy fillets; remove 4 fillets, roll up jelly-roll style and set aside.

In a medium mixing bowl mash the remaining anchovy fillets; stir in Worcestershire sauce and pepper; add ground beef.  Mix well and shape into four 3/4-inch thick patties.  Place in grill basket if desired; grill patties, on an uncovered grill, directly over medium-hot heat for 6 minutes.  Turn and grill to desired doneness, allowing about 6 minutes for medium.

For each serving, place one romaine leaf atop 2 or 3 pieces of Caesar Toast.  Top with a meat patty, 1/4 of cheese and onion and one rolled anchovy fillet.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

               Grill-Roasted Asparagus With Slivered Garlic

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  asparagus -- ends trimmed
  2              large  or 4 small garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare the grill for indirect cooking.  If you have a charcoal grill, build the fire on one side of the grill, or around the sides of the grill, leaving an empty space in the middle.  For a gas grill, if it has controls for the left and right, heat one side.  If you have front and back burners, heat the back.

Make a rimmed baking pan out of a double thickness of heavy-duty aluminum foil.  The pan should be just large enough to hold all the asparagus in a single layer and fit comfortably on the part of the grill away from the heat.

In a shallow dish, combine the asparagus, garlic, oil and salt and pepper to taste.  Toss to coat.  Transfer the mixture to the rimmed baking pan.  Place the pan on the grill over indirect heat.

Cover the grill and cook the asparagus, maintaining the temperature inside the grill at about 350 degrees, until the asparagus is tender and its skin slightly wrinkled, turning the asparagus once or twice during the cooking to help them roast evenly.

The asparagus should take 15 to 25 minutes to cook, depending on the thickness of the stalks and the heat inside the barbecue.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The direct heat of the grill tends to char the outside of the stalks before the insides are cooked.  To get around this problem, roast the asparagus over indirect heat on a disposable baking pan made from aluminum foil.  The asparagus cooks without burning and is able to absorb just the right amount of grill flavor.  Here, thin slices of garlic cook with the asparagus.  Protected from the fire, the garlic slices become golden brown and sweet.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  low-sodium soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated sugar
  1              pound  green beans -- ends trimmed
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame seeds

Prepare the grill for indirect cooking.  If you have a charcoal grill, build the fire on one side of the grill, or around the sides of the grill, leaving an empty space in the middle.  For a gas grill, if it has controls for the left and right, heat one side.  If you have front and back burners, heat the back.

In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, soy sauce and sugar; set aside.

Rinse the beans in a colander and shake off any excess water.  Place a large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil on the work surface.  Mound the green beans in the center.  Bring the sides of the foil up to form a bowl.

Drizzle the beans with the sesame-soy mixture, sprinkle with the sesame seeds and toss to coat.  Bring the foil all the way up and over the beans to form a loose packet.  Fold the edges together to form a tight seal.

Place the packet on the grill over indirect heat.  Cover the grill and cook the beans, maintaining the temperature at about 350 degrees, until the beans are cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes.

To serve, transfer the beans and dressing to a shallow bowl and toss to combine.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHILE DRESSING ===
  1                     lemon grass stalk -- minced
                        = (or grated zest of 1 lime)
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce or light soy sauce -- see * Note
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- minced
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1              small  red onion -- sliced paper-thin
                        === SALAD MIX ===
  1             medium  green or red bell pepper
  2               cups  shredded romaine lettuce
  3                     plum tomatoes -- cored, seeded,
                        and finely diced
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
     1/3           cup  finely-shredded fresh mint leaves
  4                     beef skirt steaks - (6 oz ea)
                        = (or 1 1/2 lbs flank steak)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1              large  avocado
  12                    flour tortillas - (8" dia)

* Note:  Fish sauce is available in Asian markets.  Routhier recommends the Squid or Tiparos brands.

To prepare Chile Dressing:  In a small bowl, whisk together all dressing ingredients.  Cover; set aside.

To prepare Salad Mix:  Cut bell pepper in half lengthwise.  Place, skin-side up, under a hot broiler; broil until skin blackens.  Let stand for 5 minutes to cool.  Hold pepper under cold running water and rub skin off.  Pat dry, then core, seed and cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips.  Place in a mixing bowl.  Add lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro and mint; toss to mix.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Prepare a fire in an outdoor grill.  Season steaks to taste with salt and pepper.  In a small bowl, combine oil and garlic.  Brush both sides of meat with the mixture.  Grill steaks to desired degree of doneness, about 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Remove steaks to a cutting board; let stand 5 to 10 minutes.

Holding a carving knife at a slight angle, slice steak across the grain into thin slices.  Add steak to salad mix.  Pour dressing over salad; toss gently to coat ingredients.  Turn salad onto a serving platter.

Cut avocado in half lengthwise; remove pit.  Peel, then cut the avocado into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Place avocado on a small plate.

To serve:  Place a portion of the salad on a tortilla, along with a few slices of avocado.  Roll up and eat out of hand.

This recipe yields 12 fajitas, enough for 6 light main-course servings.

Comments:  If you're in no hurry to leave the kitchen, try this exotic take on fajitas.  It tosses ingredients in a Vietnamese-style dressing.

To prepare Chile Dressing:  In a small bowl, whisk together all dressing ingredients.  Cover; set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare Salad Mix:  Cut bell pepper in half lengthwise.  Place, skin-side up, under a hot broiler; broil until skin blackens.  Let stand for 5 minutes to cool.  Hold pepper under cold running water and rub skin off.  Pat dry, then core, seed and cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips.  Place in a mixing bowl.  Add lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro and mint; toss to mix.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare a fire in an outdoor grill.  Season steaks to taste with salt and pepper.  In a small bowl, combine oil and garlic.  Brush both sides of meat with the mixture.  Grill steaks to desired degree of doneness, about 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Remove steaks to a cutting board; let stand 5 to 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Holding a carving knife at a slight angle, slice steak across the grain into thin slices.  Add steak to salad mix.  Pour dressing over salad; toss gently to coat ingredients.  Turn salad onto a serving platter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut avocado in half lengthwise; remove pit.  Peel, then cut the avocado into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Place avocado on a small plate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve:  Place a portion of the salad on a tortilla, along with a few slices of avocado.  Roll up and eat out of hand.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 12 fajitas, enough for 6 light main-course servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  If you&apos;re in no hurry to leave the kitchen, try this exotic take on fajitas.  It tosses ingredients in a Vietnamese-style dressing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Perdue fresh Cornish hens
     1/2           cup  raspberry jelly
  1              small  shallot -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil leaves
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
  1         tablespoon  olive or vegetable oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

If using covered charcoal grill, open all vents and prepare coals at least 30 minutes before cooking.  When coals are medium, using tongs, arrange coals on either end of grill and arrange drip pan, slightly larger than hens, at center in bottom of grill under the grate.

If using gas grill, preheat to high.  If grill has 3 heating zones, turn center off and reduce the heat for the other two to medium.  If grill has 2 heating zones, turn one off and reduce the heat for the other one to medium.  If grill has no drip pan, place drip pan, slightly larger than hens, on the "off" section in bottom of grill under the grate.

Trim any excess fat from tail end of hens.  Tie legs together.  Place hens breast up on grill over drip pan on the "off" section.  Cover and grill 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, in medium microwave-safe measuring cup or bow, combine jelly, shallot, basil, vinegar, lemon peel, oil and salt.  Microwave at HIGH (Full Power) 30 seconds or until jelly is smooth and blended when stirred.

Grill hens, basting with raspberry mixture, an additional 25 minutes or until meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh registers 180 degrees.  Do not baste during the last 5 minutes of grilling.  Do not turn hens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin seeds
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped garlic
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  red currant jelly
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
  8              large  boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- pounded evenly
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped cilantro

In a small dry skillet, toast the cumin seeds over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.  Using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, grind to a powder.  Empty into a large bowl.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in the skillet.  Add the garlic and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until golden, about 3 minutes.  Add to the cumin, then whisk in the vinegar, jelly, lemon juice, mustard, soy sauce, crushed red pepper and ginger.  Whisk in the remaining cup olive oil.  Add the chicken breast halves, turning to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.

Light a gas grill or preheat a cast-iron grill pan until hot.  Remove the chicken from the marinade and season on both sides with salt and pepper.  Cook the chicken, skinned-side down, until nicely seared with grill marks, rotating the pieces once or twice, about 4 minutes.  Flip and cook the other side, rotating, until charred all over and cooked through, about 4 minutes longer.

Transfer to a platter and sprinkle the cilantro on top.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  vegetable oil
  2              small  garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Tabasco sauce -- to taste
                        = (or other red hot pepper sauce)
  2             pounds  bone-in skin-on chicken pieces
                        = (preferably dark meat)

Preheat the grill on high.

In a bowl, combine the oil, garlic, cayenne, vinegar and hot sauce.  Add the chicken and toss to coat.

Using tongs, carefully transfer the chicken to the grill, discarding the sauce.  Grill, turning once, over direct heat for 2 minutes per side.

Transfer the chicken to the cooler portion of the grill or reduce the heat to medium and grill until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear when pierced with a fork, 16 to 20 minutes.  (Dark meat will cook slightly more slowly than white meat.)  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Some nights we crave the flavor of Buffalo wings the bar stool and the grease that typically accompany them.  While this recipe is a tad inauthentic, it is a flavorful alternative that is grilled, not fried, and uses substantial pieces of chicken that you could call dinner.

You could liven things up by increasing the amount of cayenne pepper and hot pepper sauce proportionately.  Or, to tone down the heat, provide a chilled side dish.  Either combine equal parts of sour cream and mayonnaise along with a handful of crumbled blue cheese and freshly ground black pepper, or toss together some shredded green apple, jicama and carrots with sour cream, a splash of orange or lime juice and salt and pepper to taste.

And don't forget a pile of napkins.

Using tongs, carefully transfer the chicken to the grill, discarding the sauce.  Grill, turning once, over direct heat for 2 minutes per side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the chicken to the cooler portion of the grill or reduce the heat to medium and grill until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear when pierced with a fork, 16 to 20 minutes.  (Dark meat will cook slightly more slowly than white meat.)  Serve immediately.

Comments:  Some nights we crave the flavor of Buffalo wings the bar stool and the grease that typically accompany them.  While this recipe is a tad inauthentic, it is a flavorful alternative that is grilled, not fried, and uses substantial pieces of chicken that you could call dinner.
</DirT>
<DirT>
You could liven things up by increasing the amount of cayenne pepper and hot pepper sauce proportionately.  Or, to tone down the heat, provide a chilled side dish.  Either combine equal parts of sour cream and mayonnaise along with a handful of crumbled blue cheese and freshly ground black pepper, or toss together some shredded green apple, jicama and carrots with sour cream, a splash of orange or lime juice and salt and pepper to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
And don&apos;t forget a pile of napkins.

                          Grilled Eggplant Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Salads/Dressings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  small eggplants
                        Salt -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  tomato
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced fresh chili pepper -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice

Trim and discard the ends of the eggplants; cut the eggplant crosswise into slices that are 1/2 inch thick.  Transfer the eggplant slices to a colander, sprinkling each layer generously with salt.  Place the colander over a plate to drain for at least 30 minutes.

Preheat the grill on medium.

Rinse the eggplant with cool water and pat dry with paper towels.  Brush the eggplant slices with oil and place them, oiled-side down, on the grill.

Cook, without turning, until lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes.  Brush the top of each slice with oil, turn and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer the slices to a platter, arranging them in a slightly overlapping fashion; set aside.

Meanwhile, cut the tomato in half and squeeze out the seeds and juice.  Chop the remaining tomato and place it in a bowl.  Add the parsley, chili pepper, lemon juice and salt to taste and toss to combine.  Spoon the tomato mixture over the eggplant.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:   Just a few ingredients make a lovely accompaniment to an antipasto assortment or as a side dish with meat or fish.  Take this as a master recipe that can be endlessly adapted.  For example, the addition of chili pepper is not exactly traditional Italian but it tastes terrific.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic

             Grilled Grouper With Peach Glaze And Corn Salad

Recipe By     :Russell Cronkhite
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     grouper fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        = (may substitute red snapper or redfish)
  2        tablespoons  lemon-pepper seasoning
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
                        Corn Salad -- (see recipe)
                        === GALZE ===
  3                     ripe but firm peaches -- peeled, chopped
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1                cup  peach nectar
                        = (or white grape juice)

For the Glaze:  In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the peaches (should be about 2 cups), vinegar, sugar and nectar or juice.

Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring frequently, until the peaches soften and the liquid thickens, 20 to 30 minutes.

Strain the glaze, pressing on the solids with a spatula or the back of a spoon; discard the solids.  Set the glaze aside to cool to room temperature.  (May cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days.)

Preheat the grill on high.  Pour half of the glaze into a small bowl and set aside; keep the remaining glaze near the grill.

Season both sides of each fish fillet with lemon-pepper and salt to taste.

Lightly brush the grill rack and both sides of the fish with oil.  Grill the fish over high heat for 3 to 4 minutes.

Using a long-handled spatula, carefully turn the fish.  Baste the grilled side of the fish generously with the peach glaze, discarding the rest of the basting glaze.

Grill the fish until cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat and brush lightly with the reserved glaze.  Serve with the Corn Salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A light dusting of lemon-pepper seasoning on the fish provides just the right contrast to the sweetness of the glaze.  For an extra kick, coat the grouper with a fiery curry or Cajun spice rub just before grilling.  I serve it with Corn Salad.

Using a long-handled spatula, carefully turn the fish.  Baste the grilled side of the fish generously with the peach glaze, discarding the rest of the basting glaze.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grill the fish until cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat and brush lightly with the reserved glaze.  Serve with the Corn Salad.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  A light dusting of lemon-pepper seasoning on the fish provides just the right contrast to the sweetness of the glaze.  For an extra kick, coat the grouper with a fiery curry or Cajun spice rub just before grilling.  I serve it with Corn Salad.

                   Grilled Plantains With Citrus Glaze

Recipe By     :Jack Bishop
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  orange juice
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  2              large  ripe plantains
                        = (yellowish black or black)
  1         tablespoon  canola
                        = (or other tasteless oil)
                        Salt -- to taste

Light a grill fire.

Combine the orange juice, lime juice, and brown sugar in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Simmer until the mixture thickens to the consistency of a thin syrup, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside.

Trim the pointed ends from the plantains.  Cut the plantains into 3-inch chunks.  Use a paring knife to slit the skin lengthwise in several places on each piece.  Carefully remove the skin with your fingers and discard it.  Cut each 3-inch chunk in half lengthwise.  Toss the plantains, oil, and salt to taste in a large bowl.

Grill the plantains over a medium-hot fire, turning once, until browned, about 7 minutes.  Brush the glaze over the plantains and continue to grill, turning once, until richly colored, about 2 minutes.  (It's fine if the plantains blacken in spots.)  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 side-dish servings.

Comments:  Ripe plantains take extremely well to the grill.  You could serve them as is (seasoned with just salt), but I like to brush a not-too-sweet citrus glaze over the pieces when they are almost done. (Don't brush on the glaze earlier; or it will burn.)  Grilled plantains are great with grilled pork, beef or chicken.

Combine the orange juice, lime juice, and brown sugar in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Simmer until the mixture thickens to the consistency of a thin syrup, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside.

Trim the pointed ends from the plantains.  Cut the plantains into 3-inch chunks.  Use a paring knife to slit the skin lengthwise in several places on each piece.  Carefully remove the skin with your fingers and discard it.  Cut each 3-inch chunk in half lengthwise.  Toss the plantains, oil, and salt to taste in a large bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grill the plantains over a medium-hot fire, turning once, until browned, about 7 minutes.  Brush the glaze over the plantains and continue to grill, turning once, until richly colored, about 2 minutes.  (It&apos;s fine if the plantains blacken in spots.)  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     portabello mushrooms
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  balsamic or red wine vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  low-fat mayonaise
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
                        = (or 2 tspn dried basil)
  2        tablespoons  roasted red pepper from a jar -- chopped
  1              small  loaf whole-wheat French bread
  4                     lettuce leaves
  8                     thin tomato slices

Gently wash the tops of the portabello mushrooms and dry.  Place in a shallow pan and drizzle the oil over the mushrooms.  Next, pour the vinegar over and sprinkle the black pepper over the mushrooms.  Cover and let marinate for 1 hour.

Prepare the grill.  The mushrooms need to be grilled over medium coals.

Next, make the roasted red pepper and basil mayonnaise.  Mix the mayonnaise, chopped roasted peppers and basil together.  Put in refrigerator.

To grill the mushrooms, place them gill-sides down.  Each side should be grilled for 8 minutes.  Turn mushrooms about every 2 minutes to prevent burning and brush with the rest of the marinade during cooking.  Remove from grill.  Cut the grilled mushroom in 1/4-inch strips.

To assemble the sandwich, cut the French bread in half lengthwise.  Spread the mayonnaise on both sides of the bread.  Arrange the grilled mushroom strips on the bread.  Top with the lettuce leaves, tomato slices and other half of the french bread.  Cut into 4 pieces.

Serve with potato salad and coleslaw to complete the meal.  The mushroom strips can also be served on a tossed salad.  This sandwich is delicious served cold.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  4        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar -- divided
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce, preferably tamari
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, and
                        crushed through a press
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             medium  portobello mushrooms - (1 1/4 lbs total) -- stemmed
  5              large  ripe plum tomatoes -- halved lengthwise,
                        with interiors scooped out
                        Salt -- to taste
  2               cups  wood chips, preferably hickory -- (optional)
  1                     baguette-type crusty bread
                        = (abt 21" long and abt 3" wide)
     1/2           cup  goat cheese
  16                    arugula leaves

In a shallow, nonreactive dish, whisk together 3 tablespoons olive oil, 3 tablespoons vinegar, soy sauce, garlic and a generous grinding of pepper.  Add mushroom caps, turning to coat well.  Cover; marinate, basting occasionally, for 1 hour.

Drizzle tomatoes on both sides with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.

Preheat grill to medium-high.  Distribute wood chips according to grill manufacturer's directions.  Position grill rack about 6 inches above the heat.

Cook mushroom caps in covered grill until lightly marked, about 3 minutes.  Baste with any unabsorbed marinade, turn caps, and grill another 2 to 3 minutes, or until well browned, tender and smoky.  Transfer to a cutting board.  Cut mushrooms in half.

Place tomatoes cut-sides down on rack; cover and grill until lightly marked, about 2 1/2 minutes.  Turn, cover and grill until lightly browned and fairly tender, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.  Transfer to a plate; let cool, cut-sides down.

With a serrated knife, cut loaf of bread in half horizontally.  Brush cut sides with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Toast bread on grill, cut-sides down, until lightly marked, about 1 minute.

Evenly spread cut side of the bottom half of loaf with cheese; season with salt and pepper.  Arrange tomato halves over cheese.  Arrange arugula leaves over tomatoes.  Drizzle evenly with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and remaining 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar.  Arrange mushroom pieces over arugula.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Set top half of bread loaf in place; press gently.

With a serrated knife, cut loaf crosswise into 4 sandwiches.  Serve within an hour or two.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     pork rib or loin chops -- see * Note
     2/3           cup  cider vinegar
     1/3           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  dried sage -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     sweet potatoes - (abt 1 lb)
  1             medium  sweet onion
                        = (such as Vidalia)

* Note:  Select either pork rib or loin chops that are about 1 1/4 inches thick for this meat-and-potatoes dish.

Trim fat from chops.  Place chops in a plastic bag set in a shallow dish.  For marinade, in a small saucepan combine cider vinegar and balsamic vinegar.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat.  Boil gently, uncovered, about 8 minutes or until reduced to about 2/3 cup.  Cool slightly.  Stir in oil, sage, salt, and pepper.  Reserve 1/4 cup marinade; set aside.

Pour remaining marinade over chops; seal bag.  Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 to 24 hours, turning bag occasionally.

Drain chops, discarding marinade.  Brush potatoes (quartered lengthwise) and onion (cut into 3/4-inch slices) with the reserved marinade.

For a charcoal grill, place medium coals in bottom of grill.  Place chops, potatoes, and onion on grill rack directly over coals.  Cover and grill for 25 to 30 minutes or until chops are slightly pink in center and vegetables are tender, turning chops once and vegetables occasionally.

For a gas grill, preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium.  Place chops, potatoes, and onion on grill rack over heat.  Grill as above.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                  Grilled Salmon And Purple Passion Slaw

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  salmon fillets
  1           teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
                        = (or ground ginger)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2                loaf sturdy bread -- (optional),
                        thickly sliced
                        Olive oil -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  1                     red bell pepper -- cored, sliced thin
     1/2                medium head red cabbage -- cored, sliced thin
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  granulated sugar

Prepare gas or charcoal grill for direct cooking.  Season flesh side of fillets with five-spice powder and salt and pepper to taste; set aside.  Brush bread slices with olive oil.

Heat canola oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add bell pepper and cabbage; cook until soft, about 8 minutes.  Stir in lemon juice, soy sauce and sugar; season to taste with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, grill salmon, starting with the skin-side down, about 4 minutes per side.  Grill bread slices until browned, turning once.

To serve, divide slaw among 6 plates and top with portions of salmon; serve bread on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Timesaving Tips:  To prevent the fish from sticking, cover the center of the grate with lightly oiled foil; place the fish on one half of the foil.  Halfway through cooking, turn the fish over onto the bare foil to finish.

Serve the cabbage mixture raw.  (Think of it as a type of coleslaw.)  But be sure to slice the pepper and cabbage nice and thin.

Comments:  Many supermarkets carry five-spice, but if you have no time or no luck finding it, salt, pepper and a sprinkling of ground ginger would probably taste fine.

                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Cabernet Sauvignon
                        = (or other dry red wine)
  2 1/2           cups  blackberries -- rinsed, drained
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  sugar - (to 3)
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
  6                     salmon steaks, 1" thk - (6 to 7 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a food processor or blender, combine wine and 2 cups berries; whirl until pureed.  Rub berry mixture through a fine strainer into a 1 1/2- to 2-quart pan; discard residue.  Add shallots, ginger, and 2 tablespoons sugar.

Bring berry mixture to a boil over high heat, and stir often until reduced to 1 cup, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat, and stir in butter and more sugar to taste.  (The berry sauce should be nicely balanced between sweet and tart; judge the amount of sugar to add by the sweetness of the fruit.)

Rinse salmon and pat dry.  Coil belly strips of fish into center of steaks and secure each portion with a small skewer (such as the kind used for trussing turkeys).

Lay salmon on an oiled grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill.  Cook fish, turning once, until opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), 7 to 10 minutes.

Set a salmon steak on each of 6 warm plates (remove skewers if desired).  Spoon berry coulis (if cool, stir over high heat until warm, about 1 minute) equally over steaks.  Garnish with remaining 1/2 cup whole berries; add salt and pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Classmates in culinary school, Krista Painter and Amy French of Seattle, WA are also friends who cook together for fun.  At Pike Place Market, when the bounty of summer is at its peak, they snap up the freshest blackberries and salmon to make this festive dish."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  Cabernet Sauvignon
                        = (or similar dry red wine)
  3             ounces  dry sun-dried tomatoes
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced fresh garlic
  3        tablespoons  finely-diced onion
  3               cups  chopped fresh tomatoes
                        = (or canned diced tomatoes)
     1/3           cup  pitted black olives
  3          teaspoons  tomato paste
  3          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  6                     salmon fillets - (4 to 6 oz ea)

In a small pot, bring the wine and a cup of water to a boil.  Add the sun-dried tomatoes and remove from heat.  Let tomatoes reconstitute for about 5 minutes, until softened.  Drain tomatoes, reserving liquid, and chop into medium dice.

Spray the rack of a grill with non-stick spray and preheat the grill.

In a medium pot, combine sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, onion, tomatoes, olives, tomato paste, rosemary, salt and pepper.  Cook over medium heat until well blended and aromatic.  Use reserved wine if needed to keep moist.  Pulse briefly in food processor to make the compote.  Set aside and keep warm.

Place the salmon on the grill and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Thicker fillets may need to be finished in a 350 degree oven for about 5 minutes.

Serve 1 fillet per person and top with compote.  The compote can be served at room temperature or may be heated slightly.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                 Grilled Salmon With Tropical Fruit Salsa

Recipe By     :Anne Willan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  ripe mango -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  1              small  papaya - (avocado-size) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  2                     navel oranges -- peeled, diced,
                        see * Note
  1                cup  full-bodied white wine
  3        tablespoons  honey mustard
     3/4           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     skin-on salmon fillets - (abt 1 lb)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil - (to 2)
  1                     medium bunch fresh basil -- cut chiffonade,
                        plus additional for garnish

* Note:  To segment an orange:  Slice off the bottom and top.  Stand the fruit on a cutting board with 1 of its cut sides down.  Using a serrated knife, cut the peel and pith away from the fruit from top to bottom, following the curve.  Then, holding the fruit in your hand, cut the orange segments out of their membranes.  (The idea is to remove all the orange skin and white pith.)

Prepare the grill.

In a medium bowl, combine the mango, papaya and orange.  Set aside.

In a small bowl, whisk together the wine, mustard, orange juice and salt and pepper to taste.  Add about a third of this marinade to the fruit mixture, toss to coat and set aside.

Place a double layer of aluminum foil on a work surface.  Place the salmon fillets, skin-side down, next to one another in the center of half of the foil.  Push the edges up slightly.  Brush the salmon lightly with oil and drizzle with the remaining marinade.  Fold the other side of foil over the top and crimp the edges to seal tightly.

Transfer the package to the grill and cook until it flakes easily, about 10 minutes per inch of thickness.

Add the basil to the salsa and toss to coat.  Taste and adjust the seasoning accordingly.

Carefully open the salmon package, being careful of the steam.  Transfer the salmon to individual plates, spoon the salsa on the side and, if desired, garnish with a basil sprig.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  For a perfect summer supper, side by side on the grill with the salmon, add garden tomatoes and ears of fresh corn in the husk.  A sweet wine such as a Sauternes would come as a pleasant surprise on salmon, but almost any white wine works well provided it is not too dry.  This makes an ample amount of salsa, enough as a side dish, not a garnish.

       Grilled Sausage On Crusty Buns With Braised Onions And Peppe

Recipe By     :Cinda Chavich
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     good-quality fresh sausages -- see * Note
  6                     crusty panini buns
  2                     red or yellow bell peppers -- slivered
     1/4           cup  good-quality virgin olive oil
  2              large  sweet red or white onions -- sliced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  dark beer
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Like Spolumbo's or Gordon Sinclair's chicken or turkey sausages.

Cut the peppers lengthwise, remove the stems and seeds, and slice into long slivers.  Cut the onions in half and slice thinly.

In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat and cook the onions and peppers slowly until they are golden and caramelized.  This will take at least 30 minutes.  Stir in the minced garlic, sugar and beer, and simmer until most of the liquid is gone and the onions and peppers form a thick, jammy mass.  Season with salt and pepper and set aside.

Grill the sausages over medium heat for 15 minutes, until nicely browned and cooked through.  Pile some of the caramelized pepper and onion mixture on each bun and fill each with a grilled sausage.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  I like to grill any kind of fresh sausage (especially poultry sausage) and serve it piled on a crispy Italian style panini bun with lots of sweet caramelized onions and peppers.

                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16             large  sea scallops -(abt 1 1/4 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  honey
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
                        Oil -- for grill grate
                        Wooden skewers -- soaked in warm water
                        water for 30 minutes, or metal skewers
                        === GLAZE ===
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt

Rinse and pat dry the scallops.  In a small bowl combine the olive oil, basil, salt, pepper, honey and lemon juice.  Place the scallops in a large plastic resealable bag or bowl and add the basil mixture.  Toss to coat and marinate in the refrigerator up to 45 minutes.

Preheat the grill on high.  When hot, oil the grate well.  Or place a grill screen directly on the hot grate and oil it.  Remove the scallops from the marinade and thread them on skewers.  Discard the marinade.

In a small bowl, mix together the glaze ingredients; set aside.

Grill the scallops until just opaque in the center, 4 to 6 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling.  Brush with the glaze during the last 1 to 2 minutes of grilling time.  Do not overcook or the scallops will be tough and chewy.

Remove from the grill and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  They're great for a quick dinner because the shrimp or sea scallops need little marinating time and cook so quickly.  Thread the seafood on wooden skewers for easier turning on the grill.

In a small bowl, mix together the glaze ingredients; set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grill the scallops until just opaque in the center, 4 to 6 minutes, turning once halfway through grilling.  Brush with the glaze during the last 1 to 2 minutes of grilling time.  Do not overcook or the scallops will be tough and chewy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the grill and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  They&apos;re great for a quick dinner because the shrimp or sea scallops need little marinating time and cook so quickly.  Thread the seafood on wooden skewers for easier turning on the grill.

           Grilled Steak And Roasted Red Onion Ring Sandwiches

Recipe By     :Barbara Scott-Goodman
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINATED STEAK ===
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2 1/2         pounds  sirloin, 1" thick
                        = (or top round or flank steak)
                        === ONION RINGS ===
  4             medium  red onions -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4"-thick rings
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SANDWICHES ===
  12            slices  rye bread
                        Mayonnaise or mustard
                        Boston or Bibb lettuce -- coarsely shredded

Combine the vinegar and soy sauce in a small bowl.  Whisk in the olive oil.  Place the steak in a large glass or ceramic baking dish and pour the marinade over it.  Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 hours, or overnight.  Turn steak occasionally.

Prepare a gas or charcoal grill.

Grill steak over medium-hot coals for 4 to 5 minutes to a side for rare; 6 to 7 minutes for medium.  Baste with the marinade during grilling.  Remove steak to a cutting board and thinly slice on the diagonal.  Cover the meat and refrigerate to chill.

To prepare the onion rings, pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.  Place sliced onions in a roasting pan.  Toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil and salt and pepper.  Roast the onions until fork-tender, about 1 hour.

To assemble the sandwiches, generously spread the bread with the mayonnaise or mustard.  Divide the sliced steak between 6 of the bread slices and cover it with the roasted onion rings.  Top with the shredded lettuce and the remaining bread and cut the sandwiches in half.

This recipe yields 6 sandwiches.

Comments:  This wonderful, hearty sandwich is great for a picnic lunch.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  large shrimp -- unpeeled, deveined
     1/3           cup  tequila
                        = (or orange juice)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime or lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  reduced-fat or nonfat sour cream
     1/2                reduced-fat or nonfat mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        === FOR GRILLING ===
                        Oil -- for grill grate
                        Wooden skewers -- soaked in warm water
                        for at least 30 minutes, or metal skewers

Rinse the shrimp in cold water.  Using a small pair of scissors or paring knife, carefully cut a slit in the back of each shrimp.  Place the shrimp in a large bowl or a large plastic resealable bag.

In a small bowl, mix together the tequila, olive oil, lime juice, garlic, cumin, black pepper, salt and cilantro.  Pour this mixture over the shrimp, tossing to coat.  Marinate in the refrigerator up to 45 minutes.

To prepare the Sauce:  In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Preheat the grill on high.  Remove the shrimp from the marinade and thread on skewers.  Discard the marinade.  When the grill is ready, oil the grate well.  Grill the shrimp until the shells turn pink and the shrimp are just opaque, turning once during grilling.

Remove from the grill and serve with the sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The sauce also works well with grilled sea scallops.

             Grilled-Banana Split With Chocolate Toffee Melt

Recipe By     :Cheryl and Bill Jamison
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Grilling


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  half-and-half
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  6             medium  bananas
  3                     toffee candy bars - (1.4 oz ea)
                        = (or 4 to 5 oz chocolate-covered
                        toffee, chopped into chunks)
  2                     flavors ice cream (12 to 18 scoops total)
                        Whipped cream
                        Toasted almonds

Prepare a medium grill.

Meanwhile, combine sugar and half-and-half in a heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to a full rolling boil, stirring occasionally.  Stir in butter; remove from the heat.

Just before grilling, slice the bananas, still in their skins, lengthwise.

Transfer bananas, cut-side down, to a well-oiled grate.  Grill, covered or uncovered, 3 to 4 minutes.  Turn bananas skin-side down, brush cut surfaces with a few teaspoons of half-and-half mixture, and grill 2 to 3 minutes longer, until soft and lightly colored.

Remove bananas from skins.  If you have long banana-split dishes, leave banana halves whole; place two halves in each dish.  If not, cut bananas into bite-size chunks and divide among dishes.

Return half-and-half mixture to medium-low heat; stir in toffee chunks.  Cook briefly, until chocolate and toffee have partly melted (leaving some chunkiness); stir well.

Top each dish of bananas with 2 or 3 scoops ice cream and some of the chocolate-toffee melt.  Add whipped cream and almonds; serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 generous servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     chickens - (abt 3 lbs ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BASTING SAUCE ===
  6        tablespoons  honey -- or more
  3        tablespoons  tarragon or white wine Vinegar
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  1           teaspoon  dried tarragon

In bowl, combine honey (use up to 8 tablespoons if you think necessary), vinegar, curry powder and tarragon.

Remove grids from barbecue.  Place one or two shallow drip pans -- filled with water or stock (you can also add a splash of white wine on the lava rocks.  Preheat barbecue to high setting.

Arrange chickens on spit, making sure they are evenly balanced.  Brush with honey basting sauce and install rotisserie on barbecue with drip pans directly underneath.

Barbecue at high setting for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium and roast chickens, with lid down, for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, basting every 30 minutes with sauce, until thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh registers 185 degrees.  Remove from barbecue, season with salt and pepper, and tent with foil.  Let stand 10 minutes before carving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Indirect Cooking Method for Gas Barbrcues with Two Burners:  Place a shallow metal or foil pan (not necessary to add water) under one side of grill to catch drippings.  Preheat both sides of barbecue on high setting.  Tie wings and legs of chicken with string; brush lightly with oil.  Place chicken breast-side down on hot grill and cook for two minutes.  Turn chicken on its side and grill for two minutes.  (A long-handled spoon inserted in cavity makes it easy to turn).  Turn on back and grill for two minutes; continue to grill chicken on other side for two minutes until browned all over.  Place chicken, breast-side up, on the side of barbecue with drip pan underneath; turn off burner on that side.  Brush liberally with sauce and roast chicken with lid down for about 90 minutes, brushing occasionally with sauce, until chicken is done.  (Indirect heat from other side of barbecue will cook the chicken).  This method also works well with beef, pork, or lamb roasts.

Cooking Method for Charcoal Barbecue with a Lid:  Move the hot coals to the sides of barbecue and place a drip pan in centre.  Place chicken or roast on grill with drip pan directly underneath.  Cook with lid down and use a meat thermometer to gauge when foods are cooked.

Recipe By     :Tom Douglas
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PORK CHOPS ===
  5               cups  cold water
     3/4           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/2           cup  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  unsulfured light molasses
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     thick-cut pork chops
                        = (abt 1 1/2" thick and abt 12 oz ea)
                        === FOR THE APPLE RINGS ===
  2                     tart apples
                        = (preferably Braeburn or Granny Smith)
     1/4           cup  honey
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Creamy Corn Grits -- (see recipe)
                        Fresh thyme sprigs -- (optional), garnish

For the Pork Chops:  In a nonreactive pan or bowl, combine the water, brown sugar, salt, maple syrup, molasses, bay leaves, ginger, allspice and pepper.  Add the pork chops, cover and refrigerate for 1 day.

Fire up the grill.  Remove the pork chops from the brine, discarding the brine; set aside at room temperature for 20 minutes.

Grill the pork chops over direct heat, covered, with the vents open.  Smoke should be flowing from the vents, which means the fire is hot, and you should be able to hear the pork sizzling.  Brown both sides of the pork chops.  If the surface is burning, move the pork chops to an area of indirect heat on the grill.

Pull the pork from the grill when it reaches an internal temperature of 140 to 145 degrees on an instant-read meat thermometer.  It should take approximately 25 minutes total.  Let the pork chops rest about 5 minutes.

For the Apple Rings:  Core the apples, leaving the peels on, and slice into rings about 1/4-inch thick.  In a small bowl, combine the honey and lemon juice.  Brush this mixture on the apple rings and grill them over direct heat, with the lid off, until caramelized, about 4 minutes.  You don't want to cook them so much that they fall apart; the goal is simply to caramelize them.

On the plate:  Spoon the Creamy Corn Grits in the center of 4 individual plates.  Lean a pork chop against the mound of grits.  Garnish with the grilled apple rings and, if desired, a sprig of fresh thyme.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  Try a Cotes-du-Rhone, maybe from the small town of Vacqueyras.  They are quite fruity in nature.

Comments:  The maple syrup in this cure does two things; it adds a touch of sweetness as well as an incredible flavor.  For me, the smell of the cured chops charcoal-grilling reminds me of my Grandma Fogarty's kitchen.  You can also try this cure technique with grilled pork tenderloin (and adjust the grilling time as needed).  The pork needs to marinate a day ahead, so plan accordingly.

For the Pork Chops:  In a nonreactive pan or bowl, combine the water, brown sugar, salt, maple syrup, molasses, bay leaves, ginger, allspice and pepper.  Add the pork chops, cover and refrigerate for 1 day.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fire up the grill.  Remove the pork chops from the brine, discarding the brine; set aside at room temperature for 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grill the pork chops over direct heat, covered, with the vents open.  Smoke should be flowing from the vents, which means the fire is hot, and you should be able to hear the pork sizzling.  Brown both sides of the pork chops.  If the surface is burning, move the pork chops to an area of indirect heat on the grill.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pull the pork from the grill when it reaches an internal temperature of 140 to 145 degrees on an instant-read meat thermometer.  It should take approximately 25 minutes total.  Let the pork chops rest about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Apple Rings:  Core the apples, leaving the peels on, and slice into rings about 1/4-inch thick.  In a small bowl, combine the honey and lemon juice.  Brush this mixture on the apple rings and grill them over direct heat, with the lid off, until caramelized, about 4 minutes.  You don&apos;t want to cook them so much that they fall apart; the goal is simply to caramelize them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On the plate:  Spoon the Creamy Corn Grits in the center of 4 individual plates.  Lean a pork chop against the mound of grits.  Garnish with the grilled apple rings and, if desired, a sprig of fresh thyme.

Categories    : Grilling                        Mushrooms


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  portobello mushrooms
                        === MARINADE ===
  4             cloves  garlic -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1           teaspoon  cracked black pepper
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
     2/3           cup  extra virgin olive oil
                        === SPICY PEPPER SAUCE ===
  1                cup  red wine
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2                     shallots -- chopped
  2               cups  roasted vegetable stock
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- roasted, peeled,
                        stemmed and seeded
  2                     Anaheim peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        stemmed and seeded
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
  2          teaspoons  ground toasted cumin seeds
  1           teaspoon  chopped cilantro
  2          teaspoons  unsalted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To prepare the marinade, put all of the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk together.  Remove the stems from the portobellos and discard them.  Place the mushroom caps in a large bowl, pour the marinade over them, and toss well.  Let marinate for at least 30 minutes.

To prepare the sauce, put the red wine, garlic, and shallots in a medium saucepan and reduce over high heat until about 1/3 cup of liquid remains, about 4 minutes.  Add the vegetable stock and peppers, decrease the heat to medium, and reduce until about half of the liquid remains.

Puree the sauce in the pan with a handheld blender.  Alternatively, transfer the sauce to the bowl of a food processor and blend, then return to the pan.  Season to taste with the coriander, cumin, and cilantro.  Add the butter, and stir well.  Season to taste with the salt and pepper.  Keep warm.

To prepare the mushrooms, oil the grill racks and heat the grill to very hot.  Remove the mushrooms from the marinade, letting the excess marinade drain off, and place the caps on the grill.  Grill on each side for 3 to 4 minutes, or until tender.

To serve, divide mashed potatoes or polenta among the serving plates.  Top with the mushrooms and pour some of the sauce over them.  Serve immediately with the remaining sauce in a bowl on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                     Marvelous Marinated London Broil

Recipe By     :Alicia Ross and Beverly Mills
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  honey
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  reduced-sodium soy sauce
                        Juice of 1 lime
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  2 1/4         pounds  London broil (top round steak)

Measure honey into a 2-cup glass measure.  Microwave, uncovered, on high for 30 seconds.

Add oil, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, garlic and onion powder to honey.  Whisk to blend well.

Place meat in a gallon-size, zipper-top plastic bag.  Whisk marinade once more; pour over meat.  Seal bag.  Turn bag several times to cover the meat with marinade.  Refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours, turning bag at least once, if possible.

Prepare a medium-hot fire in grill.

Remove meat from marinade; discard marinade.  Grill meat, covering the grill, to desired doneness, about 7 to 10 minutes a side for medium-rare, depending on the thickness.  Do not overcook.

Remove from grill and thinly slice across the grain.  Serve at once, or let stand until ready to serve.  (Refrigerate leftovers, covered, up to 3 days.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Unfortunately, this recipe just isn't the same if you can't grill it, so think about investing in a small grill if you don't have one.  We prefer gas models because at the flick of a switch, you're ready to cook.  Of course, for some folks charcoal is the only way to go.  If that's you, you'll still love this recipe.

                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     beef tenderloin - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
                        = (preferably center cut)
  1                     large bunch fresh Italian flat-leaf parsle -- stemmed
                        = (abt 2 cups leaves)
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1                cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar -- or more to taste
  3        tablespoons  water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt -- or more to taste
  1           teaspoon  finely-ground black pepper -- or more to taste

Place the piece of tenderloin lengthwise on the cutting board.  Holding the knife parallel to the cutting board, cut the meat into 4 flat, even horizontal strips.  Place each strip between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound with the side of a cleaver or with a rolling pin to a thickness of 1/4 inch.  Arrange the steaks in a nonreactive baking dish.

Prepare the chimichurri.  Combine the parsley and garlic in a food processor and process until finely chopped.  Add the oil, 1/4 cup vinegar, water, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and process to make a thick sauce.  Correct the seasoning, adding salt, pepper, or vinegar as necessary; the mixture should be highly seasoned.  Place half the chimichurri in a bowl or crock for serving; pour the remainder over the meat.  Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator, 30 minutes, turning several times.

Preheat the grill to high.

When ready to cook, oil the grill grate.  Drain the beef and place it on the hot grate.  Grill, turning with tongs, until cooked to taste, 1 to 2 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Serve with the remaining chimichurri sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The word churrasco is used throughout Latin America to describe beef cooked on the grill, although the precise meaning varies from country to country.  In Brazil, for example, churrasco is the generic term for barbecue.  In Nicaragua it refers to a broad, thin steak cut from a beef tenderloin.  Most steaks are cut across the muscle grain, but Nicaragua's churrasco is cut along the grain.  What results is a flat, thin piece of meat with a remarkable texture, a steak that's tender enough to cut with a fork.  (And the steak's broad surface area readily picks up the smoke flavor from the coals.)

Nicaraguan churrasco is always served with a trio of sauces: chimichurri (here used as a marinade as well), salsa marinara (Nicaraguan Tomato Sauce), and a spicy pickled onion sauce called cebollita.  Other accompaniments might include fried plantains and Bahamian peas and rice.

Nicaraguan churrasco is always served with a trio of sauces: chimichurri (here used as a marinade as well), salsa marinara (Nicaraguan Tomato Sauce), and a spicy pickled onion sauce called cebollita.  Other accompaniments might include fried plantains and Bahamian peas and rice.

                        North Carolina Pulled Pork

Recipe By     :Steven Raichlen
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork                            Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     Boston butt - (5 to 7 lbs)
                        = (bone-in pork shoulder roast)
  3        tablespoons  to 4 of Basic Barbecue Rub -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  cider vinegar
  1              small  onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper - (to 2) -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  coarse salt
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  hot red pepper flakes
  3               cups  North Carolina Vinegar Sauce -- (see recipe)
  10                    hamburger buns - (to 12)
                        Coleslaw -- for serving

Sprinkle pork shoulder on all sides with Basic Barbecue Rub, patting it onto the meat with your fingers.  Grill right away, or let stand in the refrigerator, covered, up to 24 hours.  The longer you cure it, the richer the flavor will be.

Place all the wood chips in the smoker box or in a smoker pouch; using all but 1 burner, preheat grill to high until you see smoke, then reduce heat to medium-low.

To prepare mop sauce:  Combine vinegar, onion, jalapeÒos, salt, sugar, black pepper, red pepper flakes and 1/2 cup water in a nonreactive bowl; stir until salt and brown sugar dissolve.

Place pork, fat-side up, on grill, away from direct heat.  Cover grill and cook pork until very tender, 4 to 6 hours (about 195 degrees on an instant-read meat thermometer).  After 1 hour, baste the pork with the mop sauce; repeat every hour.

Transfer cooked pork to a cutting board, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 15 minutes.  When ready to serve, wearing rubber gloves, pull off skin and fat.  Finely chop crisp skin with a cleaver; add skin to pulled pork or discard.  Discard fat.

Pull pork into pieces or chop it.  Transfer pork to a roasting pan; stir in 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the North Carolina Vinegar Sauce, enough to keep the pork moist.

To serve, mound pork on hamburger buns and top with coleslaw.  Serve remaining vinegar sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

                Pork Kebabs With Rosemary Marmalade Glaze

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     rosemary stems -- to make skewers
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  orange zest
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1              pound  boneless pork loin
  1              large  red onion
  1                     green bell pepper
  2              large  firm peaches
  1                cup  orange marmalade
                        Several sprigs fresh rosemary

Cut several long stems of rosemary and scrape them, leaving several leaves on the top end.  (Use a garden glove to protect your hand and ran the stem through your fingers to remove the leaves.)  Cut the bottom end of the stem at an angle so that it is pointed and more easily pierces the food.  Soak the skewers in a pan of water 8 hours to overnight.  A roasting pan works well for this.

Combine 1/4 cup olive oil, lemon juice, orange zest and chopped rosemary in a shallow glass baking dish or a zip-close bag.  Cut pork in 1-inch cubes and add to the marinade, tossing to coat completely.  Cover and refrigerate up to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Cut red onion and bell pepper in 1- to 1 1/2-inch squares.  Cut unpeeled peaches in about 2-inch cubes.

In a small saucepan over low heat, cook marmalade and rosemary sprigs until the marmalade is completely liquid.  Set aside.

Thread pork and peaches alternately on four rosemary skewers; thread onion and bell pepper pieces alternately on remaining skewers.

Brush skewers with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Place on the grill with the leaf end hanging over the side of the grill to keep it from burning.  Turn often to ensure even cooking.

The pork and peaches take about 12 minutes, the peppers and onions about 15 minutes.  Just before the kebabs are cooked through, brush with the marmalade glaze and continue cooking until done.

This recipe yields 4 servings (1 pork and 1 vegetable kebab).

<DirT>
Cut several long stems of rosemary and scrape them, leaving several leaves on the top end.  (Use a garden glove to protect your hand and ran the stem through your fingers to remove the leaves.)  Cut the bottom end of the stem at an angle so that it is pointed and more easily pierces the food.  Soak the skewers in a pan of water 8 hours to overnight.  A roasting pan works well for this.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine 1/4 cup olive oil, lemon juice, orange zest and chopped rosemary in a shallow glass baking dish or a zip-close bag.  Cut pork in 1-inch cubes and add to the marinade, tossing to coat completely.  Cover and refrigerate up to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut red onion and bell pepper in 1- to 1 1/2-inch squares.  Cut unpeeled peaches in about 2-inch cubes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small saucepan over low heat, cook marmalade and rosemary sprigs until the marmalade is completely liquid.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Thread pork and peaches alternately on four rosemary skewers; thread onion and bell pepper pieces alternately on remaining skewers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush skewers with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Place on the grill with the leaf end hanging over the side of the grill to keep it from burning.  Turn often to ensure even cooking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The pork and peaches take about 12 minutes, the peppers and onions about 15 minutes.  Just before the kebabs are cooked through, brush with the marmalade glaze and continue cooking until done.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings (1 pork and 1 vegetable kebab).

               Pork Tenderloin And Grilled Vegetable Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     pork tenderloins - (3/4 lb ea)
  1                cup  dry red wine
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary - (2" long)
  1                     garlic clove -- smashed
     1/4      teaspoon  dried hot red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  red-wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  mild-flavored honey
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
  2             medium  red bell peppers -- quartered
  3             medium  zucchini - (1 lb total) -- trimmed, and cut
                        lengthwise into 1/4" slices
  1             medium  onion -- cut lengthwise
                        into 6 wedges, leaving root ends intact
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  2               cups  trimmed baby arugula - (abt 1 oz)

Trim off tail ends of tenderloins to form 2 (8-ounce) pieces, reserving trimmings for another use.

Boil wine, rosemary sprig, garlic and red pepper flakes in a small heavy saucepan until reduced to about 1/2 cup, 7 to 8 minutes.  Pour through a fine sieve into a measuring cup, then transfer rosemary sprig, garlic and red pepper flakes to a sealable plastic bag along with 1/4 cup wine marinade and tenderloins.  Refrigerate, turning bag occasionally, at least 2 hours or overnight.

To prepare dressing:  Return remaining 1/4 cup wine marinade to saucepan.  Add vinegar, honey and chopped rosemary; boil until reduced to about 1/4 cup, 6 to 8 minutes.

Prepare grill for cooking.

When fire is medium-hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above the rack for 3 to 4 seconds), put bell peppers, zucchini and onion on a lightly oiled grill rack and place over fire.

Grill zucchini and onion, turning, until tender, 8 to 10 minutes, then transfer to a cutting board.

Grill peppers until skins are blackened and flesh begins to soften, about 8 minutes, then transfer to a bowl, cover and let steam 10 minutes.

While peppers are steaming, pat pork dry and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Grill on lightly oiled grill rack over medium-hot fire, turning frequently, until an instant-read thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into meat registers 155 degrees, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to a cutting board, tent loosely with foil and let stand 10 minutes before slicing.

Peel peppers and cut into 1-inch pieces.  Transfer to a large bowl.

Cut zucchini and onion into 1-inch pieces; add to peppers.  Toss vegetables with 2 tablespoons rosemary dressing, 1 teaspoon oil, and salt and pepper to taste.

Toss arugula with remaining 1 teaspoon oil.  Mound grilled vegetables on 4 plates; top with sliced pork.  Add any juices from cutting board to remaining 2 tablespoons dressing and drizzle over pork.  Top with arugula.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Many packages of pork tenderloin contain two tenderloins weighing about 3/4 pound each.  If you happen to get a package with one larger tenderloin, simply cook it a little while longer.

If the grids on your grill are widely spaced, you may want to use a grill basket for the vegetables.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     rack beef ribs rack - (2 1/2 to 3 lbs)
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste
                        Cracked or coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  apple or hickory chips or chunks -- soaked in water to
                        cover for 1 hour, then drained
                        Favorite barbecue sauce

Generously season beef ribs on both sides with salt and pepper.

Set up grill for indirect grilling.  On a charcoal grill, light the coals and rake them into 2 piles at opposite sides of the grill.  Place an aluminum foil drip pan in the center.  Toss half the wood chips on the coals.

On a gas grill, light burner on 1 side.  Place drip pan on other side.  Place all the wood chips in a smoker box or smoker pouch.  (To make the latter, tightly wrap chips in aluminum foil and poke holes in the top with a pencil to allow smoke to escape.)  Place smoker pouch directly over one of the burners under the grate and run grill on high until you see lots of smoke, then reduce heat to medium-low.

Immediately place ribs on the grate, meat-side up, over the drip pan away from the heat.  Cover grill and adjust vents to obtain a temperature of about 275 degrees.  (If using a smoker, follow manufacturer's instructions.)

Indirect grill the ribs until dark golden brown (almost black), very crisp on the outside and very tender, 5 hours.  (If using charcoal grill, replenish coals every hour, adding remaining wood chips after the first hour.)

Serve with your favorite barbecue sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Comments:  Pit master Mike Mills is way too wily to share his recipe for baby back ribs. (And even if he did, I wouldn't believe half of what he told me.) But he did outline the basic procedure for making Blue Smoke's meaty beef ribs.  By the way, if you've never had a barbecued beef rib, you're about to have a life-changing experience.

Take a 36-inch piece of foil and fold in half to create a double thickness.  Place bean mixture on one half and top with sausage links.  Fold over other half of foil to cover.  Crimp 3 edges of foil together to seal, forming a pouch.

Place packet on grill (sausage-side down) and cook 10 minutes on high.  Flip carefully, and cook 10 minutes longer or until juices run clear.  Open pouch carefully -- steam is hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN ===
  1                     broiler/fryer chicken - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1             medium  lime
  1             medium  lemon
     3/4           cup  Italian salad dressing - (to 1)
  1                cup  orange juice
     1/2                onion -- sliced, or quartered
                        Nonstick cooking spray -- as needed
                        === GLAZE ===
  1                cup  orange marmalade
     1/2           cup  water -- divided
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  1           teaspoon  honey - (to 2)
  2             dashes  hot sauce -- (optional)

To prepare Chicken:  Rinse chicken; cut in half.  Wash and pat dry.  Salt and pepper chicken; sprinkle with chili powder and garlic powder.

Juice lime and lemon; place juice in self-sealing plastic bag, along with remains of squeezed lemon and lime.  Add salad dressing, orange juice and onion; mix to combine.  Add seasoned chicken to bag.  Refrigerate at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.  Drain chicken; discard marinade.

Remove cooking grid from grill or smoker.  Prepare medium fire in gas or charcoal grill or preheat smoker.  Coat cold cooking grid with nonstick cooking spray.  Soak chunks of hickory or fruit wood in water at least 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare Glaze:  Warm marmalade in saucepan over medium heat.  Increase heat; bring to a rapid boil.  Add 1/4 cup water, lemon juice, orange juice and honey.  Return to a rolling boil; reduce heat and let simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.  If mixture is too thick, thin with remaining 1/4 cup water.  If desired, strain out orange zest (from the marmalade).  Stir in hot sauce.  Set aside.

Add soaked wood to burning coals.  Add chicken to grill; immediately apply glaze generously to chicken.

Cook about 1 hour, adding more soaked wood chunks as necessary (chicken should smoke for 30 to 45 minutes).  Chicken is done when breast temperature measures 160 degrees and thigh measures 180 degrees when tested with instant-read thermometer.  Watch carefully; glaze can burn easily because of its high sugar content.

Serve with favorite barbecue sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

        Southwestern Tuna With Grilled Pineapple And Sweet Onions

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     tuna steaks, 1 1/4"-thk - (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        = (may substitute swordfish)
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  pineapple juice
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, minced
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh oregano or cilantro
                        === SPICE RUB ===
  2        tablespoons  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
     1/2    tablespoon  kosher salt
                        === FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ===
  4             slices  fresh pineapple, 1/2"-thk
  4             slices  sweet onion such as Vidalia, 1/4"-thk
                        Vegetable oil -- for the grill
  2                     limes -- halved

For the Marinade:  In a shallow bowl, combine the oil, juice, garlic, jalapeÒo pepper and oregano or cilantro.  Add the tuna and turn to coat.  Cover and refrigerate, turning once, for 2 hours.

For the Spice Rub:  In a small bowl combine the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, pepper and salt; set aside.

Preheat the grill on high.

Transfer the tuna to a platter, discarding the marinade.  Sprinkle both sides of each tuna steak with the spice rub.

Lightly brush the grill rack and both sides of the fish with oil.  Grill the fish over high heat for 5 to 6 minutes.

Lightly brush the top of the fish with oil.  Using a long-handled spatula, carefully turn the fish.  Grill until cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes.

For the Fruit And Vegetables:  Immediately after turning the fish, using a clean brush, rub the pineapple and onion slices lightly with oil.  Grill, turning once, for 5 to 6 minutes.

To serve, divide the pineapple and onion slices evenly among individual plates and top with a fish steak.  Squeeze the juice from a lime half over each fish steak.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Tuna steaks stand up to the intense heat of the grill.  They also pair particularly well with the flavor of mesquite.  The sweetness of the grilled pineapple and onions balances the intense spices.  Serve with corn on the cob or your favorite salsa or salad.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  paprika, preferably Hungarian
  2        tablespoons  chili powder, preferably Gebhardt
  1           teaspoon  to 2 of cayenne pepper -- (optional)
  2        tablespoons  granulated garlic or garlic powder
  2        tablespoons  light or dark brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  dry mustard, preferably Colman's
  1           teaspoon  ground sage
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4           cup  salt
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl or jar.

This recipe yields 1 cup.

Comments:  This dry rub recipe is very versatile and can be used to flavor long, slow-cooked meats, such as pork ribs and beef brisket, as well as quickly grilled steaks or pork chops.  You can make it ahead and store it at room temperature in a tightly sealed jar for two months.

                           Spicy Beer Marinade

Recipe By     :Bruce Aidells
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grilling                        Marinades


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
  3        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  1             bottle  lager beer - (12 oz)
  1         tablespoon  coarse-grained mustard
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        = (or 1 tbspn A-1 steak sauce)
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  minced onion
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 cups, enough for two 1 1/2- to 2-pound steaks.

Comments:  Many marinades use wine, but while white wine is acceptable, I think that marinades containing red wine impart a sharp, bitter, and acrid flavor to grilled meat.  Beer, on the other hand, is a delightful liquid for marinating, imparting an ever-so-slight malty flavor that goes particularly well with the smokiness of grilling.  Use this marinade with sirloin steak, flank steak, or top round (often sold as London broil).

        Striped Bass With Lemon-Basil Marinade And Couscous Salad

Recipe By     :Russell Cronkhite
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  crushed fennel seeds
  2          teaspoons  freshly-cracked black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              bunch  fresh basil leaves -- minced
  4              whole  bass or rockfish - (abt 2 lbs ea)
                        = (may substitute trout, perch or sole)
                        Coarse salt -- for seasoning
                        Olive oil -- for brushing grate
  2                     lemons -- halved
                        Couscous Salad -- (see recipe)

In a medium bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, oil, fennel, pepper, red pepper flakes, garlic and basil.

Add the fish, one at a time, and turn to coat each fish, inside and out, with the marinade.  Transfer the fish to a shallow baking dish, pour the remaining marinade over the top, cover and refrigerate for 4 hours.

Preheat the grill on medium.  Remove the fish from the marinade and pat dry; discard the marinade.

Lightly brush the grill rack with oil.  Grill the fish over medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes.  Lightly brush the fish with oil.  Using long-handled tongs, carefully turn the fish.  Grill until cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes.

The fish should flake easily all the way through.  If the fish is not done, close the top of the grill and heat for a few more minutes.

To serve, transfer an entire fish to individual plates with lemon.  Serve with Couscous Salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Rockfish are never sold whole at less than 2 pounds each, so if you choose this recipe, which uses whole fish, not fillets, remember that it will provide an ample serving for each diner.  The natural combination of lemon and basil imparts a subtle flavor to just about any seafood.  I serve this with a simple, Moroccan-inspired Couscous Salad.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, oil, fennel, pepper, red pepper flakes, garlic and basil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the fish, one at a time, and turn to coat each fish, inside and out, with the marinade.  Transfer the fish to a shallow baking dish, pour the remaining marinade over the top, cover and refrigerate for 4 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the grill on medium.  Remove the fish from the marinade and pat dry; discard the marinade.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly brush the grill rack with oil.  Grill the fish over medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes.  Lightly brush the fish with oil.  Using long-handled tongs, carefully turn the fish.  Grill until cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The fish should flake easily all the way through.  If the fish is not done, close the top of the grill and heat for a few more minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, transfer an entire fish to individual plates with lemon.  Serve with Couscous Salad.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Rockfish are never sold whole at less than 2 pounds each, so if you choose this recipe, which uses whole fish, not fillets, remember that it will provide an ample serving for each diner.  The natural combination of lemon and basil imparts a subtle flavor to just about any seafood.  I serve this with a simple, Moroccan-inspired Couscous Salad.

                 The Best Stinkin' Sandwich In Town - ...

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Grilling

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === THE TRI TIP ===
  1                     tri tip roast -- about 2 lb.
  1                jar  roasted garlic cloves - (6 oz)
                        = (Christopher Ranch brand preferred)
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh peeled garlic
                        = (Christopher Ranch brand preferred)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === THE AIOLI ===
     1/2           cup  reserved roasted garlic cloves -- from above
     1/2           cup  pitted kalamata olives
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === THE REST ===
  6                     crusty French rolls
  1                cup  finely-shredded basil chiffonade
  1                cup  arugula chiffonade
  1                cup  romaine lettuce chiffonade
  3                     roma tomatoes -- seeded, diced

For the roast, set aside 1/2 cup of the roasted garlic cloves for the aioli.  Place olive oil, chopped garlic and herbs in a medium resealable plastic bag.

Place tri tip on a firm surface.  Pierce with a paring knife and place a whole clove of roasted garlic all the way into the meat.  Repeat until all roasted garlic is inserted.  This may take about 10 minutes but is well worth the time.

Place tri tip in the bag with the marinade, making sure the marinade is distributed evenly over the meat.  Marinate for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator.

For the aioli, place reserved roasted garlic and olives in a food processor.  Pulse until coarsely chopped.  Add mayonnaise, balsamic vinegar and herbs.  Pulse again until blended.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Using the direct heat method, grill tri tip over medium heat until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees.  Let meat rest for 20 minutes before slicing.

While meat is resting, lightly toast French rolls on the grill.  Prepare greens and tomatoes, then toss together gently just before assembling sandwich.  Slice meat and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Spread both sides of the rolls with aioli.  Top with tri tip, greens and tomatoes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                Wasabi-Glazed Whitefish With Zucchini Slaw

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Grilling
                Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame oil
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  wasabi powder
                        = (or 1 tbspn prepared horseradish)
  4                     fresh skinless whitefish, sea bass, or
                        orange roughy fillets, 1" thk - (4 oz ea)
                        === SLAW ===
  1 1/3           cups  coarsely-shredded zucchini
  1                cup  sliced radishes
  1                cup  fresh pea pods
  2        tablespoons  snipped fresh chives
  3        tablespoons  rice vinegar

Combine soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon of the seasme oil, 1/4 teaspoon of the sugar, and the wasabi powder.  Rinse fish; pat dry with paper towels.  Brush both sides of fish with soy mixture.

Lightly grease the rack of a gas grill.  Preheat grill.  Reduce heat to medium.  Place fish on the grill rack directly over heat, tucking under any thin edges.  Cover and grill for 8 to 12 minutes or until fish just flakes easily when tested with a fork, gently turning once halfway through grilling.

To cook fish on a charcoal grill, grill fish directly over medium coals for 8 to 12 minutes or until fish just flakes easily when tested with a fork, gently turning once halfway through grilling.  Serve as above.

Meanwhile, for slaw, in a medium bowl combine the zucchini, radishes, pea pods, and chives.  Stir together vinegar, the remaining sesame oil, and the remaining sugar.  Drizzle over the zucchini mixture; toss to coat.  Serve the fish with slaw.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Wasabi -- the head-clearing green condiment traditionally served with sushi -- adds a subtle fire to this fish dish.  Look for wasabi powder or paste in Japanese markets or larger supermarkets.

                    Whole Chicken, Halved, And Grilled

Recipe By     :Kate Heyhoe
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Grilling
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  chicken - (abt 4 lbs) -- cut in half
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        = (or vegetable or canola oil)
                        === SPICE RUB ===
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  granulated garlic
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh thyme
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried thyme, crumbled)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh rosemary
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried rosemary, crumbled)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh oregano
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried oregano, crumbled)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt

Rub each chicken half with a small amount of oil, then rub in the spice rub (or other spices of choice).  If possible, refrigerate at least 30 minutes for spices to penetrate.  But you can also proceed with grilling immediately and it will still taste good.

Heat one-half of the grill to medium, leaving the other half unheated.  Just before grilling, lightly coat the chicken skin with nonstick spray or brush the grill with oil.  Grill, skin-side down, directly over medium heat, until grill marks form and the skin starts to turn color (watch that the skin doesn't burn).

Turn the halves over and move them to an area away from the heat source, so they can cook indirectly.  (If you have a two-tier grill, move them to the upper rack, above an area without direct heat.)  Cover the grill.

Every 15 minutes or so, reposition the halves so they cook evenly.  Cook covered until done, about 40 minutes for a 3 to 4 pound bird, then test for doneness.  Chicken is done when it reaches 170 degrees in the thigh, as measured by a meat thermometer.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  A whole chicken is thrifty but can take some time to cook on the grill.  Cutting the chicken in half, using a chef's knife or poultry shears, takes just a few minutes but saves plenty of cooking time.  Flavor the chicken with a dry rub or marinade before cooking.

For Best Results:  Grill the chicken halves skin-side down on medium heat, until light and golden.  Then flip them over and cook over indirect heat, covered, until cooked through (at this point it's like roasting them in the oven).  The skin will continue to brown from the indirect heat.  Rotate the halves in relation to the heat source so the meat cooks evenly.

Categories    : Grilling                        Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  jumbo shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  3 1/2         ounces  achiote paste - ( 1/2 block)
  2        tablespoons  orange juice concentrate
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Fresh lime wedges -- for serving

Prepare the shrimp and place them in a gallon-size resealable plastic storage bag.  Refrigerate.

Combine the remaining ingredients in a small bowl, mashing the achiote with a fork at first to break it up, then whisking it in.  Pour over the shrimp and combine well.  Let marinate for at least 30 minutes, preferably a couple of hours.

Grill over a very hot grill, 3 to 4 minutes on each side until cooked through.  Serve immedately with lime wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Achiote (ah-she-O-tay) is a paste that figures prominently in the cooking of the Yucatan Peninsula, where it is used as a marinade for meats.  It comes in a small block that looks like Sculpey clay.  I like it because the color is the orangey-red of a dramatic sunset and the flavor has the appealing characteristic of being very subtle yet very persistent and permeating.  (It reminds me a little of iodine.)  The principal ingredient is annatto seeds, which are used as a dye in butter and cheddar cheese.

I find that the flavor works well with shrimp and makes for a dramatic presentation.  It is routinely combined with oranges --- for good reason, as you'll see.  I like the shrimp with only a squeeze of lime, some rice and black beans and a vinegary slaw.  But you could easily serve a spicy dipping sauce or salsa with them.
