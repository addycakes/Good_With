  2        tablespoons  boiling water
  2        tablespoons  instant espresso powder
     3/4           cup  mascarpone cheese -- room temperature
  1                cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                jar  sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil - (10 oz) -- chopped, and
                        oil reserved
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
     2/3           cup  dry white wine
  8             ounces  angel hair pasta
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  soft fresh goat cheese -- coarsely crumbled
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves

Add the pasta to the tomato mixture and toss to coat, adding some reserved cooking liquid to moisten.  Season the pasta, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle with the goat cheese and parsley and stir.  Mound the pasta into bowls and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  shelled edamame soy beans
  8             ounces  thin green beans -- trimmed
  8             ounces  yellow wax beans -- trimmed
  1 1/2           cups  cherry tomatoes -- halved
     1/3           cup  red wine vinegar

  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Cook the edamame in a large pot of boiling water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain.  Rinse with cold water, then drain well and pat dry.  Repeat with the green beans and yellow beans.  Combine the vegetables in a bowl.

Add the vinegar, oil, herbs, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper to a glass screw-top jar.  Seal the jar and shake vigorously to mix the vinaigrette.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  whole artichoke hearts - (13 to 14 oz) -- rinsed well,
                        drained, and patted dry
  1                cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
     1/4           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated lemon peel
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2                     garlic cloves
  1           teaspoon  salt -- plus
                        more for seasoning
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- plus
                        more for seasoning
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- room temperature
                        Nonstick cooking spray
                        Italian parsley sprigs -- for garnish
                        Assorted breads and crackers -- to serve
                        Assorted cut-up fresh vegetables -- to serve
                        = (such as bell peppers, cucumbers,
                        celery, endive leaves, and carrots)

Blend the artichokes, parsley, nuts, lemon peel, lemon juice, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a food processor, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally, until the artichokes are very finely chopped.  With the machine running, gradually pour in 1/4 cup oil.  Continue blending until the pesto is creamy.  Season the pesto, to taste, with more salt and pepper.

Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large bowl until light and fluffy.

Spray a 2- to 3-cup bowl with nonstick spray.  Line the bowl with plastic wrap, extending the plastic over the sides.  Spread enough cream cheese mixture evenly over the bottom of the prepared bowl to form a 1/2-inch layer.  Top with enough pesto to form a 1/2-inch layer.  Repeat layering the remaining cream cheese mixture and pesto.  Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 2 days.

Invert the torta onto a platter and remove the plastic.  Garnish with parsley sprigs.  Serve with bread, crackers, and vegetables.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Blend the artichokes, parsley, nuts, lemon peel, lemon juice, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a food processor, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally, until the artichokes are very finely chopped.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     Japanese eggplants - (to 6) -- cut 1" cubes
                        = (abt 2 lbs total)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1              pound  mild Italian turkey sausage -- casings removed
     1/3           cup  dry red wine
  3               cups  marinara sauce
  1           teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper flakes
  8             ounces  angel hair pasta
  1              pound  mozzarella -- diced
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1            package  frozen puff pastry - (2 sheets) -- thawed
                        = (a 17 1/4-oz pkg)

Heat 1/3 cup of oil in a large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat.  Add half of the eggplant and toss to coat in the oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Saute the eggplant until it is golden and tender, about 10 minutes.  Decrease the heat to medium.  Add half of the garlic and saute until it is tender, about 2 minutes longer.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the eggplant mixture to a large bowl.  Repeat with the remaining 1/4 cup oil and the remaining eggplant and garlic.

Add the sausage and wine to the same frying pan.  Cook over medium-high heat until the wine evaporates and the sausage is brown, breaking the sausage into pieces with the back of a spoon, about 8 minutes.  Add the sausage, marinara sauce, and crushed red pepper to the eggplant mixture, and toss to combine.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.  Add the angel hair and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until pasta is still slightly crunchy and undercooked.  Drain.  Toss the angel hair with the eggplant mixture.  Cool completely.  Add the mozzarella and Parmesan and toss to combine.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Roll out 1 pastry sheet on a floured surface to a 13 1/2-inch square.  Transfer to a 9-inch springform pan, allowing the excess pastry to hang over the rim.  Spoon the pasta mixture into the pan.  Place the second pastry sheet atop the pasta filling.  Pinch the edges of the pastry sheets together to seal.  Trim the overhanging pastry edges to about 1-inch.  Fold the pastry edges in to form a decorative border.  Cut a slit in the center of the top pastry to allow the steam to escape.

Bake until the pastry is brown and puffed on top, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.  Let stand for 20 minutes.  Remove the pan sides and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  eggs
     1/3           cup  whole milk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (about)
  8             ounces  fontina cheese -- cut into 1/2" cubes
  8             ounces  fresh water-packed mozzarella -- drained, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced fresh basil leaves
  1                cup  Marinara Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan

Whisk the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.  Heat a 6-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.  Brush the skillet with some butter.  Working quickly, pour 3 tablespoons of the egg mixture into the pan, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan evenly.  Cover and cook until the egg crepe is just set, about 1 minute.  Invert the skillet over a plate, and allow the egg crepe to drop onto the plate.  Repeat to make 10 crepes total, brushing the skillet with melted butter as needed and stacking crepes on the plate.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Butter a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish.  Arrange 1 egg crepe on a work surface.  Place some of the fontina and mozzarella cheese in the center of the egg crepe, then sprinkle with some basil.  Roll up the crepe.  Place the filled crepe in the prepared baking dish, seam-side down.  Repeat with the remaining egg crepes, cheese, and basil.  Spoon the Marinara Sauce over the crepes.  Sprinkle with the Parmesan and dot with 2 tablespoons of butter.  Bake until the cheese melts and the top is golden, about 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 5 to 10 servings.

  1                     butternut squash - (abt 3 lbs) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Lightly butter an 8-inch baking dish and set aside.  Fill a large pot with enough water to come 2 inches up the sides of the pot.

Transfer the squash to a food processor and blend until smooth and creamy.  Season the squash to taste with salt and pepper.

Spoon half of the squash evenly over the prepared baking dish.  Dollop half of the pesto all over the squash in the dish.  Sprinkle half of the cheese over the squash.  Repeat layering with the remaining squash, pesto, and cheese.  Using a skewer, swirl the pesto decoratively into the squash.  Dot the top with butter and bake until the gratin is heated through and golden brown around the edges, about 40 minutes.

  1                cup  vegetable oil
  3              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  4                     ripe bananas -- peeled, and
                        coarsely mashed
                        === FROSTING ===
  3             ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- room temperature
     1/3           cup  mascarpone cheese -- room temperature
  3        tablespoons  honey
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts -- toasted

Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium bowl to blend.  Beat the sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl to blend.  Stir in the banana.  Add the dry ingredients and stir just until blended.

Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups.  Bake the muffins on the middle rack until the tops are golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out with no crumbs attached, about 25 minutes.  Transfer the muffins to a rack and cool slightly.  The muffins may be eaten warm or cooled completely and frosted.

To frost the cupcakes:  Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy.  Beat in the mascarpone cheese and then beat in the honey.  Spread the frosting over the muffins.  Sprinkle with the walnuts.

This recipe yields 18 muffins.

                 Beef Crostini With Red Pepper Mayonnaise

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Beef
                First Course

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  36            slices  baguette bread/ 1/2" thick
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     2/3           cup  roasted red peppers preserved in water -- drained well,
                        and patted dry
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              piece  beef tenderloin - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- trimmed
  3        tablespoons  drained capers -- chopped
                        Coarse sea salt -- to serve

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Arrange the bread slices on 2 heavy large baking sheets.  Drizzle 3 tablespoons oil over the bread slices.  Bake until the crostini are pale golden and crisp, about 15 minutes.

Blend the bell peppers and mayonnaise in a food processor until smooth and creamy.  Season the bell pepper mayonnaise, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate.

Tie the beef with kitchen string to help maintain its shape.  Season the beef with salt and pepper.  Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a heavy small skillet over medium heat.  Add the beef to the skillet and cook until brown and cooked to desired doneness, about 8 minutes for rare.  Freeze the beef until it is just frozen (this will make it easier to slice), about 3 hours.  Using a large sharp carving knife, cut the beef into thin slices.

Spread the bell pepper mayonnaise over the crostini and top with the sliced beef.  Arrange the crostini on a platter.  Scatter over the capers, sprinkle with the coarse sea salt, and serve.

Alternative:  If desired, the beef tenderloin can be substituted with 1 pound freshly sliced roast beef.  Since the roast beef is already cooked and can be used as is, it makes a great time-saving alternative.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Do-Ahead Tip:  The bell pepper mayonnaise and sliced beef can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and refrigerate.

Puree the blueberries in a clean blender with 1/3 cup of the sugar syrup until smooth.  Strain through a clean fine-meshed strainer and into a third bowl.  Discard the seeds and solids.  Pour each of the purees into clear glass bowls or small pitchers.

For each serving, pour 2 to 4 tablespoons of the desired fruit puree into a Champagne flute.  Slowly pour enough Prosecco into the flute to fill.  Gently stir to blend.  Garnish with the whole berries, as desired, and serve.

                  Broiled Salmon With Herb Mustard Glaze

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     garlic cloves
     3/4      teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
     3/4      teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1         tablespoon  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  whole-grain mustard
                        Nonstick olive oil cooking spray
  6                     salmon fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     lemon wedges

In a mini food processor, combine garlic, rosemary, thyme, wine, oil, Dijon mustard, and 1 tablespoon of whole-grain mustard.  Grind the mustard sauce until combined, about 30 seconds.  Transfer to a small bowl.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon of whole-grain mustard to the sauce and stir to combine.  Set aside mustard sauce.

Preheat the broiler.  Line a heavy rimmed baking sheet with foil.  Spray the foil with nonstick spray.  Arrange the salmon fillets on the baking sheet and sprinkle them with salt and pepper.  Broil for 2 minutes.  Spoon the mustard sauce over the fillets.  Continue broiling until the fillets are just cooked through and golden brown, about 5 minutes longer.

Transfer the fillets to plates and serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recommended Wine: 2001 Pecchenino 
Origin: Alba, Piedmont 
Grape: Dolcetto

Wine notes:  Using white wine for fish and red wine for meat no longer applies.  Break with tradition.  Italy produces many interesting reds, so for this dish I chose a classic Italian wine made from the dolcetto grape.  This lighter bodied red will marry well with my salmon dish which has a rich and silky texture.  The delicacy of the herbs in my mustard glaze goes nicely with the fruity nature of the wine.  My rule for pairing wine with dishes is to go with what tastes good.

Wine Pouring Notes:  Do not fill above the curve of the bowl, never more than 1/2 full, that way you can get a true sense of the wine's aroma and a better sense of its bouquet.  To get the full experience of the wine, place your nose into the glass and take in the wine's beautiful aroma.

                            Chicken Carbonara

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced pancetta -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  8              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
                        Salt -- as needed
  1              pound  spaghetti
  4               cups  coarsely-shredded chicken
                        = (from 1 roasted chicken)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts -- toasted
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated lemon peel

Heat the oil in a heavy large frying pan over medium heat.  Add the pancetta and garlic and saute until it is brown and crisp, about 8 minutes.  Cool slightly.

In a large bowl, whisk together the cream, cheese, yolks, basil, and parsley to blend.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.  Add the spaghetti and cook until it is just tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Drain.

Add the chicken to the pan with the pancetta and stir to combine.  Next, add the spaghetti and the cream mixture and toss over medium-low heat until the chicken is heated through and the sauce coats the spaghetti thickly, about 4 minutes (do not boil or you might end up scrambling the eggs).  Season the pasta, to taste, with pepper and salt if needed (the pancetta will likely add all the salt you need).  Transfer the pasta to a large wide serving bowl.  Sprinkle the walnuts and lemon zest over, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts
  2 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pound  white mushrooms -- sliced
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  5                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  whole milk -- room temperature
  1                cup  heavy whipping cream -- room temperature
  1                cup  chicken broth
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  12            ounces  linguine
     3/4           cup  frozen peas
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  1                cup  grated Parmesan
     1/4           cup  dried Italian-style breadcrumbs

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Spread 1 tablespoon of butter over a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish.  Melt 1 tablespoon each of butter and oil in a deep large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper.  Add the chicken to the hot pan and cook until pale golden and just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer the chicken to a plate to cool slightly.  Coarsely shred the chicken into bite-size pieces and into a large bowl.

Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon each of butter and oil to the same pan.  Add the mushrooms and saute over medium-high heat until the liquid from the mushrooms evaporates and the mushrooms become pale golden, about 12 minutes.  Add the onion, garlic, and thyme, and saute until the onion is translucent, about 8 minutes.  Add the wine and simmer until it evaporates, about 2 minutes.  Transfer the mushroom mixture to the bowl with the chicken.

Melt 3 more tablespoons butter in the same pan over medium-low heat.  Add the flour and whisk for 2 minutes.  Whisk in the milk, cream, broth, nutmeg, remaining 1 3/4 teaspoons salt, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon pepper.  Increase the heat to high.  Cover and bring to a boil.  Simmer, uncovered, until the sauce thickens slightly, whisking often, about 10 minutes.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the linguine and cook until it is tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 9 minutes.  Drain.  Add the linguine, sauce, peas, and parsley to the chicken mixture.  Toss until the sauce coats the pasta and the mixture is well blended.

Transfer the pasta mixture to the prepared baking dish.  Stir the cheese and breadcrumbs in a small bowl to blend.  Sprinkle the cheese mixture over the pasta.  Dot with the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter.  Bake, uncovered, until golden brown on top and the sauce bubbles, about 25 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                        = (or 1 cup frozen lima beans)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Heat the oil in large ovenproof pot over high heat.  Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper.  Working in 2 batches if necessary, cook the chicken in the pot until golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Transfer the chicken to a bowl.

Carefully add the potatoes to the same pot and cook until they are golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute.  Add the wine and stir to scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pot.  Add the broth, oregano, and thyme.

Return the chicken to the pot.  Stir to combine.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Cover and bake in the oven until the chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.  Transfer the chicken to a platter.  Arrange the potatoes around chicken.

Add the artichoke hearts to the sauce in the pot.  Cover and simmer over high heat until the artichokes are tender, stirring often, about 4 minutes.  Turn heat to low.  Stir in the butter.  Pour the sauce over chicken and potatoes, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

              Chicken With Mustard Mascarpone Marsala Sauce

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- each breast
                        cut crosswise into 3 pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  5        tablespoons  butter -- divided
     3/4           cup  chopped onion
  1              pound  cremini mushrooms -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1                cup  dry Marsala wine
  1                cup  mascarpone cheese - (8 oz)
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves -- plus
  1              whole  sprigs for garnish
  12            ounces  dried fettuccine

Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over high heat.  Add the chicken and cook just until brown, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer the chicken to a plate and cool slightly.

While the chicken cools, melt 2 tablespoons of butter to the same skillet over medium-high heat, then add the onion and saute until tender, about 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and garlic and saute until the mushrooms are tender and the juices evaporate, about 12 minutes.  Add the wine and simmer until it is reduced by half, about 4 minutes.  Stir in the mascarpone and mustard.

Cut the chicken breasts crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices.  Return the chicken and any accumulated juices to the skillet.  Simmer, uncovered, over medium-low heat until the chicken is just cooked through and the sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes.  Stir in the chopped parsley.  Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Drain.  Toss the fettuccine with 3 tablespoons of butter and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Swirl the fettuccine onto serving plates.  Spoon the chicken mixture over top.  Garnish with parsley sprigs and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  fine yellow cornmeal
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3              large  eggs
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  orange zest
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest
  1 3/4           cups  semisweet chocolate chips
  2        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Stir the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.  Using an electric mixer, beat the eggs and sugar in another large bowl until pale yellow and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Add the orange and lemon zests to the dry ingredients.  Add the flour mixture to the eggs and sugar and beat just until blended (the dough will be soft and sticky).  Let stand for 5 minutes.

Using a rubber spatula, transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet, forming two mounds spaced evenly apart.  Moisten your hands with water and shape the dough into two 11- by 4-inch logs.  Bake until lightly brown, about 35 minutes.  Cool the logs for 5 minutes.

Using a serrated knife, cut the logs crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick diagonal slices.  Arrange the biscotti cut-side down on the same baking sheet.  Bake until the biscotti are pale and golden, about 25 minutes.  Cool the biscotti on the baking sheet for 5 minutes.  Using a metal spatula, transfer the biscotti to a rack and cool completely.

Melt the chocolate chips in the microwave, stirring every 20 seconds, about 1 1/2 minutes total.  Dip 1 cut side of each biscotti into the melted chocolate.  Gently shake off the excess chocolate.  Place the biscotti, chocolate-side up, on the baking sheet.  Refrigerate until the chocolate is firm, about 35 minutes.  Dip a pastry brush in the cocoa, then lightly brush the cocoa over the chocolate on each biscotti.

The biscotti can be made ahead.  Store them in an airtight container up to 4 days, or wrap them in foil and freeze in resealable plastic bags up to 3 weeks.

This recipe yields 3 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  2               cups  fresh strawberries
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        === PUDDING ===
                        Butter -- for greasing cups
  6             ounces  bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened) -- chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh whole milk ricotta cheese -- drained for 2 hours
                        to remove any excess liquid
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
     1/3           cup  sugar
  3              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  orange zest
     1/2      teaspoon  pure almond extract
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  3              large  egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar

To make the Sauce:  Blend the strawberries and sugar in a food processor until smooth.  Strain the puree through a fine mesh strainer.  Cover and refrigerate.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

To make the Pudding:  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Lightly butter 6 (6-ounce) custard cups.  Arrange the cups in a large roasting pan.  Melt the chocolate in a medium bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water.  Set the melted chocolate aside.  Blend the ricotta, 1/4 cup of sugar, egg yolks, orange zest, almond extract, cinnamon, and salt in a food processor until very smooth.  Blend in the melted chocolate.  Transfer the ricotta mixture to a large bowl.

Using an electric mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites in another large bowl with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form.  Gradually beat in the remaining 1/3 cup of sugar.  Continue beating until semi-firm peaks form.  Fold the egg whites into the ricotta mixture.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared cups.  Fill the pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the custard cups.  Bake until the pudding puffs slightly but the centers are still creamy, about 25 minutes (the pudding will become thick and creamy when cold).  Allow puddings to cool slightly before removing from water bath.  Remove the custard cups from the bath.  Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours.

Run a knife around the sides of the puddings to loosen.  Invert the puddings onto plates.  Drizzle the strawberry sauce around the puddings and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Using an electric mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites in another large bowl with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form.  Gradually beat in the remaining 1/3 cup of sugar.  Continue beating until semi-firm peaks form.  Fold the egg whites into the ricotta mixture.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared cups.  Fill the pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the custard cups.  Bake until the pudding puffs slightly but the centers are still creamy, about 25 minutes (the pudding will become thick and creamy when cold).  Allow puddings to cool slightly before removing from water bath.  Remove the custard cups from the bath.  Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Run a knife around the sides of the puddings to loosen.  Invert the puddings onto plates.  Drizzle the strawberry sauce around the puddings and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Salt -- as needed
  1              pound  farfalle pasta
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1              pound  cremini mushrooms -- thickly sliced
  1              pound  thin asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        cut crosswise into 1" pieces
  1                cup  mascarpone cheese
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
     3/4           cup  walnuts -- toasted
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the farfalle and cook until al dente, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes.  Drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta water.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and saute until tender and most of the juices have evaporated, about 5 minutes.  Add the asparagus and saute until the asparagus is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the farfalle.  Stir in the mascarpone and nutmeg and toss until the cheese coats the pasta, adding the reserved cooking liquid 1/4 cup at a time to moisten.  Stir in 1/2 cup of walnuts.  Season the pasta, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Mound the pasta in a large bowl.  Sprinkle with the Parmesan and remaining 1/4 cup of walnuts.  Serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     onions -- chopped
  2                     carrots -- peeled, chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  6               cups  chicken broth
  2               jars  roasted red bell peppers preserved in
                        water - (12 oz ea) -- drained
  1                     russet potato -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

     1/2           cup  mascarpone cheese

Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add the bread cubes and saute until they are crisp and golden, about 8 minutes.

Ladle the soup into bowls.  Dollop a tablespoon of mascarpone in the center of each bowl and top with croutons.  Sprinkle with pepper and serve.

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add the pancetta and saute until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a small bowl.

Pour off all but 1/4 cup of the pan drippings (if necessary, add more oil to the pan drippings to equal 1/4 cup total).  Reduce the heat to medium.  Add 3 teaspoons of garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the flour and whisk for 2 minutes.  Gradually whisk in the milk.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly, whisking often, about 5 minutes.  Gradually whisk in all the Fontina, mozzarella, Parmesan, and provolone cheeses.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the rigatoni and cook until almost al dente, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes.  (The pasta will continue cooking in the oven.)  Drain pasta and add directly into the cheese.  Add the parsley, basil, and pancetta and toss to coat.  Season the pasta mixture, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Transfer the pasta mixture to the prepared dish.

Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add the remaining garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat.  Add the bread crumbs and toss to coat.  Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture over the pasta mixture.  Drizzle the top with extra-virgin olive oil and bake until the sauce bubbles and the bread crumbs are golden brown, about 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  broccoli rabe -- trimmed, and
                        the stalks cut crosswise into 3" pieces
  1                     container fresh fettuccine pasta - (9 oz)
  1                can  reduced-sodium chicken broth - (14 oz)
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  3               cups  shredded roasted chicken
                        = (from 1 roasted chicken)
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
     1/2           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the broccoli rabe and cook until crisp-tender, 2 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the broccoli rabe to a large bowl of ice water.  Once cooled, drain broccoli rabe and set aside.  Add the fettuccine to the same pot of boiling water and cook until just tender, about 2 minutes.  Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of cooking liquid.

Meanwhile, bring the broth and lemon juice to a boil in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Boil until the broth reduces by half, about 5 minutes.  Add the chicken and simmer just until heated through, about 2 minutes.  Add broccoli rabe to the chicken broth and stir to combine.  Add the pasta, 1/2 cup of Parmesan, pine nuts, parsley, oil, and lemon zest.  Toss to coat, adding some of the reserved cooking liquid, 1/4 cup at a time, to moisten.  Season the pasta with salt and pepper, to taste.  Mound the pasta into bowls and serve.  Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Olive oil -- for frying
  1 3/4           cups  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1 1/2           cups  panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt

  3             medium  zucchini -- cut into 3"-long
                        by 1/2"-wide strips

Pour enough oil into a large frying pan to reach a depth of 2 inches.  Heat the oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees.

Stir 1 1/2 cups Parmesan, the panko, and salt in a medium bowl to blend.  Whisk the eggs in another medium bowl to blend.  Working in batches, dip the zucchini in the eggs to coat completely and allow the excess egg to drip back into the bowl.  Coat the zucchini in the panko mixture, patting to adhere and coat completely.  Place the zucchini strips on a baking sheet.

When the oil is hot, working in batches, fry the zucchini sticks until they are golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried zucchini to paper towels and drain.

Arrange the fried zucchini on a platter.  Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan and serve.

         Fusilli With Sausage, Artichokes, And Sun-Dried Tomatoes

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes -- sliced, with
  2        tablespoons  oil reserved
  1              pound  Italian hot sausages -- casings removed
  2           packages  frozen artichoke hearts - (8 oz ea)
  2              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1 3/4           cups  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  16            ounces  fusilli pasta
     1/2           cup  shredded Parmesan -- plus
                        additional for garnish
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  8             ounces  water-packed fresh mozzarella -- drained, and
                        cubed, optional
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the oil reserved from the tomatoes in a heavy large frying pan over medium-high heat.  Add the sausages and cook until brown, breaking up the meat into bite-size pieces with a fork, about 8 minutes.  Transfer the sausage to a bowl.  Add the artichokes and garlic to the same skillet, and saute over medium heat until the garlic is tender, about 2 minutes.  Add the broth, wine, and sun-dried tomatoes.  Boil over medium-high heat until the sauce reduces slightly, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Cook the fusilli in boiling water until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring often, about 8 minutes.  Drain the pasta (do not rinse).  Add the pasta, sausage, 1/2 cup Parmesan, basil, and parsley to the artichoke mixture.  Toss until the sauce is almost absorbed by the pasta.  Stir in the mozzarella.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Serve, passing the additional Parmesan cheese alongside.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  fresh baby spinach leaves
  4                     sea bass fillets - (5 oz ea)
  4          teaspoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  dry Marsala wine
  8          teaspoons  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  1                     lime -- quartered
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced fresh basil leaves

Cut 4 (12-inch-square pieces) of aluminum foil.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Working with 1 foil sheet at a time, place the foil sheets on the work surface.  Place 1 1/2 cups of spinach in the center of each foil sheet.  Top with a sea bass fillet.  Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of ginger and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic, then drizzle 2 tablespoons of Marsala, 2 teaspoons of soy sauce, and 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil over the fish and spinach.  Gather the foil sheets over the fish.  Fold in the foil edges and pinch tightly to seal.  Place the foil packages on a heavy large baking sheet.

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
  1                     russet potato - (abt 1 lb)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  shaved Pecorino Romano

Cook the butter in a heavy medium skillet over medium heat until it begins to brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Add the thyme leaves.  Set aside.

Pierce the potato all over with a fork.  Microwave the potato until tender, turning once, about 12 minutes.  Cut the potato in half and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; discard the skin.  Using a fork, mash the potato well.  Mash in the salt and pepper.  Mix in 3 tablespoons of the egg; discard the remaining egg.  Sift the flour over the potato mixture and knead just until blended.

Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces.  Roll each piece between your palms and the work surface into a 1/2-inch-diameter rope (about 20 inches long).  Cut the dough into 1-inch pieces.  Roll each piece of dough over a wooden paddle with ridges or over the tines of a fork to form grooves in the dough.

Cook the gnocchi in a large pot of boiling salted water until the gnocchi rise to the surface, about 1 minute.  Continue cooking until the gnocchi are tender, about 4 minutes longer.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the gnocchi to the hot thyme-butter in the skillet.  Toss to coat.

Spoon the gnocchi and butter sauce into shallow bowls.  Top with the Pecorino and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

     1/2           cup  pitted Sicilian green olives -- finely chopped
                        = (or kalamata olives)
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced chives

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Arrange the bread slices on 2 heavy large baking sheets.  Brush olive oil over the bread slices.  Bake until the crostini are pale golden and crisp, about 15 minutes.

Blend the goat cheese and cream cheese in a food processor until smooth and creamy.  Add the parsley, thyme, and lemon peel.  Using the on/off button, pulse just to blend.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Spread the cheese mixture over the crostini.  Sprinkle with the olives, chives, and more pepper.  Arrange the toasts on a platter and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Do-Ahead Tip:  The crostini and cheese mixture can each be prepared 2 days ahead.  Store the crostini in an airtight container at room temperature.  Cover and refrigerate the cheese mixture.  Let the cheese mixture stand at room temperature for 1 hour to soften slightly before spreading over the crostini.

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     loaf ciabatta bread
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  garlic cloves
  1                     tomato -- halved crosswise
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat.  Slice ciabatta in half lengthwise.  Then cut each half into 1-inch slices.  In batches as needed, grill the ciabatta slices, cut-side down until they are golden and crisp, about 2 minutes.

Working quickly, drizzle the toasted sides with extra-virgin olive oil.  Rub the garlic cloves over the grilled bread, then rub the cut side of the tomatoes over the grilled bread.  It's important to do this while the bread is still hot or warm, otherwise the garlic won't melt into the bread.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
     1/3           cup  dark corn syrup
  2 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped toasted hazelnuts
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda

Line a heavy large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Stir the sugar, water, light corn syrup, and dark corn syrup in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves.  Increase the heat to high and boil without stirring until a candy thermometer registers 260 degrees, about 20 minutes.  Reduce the heat to medium-low.  Mix in the hazelnuts, butter, and salt (the mixture will be thick and nutty), and cook until the thermometer registers 295 degrees, stirring constantly, about 15 minutes.  Quickly stir in the baking soda.  Immediately pour the caramel onto the prepared baking sheet, spreading it as thinly as possible.  Let stand until hard.

Break the brittle into pieces and store in an airtight container at room temperature.  If desired, serve over your favorite ice cream.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 pounds.

     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  11            ounces  soft fresh goat cheese log
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil or
                        Meyer lemon olive oil
                        Fresh herb sprigs -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Arrange the bread slices on 2 heavy baking sheets.  Drizzle 3 tablespoons of olive oil over the bread slices.  Bake until the crostini are pale golden and crisp, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, stir the herbs, lemon zest, pepper, and salt in a medium bowl to blend.  Using about 2 teaspoons of cheese for each, form the goat cheese into 1-inch diameter balls.  Roll the cheese balls in the herb mixture to coat completely.  Arrange the cheese balls on a platter.  Drizzle the extra-virgin olive oil over and around the cheese balls.  Serve with the crostini.  Garnish with herb sprigs.

The crostini and cheese balls can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Store the crostini in an airtight container at room temperature.  Cover and refrigerate the cheese balls.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  purchased biscotti
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
  1                     container fresh whole milk ricotta - (12 o -- drained
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  orange blossom or clover honey
  1         tablespoon  orange zest
  4              large  eggs

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides with 2 layers of heavy-duty foil.  Finely grind the biscotti in a food processor.  Add the melted butter and process until the crumbs are moistened.  Press the crumb mixture over the bottom (not the sides) of the prepared pan.  Bake until the crust is golden, about 15 minutes.  Cool the crust completely on a cooling rack.

Blend the ricotta in a clean food processor until smooth.  Add the cream cheese and sugar and blend well, stopping the machine occasionally and scraping down the sides of the work bowl.  Blend in the honey and orange zest.  Add the eggs and pulse just until blended.

Pour the cheese mixture over the crust in the pan.  Place the springform pan in a large roasting pan.  Pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan.  Bake until the cheesecake is golden and the center of the cake moves slightly when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour and 5 minutes (the cake will become firm when it is cold).

Transfer the cake to a rack and cool 1 hour.  Refrigerate until the cheesecake is cold, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.  Cut the cake into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Olive oil -- for frying
  1              pound  prepared pizza dough
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon

Pour equal parts of vegetable oil and olive oil into a large frying pan to reach a depth of 2 inches.  Heat the oil over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375 degrees.

Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/2-inch thickness.  Using a floured 2-inch cookie cutter, cut out doughnut rounds.  Using a floured 1-inch cookie cutter, cut out a hole in the center of each doughnut.  Gather the dough scraps and re-roll to cut out more doughnuts.

Whisk the sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl to blend.  Set the cinnamon-sugar aside.

When the oil is hot, working in batches, fry the doughnuts until they puff but are still pale, about 45 seconds per side.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the doughnuts to paper towels to drain.  Cool slightly.  While the doughnuts are still warm, add to the bowl with cinnamon-sugar and generously coat each 2 times with the cinnamon-sugar.  Serve warm.

Alternately, cool the fried doughnuts to room temperature.  Stir 3 ounces milk chocolate and 1/4 cup whipping cream in a heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat until the chocolate melts.  Set aside until the chocolate sauce comes to room temperature but does not set.  Dip 1 side of each doughnut into the chocolate mixture.  Sprinkle with finely chopped toasted almonds or crushed espresso beans and set aside until the chocolate is set.

This recipe yields about 18 doughnuts.

Alternately, cool the fried doughnuts to room temperature.  Stir 3 ounces milk chocolate and 1/4 cup whipping cream in a heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat until the chocolate melts.  Set aside until the chocolate sauce comes to room temperature but does not set.  Dip 1 side of each doughnut into the chocolate mixture.  Sprinkle with finely chopped toasted almonds or crushed espresso beans and set aside until the chocolate is set.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  orzo pasta
  10             large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2             ounces  smoked mozzarella -- cut 1/2" cubes
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced fresh basil leaves
  1         tablespoon  butter

     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  8                     thin asparagus stalks -- trimmed, and

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
                        more as needed
  2              large  onions -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  9                     flour tortillas - (8" dia)
  3               cups  shredded Fontina
     3/4           cup  jarred roasted red bell peppers -- drained well,
                        and patted dry
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped fresh Italian parsley -- plus sprigs
                        for garnish
     1/3           cup  freshly-shredded Parmesan -- plus
  3        tablespoons  freshly-shredded Parmesan -- for garnish

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a heavy large skillet over medium-low heat.  Add the onions and sugar, and cook until the onions are golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Season the onions, to taste, with salt and pepper; set aside.

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.

Sprinkle some Fontina over half of a tortilla.  Arrange some bell peppers and sauteed onions on top of the Fontina.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley and Parmesan.  Sprinkle more Fontina over.  Fold the clean half over the filling to cover and press gently to seal.  Repeat with remaining tortillas evenly dividing the filling ingredients.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil on a heavy large griddle over medium heat.  Working in batches, cook the quesadillas until the cheese melts and the tortillas are golden brown, adding more oil as needed, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer the quesadillas to baking sheets and keep them warm in the oven while cooking the remaining quesadillas.

Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan over the quesadillas.  Cut each quesadilla into 4 wedges.  Arrange them on a platter.  Garnish the platter with parsley sprigs and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Do-Ahead Tip:  The quesadillas can be assembled up to 8 hours ahead.  Arrange them on a baking sheet, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     baguette -- cut 24 (1/2"-thk)
                        slices
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2                     bars gianduja chocolate or semisweet
                        chocolate with hazelnuts - (3 oz ea) -- broken along the
                        indentations into 24 pieces
  24             large  marshmallows

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Line a large baking sheet with a silicone baking mat, parchment paper, or foil.  Arrange the bread slices on the baking sheet.  Generously brush the butter over the bread slices.  Sprinkle the slices with sugar.  Bake until the crostini are crisp and golden, about 15 minutes.

Arrange the chocolate pieces in a single layer atop the crostini.  Skewer 1 marshmallow onto each of 6 skewers.  Roast the marshmallows directly over a campfire until toasted to desired doneness.  Push 1 roasted marshmallow atop the chocolate on each crostini and serve.  Repeat to make 24 s'mores total.

Alternative:  Chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella) may be used instead of the chocolate bars.  To do so, omit coating the bread slices with sugar before baking them, and spread about 2 teaspoons of the chocolate-hazelnut spread over each crostini before topping it with the roasted marshmallows.

This recipe yields 24 s'mores.

  3             ounces  thinly-sliced prosciutto -- chopped
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
     3/4      teaspoon  salt -- plus
                        more for salting water
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (to 2)
  12                    uncooked lasagna noodles
  2               cups  marinara sauce
  1                cup  shredded mozzarella - (abt 4 oz)

To make the Sauce:  Melt the butter in a heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add the flour and whisk for 3 minutes.  Whisk in the milk.  Increase the heat to medium-high.  Whisk the sauce until it comes to a simmer and is thick and smooth, about 3 minutes.  Whisk the salt, pepper, and nutmeg into the bechamel sauce.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Whisk the ricotta, spinach, 1 cup Parmesan, prosciutto, egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl to blend.

Add a tablespoon or 2 of oil to a large pot of boiling salted water.  Boil the noodles until just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain.  Arrange the noodles in a single layer on a baking sheet to prevent them from sticking.

Butter a 13- by 9- by-2-inch glass baking dish.  Pour the bechamel sauce over the bottom of the prepared dish.  Lay out 4 lasagna noodles on a work surface, then spread about 3 tablespoons of ricotta mixture evenly over each noodle.  Starting at 1 end, roll each noodle like a jelly roll.  Lay the lasagna rolls seam-side down, without touching, atop the bechamel sauce in the dish.  Repeat with the remaining noodles and ricotta mixture.  Spoon 1 cup of marinara sauce over the lasagna rolls.  Sprinkle the mozzarella and remaining 2 tablespoons of Parmesan over the lasagna rolls.

Cover tightly with foil.  Bake until heated through and the sauce bubbles, about 20 minutes.  Uncover and bake until the cheese on top becomes golden, about 15 minutes longer.  Let stand for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, heat the remaining marinara sauce in a heavy small saucepan over medium heat until hot, and serve alongside.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                     Lime-Oncello Spritzers With Mint

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LIMONCELLO ===
  2             pounds  limes - (abt 10 large)
  1             bottle  100-proof vodka - (750 ml)
  2 1/2           cups  sugar
  2 1/2           cups  water
                        === SPRITZERS ===
                        Ice cubes -- as needed
  1                cup  fresh mint leaves
  1                cup  club soda

To make Limoncello:  Using a vegetable peeler, remove the peel from the limes in long strips (reserve the limes for another use).  Place the lime peels in a 1-quart jar.  Pour the vodka over the peels and screw on the lid.  Steep the lime peels in the vodka for 1 week at room temperature.

Stir the sugar and water in a large saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes.  Cool completely, then stir in the vodka mixture.  Strain the liquids into bottles, pressing on the peels to extract as much liquid as possible.  Seal the bottles and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours and up to 1 month.

To make Spritzers:  Fill 4 tall glasses halfway with ice.  Add the mint leaves.  Using the handle of a wooden spoon, coarsely crush the mint leaves into the ice.  Pour some limoncello over, and stir to blend.  Add a splash of club soda and serve.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 quarts of limoncello, 4 spritzers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick cooking spray
  8             ounces  purchased biscotti
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
  3        tablespoons  grated lemon zest
  1                     container fresh whole milk ricotta - (12 o -- drained, and
                        at room temperature
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  Limoncello Liqueur -- (see recipe)
                        = (or store bought)
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  4              large  eggs -- room temperature

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Spray the bottom of a 9- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.  Finely grind the biscotti in a food processor.  Add the melted butter and 1 tablespoon of lemon zest, and process until the crumbs are moistened.  Press the crumb mixture over the bottom (not the sides) of the prepared pan.  Bake until the crust is golden, about 15 minutes.  Cool the crust completely on a cooling rack.

Blend the ricotta in a clean food processor until smooth.  Add the cream cheese and sugar and blend well, stopping the machine occasionally and scraping down the sides of the work bowl.  Blend in the limoncello, vanilla, and remaining 2 tablespoons of lemon zest.  Add the eggs one at a time, and pulse just until blended.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.

Pour the cheese mixture over the crust in the pan.  Place the baking pan in a large roasting pan.  Pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the baking pan.  Bake until the cheesecake is golden and the center of the cake moves slightly when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour (the cake will become firm when it is cold).

Transfer the cake to a rack; cool 1 hour.  Refrigerate until the cheesecake is cold, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.  Cut the cake into squares and serve.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

Comments:  Limoncello liqueur can be found at most liquor stores and in the liquor department of some specialty markets.  If limoncello liqueur is unavailable at stores near you, use the recipe in this collection to make your own limoncello liqueur.

     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan

Heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the juices evaporate and the chicken is golden, about 10 minutes.  Add the shallots and garlic and saute until tender, about 2 minutes.  Add the wine and stir to scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the skillet.  Add the rosemary and mix well.  Add the Marinara Sauce and bring to a simmer.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer gently until the flavors blend, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the linguine and cook until al dente, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Drain, reserving 1 cup of cooking liquid.  Add the linguine to the ragu and toss to coat, adding some reserved cooking liquid to moisten.  Transfer the pasta to a large serving bowl.  Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  fresh basil leaves - (lightly packed)
     1/3           cup  white wine vinegar
                        = (or fresh lemon juice)
  1           teaspoon  salt -- plus
                        more for seasoning
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- plus
                        more for seasoning
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  8               cups  arugula
  4               cups  bite-size radicchio pieces
                        = (from a 10-oz head)
  1                     carrot -- peeled
  1                     hothouse cucumber -- peeled

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick cooking spray
  8             ounces  purchased amaretti cookies - -- (abt 23 cookies)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
     3/4           cup  sugar
  8              large  egg yolks
     1/3           cup  brewed espresso
  2        tablespoons  dry Marsala wine
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  whipping cream

Spray a 9 1/4- by 5 1/4- by 3-inch metal loaf pan lightly with nonstick spray.  Line the pan with plastic wrap.  Finely grind the cookies in a food processor.  Add the melted butter and process until the crumbs are moistened.  Press the crumb mixture onto the bottom of the prepared loaf pan.  Refrigerate.

Whisk 1/2 cup of sugar, egg yolks, espresso, Marsala, and salt in a large metal bowl to blend.  Set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (do not allow the bottom of the bowl to touch the water).  Whisk the egg mixture until it is thick and creamy and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the mixture registers 160 degrees, about 5 minutes.  Set the custard over another bowl of ice to cool completely.

Using an electric mixer, beat the cream and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in another large bowl until firm peaks form.  Using a large rubber spatula, fold the whipped cream into the custard.  Spoon the mixture atop the prepared crust.  Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until frozen, at least 8 hours or up to 3 days.

Unfold the plastic wrap.  Invert the semifreddo onto a platter.  Remove the plastic wrap.  Cut the semifreddo into 1-inch slices and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Whisk 1/2 cup of sugar, egg yolks, espresso, Marsala, and salt in a large metal bowl to blend.  Set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (do not allow the bottom of the bowl to touch the water).  Whisk the egg mixture until it is thick and creamy and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the mixture registers 160 degrees, about 5 minutes.  Set the custard over another bowl of ice to cool completely.

Using an electric mixer, beat the cream and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in another large bowl until firm peaks form.  Using a large rubber spatula, fold the whipped cream into the custard.  Spoon the mixture atop the prepared crust.  Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until frozen, at least 8 hours or up to 3 days.

<DirT>
Unfold the plastic wrap.  Invert the semifreddo onto a platter.  Remove the plastic wrap.  Cut the semifreddo into 1-inch slices and serve.

  1                can  garbanzo beans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
  1 1/2           cups  red and yellow teardrop tomatoes or

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  garlic cloves
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     tied 3 1/2- to 4-lb boneless pork loin
                        roast
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced pancetta
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine

Blend the garlic, rosemary, thyme, and oil in a small food processor, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally, until the garlic is minced.

Sprinkle the pork roast generously with salt and pepper.  Arrange the pancetta slices on a work surface, overlapping slightly and forming a rectangle.  Spread half of the garlic mixture over 1 side of the pork and between the 2 loins that meet in the center of the tied pork roast.  Place the pork, garlic mixture-side down, in the center of the pancetta rectangle.  Spread the remaining garlic mixture over the remaining pork.  Wrap the pancetta slices around the pork.  Place the pork in a roasting pan.  Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Pour 1/2 cup of broth and 1/2 cup of wine into the roasting pan.  Add more broth and wine to the pan juices every 20 minutes.  Roast the pork until a meat thermometer inserted into the center registers 145 degrees for medium-rare, about 1 hour.  Transfer the pork to a cutting board.  Tent with aluminum foil and let stand for 10 minutes.  Pour the pan drippings into a glass measuring cup and spoon off any fat that rises to the top.

Using a large sharp carving knife, cut the pork into 1/4-inch-thick slices and serve with the pan juices.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Blend the garlic, rosemary, thyme, and oil in a small food processor, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally, until the garlic is minced.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sprinkle the pork roast generously with salt and pepper.  Arrange the pancetta slices on a work surface, overlapping slightly and forming a rectangle.  Spread half of the garlic mixture over 1 side of the pork and between the 2 loins that meet in the center of the tied pork roast.  Place the pork, garlic mixture-side down, in the center of the pancetta rectangle.  Spread the remaining garlic mixture over the remaining pork.  Wrap the pancetta slices around the pork.  Place the pork in a roasting pan.  Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour 1/2 cup of broth and 1/2 cup of wine into the roasting pan.  Add more broth and wine to the pan juices every 20 minutes.  Roast the pork until a meat thermometer inserted into the center registers 145 degrees for medium-rare, about 1 hour.  Transfer the pork to a cutting board.  Tent with aluminum foil and let stand for 10 minutes.  Pour the pan drippings into a glass measuring cup and spoon off any fat that rises to the top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a large sharp carving knife, cut the pork into 1/4-inch-thick slices and serve with the pan juices.

                    Pork Loin With Fig And Port Sauce

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  2 1/2           cups  port
  1 1/4           cups  reduced-sodium chicken broth
  8                     dried black Mission figs -- coarsely chopped
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  1         tablespoon  honey
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === PORK ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
                        additional for seasoning
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper -- plus
                        additional for seasoning
  1                cup  canned low-salt chicken broth
  1                     boneless pork loin - (4 to 4 1/2 lbs)

For the Sauce:  In a heavy medium saucepan, combine the first 6 ingredients.  Boil over medium-high heat until reduced by half, about 30 minutes.  Discard the herb sprigs and cinnamon sticks (some of the rosemary leaves will remain in the port mixture).  Transfer the port mixture to a blender and puree until smooth.  Blend in the butter.  Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper.  (The sauce can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm over medium heat before using.)

For the Pork:  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Stir the oil, rosemary, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper in a small bowl to blend.  Place the pork loin in a heavy roasting pan.  Spread the oil mixture over the pork to coat completely.  Roast until an instant read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the pork registers 145 degrees, turning the pork every 15 minutes to ensure even browning, about 45 minutes total.

Transfer the pork to a cutting board and tent with foil to keep warm.  Let the pork rest 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, stir the chicken broth into the roasting pan.  Place the pan over medium heat, and scrape the bottom of the pan to remove any browned bits.  Bring the pan juices to a simmer.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Using a large sharp knife, cut the pork crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Arrange the pork slices on plates.  Spoon the jus over.  Drizzle the warm fig sauce around and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20                    paper-thin prosciutto or speck slices
  1                     fennel bulb -- cored, and
                        thinly sliced lengthwise
     1/2                orange bell pepper -- cut lengthwise
                        into thin strips
     1/2                red bell pepper -- cut lengthwise
                        into thin strips
     1/2                yellow bell pepper -- cut lengthwise
                        into thin strips
  10            stalks  broccolini -- blanched
     1/4          head  cauliflower -- separated into
                        small florets with stems intact, blanched
  2        tablespoons  Meyer lemon olive oil
  1              piece  Parmesan - (2 oz)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Salt -- for blanching water

Working with 1 slice of prosciutto at a time, cut the prosciutto lengthwise in half.  Wrap a small bundle of the fennel slices (about 3 slices) with prosciutto, allowing the fennel to extend over each side of the prosciutto.  Bundle 1 strip each of the orange, red, and yellow bell peppers, then wrap each bundle with prosciutto, allowing the bell peppers to extend over each side of the prosciutto.  Wrap the prosciutto around the stalks of broccolini.  Wrap the prosciutto around the stem end of the cauliflower florets.  Arrange the vegetables on a platter.

Drizzle with the oil.  Using a grater or vegetable peeler, shave the Parmesan over the vegetables.  Sprinkle with pepper, and serve.

This recipe yields 40 bundles; about 8 servings.

Recommended Wine: 2002 Terruzi & Puthod Terre di Tufi 
Origin: San Gimignano, Tuscany 
Grape: Vernaccia

Wine notes:  For this dish I picked a white wine from a little town in Tuscany.  This wine is made from vernaccia grapes and is very luxurious in texture.  There is a wonderful perfume to this wine, similar to wild flowers and freshly cut grass.  The crudite gives it an extra mineral edge which makes this wine a perfect match with my dish.  I like to serve this chilled but not too cold because the colder the wine, the more difficult it is to taste it.

Wine Pouring Notes:  Do not fill above the curve of the bowl, never more than 1/2 full, that way you can get a true sense of the wine's aroma and a better sense of its bouquet.  To get the full experience of the wine, place your nose into the glass and take in the wine's beautiful aroma.

                    Rack Of Lamb With Mint-Basil Pesto

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  fresh mint leaves - (lightly packed)
     3/4           cup  fresh basil leaves - (lightly packed)
     1/2           cup  walnuts -- toasted
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2                     garlic cloves
     3/4      teaspoon  salt -- plus
                        more for seasoning
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- plus
                        more for seasoning
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     racks lamb - (1 1/2 lbs ea) -- trimmed, frenched

Blend the mint, basil, nuts, cheese, lemon juice, garlic, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper in a food processor until the herbs are finely chopped.  With the machine running, gradually blend in 1/3 cup of oil until the mixture is smooth and creamy.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Generously sprinkle the lamb racks with salt and pepper.  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a grill pan or heavy large skillet over high heat.  Place 1 lamb rack in the skillet and cook just until brown, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer the lamb rack meat side up on a heavy large baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining 2 lamb racks.

Roast the lamb in the oven until cooked to desired doneness, about 20 minutes for medium-rare.  Transfer the lamb racks to a work surface.  Set aside for 10 minutes.  Cut the lamb between the bones into single chops.  Spread the pesto over 1 cut side of each chop.  Arrange the chops, pesto-side up, on plates or a platter, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Do-Ahead Tip:  The pesto and lamb racks may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead.  Cover the pesto and lamb separately and refrigerate.  Allow extra time for the chilled lamb to roast.

Alternately, the racks of lamb can be sliced then broiled before serving.  To broil the lamb: Use 18 to 24 meaty single lamb rib chops (about 2 1/2 ounces each, from 3 racks of lamb).  Preheat the broiler.  Arrange the lamb chops in a single layer over 2 heavy baking sheets.  Lightly brush the lamb chops with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Watching closely, broil the lamb chops 3 inches from the heat source until cooked to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Spread the pesto over the chops.  Arrange the chops pesto-side up on plates or a platter, and serve.

                          Raspberry Almond Tart

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed
                        = (from a 17 1/4-oz package)
  1                     egg -- beaten to blend
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  amaretto liqueur
     1/4           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted, and
                        coarsely crumbled
  2                     baskets fresh raspberries - (6 oz ea)
                        Unsweetened cocoa powder -- for dusting

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut a 3/4-inch wide strip off each side of the pastry and reserve.  Roll out the pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface to a 10-inch square.  Brush the edges of the square with the egg.  Working with 1 strip at a time, stand the strips along the edges of the pastry square and crimp where they meet.  You want to create a shallow box, where the pastry square is the base and the 4 strips are the walls.  Overlap the strips at the corners, stretching them if necessary to complete the walls of the box.  Brush the border with the egg.  Pierce the center of the pastry all over with fork.  Bake until the pastry is golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to a rack and cool completely.

Using an electric mixer, beat the cream until soft peaks.  With the mixer still running, gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks.  Add the liqueur and beat until just well blended; be careful not to overmix or the whipped cream will turn into a buttery consistency and start to separate.  Using a large spatula, fold in the nuts.  Spoon the cream mixture into the prepared pastry crust.  Arrange the berries over the cream.  Sift the cocoa powder over and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  You can use any fruit that's in season (orange segments, berries, plums, bananas, grapes).  Blueberries make a good substitute for the raspberries, and sliced peaches or nectarines are delicious as well.

Cut a 3/4-inch wide strip off each side of the pastry and reserve.  Roll out the pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface to a 10-inch square.  Brush the edges of the square with the egg.  Working with 1 strip at a time, stand the strips along the edges of the pastry square and crimp where they meet.  You want to create a shallow box, where the pastry square is the base and the 4 strips are the walls.  Overlap the strips at the corners, stretching them if necessary to complete the walls of the box.  Brush the border with the egg.  Pierce the center of the pastry all over with fork.  Bake until the pastry is golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to a rack and cool completely.

Using an electric mixer, beat the cream until soft peaks.  With the mixer still running, gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks.  Add the liqueur and beat until just well blended; be careful not to overmix or the whipped cream will turn into a buttery consistency and start to separate.  Using a large spatula, fold in the nuts.  Spoon the cream mixture into the prepared pastry crust.  Arrange the berries over the cream.  Sift the cocoa powder over and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  You can use any fruit that&apos;s in season (orange segments, berries, plums, bananas, grapes).  Blueberries make a good substitute for the raspberries, and sliced peaches or nectarines are delicious as well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  spinach ravioli or tortelloni
  1                cup  purchased marinara sauce
     1/2           cup  whole-milk ricotta cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced fresh basil leaves

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add about 1/4 cup olive oil to the water to help prevent pasta from sticking.  Add the ravioli and cook until al dente, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Drain the ravioli, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water.  Toss the ravioli with the remaining oil to coat.

Meanwhile, bring the marinara sauce to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat, whisking often.  Whisk in the ricotta and enough reserved cooking water to thin the sauce to desired consistency.  For a thicker sauce, use less pasta water; for a thinner sauce, add more water.  Return the sauce to a simmer.  Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Spoon 3 tablespoons of sauce over the bottom of each of 6 bowls.  Arrange the ravioli over the sauce.  Drizzle the remaining sauce over the ravioli.  Sprinkle with the Parmesan and the basil, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  canned low-salt chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  arborio rice
                        = (or medium-grain white rice)
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
     1/3           cup  frozen peas -- defrosted, optional
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan -- plus
                        additional for garnish
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring the broth to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Cover the broth and keep it warm over very low heat.

Melt the butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 8 minutes.  Stir in the garlic and saute for 30 seconds.  Stir in the rice and cook for about 2 minutes until the rice is toasted.  Add the wine and stir until it is absorbed, about 1 minute.  Add 3/4 cup of hot broth; simmer over medium-low heat until the liquid is absorbed, stirring often, about 6 minutes.  Repeat, adding 3/4 cup of hot broth 2 more times, stirring often, about 12 minutes longer.  At this point, the risotto can be made 4 hours ahead.  Refrigerate the risotto (the rice will still be firm) and remaining broth, uncovered, until cool, then cover and keep them refrigerated until ready to proceed.

Bring the remaining broth to a simmer, then cover and keep it warm over very low heat.  Stir 3/4 cup of hot broth into the partially cooked risotto over medium heat until the broth is absorbed and the risotto is hot, about 3 minutes.  Add the remaining broth and simmer until the rice is just tender and the mixture is creamy, about 5 minutes longer.  Stir in the peas and parsley.  Add the 1/2 cup of Parmesan.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Spoon the risotto into bowls.  Sprinkle additional cheese over and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Refrigerate the risotto (the rice will still be firm) and remaining broth, uncovered, until cool, then cover and keep them refrigerated until ready to proceed.

<DirT>
Bring the remaining broth to a simmer, then cover and keep it warm over very low heat.  Stir 3/4 cup of hot broth into the partially cooked risotto over medium heat until the broth is absorbed and the risotto is hot, about 3 minutes.  Add the remaining broth and simmer until the rice is just tender and the mixture is creamy, about 5 minutes longer.  Stir in the peas and parsley.  Add the 1/2 cup of Parmesan.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Spoon the risotto into bowls.  Sprinkle additional cheese over and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     beef rib-eye steaks - (12 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     onions -- thinly sliced
  2                     carrots -- peeled, sliced thin
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     3/4           cup  dry red wine
  1                jar  marinara sauce - (26 oz)
  1                cup  beef broth
  16            ounces  dried rigatoni pasta
  3             ounces  Parmesan -- shaved

Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a heavy large frying pan over high heat.  Sprinkle the steaks with salt and pepper.  Cook the steaks until they are brown but still rare in the center, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer the steaks to a plate and set aside to cool completely.

Add 2 more tablespoons of olive oil to the same pan.  Saute the onions and carrots until the onions are translucent, about 8 minutes, with additional salt and pepper, to taste.  Add the garlic and oregano, and saute for 1 minute.  Add the wine and simmer for 1 minute.  Add the marinara sauce and broth.  Cover and simmer over medium-low heat to allow the flavors to blend, about 10 minutes.  Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, trim off any fat from the steaks, then cut the steaks into bite-size pieces and set aside.  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.  Add the rigatoni and boil until it is tender but still firm to the bite, stirring often, about 10 minutes.  Drain the rigatoni.

Toss the rigatoni and reserved steak pieces and any accumulated juices from the steaks with the sauce to coat.  Transfer the pasta to bowls.  Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese shavings and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24            slices  Italian dry Genoa salami, 1/8" to 1/4"
                        thick - (abt 4 oz)
     1/3           cup  sour cream
  3        tablespoons  thinly-sliced fresh basil leaves

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with aluminum foil.  Arrange the salami in a single layer over the baking sheets.  Bake until the salami slices are amber brown, watching closely to ensure they brown evenly, about 15 minutes.  Transfer the salami crisps to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to absorb the excess oil.  Set aside to cool.

Spoon a dollop of sour cream on top of each salami crisp.  Sprinkle the basil over and serve.

This recipe yields 24 pieces.

Do-Ahead Tip: The salami crisps can be made 8 hours ahead. Store in airtight containers and keep at room temperature.

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              piece  beef tenderloin - (10 oz)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  fresh arugula or fresh baby spinach - -- (lightly packed)
     1/2         ounce  shaved Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice

Tie the beef tenderloin with kitchen twine to help maintain its shape, then freeze the tenderloin until frozen (this ensures that the center stays rare when cooking a small piece of meat).  Then, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy small skillet over high heat.  Rub the frozen beef with salt and pepper.  Add the beef to the hot skillet and sear on all sides, about 4 minutes total (the beef will be just barely seared on the outside but will remain rare).  Freeze the beef until it is almost frozen, about 1 hour (this makes it easier to cut into very thin slices).  Using a large sharp carving knife, slice the beef as thinly as possible.  Arrange the arugula and Parmesan shavings on a serving platter and lay the beef slices on top.  Drizzle with the remaining olive oil and lemon juice.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve.

Alternative:  Use 6 ounces of thinly-sliced bresaola instead of the tenderloin.  Do not cook the bresaola.  Serve it as you would the tenderloin, above.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Tie the beef tenderloin with kitchen twine to help maintain its shape, then freeze the tenderloin until frozen (this ensures that the center stays rare when cooking a small piece of meat).  Then, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy small skillet over high heat.  Rub the frozen beef with salt and pepper.  Add the beef to the hot skillet and sear on all sides, about 4 minutes total (the beef will be just barely seared on the outside but will remain rare).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  yellow mustard seeds -- cracked
  3                     beef rib-eye steaks - (12 to 14 oz ea)
  4             ounces  Gorgonzola -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  sour cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Remove some of the bread from the center of the baguette halves.  Spread the cheese mixture over the baguette halves.  Arrange the arugula then the warm steak slices over the baguette bottom.  Sprinkle the steak slices with salt and pepper.  Cover with the baguette top.  Cut the sandwich crosswise into 6 equal pieces and serve.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  onion -- grated
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  1              large  egg
  3        tablespoons  ketchup
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  grated Pecorino Romano
     1/4           cup  dried plain bread crumbs
  1              pound  ground turkey -- preferably dark meat
  2                     zucchini -- ends removed,
                        halved lengthwise and crosswise
  1                     short orange bell pepper -- halved, seeded
  1                     short red bell pepper -- halved, seeded
  1                     short yellow bell pepper -- halved, seeded
  1 1/2           cups  marinara sauce

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Lightly drizzle the olive oil into a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish.  Whisk the onion, parsley, egg, ketchup, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl to blend.  Stir in the cheese and bread crumbs.  Mix in the turkey.  Cover and refrigerate the turkey mixture.

Using a melon baller or spoon, carefully scrape out the seeds and inner flesh from the zucchini, leaving 1/8-inch-thick shells.  Be careful not to pierce through the skin.  Fill the zucchini and pepper halves with the turkey mixture, dividing equally and mounding slightly.  Arrange the stuffed vegetables in the baking dish.  Pour the marinara sauce over the stuffed vegetables.

Bake uncovered until the vegetables are tender and beginning to brown and a thermometer inserted into the filling registers 165 degrees, about 45 minutes.  Transfer the stuffed vegetables to a platter and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  panko (Japanese bread crumbs)
  3              large  eggs
  4                     swordfish steaks, abt 1/2"-thk - (5 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4        tablespoons  light olive oil
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3               cups  arugula - (lightly packed)
  1              bunch  watercress -- stemmed

Place the panko in a pie dish.  In another pie dish, beat the eggs to blend.  Line a large cutting board with plastic wrap.  Place 2 swordfish steaks on plastic wrap, about 2 inches apart.  Place another sheet of plastic wrap over the steaks.  Using the flat side of a meat mallet or a heavy rolling pin, gently flatten the swordfish steaks to 1/4-inch thick.  Remove top plastic wrap and sprinkle the swordfish with salt and pepper on both sides.  Set aside the swordfish steaks and flatten and season remaining 2 steaks, using the plastic wrap to help again.  Dip each steak into the egg, then the panko, coating completely and patting to adhere.

Working in batches, melt 2 tablespoons of butter with 2 tablespoon of light olive oil in a heavy large frying pan over medium-high heat.  Place 2 coated swordfish steaks in pan and cook until brown and crisp and just cooked through in the middle, about 1 1/2 minutes per side.  Transfer to a cooling rack set on a baking sheet and lightly tent with foil to keep warm (do not seal with foil or the breading will become soggy).  Repeat with the remaining butter, olive oil, and 2 swordfish steaks.

Whisk the lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil in a large bowl to blend.  Add the arugula and watercress, and toss lightly to coat.  Season the salad, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Transfer the swordfish steaks to plates.  Top with the salad and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Place the panko in a pie dish.  In another pie dish, beat the eggs to blend.  Line a large cutting board with plastic wrap.  Place 2 swordfish steaks on plastic wrap, about 2 inches apart.  Place another sheet of plastic wrap over the steaks.  Using the flat side of a meat mallet or a heavy rolling pin, gently flatten the swordfish steaks to 1/4-inch thick.  Remove top plastic wrap and sprinkle the swordfish with salt and pepper on both sides.  Set aside the swordfish steaks and flatten and season remaining 2 steaks, using the plastic wrap to help again.  Dip each steak into the egg, then the panko, coating completely and patting to adhere.

Working in batches, melt 2 tablespoons of butter with 2 tablespoon of light olive oil in a heavy large frying pan over medium-high heat.  Place 2 coated swordfish steaks in pan and cook until brown and crisp and just cooked through in the middle, about 1 1/2 minutes per side.  Transfer to a cooling rack set on a baking sheet and lightly tent with foil to keep warm (do not seal with foil or the breading will become soggy).  Repeat with the remaining butter, olive oil, and 2 swordfish steaks.

Whisk the lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil in a large bowl to blend.  Add the arugula and watercress, and toss lightly to coat.  Season the salad, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Transfer the swordfish steaks to plates.  Top with the salad and serve.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  herbes de Provence
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2             pounds  swordfish steaks (at least 1" thick) -- trimmed
  12                    short thick wooden skewers -- soaked in water for

Prepare the barbecue for medium-high heat or preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat.  Grill the swordfish skewers until the swordfish is just opaque in the center and the pancetta is crisp, turning often, about 10 minutes.

Transfer the skewers to plates and serve with lemon wedges.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  slender green beans -- trimmed, and
                        halved crosswise
  3          teaspoons  salt -- plus more to taste
  2              large  red potatoes -- diced
     1/3           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8             ounces  cherry tomatoes -- halved
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  9             ounces  canned tuna packed in oil -- drained

Cook the green beans in a large pot of boiling water until crisp-tender, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes.

Drain the potatoes and pat dry with a towel.

In a small bowl, whisk the lemon juice, garlic, oil, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper.  Place the tomatoes, basil and parsley in a large serving bowl.  Add the tuna and toss gently to combine.  Add the green beans and potatoes and gently combine.  Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat.

     1/2           cup  frozen peas -- thawed
  1                     lemon -- cut into wedges

Sprinkle the veal with salt and pepper.  Melt 1/2 tablespoon of butter with 2 teaspoons of oil in a heavy large frying pan over high heat.  Working in batches if necessary, add the veal and saute until just cooked through and golden, about 45 to 60 seconds per side.  Transfer the veal to a platter and tent with foil to keep it warm.  Repeat with the remaining veal, adding more butter and oil to the pan as necessary.

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in the same pan over high heat.  Add the mushrooms and shallots.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and saute until the mushrooms are golden brown, about 8 minutes.  Add the wine, broth and saffron, and simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.  Add the cream and boil until the sauce thickens slightly, stirring often, about 4 minutes.  Add the peas and return the sauce to a simmer.  Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Pour the sauce over the veal and serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  butter or vegetable shortening
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  brandy, grappa or amaretto
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  olive oil -- for deep frying
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

Using an electric mixer, beat the butter or shortening and sugar in a large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in the egg and the brandy.  Beat in the salt.  Add the flour and beat until blended.  Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until a soft dough forms.  Form the dough into a ball.  Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces.  Shape the dough pieces into balls.  Wrap the dough balls with plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes.

Working with 1 dough ball at a time, roll the dough ball into a 12-inch diameter round (the dough should be very thin and almost transparent).  Using a fluted pastry cutter, trim the edges to form a square shape.  Cut the dough into 1-inch strips.  Cut each strip in half crosswise to form 5-inch-long strips.  Gently stretch the strip so that you have enough dough to tie a bow.  Repeat with remaining dough strips.  Gather the dough scraps, then reroll and cut them to make additional bowtie pastries.

Line a baking sheet with paper towels.  Heat the oil in a large heavy frying pan over medium heat to 375 degrees.  Working in batches, fry the pastries until they puff and become golden, turning once, about 2 minutes total.  Using tongs, transfer the pastries to the paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain the excess oil.  While still hot, dust the pastries generously with confectioners' sugar and serve.

The pastries can be made 2 days ahead.  Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     frozen phyllo pastry sheets - (17" by 13") -- thawed
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- melted
  6             ounces  good-quality white chocolate -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  heavy whipping cream
     1/2           cup  hazelnuts -- toasted, husked,
                        and finely chopped
     1/4           cup  chocolate hazelnut spread -- (optional)
                        = (Nutella recommended)
  1                     bar bittersweet chocolate - (3 oz) -- grated, for garnish
                        Edible flowers -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Lay 1 phyllo sheet on a work surface.  Brush the phyllo with melted butter.  Top with another phyllo sheet.  Repeat with more butter and 2 more phyllo sheets.  Cut the stacked phyllo sheets into 6 (5-inch) squares.  Line each muffin cup with 1 stacked phyllo square, allowing the edges to ruffle and extend above the cup rims.  Repeat with the remaining 4 phyllo sheets and melted butter.  Bake until the phyllo cups are golden brown, about 9 minutes.  Transfer the muffin pan to a cooling rack and cool completely.

Meanwhile, stir the white chocolate and 1/4 cup cream in a heavy small saucepan over low heat until the chocolate is melted and smooth.  Pour into a large bowl and cool to barely lukewarm.  Stir in the hazelnuts.  Using an electric mixer, beat the remaining 1 1/4 cups cream in another large bowl to medium-firm peaks.  Fold the cream into the white chocolate mixture in 2 batches.  Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.

Spoon 2 teaspoons of the chocolate hazelnut spread into each phyllo cup, if using.  Spoon the white chocolate mousse into the cooled phyllo cups, mounding slightly.  Arrange the mousse-filled phyllo cups on plates.  Sprinkle the bittersweet chocolate over the mousse, or garnish with edible flowers, and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Do-Ahead Tip:  The unfilled phyllo cups can be made 2 days ahead.  Store them in an airtight container at room temperature.  The white chocolate mousse can be made up to 8 hours ahead.  Keep it refrigerated.  The filled phyllo cups can be assembled up to 1 hour ahead.  Cover and refrigerate them.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  1              large  radicchio head - (abt 12 oz) -- coarsely chopped
  1                can  cannellini beans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
     1/3           cup  fish broth
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     whitefish fillets - (5 to 6 oz ea)
                        = (such as tilapia)
                        All-purpose flour -- for dredging
                        === LEMON VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  fresh Italian parsley leaves - -- (lightly packed)
  2                     garlic cloves
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add the shallots and saute until tender, about 2 minutes.  Add the radicchio and saute until wilted, about 5 minutes.  Add the beans and broth, and cook until the beans are heated through, stirring often, about 5 minutes.  Season the radicchio mixture, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a 14-inch (or 2 smaller) nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle the fillets with salt and pepper.  Dredge the fillets in flour to coat completely.  Shake of the excess flour and fry 3 fillets in each pan until they are golden brown and just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.

Spoon the radicchio mixture over the center of the plates.  Top with the fillets.  Drizzle the vinaigrette over and serve immediately.

Lemon Vinaigrette:  Blend the lemon juice, parsley, garlic, lemon zest, salt, and pepper in a blender.  With the machine running, gradually blend in the oil.  Season the vinaigrette, to taste, with more salt and pepper.  (Makes scant 2/3 cup)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2                     onions -- thinly sliced
  2            bunches  Swiss chard -- trimmed, and
                        chopped - (abt 14 cups)
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                can  diced tomatoes with juices - (14 1/2 oz)
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             ounces  whole-wheat spaghetti
     1/4           cup  pitted kalamata olives -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Pecorino cheese
  2        tablespoons  toasted pine nuts

Heat the oil in a heavy large frying pan over medium heat.  Add the onions and saute until tender, about 8 minutes.  Add the chard and saute until it wilts, about 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Stir in the tomatoes with their juices, wine, and red pepper flakes.  Bring to a simmer.  Cover and simmer until the tomatoes begin to break down and the chard is very tender, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Season the chard mixture, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the spaghetti and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring frequently, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain the spaghetti.  Add the spaghetti to the chard mixture and toss to combine.

Transfer the pasta to serving bowls.  Sprinkle the olives, cheese, and pine nuts and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recommended Wine: 2001 Clerico Trevigne 
Origin: Alba, Piedmont 
Grape: Barbera

Wine Notes:  This wine is from the north in the Piedmont region of Italy.  I chose a Barbera because I needed a wine to to stand up to the bitterness of the swiss chard and the strong taste of the pecorino cheese.  This wine's texture is smooth and the color is a dark ruby red.  Its bouquet is scorched earth and blackberries with a kiss of oak.  The pasta's flavors do not fight with the taste of the wine but is an explosion of flavor every time you take a bite of spaghetti or a sip of wine.

Wine Pouring Notes:  Do not fill above the curve of the bowl, never more than 1/2 full, that way you can get a true sense of the wine's aroma and a better sense of its bouquet.  To get the full experience of the wine, place your nose into the glass and take in the wine's beautiful aroma.
