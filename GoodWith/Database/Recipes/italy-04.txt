  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Simply Sweet Dough -- (see recipe)
  3               cups  almond paste
                        = (homemade or store-bought)
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
                        with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for egg wash
                        === GLAZE ===
  1 1/2           cups  confectioner's sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  3        tablespoons  milk or half-and-half - (to 4)

Lightly spray two baking sheets with vegetable oil spray.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide the dough in half and cover one half with a towel or bowl.

Roll out the other piece of dough to an 18-inch round.  Spread 1 1/2 cups of the almond paste evenly over the dough to within 1/4-inch of the edges.  Starting at the edge nearest you, roll the dough up tightly like a jelly roll, tucking in the ends as you roll.  Pinch the seam closed and put the dough seam-side down on one of the prepared baking sheets.  Shape the dough into a candy cane, wreath, or S shape; if you've made a wreath, pinch the ends to the dough together and tuck them under to seal the seam.  Cover with a clean towel and let the dough rise for 45 minutes.  Repeat with the remaining dough and almond paste.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Brush the tops of each bread with the egg wash.  With scissors, make a few decorative slashes lengthwise down the center of the candy cane shape, or cut 1/2-inch slashes about 1 inch apart around the edges of the wreath or the S shape.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the breads are a rich brown on both the top and bottom.  Cool the breads on wire racks until just warm.

Meanwhile, in a bowl, mix the confectioners' sugar with the almond extract and just enough of the milk to make a smooth glaze.  The glaze should be just thick enough to flow slowly off a spoon.

With a spoon, drizzle the glaze over the warm breads.  Let the glaze dry completely.  Serve the breads warm or at room temperature.  The breads can be frozen, well wrapped in heavy-duty aluminum foil and then in plastic bags, for up to 2 months.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

Comments:  For these elegant and wonderfully scented almond breads, use a good commercially prepared almond paste, such as Solo, or make your own.  Almond paste can be stored in the refrigerator for weeks or in the freezer for months.  Jam can be used in place of almond paste, as can ground walnuts and raisins.

                  Artichoke Sauce - {Salsa Di Carciofo}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta
                Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced shallots - (4 oz)
  1             medium  onion -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                can  artichoke hearts - (14 oz) -- drained, rinsed,
                        and thinly sliced
                        = (or 4 fresh cleaned artichoke hearts)
     1/2           cup  grated carrots
     1/4      teaspoon  celery salt
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  minced fresh Italian parsley leaves -- stems removed
  1              pound  linguine
                        Freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- to sprinkle

Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large saute pan, add the shallots and onion, and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to wilt but not turn brown.  Stir in the garlic and cook until it softens but do not let it brown.  Stir in the artichokes, carrots, celery salt, sea salt, oregano, and black pepper and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Pour in the wine, increase the heat to high, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in the parsley, cover the pan, and keep the sauce warm while the linguine cooks.

Cook the linguine according to the directions.  When al dente, drain the pasta, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.  Return the pasta to the pot and, over low heat, stir in the artichoke sauce and the reserved cooking water.  Mix well.  Transfer to a pasta platter and serve immediately with grated cheese to pass.

Note:  To clean fresh artichokes, cut and discard the stem and remove the outer leaves until the pale yellow leaves appear.  Cut off the top two thirds of the artichokes.  Open the center and scrape out the hairy choke.  Place the artichoke hearts in cold water with fresh lemon juice.  Bring a pot of water to a boil, add the artichokes and boil until tender, 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain and proceed with the recipe.  Use a serrated knife to make neat artichoke slices.

This recipe yields 2 1/4 cups.

Comments:  Watching the "artichoke lady" of Verona whittle away the outer leaves of bushels of artichokes like a master wood carver was the inspiration for this quick artichoke sauce using canned artichoke hearts.  If you wish to use fresh artichokes, you will need 4 large ones.  This sauce is delicious over spaghetti or linguine.

Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large saute pan, add the shallots and onion, and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to wilt but not turn brown.  Stir in the garlic and cook until it softens but do not let it brown.  Stir in the artichokes, carrots, celery salt, sea salt, oregano, and black pepper and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Pour in the wine, increase the heat to high, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in the parsley, cover the pan, and keep the sauce warm while the linguine cooks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the linguine according to the directions.  When al dente, drain the pasta, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.  Return the pasta to the pot and, over low heat, stir in the artichoke sauce and the reserved cooking water.  Mix well.  Transfer to a pasta platter and serve immediately with grated cheese to pass.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  To clean fresh artichokes, cut and discard the stem and remove the outer leaves until the pale yellow leaves appear.  Cut off the top two thirds of the artichokes.  Open the center and scrape out the hairy choke.  Place the artichoke hearts in cold water with fresh lemon juice.  Bring a pot of water to a boil, add the artichokes and boil until tender, 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain and proceed with the recipe.  Use a serrated knife to make neat artichoke slices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 1/4 cups.

Comments:  Watching the &quot;artichoke lady&quot; of Verona whittle away the outer leaves of bushels of artichokes like a master wood carver was the inspiration for this quick artichoke sauce using canned artichoke hearts.  If you wish to use fresh artichokes, you will need 4 large ones.  This sauce is delicious over spaghetti or linguine.

                 Artichokes With Fettucine And Mint - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  artichokes
                        Juice of 1 large lemon
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2         pound  fettucine
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
     3/4           cup  grated Pecorino Romano cheese
     1/4           cup  minced fresh mint
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste

Roll the artichokes back and forth across a countertop to loosen the leaves a bit.  Cut the stems off the bottoms and remove the tough outer leaves.  Cut off about 1/4 inch of the tops.  Spread the center leaves of each artichoke to expose the fuzzy interior choke and remove the fuzzy choke; I use a small melon baller for this.  Rinse the artichokes well.

Place the artichokes upright in a pot just large enough to hold them and add water to cover them by 1 inch.  Add the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Cover and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium and boil gently for 30 to 35 minutes, or until you can easily pull a leaf from one of the artichokes.  Drain them immediately and refresh under cold water.  Place them upside down on a towel.

Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling water, cook the fettucine until al dente; drain well and toss with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil.  Add the garlic and saute until soft.  Add the fettucine and cook, stirring, over medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the Pecorino Romano cheese and mint.

Place the artichokes upright in an oiled baking dish.  Divide the fettucine mixture evenly among the artichokes, filling the center cavity of each one to the top.  Give each artichoke a grinding of black pepper and drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over the tops.

Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake until heated through, about 20 minutes.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Italian artichokes are much smaller than our globe artichoke.  At home, artichokes were marinated in olive oil and vinegar and served as an antipasto, or they were boiled, stuffed, and baked.  Grandma Galasso liked to make them the Roman way, stuffed with lots of garlic and mint.  I go a little further and add fettucine.

            Asparagus And Prosciutto - {Asparagi E Prosciutto}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  asparagus -- stalks trimmed
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- chopped
                        Freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- for sprinkling

Make a slash in the bottom of each asparagus stalk.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the salt.  Add the asparagus and cook, uncovered, until a knife is easily inserted in the stalk.  Carefully drain the asparagus.

In a large skillet, heat the butter and olive oil.  Add the prosciutto and fry until it begins to crisp.  Add the asparagus and heat through.  Carefully transfer the asparagus and prosciutto to a serving platter.  Sprinkle with the cheese and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Asparagus is the obvious choice of vegetable for an Easter or springtime buffet.  Look for stalks with tightly closed tips.  In this quickly made dish, asparagus spears are combined with crisp pieces of fried prosciutto and sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese.

Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Grinding of black pepper
  2                     medium- eggplants -- stemmed, peeled,
                        and cut into thin slices
  3              large  eggs -- slightly beaten
     1/2           cup  canola or peanut oil
  2 1/2           cups  tomato sauce
     2/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Place the flour, salt, and pepper in a heavy-duty paper bag.  Close the bag and shake the ingredients to blend them.  Add the eggplant slices a few at a time to the bag, then close the bag and shake to coat the slices.  Transfer the slices to a dish.

Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the bottom of a 9- by 12-inch casserole dish and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat the oil in a large saute pan.  While it is heating, coat the slices of eggplant in the beaten egg on both sides.  Fry the slices in the oil until they are golden brown on each side.  As they brown, transfer them to a baking sheet lined with paper towels.

Place a layer of the slices in the baking dish, slightly overlapping them.  Spoon on a thin layer of tomato sauce and one-third of the grated cheese.  Continue making layers until all the eggplant is used.  Finish off the top layer with tomato sauce.

Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake it for 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove the dish and allow it to sit for 15 minutes before cutting it.  Serve hot.

Note:  This is even better made a day ahead of time.  Cut it when cold for neat, even pieces.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  In my first cookbook, Ciao Italia, there is not one recipe for eggplant alla Parmigiana.  The reason was that I thought everyone knew how to make it.  It was not until I did a segment on a version of eggplant alla Parmigiana that I realized I had been doing an injustice to my readers.  This recipe was made on the series by the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, Buddy Cianci.  Buddy uses his great Aunt Anna's recipe, which creates a very light-tasting, non-greasy eggplant that is even good served cold between slices of coarse bread as a wonderful sandwich.  There is great debate among cooks as to whether to fry the eggplant in olive oil or vegetable oil.  I prefer vegetable oil, which produces a lighter-tasting dish.  In Sicily the Parmesan cheese is replaced by Cacciocavallo cheese, and pine nuts and raisins are added to the layers.

          Baby Broccoli And Spaghetti - {Broccolini E Spaghetti}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  pancetta (Italian bacon) -- diced
  1              pound  broccolini -- washed and drained
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  fresh tomatoes -- skinned, seeded,
                        and coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  water or chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Grinding of black pepper
  1              pound  spaghetti
     1/4           cup  reserved pasta-cooking water
                        Grated Pecorino cheese -- for sprinkling

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet, add the pancetta, and cook, stirring, over medium heat, until the pancetta begins to render its fat.  Stir in the broccolini and continue cooking for another 3 minutes.  Stir in the garlic and continue cooking until the garlic softens.  Stir in the tomatoes, chicken broth, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper.  Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat for 5 minutes.  The broccolini should remain al dente, or have a bit of crunch to it.  Set the broccolini aside and keep it warm while the spaghetti is cooking.

In a pasta pot with insert, bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a boil.  Stir in the remaining tablespoon of salt and the spaghetti.  Stir the spaghetti once or twice.  Cover the pot and bring to a boil, then remove the cover and cook until the spaghetti is al dente.

Drain the spaghetti into a colander, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.  Return the spaghetti to the pasta pot.  Stir in the broccolini, the reserved water, and the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and mix well over medium-low heat.  Transfer the mixture to a platter, sprinkle the top with Pecorino cheese, and serve immediately.

Note:  Did you know that it is best to grate hard cheeses such as Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino when they are at room temperature?

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Broccolini (baby broccoli) is similar to broccoli but with smaller and not as compact florets; the stem is totally edible, leaving no waste.  The delicate florets and slender stems have a hint of sweetness and can be cooked just like broccoli or eaten raw.  In this recipe, the broccolini is flavored with pancetta and tomatoes, providing a nice flavor contrast with the spaghetti.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet, add the pancetta, and cook, stirring, over medium heat, until the pancetta begins to render its fat.  Stir in the broccolini and continue cooking for another 3 minutes.  Stir in the garlic and continue cooking until the garlic softens.  Stir in the tomatoes, chicken broth, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper.  Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat for 5 minutes.  The broccolini should remain al dente, or have a bit of crunch to it.  Set the broccolini aside and keep it warm while the spaghetti is cooking.

In a pasta pot with insert, bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a boil.  Stir in the remaining tablespoon of salt and the spaghetti.  Stir the spaghetti once or twice.  Cover the pot and bring to a boil, then remove the cover and cook until the spaghetti is al dente.

Drain the spaghetti into a colander, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.  Return the spaghetti to the pasta pot.

                   Baked Fennel - {Finocchio Al Forno}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     medium bulbs fennel - (abt 2 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 3/4           cups  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  toasted bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Remove the feathery leaves and tough stalks from the fennel.  Wash the bulbs and cut each into quarters.

Fill a large pot with water, add 1 tablespoon salt, and bring to a boil.  Add the fennel, cover, and cook for about 20 minutes, or until a knife can easily be inserted into the fennel.  Drain in a colander.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the flour, whisking to a smooth paste, and cook for about 1 minute.  Slowly whisk in the milk and cook, whisking until the sauce comes to a simmer and thickens.  Remove from the heat and stir in the nutmeg and salt.

Spread a thin layer of the sauce in a 12- by 8-inch casserole dish.  Add the fennel, cut-sides down, in a single layer.  Pour the remaining sauce over the fennel.  Sprinkle the bread crumbs and cheese evenly over the top.  Bake, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the sauce and cheese are lightly browned.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Fennel, the licorice-tasting celery-like vegetable, has an important place in Italian cooking.  Long thought to have medicinal properties, it is still eaten raw as a digestivo after meals, a practice my family continues today.  In this recipe, it is blanketed in a simple cream sauce, topped with bread crumbs, and baked in the oven.  You can assemble the dish ahead and bake it the next day.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  red bell peppers
     1/4           cup  peanut oil - (to 1/2)
  2              small  eggplants -- peeled and diced
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped pitted Gaeta olives
  1         tablespoon  capers -- rinsed and drained
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh basil
     1/4           cup  olive oil - (to 1/2) -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  10            slices  Italian bread, 1/2" thick
  1                cup  diced mozzarella cheese - (abt 1/4 lb)
  6                     fresh plum tomatoes -- chopped
  1                cup  toasted fresh bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Place the peppers on an oiled grill or broiler pan and grill or broil them, turning them occasionally, until they are blackened all over.  Place them in a paper bag, close the bag, and let them cool.  Peel off the skins.  Remove the core, cut down one side of each pepper, and open them out flat.  Carefully remove the seeds and set the peppers aside.

In a skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the peanut oil and fry the eggplant in batches, until browned, adding more oil as necessary.  Remove the eggplant to a large bowl.  Add the olives, capers, and basil, and mix well.

Wipe out the skillet and add 1/4 cup of the olive oil.  Heat the oil and fry the bread slices a few at a time, adding more oil as necessary, until browned on both sides.  Drain on brown paper.  Tear the bread into small chunks and add to the eggplant mixture.  Add the cheese and plum tomatoes, and mix well.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Combine the bread crumbs and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

Place about 1/2 cup of the eggplant mixture on one end of each pepper and roll each pepper up like a jelly roll.  Place the peppers in an oiled baking dish and drizzle them with the 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture over the top.  Bake for 15 minutes or until heated through.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Colorful sweet peppers abound in Italian markets and they are inexpensive.  Peppers are prepared in numerous ways: Marinated for antipasti, stuffed and baked, made into filling for pasta, pureed for sauces, and sliced raw for salads.  I love to make stuffed sweet red peppers the Neapolitan way.  Make this in the summer when red peppers are less expensive.

              Beans Cooked In A Flask - {Fagioli Al Fiasco}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh cannellini beans
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  6              whole  sage leaves
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1         tablespoon  sea salt
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  3               cups  water

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.

Put everything in the pot.  Cover and bake slowly about 3 hours or until the liquid has evaporated.

Serve as a side dish to meats and poultry.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Fresh and dried beans are a big part of the Tuscan diet.  They are nutritious, cost very little, and are ingeniously used in cooking.  Cannellini and Toscanelli are two white beans that Tuscans favor.  An intriguing way of preparing them fresh is fagioli al fiasco or beans cooked in an old wine bottle with olive oil, sage, black pepper and water.  The bottle is placed over hot embers and the flask sealed with a piece of cloth.  There they cook for several hours and are then served seasoned with salt.  A less dramatic version is to cook them in a bean pot or other heavy-duty pot.

Cover the beans with cold water and allow them to soak overnight.  Drain the beans, place them in a pot, cover them with fresh water and cook them until the skins easily slip off when pressed between your fingers.  Drain the beans, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid, and set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan, add the sage and cook over very low heat for 5 minutes.  Stir in the beans and tomato extract dissolved in the reserved cooking liquid.  Heat through.  Season with salt and pepper and serve the beans with a drizzle of olive oil over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  To me, fagioli all'uccelletto is simply Tuscany's version of baked beans that are traditionally cooked in a flask for hours on an open hearth.  The term "bird style" implies that the same ingredients are used to cook small game birds.  The modern version is to bake the beans in a bean pot or other heavy oven pot.  Tuscan cooks start with fresh, creamy white cannellini beans, a luxury that eliminates the soaking process, but dried beans are our alternative.  Start the process the night before.

                Black Olive Sauce - {Salsa Di Oliva Nera}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7        tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- peeled and diced
     1/2           cup  chopped pitted black oil-cured olives -- (abt 27 olives)
  3                     plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley

In a saucepan, heat the olive oil, add the onion, and saute over medium heat until the onion softens.  Add the olives, tomatoes, salt, and pepper.  Stir the mixture and let simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.

Turn off the heat, add the parsley, and stir to blend.  Let the sauce sit at room temperature several hours.  When ready to use, reheat the sauce and pour it over pasta.

This recipe yields 1 1/4 cups.

Comments:  Prepare this pungent sauce early in the day and let it sit at room temperature so the flavors develop.  I serve it over farfalle, or butterfly-shaped macaroni, but any short macaroni will do.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  globe artichokes - (abt 1 lb)
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
                        Juice of 1 lemon
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)

  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled and minced
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  dry white wine

Wash and dry the artichokes.  Roll them around on the countertop under your hand to loosen the leaves.  Cut off the stems and remove the tough outer leaves at the base.  Cut 1/4-inch off the top of each artichoke and trim the thorns on the tips.  Open the center of each artichoke and remove the fuzzy choke with a melon scoop or spoon.

Cut the artichokes in half, then in quarters.  Place in a bowl of cold water and lemon juice.  Let soak for several minutes, then drain and dry well.  Set aside.

In a Dutch oven, heat the butter and oil.  Add the garlic and saute until it begins to soften.  Add the parsley and continue to cook over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes.  Put in the artichokes and coat well with the seasonings.  Sprinkle the salt over the artichokes, cover the pot, and cook over low heat for about 5 minutes.

Add milk and half the wine to the pot and continue to cook, covered for 15 minutes.  Add the remaining wine and cook until a knife is easily inserted into the leaves and heart.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Straight Dough -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cups  finely-chopped cooked broccoli
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh basil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2         pound  pepperoni -- diced
     1/4         pound  mozzarella cheese -- diced
     1/4         pound  Provolone cheese -- diced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for egg wash
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
                        Sesame seeds -- as needed

Prepare the dough as directed and set aside to rise until doubled in size.

In a large frying pan, heat 3 tablespoons of the oil.  Add the garlic and saute until soft.  Add the broccoli and saute for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the wine vinegar, basil, and oregano and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the mixture to a bowl and let cool.

Punch the dough down, turn it out onto a floured surface, and knead for 5 minutes.  Roll the dough out to a 12- by 14-inch rectangle.  Lift the dough onto a lightly greased baking sheet; don't worry if the edges hang over the sides of the sheet at this point.

Brush the top of the dough with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Spread the broccoli mixture over the dough to within 1/2 inch of the edges.  Scatter the diced pepperoni and cheeses over the dough and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Starting with a long side, roll the dough up tightly like a jelly roll.  Pinch the seam to seal and position the roll so the seam is on the bottom; tuck the 2 ends under the roll.

Brush the top with the egg wash and sprinkle with coarse salt and sesame seeds.  Cover with a towel and let rise for about 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until nicely browned.  Let cool and cut into thick slices.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Sometimes I get carried away with my family's cooking ethic: Never throw any food away, and always cook more than you think you will need just in case the doorbell rings.  I always worry that company will appear unannounced and I will have nothing to feed them.  If you have my broccoli roll on hand, you won't have to worry.

     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced Genoa salami
     1/3         pound  thinly-sliced prosciutto
     1/3         pound  thinly-sliced capicolla
     1/2         pound  fresh or packaged mozzarella -- sliced
     1/2         pound  thinly-sliced provolone

Put the olives, fennel bulb, marinated artichokes, and pepper strips, in a food processor and coarsely chop.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and add the garlic, chopped herbs, and olive oil.  Blend well and season with salt.  Cover the bowl and set aside to marinate for several hours.

With a bread knife, cut 1/2-inch lid off the top of the bread and set aside.  With your fingers, pull out the interior crumb of the bread, leaving about a 3/4-inch-thick shell.  Reserve the inside of the bread for another use, such as Homemade Bread Crumbs (see recipe).

Spread half the marinated salad ingredients evenly in the bottom of the bread shell.  Layer the meats and cheeses alternately on top of the salad.  Spread the remaining salad over the top.  Replace the bread lid.  Wrap the bread tightly in aluminum foil.  Place a heavy weight such as a cast-iron skillet or two clean bricks on top of the bread and refrigerate it for at least 6 hours or, even better, overnight.

An hour before serving, remove the foil and place the pitta on a serving plate.  With a bread knife, cut it into wedges while it is still cold (this will ensure neatly cut wedges).  Let come to room temperature before serving.

Variation:  Instead of flat layers of meats and cheeses, make rolled layers by rolling slices of the cheeses and meats together into cylinders.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                        === VEAL-RICE FILLING ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
     3/4         pound  ground veal
  1                cup  thinly-sliced mushrooms
     1/2           cup  cooked rice
  1                cup  diced Italian Fontina cheese - (1/4 lb)
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh parsley
                        === EGGPLANT-CHEESE FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  peanut oil
  2               cups  peeled and cubed eggplant
  1                     anchovy packed in oil -- mashed
  1                cup  Tomato And Basil Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  diced pepperoni - (abt 1/4 lb)
  1                cup  diced Provolone cheese - (abt 1/4 lb)
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
                        === PROSCIUTTO-BROCCOLI FILLING ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- diced
  1 1/2           cups  chopped cooked broccoli
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  diced Asiago cheese - (abt 1/4 lb)
     1/4           cup  oil-cured olives -- pitted and chopped

To make the dough, in a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Stir in the sugar and mix well.  Let proof until the yeast is foamy, 5 to 10 minutes.  Add the milk and olive oil and stir to blend.  Mix 3 cups of the flour and the salt and add to the yeast mixture.  Mix with your hands until a ball of dough is formed.  If the dough seems sticky, add up to 1/2 cup additional flour.

Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead it until it is very smooth.  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn to coat with the oil, cover with a clean towel, and let rise in a warm draft-free place for about 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size.

Punch the dough down.  Turn it out onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.  Cut the dough into 8 pieces.  Roll each piece out with a rolling pin to a 7-inch circle.  Place the circles on floured towels as you make them and keep covered as you work with the remaining dough.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease 2 baking sheets and sprinkle with cornmeal.

Brush each circle of dough lightly with olive oil.  Divide the filling among the circles, placing it on the lower half of each circle.  Bring the other half over to enclose the filling, like a turnover, and seal the edges closed by pressing on them with the tines of a fork.

Place the calzoni 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.  Brush the tops with the egg wash and make a small slit with scissors in the top of each calzone.  Let rise for 20 minutes.

Bake the calzoni for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.  Let cool slightly before serving.

Sausage Filling:  In a skillet, saute the sausage (in its own fat) until browned, crumbling it with a fork.  Transfer the sausage with a slotted spoon to a bowl, and drain off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the skillet.  Add the peppers, garlic, and onion and saute for 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft.  Add to the sausage along with the fennel seeds, cheese, salt and pepper, and sauce.  Stir to mix well.  Let cool.  (Makes 3 1/2 to 4 cups)

Veal-Rice Filling:  In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat and brown the veal.  Remove the veal to a bowl with a slotted soon.  Add the mushrooms to the skillet, and saute until soft.  Add the mushrooms to the veal along with the remaining ingredients, and mix well.  Let cool.  (Makes 3 1/2 to 4 cups)

Eggplant-Cheese Filling:  In a large skillet, heat the peanut oil and saute the eggplant for 5 minutes, or until soft.  Add the anchovy and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the tomato sauce, stirring to blend well, and simmer the mixture for 5 minutes.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and add the pepperoni, cheese, basil, and pepper.  Stir to mix well.  Let cool.  (Makes 4 to 4 1/2 cups)

Prosciutto-Broccoli Filling:  In a skillet, heat the olive oil and saute the prosciutto until browned and crisp.  Remove the prosciutto to a bowl.  Add the broccoli to the skillet and saute for 1 minute.  Add the broccoli to the prosciutto, along with the pepper, cheese, and olives.  Stir to mix well.  Let cool.  (Makes 3 to 3 1/2 cups)

Note:  To freeze calzoni, let cool completely and wrap them individually in aluminum foil.  Defrost in the refrigerator and reheat in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes, or until warm.

Variation:  To make mini calzoni divide the dough into 24 pieces, roll out into 2-inch circles, and fill as directed above.  Bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes, or until golden brown.  Makes about 2 dozen.

This recipe yields 8 calzoni.

Comments:  Calzone means "pant leg" and calzoni are pizza turnovers -- little half-moons of dough that house savory fillings of meat, cheeses, and/or vegetables.  When shaped, they are said to resemble the wide billowing trousers that the men of Naples wore in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  There are four fillings to choose from here.

       Camille's Stuffed Escarole - {Scarola Ripiena Alla Camille}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  raisins
  1              pound  escarole
     2/3           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  grated Pecorino Romano cheese
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled and mashed
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh basil
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  water
                        Salt -- to taste

Soak the raisins in water to cover in a small bowl for 15 minutes.

Rinse and drain the escarole well, but do not detach the leaves from the core.

In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, cheese, half the garlic, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, oregano, basil, and 3 tablespoons of the olive oil.

Drain the raisins and add one fourth to the mixture.  Reserve the remaining raisins.

Carefully spread the escarole leaves open to the center and stuff the filling in the middle.  Close up the leaves and tie the escarole firmly with kitchen string so filling will not fall out.

Place the escarole bundles in a Dutch oven or slow cooker.  Sprinkle on the remaining olive oil, garlic, and raisins.  Add the water, cover the pot, and cook over low heat for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the leaves have wilted and are soft.

Carefully remove the escarole to a cutting board and cut off the strings.  Cut the bundle into pieces and serve with pan juices, and salt and pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This Old World recipe for scarola, or escarole, comes from Camille Guarino, a viewer of my television series.  She, like me, hated this dish as a kid, but now is fond of it.  Green, curly leaves of escarole stuffed with bread crumbs, anchovies, and raisins were a hallmark of my grandmother's cooking.  Camille's recipe takes me back to Grandma's kitchen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRESCIUTA ===
     1/2           cup  water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
     1/4      teaspoon  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        === DOUGH ===
  1              large  cake fresh yeast - (1 oz)
                        = (or 4 packages active dry yeast)
  3               cups  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
                        Prepared Cresciuta -- (listed above)
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  6 1/2           cups  fine durum semolina flour - (to 6 3/4)
                        Cornmeal -- for sprinkling
                        Olive oil -- for brushing
     1/3           cup  sesame seeds

To make the cresciuta, in a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water.  Let it proof for 10 minutes, or until foamy.  Stir in the flour, cover the bowl, and let the mixture sit in a warm place for at least 4 hours, or overnight.

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in 2 cups of the warm water.  Let stand, covered for 5 minutes, or until foamy.

Stir the remaining 1 cup water and the cresciuta into the yeast, blending well.  Add 5 cups of the semolina flour and the salt to the yeast and mix with your hands until a ball of dough is formed, adding additional flour as needed until the dough is no longer too sticky.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it with closed fists for about 20 minutes.

Form the dough into a round and place it on a peel sprinkled with cornmeal.  Cover and let rise in a warm place for about 2 hours until doubled in size.  Or place the dough in a 10- by 4-inch banneton (bread basket), cover, and let rise.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees, and place a baking stone on the bottom rack to preheat for at least 30 minutes.

Brush the top of the loaf with olive oil and sprinkle on the sesame seeds.  Sprinkle the baking stone with cornmeal and slide the loaf from the peel onto the baking stone.  Or, if using a basket, carefully turn the bread out onto the peel.  Brush the top with olive oil, sprinkle on the sesame seeds, and slide the bread onto the baking stone.  Bake the bread for about 35 minutes, or until nicely browned and hollow sounding when tapped on the bottom.  Let the bread cool on a rack before slicing.

Note:  To bake the bread using a cookie sheet, follow the instructions through step 3, then shape the dough into a round or oval loaf and place on a lightly greased cookie sheet to rise.  Place the oven rack in the bottom third of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees.  Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.  Cool the bread on a wire rack before slicing.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  1             medium  cauliflower head - (abt 2 lbs) -- washed, and
                        cut into small florets
  4              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/4           cup  diced Dried Tomatoes In Olive Oil -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  minced flat-leaf parsley
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil.  Add the onions and cook until they begin to soften.  Add the cauliflower and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes.  Cover the pan, lower the heat to medium-low, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes.  Remove the onions and cauliflower to a dish, and set the pan aside.

In a large bowl, beat the eggs, cheese, tomatoes, and parsley together.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the cauliflower mixture and blend well.

Set the skillet over medium heat, and add 1 tablespoon of the oil.  Add the frittata mixture, distributing the cauliflower evenly in the pan.  Cook until the frittata holds together when the skillet is shaken.

Place a large dish or a pizza pan over the top of the skillet and invert the frittata onto the dish.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet, slip the frittata back into the pan, and cook until lightly browned on the bottom.  Turn the frittata out onto a serving plate, cut into wedges, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil.  Add the onions and cook until they begin to soften.  Add the cauliflower and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes.  Cover the pan, lower the heat to medium-low, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes.  Remove the onions and cauliflower to a dish, and set the pan aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, beat the eggs, cheese, tomatoes, and parsley together.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the cauliflower mixture and blend well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set the skillet over medium heat, and add 1 tablespoon of the oil.  Add the frittata mixture, distributing the cauliflower evenly in the pan.  Cook until the frittata holds together when the skillet is shaken.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a large dish or a pizza pan over the top of the skillet and invert the frittata onto the dish.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet, slip the frittata back into the pan, and cook until lightly browned on the bottom.  Turn the frittata out onto a serving plate, cut into wedges, and serve immediately.

                         Cheese Bread - {Crescia}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  1         tablespoon  active dried yeast
  7              large  eggs -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1                cup  grated Pecorino cheese
  7               cups  unbleached all purpose flour - (to 8)
  1 1/2           cups  diced mozzarella cheese - (8 oz)
  1                cup  diced Provolone cheese - (5 oz)

Spray a 6 1/2- by 6 1/2-inch high sided pan and a 4- by 6 1/2-inch high sided pan with olive oil and set aside.  The insert to a crock pot works well for the larger loaf and brown paper lunch bags or panettone papers work well for the smaller loaf.

Pour the water into a large bowl or into the bowl of a stand mixer.  Stir in the yeast and allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes; it will get chalky looking and bubbles should appear on the surface.

Beat the eggs with a whisk in a separate bowl to break them up; whisk in the olive oil, black pepper, salt, and grated Pecorino cheese.  Add this mixture to the yeast mixture and blend well.  Begin adding the flour 1 cup at a time until a dough is created that is not sticking to your hands.  Use the paddle attachment if using a stand mixer to make the dough; the dough should wind itself around the paddle attachment when enough flour has been added.  If doing this by hand, the job will be a little harder since this is a fairly heavy dough; add just enough flour to allow the dough to come away from the sides of the bowl.  Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface; knead it a few times with your hands, then stretch the dough out, and sprinkle the diced cheeses over the top.  Fold the dough over the cheeses and knead them into the dough.

Brush a large bowl with olive oil, and transfer the dough to the bowl.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise until doubled.  This should take about 2 hours.

Punch down the dough with your hands, and transfer it once again to a lightly floured surface.  Knead it for a few minutes.  Cut 2/3 of the dough and knead it into a round; place it in the large pan; round the remaining 1/3 portion of dough and place it in the smaller pan.  Cover the doughs with clean towels and allow them to rise for 30 to 35 minutes or until they have risen 2/3 of the way up the sides of the pan.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Remove the top rack in the oven and set aside.  Place the pans on the lowest position in the oven and bake the breads for 35 to 40 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the center of the loaves comes out clean.  The breads will rise to impressive heights, and if the tops brown too much before the breads are done, loosely cover them with a piece of aluminum foil.

Transfer the breads to a cooling rack.  Allow to cool until warm.  Run a butter knife inside the pan to loosen the bread from the sides; then invert the pan and remove the bread.  If using paper bags or panettone papers, there is no need to remove the bread from the papers.

Tip:  Use the water drained off of boiling potatoes in the recipe since potato water has so much starch that yeast loves to feed on it.

This recipe yields 1 large and 1 small bread.

Comments:  Crescia is that cheese bread made in Umbria and particularly in Gubbio for the la corsa dei Ceri, the candle race in honor of Gubbio's patron, Sant'Ubaldo.  The domed loaf with its sunny yellow crumb rises high above its rim, and this is where it gets the name, "crescia", meaning to grow or rise.  Flavored with flecks of coarse black pepper, and several kinds of cheese, including grated Pecorino, chunks of mozzarella, and Provolone, this impressive bread is best eaten warm.

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  nonfat dry milk
  1 1/3           cups  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar
  4 1/2    tablespoons  butter or margarine -- room temperature
  1              large  egg -- plus
  2              large  egg whites
  5               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 5 1/2)
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1                cup  dried tart red cherries -- diced
                        === GLAZE ===
  1 1/2           cups  confectioner's sugar
  4        tablespoons  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract

Place the dry milk in a large bowl and add the warm water.  Stir to dissolve.  Sprinkle the yeast over the milk, add the teaspoon of granulated sugar, and stir to dissolve.  Let the mixture proof for 10 minutes, covered.

Add 2 1/2 tablespoons of the butter or margarine, the egg and egg whites, and remaining granulated sugar to the mixture and whisk until well blended.  Add the flour gradually, until a ball of dough is obtained that is not sticky.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease two 15- by 11-inch baking sheets.

Mix the sugar and cinnamon together for the filling and set aside.

Punch the dough down and divide in half.  Knead each half until smooth, about 5 minutes.  Roll 1 piece on a floured surface into a 16-inch circle.  Brush the dough with 1 tablespoon of the remaining butter.  Sprinkle on half the sugar and cinnamon, and then half the cherries.  Roll the dough up from the widest side into a tight jelly roll.  Cut the roll into fifteen 1-inch slices and place them on baking sheet, spacing them close together.  Repeat for the second piece.  Let rise, covered, for 15 minutes.

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until nicely browned.  Let the rolls cool until warm on a cookie rack.

In a small bowl, mix the confectioner's sugar with the milk and almond extract until smooth.  Drizzle a little of the glaze over the tops of the rolls.  Serve warm.

Note:  These can be frozen unglazed.

This recipe yields 30 rolls.

Comments:  July 4 was an important date in our Italian-American household, not only because of US independence but because the day signaled our annual summer event -- picking cherries.  My parents packed us into the car and off we went, bemoaning the task that lay ahead.  We picked bushels of the ruby red fruit, some to give to relatives, a lot to preserve in canning jars or dry, and some to eat.  At Christmastime my mother used the dried fruit to make her cherry cookies, which I would snitch from wherever they were hidden.  Their tart-sweet flavor made my lips pucker, yet I crave those cookies every year.  I also crave these sweet rolls, which I serve for breakfast on Christmas morning.  Dried cherries are readily available, though a bit on the expensive side.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  1 1/4           cups  warm buttermilk -- (110 degrees)
  1           teaspoon  sugar -- plus
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3              large  eggs -- room temperature
                        Grated zest of one large orange
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  Alkermes
                        = (or cranberry liqueur)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  5               cups  unbleached all purpose flour - (to 5 1/4)
                        === MERINGUE TOPPING ===
  4              large  egg whites -- room temperature
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  sugar
                        Colored sprinkles

I make this dough in a stand mixer, but you can also do it by hand in a large bowl.  Dissolve the yeast in the buttermilk and stir in 1 teaspoon of the sugar.  Allow the mixture to sit for about 5 minutes.

On low speed with the paddle attachment, beat in the eggs one at a time until well blended; then beat in the zest, butter, Alkermes, salt, and remaining sugar until a smooth mixture is obtained.  Slowly beat in the flour, 1 cup at a time, until a ball of dough is formed and leaves the sides of the bowl.  The dough should feel soft and just slightly tacky on your hands.

Remove the dough from the bowl to a work surface lightly sprinkled with flour.  Knead the dough with your hands into a smooth, soft ball.  Put the dough in a bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap.  Let the dough rise about 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

When the dough looks risen, punch it down and knead it under the palm of your hands for about 3 or 4 minutes.  It should feel soft and not stick to your hands or the board.  If you need more flour, add it 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is the right consistency.  Just be careful not to add too much flour or the bread will have too tight a crumb and be dry.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Position the oven rack on the middle shelf.  Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.

Divide the dough in half and work with one half at a time.  Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface into a 26-inch-long rope.  Cut 4 inches off the rope and set aside.  Bring the two ends of the rope together to form a ring shape and place the dough on one of the baking sheets.  Cut the 4-inch piece in half and roll each piece into a 7-inch rope; make a cross with the two pieces of dough over the top of the circle.  Ironically, you will never see the cross on the bread once it is covered in meringue, but this is part of the symbolism of Easter.  Cover the dough and allow it to rise for 30 minutes.

Bake the loaves for 30 minutes or until it is almost done; use a cake skewer inserted in the dough to see if it is baked through.

Meanwhile, beat the egg whites on medium speed until they are foamy; add the salt, raise the speed to high and add the sugar in a steady stream and beat until the egg whites are fluffy and hold their peaks.

Remove the baking sheet from the oven and, working quickly with a rubber spatula, spread half of the meringue over the top and sides of the bread.  Sprinkle the colored candies over the meringue and return the bread to the oven.  Repeat the process with the remaining dough.  You may need to rewhip the remaining meringue just before spreading it on the second loaf.  Bake 10 minutes more or until the meringue is nicely browned.  Remove the bread from the oven and allow to cool completely.  Cut into thick slices for serving.

This bread is best eaten the day it is made, but will keep a day or two in the refrigerator, although the meringue may soften and settle.

This recipe yields 2 breads.

Comments:  This unusual and fun-to-make yeast bread looks more like a rustic cake with its baked meringue topping and covering of colored sprinkles.  It is part of an ancient Umbrian tradition that involves a young woman about to be married, presenting this cake to her fiance on Easter Sunday.  Alkermes liqueur, said to have its origins in the Renaissance, is the ingredient that turns the crumb a soft pink hue; it's made from cinnamon, cloves, sugar, and cochineal.  Alkermes is available in Italian specialty shops.  Use cranberry liqueur as a substitute.

<DirT>
I make this dough in a stand mixer, but you can also do it by hand in a large bowl.  Dissolve the yeast in the buttermilk and stir in 1 teaspoon of the sugar.  Allow the mixture to sit for about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On low speed with the paddle attachment, beat in the eggs one at a time until well blended; then beat in the zest, butter, Alkermes, salt, and remaining sugar until a smooth mixture is obtained.  Slowly beat in the flour, 1 cup at a time, until a ball of dough is formed and leaves the sides of the bowl.  The dough should feel soft and just slightly tacky on your hands.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the dough from the bowl to a work surface lightly sprinkled with flour.  Knead the dough with your hands into a smooth, soft ball.  Put the dough in a bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap.  Let the dough rise about 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the dough looks risen, punch it down and knead it under the palm of your hands for about 3 or 4 minutes.  It should feel soft and not stick to your hands or the board.  If you need more flour, add it 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is the right consistency.  Just be careful not to add too much flour or the bread will have too tight a crumb and be dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Position the oven rack on the middle shelf.  Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the dough in half and work with one half at a time.  Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface into a 26-inch-long rope.  Cut 4 inches off the rope and set aside.  Bring the two ends of the rope together to form a ring shape and place the dough on one of the baking sheets.  Cut the 4-inch piece in half and roll each piece into a 7-inch rope; make a cross with the two pieces of dough over the top of the circle.  Ironically, you will never see the cross on the bread once it is covered in meringue, but this is part of the symbolism of Easter.  Cover the dough and allow it to rise for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the loaves for 30 minutes or until it is almost done; use a cake skewer inserted in the dough to see if it is baked through.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, beat the egg whites on medium speed until they are foamy; add the salt, raise the speed to high and add the sugar in a steady stream and beat until the egg whites are fluffy and hold their peaks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the baking sheet from the oven and, working quickly with a rubber spatula, spread half of the meringue over the top and sides of the bread.  Sprinkle the colored candies over the meringue and return the bread to the oven.  Repeat the process with the remaining dough.  You may need to rewhip the remaining meringue just before spreading it on the second loaf.  Bake 10 minutes more or until the meringue is nicely browned.  Remove the bread from the oven and allow to cool completely.  Cut into thick slices for serving.

                 Country Breadsticks - {Grissini Rustici}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  aged provolone cheese -- minced
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- minced
  1              small  zucchini -- minced
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
  1             recipe  Straight Dough -- (see recipe)
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly grease four baking sheets with olive oil spray and set aside.

In a bowl, mix the cheese, prosciutto, zucchini, and salt together.  Set aside.

Punch down the risen dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.

Divide the dough in half.  Work with one half at a time, keeping the remaining dough covered with a towel or bowl.

On the lightly floured surface, roll one piece of dough out into a rough circle about 14 inches in diameter.  Brush the dough with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil.  Spread half the filling ingredients evenly over the dough.

Starting from the edge nearest you, roll the dough up like a jelly roll, tucking in the ends as you roll to keep the filling from falling out.  Pinch the seam closed.

Stretch the dough into a 14-inch log.  Cut the log into 14 pieces with a bench scraper or knife.

On the floured surface, roll each piece under the palms of your hands into a 10-inch-long stick.  Don't worry if some of the filling falls out -- just press it back into the dough.  Place the sticks on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them evenly.  Brush the tops of the sticks with some of the beaten egg.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the breadsticks are golden brown and shiny.  Remove the breadsticks to a cooling rack.  Meanwhile, repeat the shaping process with the remaining dough, oil, and filling.  When the first breadsticks are done, bake the second batch.

This recipe yields 28 breadsticks.

Comments:  When is a breadstick more than a breadstick?  When it's a knotty, puffy, shiny, irregular-looking stick flavored with bits of prosciutto, sharp provolone cheese, and zucchini.  These are great as an antipasto or a snack, or pack a handful for lunch instead of a sandwich!  For a party, stand them up in a country crock.  Or tie a bunch with a pretty ribbon and give as a gift from your kitchen.

       Country-Style Pizza With Olives - {Pizza Rustica Con Olive}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/2         pounds  all-purpose potatoes -- washed, peeled,
                        and cut into 1"-thick pieces
  2               cups  reserved potato-cooking water
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  reserved mashed potatoes
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  5               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 5 1/4)
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
                        additional for greasing sheet and dough
  2            bunches  scallions - (8 oz) -- washed, and
                        trimmed and cut into 1/4" slices
  4             ounces  colossal Cerignola olives - (abt 16) -- pitted and chopped
  1                cup  NiÁoise or Gaeta olives -- pitted and chopped
  1         tablespoon  diced jalapeÒo pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of black pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds
  2        tablespoons  grated Pecorino cheese

Place the potatoes in a saucepan, cover them with water, and bring to a boil.  Cook the potatoes until fork-tender; drain them and reserve 2 cups of the cooking water and allow to cool to lukewarm.  Mash the potatoes, reserving 1/2 cup for the dough and using the remaining potatoes as a side dish.

Pour the 2 cups reserved potato water into a large bowl or an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Stir in the yeast and allow the mixture to "proof" for 10 minutes, or get chalky looking with small bubbles on the surface.  Mix in the reserved mashed potatoes, salt, and olive oil.

Stir or mix in 1 cup of the flour at a time, mixing well after each addition.  Use only enough flour to create a ball of dough that winds around the dough hook if using an electric mixer or comes away from the sides of a bowl if doing this by hand.  The dough should be slightly tacky.  Resist the temptation to add too much flour.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise in a warm but not hot place (about 70 degrees) until it has doubled in size.

Heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a saute pan and when it is hot stir in the scallions.  Saute them until they become soft but not brown.  Stir in the olives and jalapeÒo pepper.  Add the salt, pepper, and oregano and saute for 2 or 3 minutes.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly grease or spray a baking sheet with olive oil and set aside.

Punch the dough down with your fist and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes.  Divide the dough in half and work with one piece at a time.  Roll the dough out into a 14- by 12-inch rectangle.  Transfer the dough to the baking sheet and lightly brush it with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Spread the olive mixture evenly over the dough to within 1/2 inch of the edges.

Roll out the second piece of dough and place it over the filling.  Seal the edges of the dough by folding the edges of the top dough over the edges of the bottom dough.  Brush the top of the dough with the beaten egg.  Sprinkle the sesame seeds evenly over the top, then sprinkle the cheese over the sesame seeds.  Make an X in the center of the top with a scissors.  Cover and let rise 20 minutes.

Bake the pizza for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the dough is nicely browned on the top and bottom.  Remove the pizza with a wide metal spatula to a cooling rack.  Cut into 2-inch squares while warm and serve.

This recipe yields 1 pizza for 8 servings.

Comments:  This savory two-crusted rustic pizza oozing with scallions and two kinds of olives is in answer to a request from viewer Donna Sakowski, who remembered her Italian grandmother making it.  What follows is my interpretation.  I like to serve it warm and cut into squares as an antipasto accompanied by wine.  It also makes a wonderful luncheon item with a salad of arugula, radicchio, and romaine lettuces.

Comments:  This savory two-crusted rustic pizza oozing with scallions and two kinds of olives is in answer to a request from viewer Donna Sakowski, who remembered her Italian grandmother making it.  What follows is my interpretation.  I like to serve it warm and cut into squares as an antipasto accompanied by wine.  It also makes a wonderful luncheon item with a salad of arugula, radicchio, and romaine lettuces.

Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  warm water - (110 115 degrees)
     1/4           cup  warm milk - (110 115 degrees)
  8        tablespoons  butter or margarine - (1 stick) -- softened
  7              large  eggs -- room temperature,
                        well beaten
  1                cup  freshly-grated Pecorino-Romano cheese - -- (5 oz)
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 7)

In a large bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water, and stir to dissolve.  Cover and let the yeast proof for about 10 minutes, or until foamy.

Add the milk to the yeast mixture, and whisk in the butter.  Whisk in the eggs, then add the cheese and pepper.  Add 6 1/2 cups flour, about a cup at a time, and mix with your hands until a soft ball of dough is formed, adding additional flour if necessary until the dough is no longer sticky.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes.

Generously grease a large bowl with olive oil, place the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat.  Cover the bowl with a towel and let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.

Punch down the dough and place it on a lightly floured work surface.  Knead it into a smooth ball.  Place the bread on a greased cookie sheet or in a greased tube pan and let rise for about 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Bake the crescia for 30 to 35 minutes, or until it is nicely browned.  If using a tube pan, let the crescia cool slightly, then carefully remove it to a cooling rack.  Serve the crescia warm, cut into slices.

This recipe yields 1 large round loaf.

Comments:  This recipe is from an old friend of my mother, Rena Petregani, who came from the village of Famo in the region of the Marches.  She prepared all the food for my mother's wedding over fifty years ago.  Crescia -- its name comes from the word for "to grow" -- is traditionally made for the Easter holiday and eaten with sausage.  This makes a beautiful ten-inch round bread.

                    Dandelion Souffle - {Spezzatelle}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  dandelions - (one large bunch) -- stemmed
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     3/4         pound  cubed lamb
  1           teaspoon  dried onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  dried garlic powder
  1                     tomato -- seeded and chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced rosemary
  4              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  crumbled goat cheese
  1                cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/2           cup  shredded mozzarella
  1                cup  reserved dandelion water -- kept hot

Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil.

Meanwhile clean the dandelions thoroughly by soaking them in several changes of cold water.  Drain them and add them to the pot of boiling water.  Cook the dandelions, uncovered, for about 5 minutes.  Drain them and set them aside.  Reserve 1 cup of the dandelion water and keep it hot.

In an ovenproof 3 1/2-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil and brown the meat.  Sprinkle the meat with the onion and garlic powders.  Add the tomato, parsley, and rosemary and cook for another 2 minutes.  Stir in the dandelions and turn off the heat.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a bowl whisk the eggs together, then whisk in the cheeses, one at a time, until the mixture is well blended and very thick.

Pour the egg and cheese mixture evenly over the top of the meat and dandelions.  Bake, uncovered, for 50 minutes, or until the top is nicely browned and puffed.

Remove the spezzatelle from the oven; it will collapse somewhat.  With a knife cut it into 4 to 6 wedges.  Use a large spoon to lift the wedges out of the pan and serve them in soup bowls.  Pour a little of the reserved dandelion broth over the top of each wedge and serve immediately.

Did you know that you can leach out the bitterness of dandelions and other bitter greens by plunging them in ice water after they have been cooked and allowing them to soak for 30 minutes before continuing with the recipe?

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Passing along the traditions of Italian food to the mext generation is very important to me and has been a distinguishing characteristic of Ciao Italia.  It is one of the reasons that I am sharing this little-known recipe for spezzatelle, a traditional wild dandelion dish from Foggia, in the region of Puglia, the heel of Italy's boot.  Resembling a souffle after it is baked, spezzatelle shows the French influence in Foggia.  The recipe was demonstrated for me by Grace Gallucci, an inspiring cook from Cleveland, Ohio, who learned how to make it from her mother Giovanina.  One of the peculiarities of this dish is the addition of garlic powder and dried onion powder, which, as Grace explains, are used so as not to overpower the taste of spezzatelle or be seen in the dish.  This came as a complete surprise to me since the region of Puglia is noted for cooking with lampasciuoli, a special type of wild onion.  Spring, when wild dandelions are plentiful, is the ideal time to make spezzatelle, but they are also available most of the year in supermarkets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  sweet red peppers - (abt 1 lb)
  2              large  sweet yellow peppers - (abt 1 lb)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             medium  onions -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced soppressata -- diced
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  fresh rosemary needles
                        Coarse salt -- for sprinkling
  1             recipe  basic bread dough

Preheat the broiler.  Lightly spray the broiler pan with olive oil spray.  Place the peppers on the pan so they are not touching one another and broil, turning them often with kitchen tongs, until they are blackened all over, 8 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, grill the peppers over a gas or charcoal grill.)

Transfer the peppers to a heavy paper bag, close the top of the bag, and let the peppers cool for about 20 minutes.

When the peppers are cool enough to handle, remove the cores, and peel away the skins.  With paper towels, wipe away the seeds -- do not rinse the peppers under running water to remove the seeds, or you will lose the flavorful juices.  Cut the peppers into thin strips and place them in a bowl with any juices.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a saute pan over medium-low heat.  Stir in the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft and glazed, about 5 minutes.  Raise the heat to high, stir in the vinegar, and simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated.  Add the onions to the bowl with the peppers.  Stir in the soppressata and salt, cover, and set aside.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Lightly spray two 16-inch pizza pans with olive oil spray and set aside.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces, and shape each piece into a ball.  Set 2 balls aside and cover them with a towel or bowl.

Roll one piece of dough into a 16 1/2-inch round.  Place the dough on one of the pizza pans.  Spread half the pepper mixture evenly over the dough.

Scatter half the rosemary needles over the work surface.  Place the second piece of dough on top of the rosemary and knead the needles into the dough.  Roll the dough out into a 16-inch round and place it over the pepper mixture.  Tightly seal the edges of the focaccia by folding the edges of the bottom dough up to meet the edges of the top dough and pinching the edges together to seal them.  Brush the top of the focaccia with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and sprinkle with coarse salt.  Using scissors, cut an X in the center of the top of the focaccia.

Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling ingredients.

Bake the focaccia for 25 to 30 minutes, until the top and bottom are browned.  Cool the focaccia slightly, then use scissors or a sharp knife to cut the focaccia into wedges.

This recipe yields two 16-inch focacce for 16 servings.

Comments:  Focaccia doppia, an elegant-looking and unusual two-crusted pizza, can serve as a hearty antipasto for an informal dinner party or become the centerpiece for lunch or dinner with a salad.

The savory filling of grilled sweet red and yellow peppers and soppressata salami, spicy sausage seasoned with pepper and cloves, is best made a few hours ahead so the flavors can mingle.  (Genoa salami, although milder in taste, can be substituted for soppressata.)  The focaccia can be assembled several hours in advance, covered with plastic wrap, and refrigerated until ready to bake.

For best results, use perforated pizza pans.  If you only want to bake one focaccia, wrap the second one in plastic wrap, then in aluminum foil, and freeze it for another time.

Bake the focaccia for 25 to 30 minutes, until the top and bottom are browned.  Cool the focaccia slightly, then use scissors or a sharp knife to cut the focaccia into wedges.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields two 16-inch focacce for 16 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Focaccia doppia, an elegant-looking and unusual two-crusted pizza, can serve as a hearty antipasto for an informal dinner party or become the centerpiece for lunch or dinner with a salad.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The savory filling of grilled sweet red and yellow peppers and soppressata salami, spicy sausage seasoned with pepper and cloves, is best made a few hours ahead so the flavors can mingle.  (Genoa salami, although milder in taste, can be substituted for soppressata.)  The focaccia can be assembled several hours in advance, covered with plastic wrap, and refrigerated until ready to bake.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For best results, use perforated pizza pans.  If you only want to bake one focaccia, wrap the second one in plastic wrap, then in aluminum foil, and freeze it for another time.

       Dried Fig And Anise Bread - {Pane Di Fichi Secchi Ed Anice}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  7 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- more or less
  5             ounces  dried Calamyrna figs - (abt 13 whole) -- stemmed
  1 1/2           cups  warm milk -- plus
  1         tablespoon  warm milk
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1 3/4      teaspoons  pure anise extract
  2              large  eggs -- slightly beaten
  1         tablespoon  wheat gluten
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar

Pour the water into a small bowl and stir in the yeast.  Stir in 1/2 cup of the flour to make a loose dough.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours or overnight; the dough will look spongy with lots of holes.

Place the figs in another bowl, cover them with water, and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour to soften them.  Drain the water, dry the figs and dice them.  Set aside.

When ready to make the dough, transfer the yeast mixture to the bowl of a large electric mixer.  Add the milk, reserving 1 tablespoon, then add the butter, sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the anise extract, eggs, wheat gluten, and salt to the bowl and combine the mixture on medium speed using the paddle attachment.  Begin adding the remaining flour 1 cup at a time and mix on high speed to allow the ingredients to combine.  Add only enough flour until the dough begins to come away from the side of the bowl and is not sticky on your hands.

Transfer the dough from the mixer to a lightly floured surface.  Push the dough down with your hands to flatten it.  Place the figs on top of the dough, then fold the dough over to cover the figs.  Knead the dough with your hands to evenly distribute the figs in the dough.  Shape the dough into a large round and place it in a lightly buttered large bowl.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise for 2 hours, or until it is double in size.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Punch the dough down with your hands and transfer it to a work surface.  With a knife divide the dough into two equal pieces and work with one piece at a time.  Roll each piece under the palm of your hands into a 46-inch rope.  Starting at one end of the rope, coil the dough up tightly and place it on one of the parchment paper-lined baking sheets.  Repeat with the second piece of dough.

Cover the baking sheets and allow the dough to rise for 20 minutes.

Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the crust is evenly browned on the top and bottom of the bread.  Use an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the dough to determine if the bread is cooked.  If the thermometer registers between 200 and 210 degrees, remove the bread to a cooling rack and cool until warm.

Meanwhile in a small bowl combine the confectioners' sugar, the remaining 1 tablespoon milk, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon anise extract.  Stir the ingredients together to make a glaze.  Use a spoon to drizzle the top of the breads with the glaze.  Serve the bread warm or at room temperature.

Note:  To freeze the bread, allow it to cool completely, then wrap it well in aluminum foil.

This recipe yields 2 loaves.

Comments:  I am keenly aware that a lot of people are afraid to work with yeast, so over the years we have made a lot of regional breads on the series to demystify the process.  A few years ago I wrote a book entitled "What You Knead," which took the novice bread baker step by step into breadmaking.  This recipe is easy to make and produces two wonderful loaves, and the whole process can be done in an electric mixer.  Start the dough early in the day, or the night before.  The wheat gluten used in this recipe is available by mail order or can be found in the baking section of some grocery stores.  Wheat gluten helps to develop a better-rising dough.  Be sure to use pure anise extract and not a weak, watered-down imitation.

        Dried Tomatoes In Olive Oil - {Pomodori Secchi Sott'Olio}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Italian
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  14                    unblemished meaty plum tomatoes -- washed and dried
  3               cups  red wine vinegar
  2                     twelve-ounce jars and lids -- sterilized
  8                     fresh basil leaves
  3        tablespoons  capers in salt -- rinsed and diced
  2        tablespoons  black peppercorns
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt
  2               cups  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 2 1/2) -- as needed

Core and cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise.

Place the tomatoes cut-side down in a dehydrator and dry according to the manufacturer's directions.  Or place cut-side down on wire racks set on baking sheets in a preheated 225 degrees oven.  Let dry until they have the texture of dried apricots.  This may take a day or longer, depending on the size of the tomatoes.

Pour the wine vinegar into a large nonreactive saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add the tomatoes and blanch them for 1 minute.  Remove the tomatoes with a slotted spoon and drain well.  The vinegar acts as a preservative and gives added flavor to the tomatoes.

Layer the tomatoes into the sterilized jars, adding half the basil, capers, peppercorns, and salt to each jar.  Slowly pour the olive oil into the jars, pressing down on the tomatoes slightly with a wooden spoon.  Make sure that the tomatoes are completely submerged under the oil at all times, or they will be exposed to air and potential bacteria growth.  Cap the jars tightly and place them in a cool spot overnight.  The next day, check the level of the oil and add more to the jars if the tomatoes are poking out of the oil.  Check the jars two or three more times, adding more oil if necessary.

Recap the jars and store them in a cool place for 6 weeks before using.  Refrigerate after opening and bring the tomatoes to room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields two 12-ounce jars.

Comments:  Dried tomatoes in olive oil have exquisite flavor, and what a gift to give yourself in the stillness of winter.  Plum or cherry tomatoes work best and the "putting up" should be done during gardening season when tomatoes are at peak flavor.  They store beautifully for months.  Use them diced as a sauce for pasta, in salads, and for antipasto.

                 Easter Dove Bread - {Colomba Di Pasqua}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm milk
     2/3           cup  sugar
  8        tablespoons  butter or margarine - (1 stick) -- melted
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  3              large  eggs -- room temperature
  3              large  egg yolks -- room temperature
  4 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 5)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              large  egg white -- slightly beaten
  1         tablespoon  turbinado (raw sugar)
                        = (or coarse brown sugar)

In the large bowl of an electric mixer, put the warm water and yeast and stir to dissolve.  Let the mixture proof for 10 minutes.  Add the milk, sugar, butter, lemon zest, vanilla, whole eggs, and egg yolks and beat on low speed to blend well.  Then beat on medium speed for 3 minutes.  Add 4 cups of the flour and the salt and beat on medium speed.  Gradually add the remaining flour a little at a time, until a soft dough is formed.  You may not need all the flour.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Place the dough in an oiled bowl.  Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Punch the dough down, divide it in half, and form 2 balls.  Place 1 ball width-wise on a greased baking sheet and gently flatten it into a cylinder 10 inches long and 5 inches thick.  Curve the dough slightly in the center.

Pat the other ball of dough into a triangle over the cylinder to form a T.  Twist the top third of the body to the right; pinch and shape to form the dove's head, neck, and beak.  Twist the bottom third to the left; pull and stretch it into a fan shape to form the tail.  With a scissors, cut deep slashes in the wings and tail to resemble feathers.

Cover the dove with a sheet of buttered waxed paper and a towel.  Let the bread rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 20 minutes.  Do not let it overrise or the shape will be lost in baking.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Gently brush the dove all over with the egg white and sprinkle the wing tips and tail section with the brown sugar.  Bake for about 50 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown.  Carefully transfer the bread to a rack to cool.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

Comments:  The Colomba is a sweet bread similar to panettone but it is shaped like a dove and made during Easter all over Italy, most of it commercially these days.  This bread along with many others was prepared on Good Friday and Holy Saturday, and eaten during Easter week.  The recipe has come down through the Galasso family.

In the large bowl of an electric mixer, put the warm water and yeast and stir to dissolve.  Let the mixture proof for 10 minutes.  Add the milk, sugar, butter, lemon zest, vanilla, whole eggs, and egg yolks and beat on low speed to blend well.  Then beat on medium speed for 3 minutes.  Add 4 cups of the flour and the salt and beat on medium speed.  Gradually add the remaining flour a little at a time, until a soft dough is formed.  You may not need all the flour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Place the dough in an oiled bowl.  Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Punch the dough down, divide it in half, and form 2 balls.  Place 1 ball width-wise on a greased baking sheet and gently flatten it into a cylinder 10 inches long and 5 inches thick.  Curve the dough slightly in the center.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pat the other ball of dough into a triangle over the cylinder to form a T.  Twist the top third of the body to the right; pinch and shape to form the dove&apos;s head, neck, and beak.  Twist the bottom third to the left; pull and stretch it into a fan shape to form the tail.  With a scissors, cut deep slashes in the wings and tail to resemble feathers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cover the dove with a sheet of buttered waxed paper and a towel.  Let the bread rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 20 minutes.  Do not let it overrise or the shape will be lost in baking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Gently brush the dove all over with the egg white and sprinkle the wing tips and tail section with the brown sugar.  Bake for about 50 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown.  Carefully transfer the bread to a rack to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 loaf.

Comments:  The Colomba is a sweet bread similar to panettone but it is shaped like a dove and made during Easter all over Italy, most of it commercially these days.  This bread along with many others was prepared on Good Friday and Holy Saturday, and eaten during Easter week.  The recipe has come down through the Galasso family.

                      Easter Dove Bread - {Colomba}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 7)
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  5              large  eggs -- plus
  4                     hard-boiled large eggs
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick) -- melted
  1 1/4           cups  milk -- or more as necessary
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  2                     whole cloves
                        Colored sprinkles

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease two cookie sheets.  On a piece of cardboard, make a template: Draw a dove that is 12 inches long from tail to beak and 7 inches across at its widest point.  Cut out the form with scissors.

Sift together 6 1/2 cups flour, the sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl.  In another bowl, whisk together 4 of the eggs, the butter, milk, and vanilla until well combined.  Add to the flour mixture and mix with your hands to form a ball of dough that is smooth and no longer sticky, adding more flour if necessary.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until it is smooth.  Divide the dough into 2 pieces.

Roll each piece of dough out into a 13- by 11-inch rectangle and transfer to the cookie sheets.  Place the template on each piece of dough and cut around it with a pastry wheel or small sharp knife.  Remove the scraps of dough.  With scissors, cut small Vs in the tails to resemble feathers.  Stick 1 clove in each head for the eyes.  Place 2 of the hard-boiled eggs side by side in the middle of each dove's body.  Cut 4 narrow 6-inch-long strips of dough from the dough scraps and cross 2 of them over each egg.

In a small bowl, lightly beat the remaining egg.  Brush the doves with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the colored sprinkles.

Bake the doves for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are lightly browned and firm to the touch.  Let them cool slightly on the cookie sheets before removing them to cooling racks.

This recipe yields 2 breads.

Comments:  Colomba is an Easter bread, shaped like a dove.  Regional versions are found all over Italy.  They may be "free-formed" by hand or baked in special dove-shaped molds.  Some have a cake-like texture, while those made with yeast have the consistency and texture of bread dough.  In this version, hard-boiled eggs are nestled in the dough before baking.  Place the doves in a colorful basket and use as a centerpiece on your Easter table.  They also make a nice Easter gift.  These can be frozen once completely cool, but the eggs will not be edible.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  6               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1 1/2           cups  ice water - (to 2)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === FILLING ===
  4           packages  frozen spinach - (10 oz ea) -- thawed, squeezed dry
     1/2           cup  freshly-greated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  3               cups  skim-milk ricotta cheese -- well drained
     3/4           cup  half-and-half
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh marjoram
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Olive oil -- for brushing
  8              large  eggs
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Pecorino-Romano or
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1                     egg yolk -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for egg wash

In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt together.  Add 1 1/2 cups ice water, a little at a time, and mix with your hands to form a rough ball of dough.  Add the olive oil and mix well.  Add just enough additional ice water to form a smooth ball; the dough should not be sticky.

Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead until very smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Divide the dough into 10 equal pieces.  Set aside, covered, on a floured surface.

In a bowl, mix the spinach with the Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Set aside.  In another bowl, mix the ricotta cheese with the half-and half, marjoram, and salt.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a 10- by 3-inch springform pan.  On a floured surface, roll one piece of the dough into a 12-inch circle.  Brush with a little olive oil, and place in the bottom of the springform pan.  Repeat with 4 more pieces of dough, brushing each one with a little olive oil.

Spread the spinach mixture evenly over the dough.  Spread the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the spinach.  Use the whole egg to make 8 shallow impressions in the ricotta, then carefully crack 1 egg into each impression.  Sprinkle the egg with salt and pepper and put 1/2 tablespoon of the butter on each one.  Sprinkle the Pecorino or Parmigiano cheese over the eggs.

One at a time, roll out the remaining 5 pieces of dough into 12-inch circles.  Carefully lay the circles over the eggs, letting the edges hang over the pan, and brush each one with olive oil.  Trim off the excess dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang.  Tuck the top layers of dough in around the edges of the pan and pinch to seal.  (At this point the pie can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated until ready to bake, or overnight.)

Two hours before serving time, brush the top of the torta with the egg wash.  Bake the pie for 1 hour or until the top is nicely browned.  Let cool to room temperature.

Release the sides of the springform pan and cut the torta into wedges.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     nine-inch-long eggplant -- washed, and
                        cut lengthwise into 1/4" thick slices
  1             medium  onion -- diced
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- diced
  8             ounces  angel hair pasta - (4 nests)
     1/4         pound  caciocavallo cheese -- diced
     1/2           cup  diced Dried Tomatoes In Olive Oil -- (see recipe)
     1/3           cup  diced pitted oil-cured black olives
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Lightly brush a 9- by 12-inch baking dish with olive oil and set aside.

Brush two baking sheets with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Lay the eggplant slices in single layers on the sheets.  Bake until soft enough to roll up, 10 to 12 minutes.  Do not let the slices brown or they will be too dry to roll.

Meanwhile, in a large saute pan over medium heat, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, then add the onion and prosciutto and cook, stirring, until the onion is soft and the prosciutto begins to brown.  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl.

Cook the angel hair according to the package directions.  Drain and add it to the onion mixture, tossing well.  Mix in the cheese, tomatoes, and olives and season with salt and pepper.

Divide the angel hair mixture evenly among the eggplant slices, spreading the mixture the length of the slices.  Roll each slice up like a jellyroll and place seam-side down in the prepared 9- by 12-inch baking dish.  Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake until the bundles are hot, 20 to 25 minutes.  Serve immediately.

Note:  Caciocavallo is a cow's milk cheese with a stringy consistency.  If unavailable, substitute provolone -- either sharp or mild.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Here is a good example of choosing the right pasta as a filling.  Strips of eggplant become the cylindrical container for neatly packaged angel hair pasta.  Involtini makes a great presentation on a buffet table, and can be prepared a day in advance.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly brush a 9- by 12-inch baking dish with olive oil and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush two baking sheets with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Lay the eggplant slices in single layers on the sheets.  Bake until soft enough to roll up, 10 to 12 minutes.  Do not let the slices brown or they will be too dry to roll.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, in a large saute pan over medium heat, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, then add the onion and prosciutto and cook, stirring, until the onion is soft and the prosciutto begins to brown.  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the angel hair according to the package directions.  Drain and add it to the onion mixture, tossing well.  Mix in the cheese, tomatoes, and olives and season with salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the angel hair mixture evenly among the eggplant slices, spreading the mixture the length of the slices.  Roll each slice up like a jellyroll and place seam-side down in the prepared 9- by 12-inch baking dish.  Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake until the bundles are hot, 20 to 25 minutes.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Caciocavallo is a cow&apos;s milk cheese with a stringy consistency.  If unavailable, substitute provolone -- either sharp or mild.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Here is a good example of choosing the right pasta as a filling.  Strips of eggplant become the cylindrical container for neatly packaged angel hair pasta.  Involtini makes a great presentation on a buffet table, and can be prepared a day in advance.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     fresh plum tomatoes - (1 1/4 lbs) -- washed
  1                cup  Italian parsley - (packed) -- leaves only
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 5)
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/3           cup  diced mostarda di frutta
                        = (or mixed candied fruit)
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 1/2)
  12                    small slices bread

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Core the tomatoes, cut them in half lengthwise, and squeeze out the seeds.  Or use the handle of a teaspoon to scrape out the seeds.

Spray a 12-inch baking dish with vegetable spray.  Place the tomato halves in the dish, cut-side up.  If the tomatoes do not sit level in the dish, shave a small amount off the bottom of the tomato with a small knife.

Put the parsley and garlic in the bowl of a food processor.  Grind the mixture until it is coarse.  With the motor running, add the olive oil, a little at a time, until a paste the consistency of pesto sauce is obtained.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the salt.

Fill the tomato cavities with some of the parsley mixture.

Bake the tomatoes, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they soften but hold their shape.  Remove the tomatoes from the oven and spread a little of the diced fruits over the top of each one.

While the tomatoes are baking, heat the olive oil in a saute pan and brown the bread slices on both sides.  Transfer them to a towel-lined dish.

Place each tomato half on a slice of the bread and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  One day while sitting in my friend Emma Berti's kitchen, I quizzed her about what she liked to cook.  Emma is Neapolitan by birth but lives near Florence.  I expected her to shower me with information about Neapolitan cooking when she said: "Let me show you my quick tomato sauce."  Out came a well-worn pan.  I expected the tomatoes, olive oil, and garlic to be next, but Emma surprised me when she poured milk into the pan and heated it, and then took a whole tube of tomato paste and squeezed it into the milk!  But for me the real triumph in her kitchen was the baked plum tomatoes stuffed with a parsley and garlic pesto, and topped with a dice of mostarda di frutta, a delicious mixture of such whole fruits as pears, cherries, and plums preserved in sugar syrup.  Mostarda di frutta con be found in Italian specialty shops or purchased by mail order.  If it is not available, substitute diced candied fruits.  Serve this dish warm as an antipasto.

Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Simply Sweet Dough -- (see recipe)
                        Cornmeal -- for sprinkling

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide the dough in half and set one half aside, covered with a towel or bowl.

Roll the dough out into a 12-inch circle.  Use a 3 1/2-inch round cutter to cut out circles, and place them on a clean kitchen towel.  Set the scraps aside and repeat with the remaining dough.  Gather the scraps together, roll out, and cut out more circles to make a total of 24.

Cover the dough circles with another towel.  Let them rise for 25 minutes.

Preheat an electric skillet to 350 degrees, or heat a cast-iron griddle.  When you are ready to cook the muffins, sprinkle a 1/2-inch deep bed of cornmeal over the bottom of the skillet or griddle.  Place 4 or 5 of the circles on the cornmeal, spacing them 1 inch apart to allow for expansion.  Cook them until nicely browned on the bottom and puffed, about 4 minutes.  Turn them over and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove the muffins to a cooling rack.  Repeat the process with the remaining dough circles.

Split the muffins with a fork or a knife, toast, and enjoy.  Any leftover muffins can be frozen, well wrapped, for future use.

This recipe yields 2 dozen muffins.

Comments:  These English muffins rise like puffy pillows as they cook in a dry hot electric frying pan or a griddle.  They have a delicate, subtle sweet taste that goes well with jam or butter.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dried white kidney beans
  1               head  escarole - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- leaves separated,
                        and well washed
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  red onion -- thinly sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  hot red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  8                     oil cured black olives -- pitted and minced
                        Toasted bread slices -- (optional)

Soak the beans overnight covered with water.  Next day drain the beans, put them in a pot, cover with water and cook them until the skins easily slip off.  Drain the beans and set aside.

Put the escarole in a large saute pan, cover the pan and wilt the leaves down.  Drain the escarole and squeeze out most of the water.  Coarsely chop it and set it aside.

In the same saute pan, heat the olive oil, add the onions and cook them over medium heat until they are very soft.  Stir in the garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper and the escarole, and continue to cook for three or four minutes.  Stir in the olives and the beans.

Serve hot as an accompaniment to meat or fish or serve as an antipasto over slices of toasted bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Creamy, white cannellini beans are everywhere in Tuscan cooking.  Made into smooth spreads for crostini, stuffed into vegetables, pureed into soups and added as fillers for salads, the bean is king in Tuscan kitchens.  Escarole and beans is an old recipe, once considered a poor dish that now finds it way onto the menus of upscale restaurants.  Use dried white kidney, Great Northern or borlotti beans for this energy packed dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPONGE ===
     1/2           cup  warm water
     1/4      teaspoon  dry active yeast
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  honey
                        === DOUGH ===
  1                cup  warm water - (110 degrees)
  1           teaspoon  dry active yeast
     1/3           cup  honey
  3              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted and cooled
  2          teaspoons  salt
  5 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 6)
     1/4           cup  chopped hazelnuts
     1/4           cup  chopped walnuts
  2        tablespoons  coarse brown sugar
                        = (turbinado or Demerara)

Early on the day you plan to make the bread, combine the sponge ingredients in a medium-size bowl.  Stir well.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set aside for 3 hours.  When the sponge is ready it will have increased three times in volume and look fluffy, with lots of small holes on the surface like the holes of a sponge.

To make the dough, in a heavy-duty mixer or food processor, combine the water, yeast, and honey and allow to proof for 5 minutes.  The mixture will look chalky.

On low speed, blend in all of the sponge mixture.

In a small bowl, lightly beat 2 of the eggs and add them to the yeast-sponge mixture.

On low speed, mix in the butter, salt, and 1 cup of the flour.  Increase the speed to medium and mix well.  Continue adding the flour 1 cup at a time, mixing each addition in well before adding the next.  You may not need all the flour.  When the dough begins to leave the sides of the bowl, increase the speed to high and beat for 4 minutes.  Feel the dough.  It should feel soft but not stick to your hands.  If it is too sticky, add a little more flour until it reaches the right consistency.

Remove the dough from the mixer or processor and knead it a few times on a work surface.  Spray a large bowl with vegetable or butter spray, place the dough in the bowl, and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap.  Allow the dough to rise for 3 hours.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a work surface.  Stretch it out with your hands.  Scatter the nuts over the dough, then fold the dough over several times to enclose the nuts.  Cut the dough in half with a knife and knead each piece into a tight ball about 5 inches in diameter.  Some of the nuts should be visible on the outside of the loaf.

Place each round on a lightly greased cookie sheet; cover each with a clean towel and allow the breads to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until nearly doubled in size.

Preheat the over to 375 degrees.

Lightly beat the remaining egg in a small bowl.  Brush each loaf with the beaten egg.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the coarse sugar over each loaf.

With a clean razor blade make an X incision about 3 inches long in the top of each loaf and fold back the four cuts.  This will allow for air to escape and prevent the loaves from splitting.

Bake the loaves until nicely browned on top and bottom, about 40 to 45 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 200 degrees when inserted in the center of the loaf.

Remove the loaves to a cooling rack.

Note:  These loaves freeze well if wrapped tightly in aluminum foil and then in heavy-duty plastic bags.

Variation:  Make four smaller loaves to give as kitchen gifts.  Wrap each loaf in clear cellophane and tie with a ribbon.

This recipe yields two 1 1/2-pound loaves.

Comments:  How wonderful the unexpected can be.  Such was the case with a visit to Montagnana, a town south of Padua, which bears witness to Venetian rule, when it was changed from a military outpost to an important trading center.  In the thirteenth century, the Da Carrara ruling family built the exquisite and beautifully preserved medieval walls that wrap around the town.  The remains of the ancient moat that also afforded protection are still visible as well.  Steeped in tradition, Montagnana is known for its palio, a horse race held since the fourteenth century, and for its delicate prosciutto, along with a very special bread.  Legend states that one Ezzelino III da Romano, who was the emperor's vicar in Italy and a skillful soldier, saved the town from a great fire but in doing so was badly injured.  A country woman make a dough with leva, a natural yeast, to which she added lots of honey, walnuts, and hazelnuts from her orchard, and made a sweet bread that restored the health and strength of Ezzelino.  The recipe that follows is an adaptation of pandolce di Ezzelino, the sweet bread that is synonymous with Montagnana.  Today it is made and sold by Giorgio Cuccato, owner of Pasticerria Cuccato, Via Porta 64.  With his father, Bruno, Giorgio has researched the history of this recipe for which the citizens of Montagnana are deeply grateful.  The life of this bread begins with a sponge or starter made from a little yeast, flour, and honey that is left to rise for 3 hours.  The sponge helps the dough to rise beautifully.

Early on the day you plan to make the bread, combine the sponge ingredients in a medium-size bowl.  Stir well.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set aside for 3 hours.  When the sponge is ready it will have increased three times in volume and look fluffy, with lots of small holes on the surface like the holes of a sponge.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the dough, in a heavy-duty mixer or food processor, combine the water, yeast, and honey and allow to proof for 5 minutes.  The mixture will look chalky.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On low speed, blend in all of the sponge mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, lightly beat 2 of the eggs and add them to the yeast-sponge mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On low speed, mix in the butter, salt, and 1 cup of the flour.  Increase the speed to medium and mix well.  Continue adding the flour 1 cup at a time, mixing each addition in well before adding the next.  You may not need all the flour.  When the dough begins to leave the sides of the bowl, increase the speed to high and beat for 4 minutes.  Feel the dough.  It should feel soft but not stick to your hands.  If it is too sticky, add a little more flour until it reaches the right consistency.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the dough from the mixer or processor and knead it a few times on a work surface.  Spray a large bowl with vegetable or butter spray, place the dough in the bowl, and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap.  Allow the dough to rise for 3 hours.
</DirT>

                     Fava Bean Casserole - {Scafata}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  shelled fava beans - (abt 2 lbs unhulled)
                        = (or lima beans)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped
  1                     carrot -- chopped
  1              pound  Swiss chard -- stemmed, washed,
                        and torn into pieces
  1              pound  plum tomatoes -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into coarse pieces
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
     1/2           cup  diced black oil-cured olives

Put the fava beans in a saucepan, cover them with water, and, if they are large, boil them for about 6 minutes or just until the outer skin slips away easily from the bean when pressed between your fingers.  If the beans are small, cook them about 4 minutes.  Drain and refresh them under cold water.  If the beans are large, remove the outer skin.  Set the beans aside.

Heat the olive oil in a large 12- or 14-inch saute pan.  Stir in the onion, celery, and carrot, and cook the mixture until the vegetables begin to soften.  Stir in the fava beans and Swiss chard.  Cover the pan and allow the mixture to simmer for 20 minutes.  Uncover and stir in the tomatoes.  Cover and cook an additional 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the salt, pepper, and olives.

Serve hot as a vegetable side dish or a luncheon dish accompanied by good coarse bread.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Scafata means hull and in this recipe refers to hulling or removing the outer skin of fresh fava beans.  Doing this reveals a creamy bean similar in appearance to fresh lima beans.  If fava beans are small, this step can be eliminated.  Prepared the Umbrian way, fava beans are cooked with Swiss chard and fresh tomatoes for a nutrition-packed, unpretentious dish.

         Fennel And Pork Calzones - {Finocchio E Porco Calzones}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  ground pork butt
  1              large  onion -- minced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     celery ribs -- minced
  1                     carrot -- minced
  1                     sweet yellow or red pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and diced
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds
     1/2           cup  tomato sauce
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             recipe  Straight Dough -- (see recipe)
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
                        Sesame seeds -- for sprinkling

In a saute pan, brown the pork in its own fat, along with the onion and garlic.  Pour off the fat.

Add the celery, carrot, sweet pepper, and fennel and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft; the mixture is fairly dry.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the tomato sauce.  Season with salt and pepper.  Set the mixture aside to cool while you roll out the dough.

Punch down the dough, then turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces.  Work with one piece at a time, keeping the remaining dough covered with a towel.

Roll each piece out on the floured surface into a 6- to 7-inch round.  Spread about 1/3 cup of the filling over one half of each round.  Fold the dough over the filling to form a turnover or half-moon shape, and crimp and seal the edges with a fork dipped in flour.

Place the calzones at least 1 inch apart on baking sheets that have been sprayed with olive oil spray.  Brush the tops of the calzones with the beaten egg and sprinkle sesame seeds over the tops.  With scissors, cut a small X in the center of each calzone.  Allow the calzones to rise for 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Bake the calzones for 25 to 30 minutes, until they are golden brown on the top and bottom.  Remove them from the baking sheets with a wide spatula and let them cool slightly on cooling racks.  these are best eaten warm.

This recipe yields 12 calzones.

Comments:  A calzone is a turnover, a half-moon shape that is as popular in Italy as pizza.  But unlike a pizza, which ports its toppings, a calzone tempts us with a filling inside.  Calzones, like pizza, have an infinite variety of fillings.

One of my favorites has always been these calzones stuffed with fennel-flavored ground pork.  They make perfect eating anytime, from picnics to Sunday night supper.  Ask the butcher to grind pork butt for the sausage; it is more flavorful than the often-used pork shoulder.

                Flat Bread On A Stone - {Torta Sul Testo}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  2           packages  fresh or frozen spinach - (10 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- sliced, and
                        cut in thin strips
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === DOUGH ===
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1              large  egg
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  6        tablespoons  grated Pecorino-Romano cheese
                        Warm water -- as needed

To make the filling, if using fresh spinach, trim and wash it thoroughly, but do not drain.  Place the spinach in a large pot, cover, and cook over medium-high heat until the spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes.  Drain well and squeeze out the excess liquid.  Chop fine.  If using frozen spinach, cook as directed on the package, drain, and squeeze out the excess liquid.  Chop fine.

In a frying pan, heat the olive oil.  Add the prosciutto and saute it until it just begins to brown.  Add the spinach and a good grinding of black pepper and mix well.  Set aside.

To make the dough, in a large bowl, mix the flour and baking soda together.  In another bowl, beat the egg, olive oil, and cheese together.  Add to the flour mixture and stir to blend well.  Add the warm water 2 tablespoons at a time, mixing with your hands until a smooth dough is formed.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes.  Divide the dough into 6 pieces and roll out each piece into a 6-inch circle; set aside on a floured surface.

Heat a cast-iron griddle or an electric frying pan until hot.  Prick the dough pieces all over with a fork and then make light overlapping circle imprints all over each piece with a small glass.  These marks are decorative, but they also speed the cooking process.  Place 1 or 2 of the breads on the griddle or in the hot pan; do not cook more than 2 at a time.  Cook until the breads have browned slightly on the bottom, about 3 to 4 minutes, then turn them over and brown them on the other side.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.  Repeat with the remaining pieces.

Cut each torta into 4 wedges.  Divide the filling evenly among 12 of the wedges and top with the remaining wedges to make sandwiches.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 rounds, or 12 small sandwiches.

Comments:  When I was in Umbria, in central Italy, I learned the ancient way of making simple peasant bread on a stone, or testo.  The bread is shaped into a flat round, like a small pizza, and then cooked on a hot stone.  You can achieve the same results by cooking the bread on a hot griddle or in an electric frying pan.  Here the bread is cut into wedges and filled with a savory spinach mixture to make little sandwiches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BESCIAMELLA SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2               cups  hot whole milk
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
                        === SPINACH ===
  2           packages  fresh spinach - (10 oz ea) -- washed and stemmed

  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4           cup  grated Pecorino cheese

Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.  Whisk in the flour to make a smooth paste.  Slowly whisk in the milk and cook the mixture over medium heat until it thickens on the back of a spoon.  Remove from the heat and stir in the salt and pepper.  Cover and set aside.  (Makes 2 cups)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cook the spinach in a large pot without any additional water.  When it is wilted, drain it and squeeze it dry.  Heat the olive oil in a saute pan, add the garlic and the spinach and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, for 3 or 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in 1/2 cup of the besciamella sauce and transfer the mixture to a 9-inch Pyrex baking dish.

Spoon the remaining sauce over the top of the spinach and sprinkle the top with the cheese.

Bake about 15 minutes or until the mixture is hot and the cheese has browned.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Anything alla fiorentina, meaning Florentine style usually signifies that there is spinach in the dish.  In this preparation a white sauce, besciamella, provides added richness

                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  2                     eggs
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     2/3           cup  milk
                        Grated zest of 2 oranges

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Lightly butter a 7 1/2- by 11 1/2-inch glass lasagne pan or similar pan and set aside.

Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder.  Set aside.

In a separate bowl with a hand mixer, beat together the eggs and sugar until thick and foamy.  On low speed, beat in the olive oil and milk.  Stir in the orange zest.

On low speed, beat the flour mixture into the egg mixture until the batter becomes smooth.  It will be the consistency of pancake batter.

Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the cake springs back when touched with your finger.

Remove the pan to a cooling rack and cool completely.

Turn the cake out onto a serving dish.  Cut into squares or other shapes.  This cake is delicious as is, but for a festive look, sprinkle the top completely with confectioners' sugar.  Also try the cake topped with fresh fruit.

This recipe yields 1 cake.

Comments:  This easy-to-prepare schiacciata (flat cake) from Florence has an interesting, moist texture, and pleasant orange taste.  As the name implies, this cake is only about 1/2-inch high after it bakes.  Cut it into squares or rounds, or use cookie cutters for a more festive look.

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  fresh thyme leaves
     1/4           cup  fresh tarragon leaves
     1/4           cup  fresh parsley leaves
  2        tablespoons  fresh basil leaves
  2              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  coarse sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1             recipe  Nonna's Sponge Dough -- (see recipe)

Place all the herbs and the garlic in a pile on a cutting board and finely mince them.  Place the mixture in a small bowl, stir in the olive oil, salt, and pepper and mix well.  Cover the bowl and let the mixture sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Lightly grease four large baking sheets.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide the dough in half.

Roll one half of the dough into a 14-inch round.  Spread half the herb mixture evenly over the surface of the dough.  Sprinkle with half the cheese.  Roll up tightly like a jellyroll, and pinch the seam closed.  Roll the dough under your palms into a 16-inch-long log.  Cut the log into 8 pieces.  Knead each piece on the floured surface until the herbs are evenly distributed throughout the dough.  Roll each piece into a 6-inch round.  Place the focaccine on the greased baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between each one.  Cover with a clean towel and let rise for 20 minutes.  Repeat the process with the remaining dough, herb mixture, and cheese.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Bake the focaccine, in two batches, for 25 to 30 minutes, until they are golden brown.  Cool the focaccine briefly on a cooling rack.  Serve warm.

Note:  These can be frozen after they're cooled completely.  Wrap each one individually in aluminum foil and put in plastic bags.  When ready to use, defrost, unwrapped, and heat in a preheated 325 degrees oven for 5 minutes.

This recipe yields sixteen 6-inch rounds.

Comments:  Focaccia, a type of thin, crispy pizza, wears a different topping from one place to another in Italy.  The more common focacce are sparsely covered with nothing more than a brushing of olive oil, slivers of garlic, and a dash of salt.  These small versions, called focaccine, are rounds of dough speckled with a fine paste (battuto) or herbs, garlic, and olive oil.  Accompanied by an assortment of cheeses, these make an ideal antipasto to be served with wine.  They are equally satisfying as picnic food, and the perfect snack.

Place all the herbs and the garlic in a pile on a cutting board and finely mince them.  Place the mixture in a small bowl, stir in the olive oil, salt, and pepper and mix well.  Cover the bowl and let the mixture sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly grease four large baking sheets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide the dough in half.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll one half of the dough into a 14-inch round.  Spread half the herb mixture evenly over the surface of the dough.  Sprinkle with half the cheese.  Roll up tightly like a jellyroll, and pinch the seam closed.  Roll the dough under your palms into a 16-inch-long log.  Cut the log into 8 pieces.  Knead each piece on the floured surface until the herbs are evenly distributed throughout the dough.  Roll each piece into a 6-inch round.  Place the focaccine on the greased baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between each one.  Cover with a clean towel and let rise for 20 minutes.  Repeat the process with the remaining dough, herb mixture, and cheese.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the focaccine, in two batches, for 25 to 30 minutes, until they are golden brown.  Cool the focaccine briefly on a cooling rack.  Serve warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  These can be frozen after they&apos;re cooled completely.  Wrap each one individually in aluminum foil and put in plastic bags.  When ready to use, defrost, unwrapped, and heat in a preheated 325 degrees oven for 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields sixteen 6-inch rounds.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Focaccia, a type of thin, crispy pizza, wears a different topping from one place to another in Italy.  The more common focacce are sparsely covered with nothing more than a brushing of olive oil, slivers of garlic, and a dash of salt.  These small versions, called focaccine, are rounds of dough speckled with a fine paste (battuto) or herbs, garlic, and olive oil.  Accompanied by an assortment of cheeses, these make an ideal antipasto to be served with wine.  They are equally satisfying as picnic food, and the perfect snack.

              Four Seasons Pizza - {Pizza Quattro Stagioni}

Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOPPINGS ===
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  white or Spanish onions -- thinly sliced
  6        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  4                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  2               cans  artichoke hearts - (14 oz ea) -- drained, and
                        thinly sliced
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  diced pitted oil-cured black olives
     1/2           cup  diced green olives in brine
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced seeded sweet red peppers
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced seeded sweet yellow peppers
  2             medium  plum tomatoes -- sliced
     1/2         pound  fresh mozzarella cheese -- sliced
  4                     fresh basil leaves -- shredded
  1             recipe  Straight Dough -- (see recipe)

In a medium skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until they are browned and glazed.  Raise the heat to high, splash in the vinegar, and stir until the vinegar evaporates.  Remove the onions to a small bowl and set aside.

Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the skillet and the shallots, and cook until soft.  Stir in the artichoke hearts and salt and pepper and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove the mixture to a small bowl.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  If using a baking stone, place it on the lowest oven rack to preheat.  Alternatively, lightly spray two 14-inch pizza pans with olive oil spray and set aside.  Line a baker's peel (or two peels, if you have them) with parchment paper or sprinkle heavily with cornmeal.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide it in half.  Set half of the dough aside, covered with a damp towel.

Pinch off a piece of dough the size of a tangerine and set it aside.  Roll the rest of the dough out to a 14-inch round.

Place the dough on the baker's peel or a baking sheet.  Divide the tangerine-size piece of dough in half and with the palms of your hands, roll each piece into a 14-inch rope.  Cross the two ropes over the top of the dough, dividing it into quarters.

Spread half the onions over one quarter of the dough.  Spread half the shallots and artichokes over the second quarter.  Press half the black and green olives gently into the dough in the third quarter, and spread half the strips of red and yellow peppers over the olives.  Arrange half of the tomato slices and cheese in the last quarter and sprinkle with half the basil.  Drizzle the top of the pizza with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Repeat the process with the remaining dough and toppings.

If using a baking stone, slide one pizza onto the stone, with the parchment paper if you used it, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the top is golden brown and the bottom crust is browned and crisp.  Bake the second pizza as soon as the first one is done.  If using pizza pans, bake the pizzas for 25 to 30 minutes.

Cut the pizzas into wedges with scissors and serve hot.

This recipe yields two 14-inch pizzas for 12 to 16 servings.

Comments:  The name of this pizza, quattro stagioni (four seasons), should tell you that it is as much fun to make as it is to eat.  There are many versions of this compartmentalized pizza to be found in Italy, and the toppings vary widely because it is made with whatever ingredients happen to be on hand.  This one evokes the seasons with everything from spring artichokes and summer tomatoes to pungent fall olives and winter onions.  I like to bake this on a preheated baking stone, but conventional pizza pans are fine, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 3/4           cups  very warm water -- (100 to 115 degrees)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  active dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 4 1/2)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  6               cups  vegetable oil - (to 8) -- for frying
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2         pound  Swiss chard
  6              large  eggs
  1                cup  grated ricotta salata
                        = (or Pecorino-Romano cheese)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cups  tomato sauce

To make the dough, place the warm water in a large bowl and add the yeast.  Mix well and let rest, covered, for 10 minutes.  Add the sugar and olive oil and mix again.

In a separate bowl, mix 4 cups of the flour with the salt and add it gradually to the yeast mixture.  Mix well with your hands until you have a ball of dough.  Add additional flour if the dough seems sticky.  Turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead it until smooth.

Lightly grease a bowl with a little oil and add the dough.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.

Preheat the broiler.

Wash and stem the Swiss chard.  Place it in a skillet with about 1 1/2 cups water.  Cover the skillet and cook until the chard is limp, about 6 minutes.  Drain the chard well in a colander.  Let cool 5 to 10 minutes, then squeeze dry with your hands and cut it into thin strips and set aside.

In a separate bowl, mix the eggs gently with a whisk.  Add the chard, ricotta, and pepper; blend gently.

In a 12-inch ovenproof frying pan, heat the butter and olive oil until hot.  Pour in the egg mixture and cook the frittata until it has set on the underside.  Place the frying pan under the broiler and broil until the eggs set on top.  Remove the pan from the broiler and invert the frittata onto a wood board; let frittata cool.  Cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips about 2 inches long and set aside.

Punch the dough down and knead for a few minutes on a lightly floured surface.  Divide the dough into 18 pieces and roll each out with a rolling pin into a 5-inch circle.  Lay a few strips of the frittata in the center and fold the dough over to make a turnover.  Press the edges closed with a fork.  Place them on a clean towel.

In a deep-fryer, heat the oil to 375 degrees.  Add a few of the turnovers at a time and fry until golden brown.  Drain on brown paper.

Variation:  Eliminate making the dough and place wedges of frittata between slices of good bread.

This recipe yields 18 sandwiches.

Comments:  Making sandwiches for my school lunchbox was Grandma Galasso's domain, but peanut butter sandwiches were very rare.  Instead I could look forward to this elaborate egg sandwich, flecked with pieces of Swiss chard and salty cheese.  It began as a frittata made with eggs and ricotta salata.  After the frittata was cooked and cooled, it was cut into pieces and placed in a yeast dough.  If eaten at home, it was topped with fresh tomato sauce.  For school lunches, pieces were sandwiched between bread slices.  If you can't find ricotta salata, substitute Pecorino Romano cheese.

           Fried Zucchini Flowers - {Fiori Di Zucchini Fritti}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  zucchini blossoms
  6               cups  peanut oil - (to 7)
                        Flour -- for dredging
  4              large  eggs -- beaten
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Open the centers of the flowers gently, remove the pistils and stigmas, and discard.  Put the flowers in a bowl of ice water for 1 hour.

Heat the oil to 375 degrees in a deep-fryer or heavy pot.

Dry the blossoms on paper towels; roll each in the flour and then the eggs.  Fry the blossoms in oil until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain on brown paper, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  It is common in outdoor markets in Italy to see carts of bright yellow-orange zucchini blossoms.  They bring a tinge of nostalgia for me, because the blossoms were a familiar sight in our kitchen.  I usually run to my garden when zucchini are plentiful and gather an apron full of blossoms.  I don't know anyone with zucchini plants who, by mid-summer, would not love to give away same blossoms.

               Garlic And Oil Sauce - {Salsa Aglio E Olio}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta
                Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/3           cup  minced fresh Italian parsley leaves
  12            ounces  spaghetti or linguine
                        Freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or
                        Pecorino cheese -- (optional)

Heat the olive oil slowly in a saute pan over low heat and when it begins to shimmer, add the garlic and cook gently until it becomes soft but not brown, about 2 minutes.  Turn off the heat, stir in the salt and parsley, and cover the pan.

Cook the pasta as directed and drain, reserving 1/3 cup of the cooking water.  Add the water to the garlic and oil and stir to blend.  Quickly mix in the cooked pasta.  Transfer the pasta to a platter or bowl and serve immediately with a sprinkling of cheese if desired.

Note:  To have parsley on hand when you need it, wash and dry a large bunch.  Take the leaves off the stems.  Discard the stems and mince the leaves with a chef's knife.  Wrap the parsley in paper towels, place in airtight sandwich bags, and freeze.  Take out what you need as you need it.  This saves having to throw out unused parsley that wilts and dries out in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 1 cup.

Comments:  When there is no time to cook, I resort to this garlic-and-olive-oil sauce for spaghetti or linguine.  With all the ingredients on hand, this can be ready in less than 10 minutes, just enough time to boil the pasta.  Use a fruity extra virgin olive oil for its intense flavor and cook the garlic slowly in it so it does not brown.

                  Garlic In Vinegar - {Aglio Sott'Aceto}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     fresh garlic bulbs - (to 3) -- separated into
                        cloves, peeled, and left whole
  1             gallon  white cider vinegar
                        = (or white wine vinegar)
                        Fresh whole basil leaves -- stemmed, wiped dry
  1              Whole  peppercorns -- as needed
  1              Whole  coriander seeds -- as needed
                        Coarse Kosher salt -- as needed
  4                     one-quart bottles

Use dark bottles to prevent light from turning the garlic dark.  Make as many as you like, putting at least six garlic cloves in each bottle with 2 to 4 fresh basil leaves, 8 to 10 peppercorns, 1 teaspoon of coriander seeds, and 1 teaspoon of salt.  Fill to the top with vinegar and cap.  Shake the bottles occasionally; store in a cool, dark spot.  The vinegar is ready to use in 4 weeks.

Use smaller decorative bottles to make customized "presents" to share with family and friends.  Use the vinegar to sprinkle on boiled meats, in potato salads and green salads, vegetable dishes, and for deglazing pans.

Note:  Vinegar has a symbolic meaning to Italians, too.  They use the phrase un segreto dell'aceto (a vinegar secret) to mean keeping a secret.  The implication is that when you have a taste of vinegar, it is difficult to talk and the secret is secure.

This recipe yields 4 one-quart bottles.

Comments:  By immersing fresh garlic cloves in good vinegar, they become milder in flavor and are good to use when you want a whiff of garlic in a dish, not a pungent reminder.  The success of this preparation depends on garlic that is not too old.  Look for tight knobs with no splits, soft spots, or sprouts growing from the knob.  Garlic grown in home gardens is best "cured" after harvesting, which means to tie the bunches together and hang them in a dry, dark place until the papers crackle.  This vinegar and garlic combination will be ready to use in four weeks.  In Tuscany, garlic flavored vinegar is used with boiled meats.

Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1 1/2         pounds  all-purpose potatoes -- washed, peeled,
                        and cut into 1"-thick pieces
  2               cups  reserved potato-cooking water
  1            package  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  reserved mashed potatoes
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  5               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 5 1/4)
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2         pound  Gorgonzola dolce cheese -- rind removed,
                        cut into small pieces
  1                cup  sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil -- drained, and
                        cut into small pieces

Place the potatoes in a saucepan, cover them with water, and bring to a boil.  Cook the potatoes until fork-tender; drain them and reserve 2 cups of the cooking water and allow to cool to lukewarm.

Mash the potatoes, reserving 1/2 cup for the dough and using the remaining potatoes as a side dish.

Pour the 2 cups reserved potato water into a large bowl or an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Stir in the yeast and allow the mixture to "proof" for 10 minutes, or get chalky looking with small bubbles on the surface.  Mix in the reserved mashed potatoes, salt, and olive oil.

Stir or mix in 1 cup of the flour at a time, mixing well after each addition.  Use only enough flour to create a ball of dough that winds around the dough hook if using an electric mixer or comes away from the sides of a bowl if doing this by hand.  The dough should be slightly tacky.  Resist the temptation to add too much flour.

Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise in a warm but not hot place (about 70 degrees) until it has doubled in size.

Punch the dough down with your fist and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes.  Divide the dough in half.  Work with one piece at a time and roll the dough into a 12- or 13-inch circle.  Transfer the dough to a pizza pan or a parchment-lined peel if baking the pizza on a baking stone.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees if baking the pizza on pizza pans, or preheat the oven to 425 degrees if using baking stones and do this 30 minutes prior to baking.  (If you only have one stone, bake one pizza at a time.)

Distribute half of the cheese over the surface of the pizza and sprinkle on half of the tomatoes.

Repeat the steps with the second piece of dough.  Cover the pizze with clean towels and allow them to again rise for about 25 minutes.

If using a baking stone slide the pizza from the peel with the parchment paper and bake until the underneath crust is golden brown and the edges of the pizza have started to brown, about 30 minutes.  Remove the pizza from the oven with the peel and allow to cool for a few minutes.  Cut the pizza with a scissors and serve hot.

Bake the second pizza on the stone as above.

If using pizza pans, bake one on the bottom rack and one on the middle rack, alternating the positions halfway through the cooking process.  This should take about 30 to 35 minutes altogether.

Remove the pizze from the oven, cut them, and serve as above.

Note:  If you want to bake only one pizza, use only half the topping ingredients called for and freeze the remaining dough in a heavy-duty plastic bag for up to 6 months.

This recipe yields 2 pizzas.

Comments:  Those who dismiss blue-veined Gorgonzola cheese as too pungent and smelly have not eaten this cheese at its best.  Made since the Middle Ages in the town for which it is named, Gorgonzola can be piccante (sharp) or dolce (sweet).  The sharper version is firmer in consistency and a straw color.  It is made from combining two curds.  Gorgonzola dolce is creamy white in texture and color, spreadable, and made from one curd.  This pizza with Gorgonzola dolce and sun-dried tomatoes has become one of my husband's favorites.  It is a culinary marriage of the region of Lombardia's famous cheese combined with the intense flavor of Campania's dried plum tomatoes in olive oil.  Just these two ingredients blanketed over an airy pizza dough made from flour, yeast, and potato water results in a masterpiece.  Start thinking about making this pizza the next time you boil potatoes.  Save the water used to boil the potatoes and 1/2 cup of the mashed potatoes to make the dough.  The taste and texture of this dough is so wonderful that it will become a favorite in your house as well.  Baking this pizza on a baking stone results in a crispier crust.  The baking stone should be preheated for at least 30 minutes before baking.

Use only enough flour to create a ball of dough that winds around the dough hook if using an electric mixer or comes away from the sides of a bowl if doing this by hand.  The dough should be slightly tacky.  Resist the temptation to add too much flour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise in a warm but not hot place (about 70 degrees) until it has doubled in size.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Punch the dough down with your fist and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes.  Divide the dough in half.  Work with one piece at a time and roll the dough into a 12- or 13-inch circle.  Transfer the dough to a pizza pan or a parchment-lined peel if baking the pizza on a baking stone.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees if baking the pizza on pizza pans, or preheat the oven to 425 degrees if using baking stones and do this 30 minutes prior to baking.  (If you only have one stone, bake one pizza at a time.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Distribute half of the cheese over the surface of the pizza and sprinkle on half of the tomatoes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Repeat the steps with the second piece of dough.  Cover the pizze with clean towels and allow them to again rise for about 25 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If using a baking stone slide the pizza from the peel with the parchment paper and bake until the underneath crust is golden brown and the edges of the pizza have started to brown, about 30 minutes.  Remove the pizza from the oven with the peel and allow to cool for a few minutes.  Cut the pizza with a scissors and serve hot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the second pizza on the stone as above.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If using pizza pans, bake one on the bottom rack and one on the middle rack, alternating the positions halfway through the cooking process.  This should take about 30 to 35 minutes altogether.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the pizze from the oven, cut them, and serve as above.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  If you want to bake only one pizza, use only half the topping ingredients called for and freeze the remaining dough in a heavy-duty plastic bag for up to 6 months.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 pizzas.

Comments:  Those who dismiss blue-veined Gorgonzola cheese as too pungent and smelly have not eaten this cheese at its best.  Made since the Middle Ages in the town for which it is named, Gorgonzola can be piccante (sharp) or dolce (sweet).  The sharper version is firmer in consistency and a straw color.  It is made from combining two curds.  Gorgonzola dolce is creamy white in texture and color, spreadable, and made from one curd.  This pizza with Gorgonzola dolce and sun-dried tomatoes has become one of my husband&apos;s favorites.  It is a culinary marriage of the region of Lombardia&apos;s famous cheese combined with the intense flavor of Campania&apos;s dried plum tomatoes in olive oil.  Just these two ingredients blanketed over an airy pizza dough made from flour, yeast, and potato water results in a masterpiece.  Start thinking about making this pizza the next time you boil potatoes.  Save the water used to boil the potatoes and 1/2 cup of the mashed potatoes to make the dough.  The taste and texture of this dough is so wonderful that it will become a favorite in your house as well.  Baking this pizza on a baking stone results in a crispier crust.  The baking stone should be preheated for at least 30 minutes before baking.

           Gracie's Pepper Rolls - {Panini Di Pepe Alla Grazia}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  active dry yeast - (2 pkgs)
  2 1/2           cups  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  anise seeds
  6 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 7)
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for egg wash
                        Sesame seeds -- as needed

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water.  Let proof until the yeast is foamy, about 10 minutes.  Add the oil, salt, pepper, and anise seeds.  Add the flour about 1 cup at a time, mixing it with your hands, until a ball is formed; you may not need all the flour.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until elastic, 10 to 15 minutes.  Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let rise in a warm draft-free place for about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease 2 baking sheets.

Punch the dough down.  Break off 2-inch pieces of dough and shape them into round rolls.  Place them 2 inches apart on the baking sheets and brush the tops with the egg wash.  Sprinkle the tops with sesame seeds.  Cover loosely with clean towels and let rise for 20 minutes, or until doubled in size.

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown.  Serve warm.

Note:  To freeze, wrap the rolls individually in foil and seal them in plastic bags.  They can be frozen for up to 3 months.  Defrost in the refrigerator and reheat to serve.

This recipe yields about 3 dozen.

Comments:  Gracie La Puma, a good friend of my family's, never arrived empty-handed on her frequent visits to our house; there was always just-baked bread or cookies "for the kids".  Her spicy, black pepper-flecked rolls were my favorite.  I could never eat just one; I doubt you will either.  I recently called her to get the recipe for those rolls.  She is almost 90 years old, but her familiar voice came riveting over the phone as if she were standing right next to me.  "Honeee, justa putta somma farina ina the wella; adda leetle yeast anda water and putta as mucha anice anda pepper youa wanta.  Goda blessa honee.  Howsa you maddar?"

           Grandma Saporito's Pizza - {Pizza Di Nonna Saporito}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Pizza With Cresciuta -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Divide the dough in half and roll each piece on a floured surface into a 13 1/2-inch round, or roll the dough to fit two 15- by 10 1/2 -inch rectangular pans.  Brush each pan with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil.

With your fingers, spread the dough in the pan and dimple the surface.  Divide the remaining olive oil and drizzle it over each pizza.  Sprinkle on the salt and pepper.

Bake the pizza until the bottom and top crusts are golden brown.  Let them cool slightly, then cut into pieces and serve.

Variation:  Press tiny slivers of fresh garlic into the dough or add fresh herbs such as basil, oregano, rosemary, or mint.

This recipe yields two 13-inch round pizzas.

Comments:  My dad loved the pizza that his mother, my grandma Saporito, made.  It was nothing more than her all-purpose yeast dough, which she also turned into bread and rolls.  After rolling out the dough, she placed it on a rectangular pan, dimpled it with her fingers, and spread on some olive oil, sea salt, and butcher's black pepper.  That was it.  For Grandma, this typified the food of her native Sicily.

             Grape Harvest Bread - {Schiacciata Di Vendemmia}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 2 3/4)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/2         pounds  seedless red grapes -- stemmed, washed,
                        and dried
  1              large  egg -- beaten

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water and let proof for 5 minutes.  Stir in 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.

In a small bowl, mix 2 1/2 cups of the flour with the salt and add to the yeast mixture.  Work the dough with your hands until a smooth ball of dough is formed.  Add additional flour as needed, but do not make the dough too stiff.  Knead the dough for a few minutes.

Grease a large bowl with 1/2 teaspoon of the olive oil and turn the dough in it.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Brush a 17 1/2- by 11 1/4-inch baking pan with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil.  Place a piece of parchment paper, cut to fit the bottom and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

After the dough has risen once, punch it down and turn it out onto a floured surface.  Knead the dough a few times, then with a rolling pin, roll it into a 20- by 16-inch rectangle.  Place the dough in the pan, stretching it a little over the sides of the pan.  Brush the dough with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, then scatter the grapes evenly over the top.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the sugar evenly over the grapes.

Bring the overhanging dough from the 2 longest sides toward the middle and pinch the seam together.  Cut most of the excess dough off the 2 remaining short sides, leaving about 1/2 inch extending.  Then fold the dough in on itself, pinching the ends closed.  Using a fork, crimp the 2 short ends.  The finished size should be about 15 by 8 inches.

Re-roll the scraps of dough and make a decorative pattern on top.  I like to cut out vines and leaves, and make small bunches of grapes, but a crisscross pattern is nice too.  Gently brush the top all over with the beaten egg and sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar evenly over the top.  Bake on the middle rack for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown on top and browned on the bottom.

Let the Schiacciata cool for 30 minutes.  Then carefully lift it out, with the parchment paper.  Let it cool to warm, then carefully pull the parchment paper away from the bottom, or leave the parchment paper in place and remove after cutting the Schiacciata into serving pieces.  This is best served warm the day it is made.  It does not freeze well.

This recipe yields 1 large loaf.

Comments:  Schiacciare means "to crush or flatten", and schiacciata is a flatbread that can change character depending on the toppings and season of the year.  At home, the dough was prepared weekly and topped with oil and herbs, or sometimes vegetables and onions.  But in the fall, when grapes were plentiful, Grandma Galasso would sweeten the dough with sugar, then crush the grapes with her fingers and spread them on top of the dough.  A second sheet of dough was placed over the top of the grapes and the Schiacciata was baked.

I use red seedless grapes, but I don't crush them.  The result is a sweet-tart harvest bread, with the grapes almost protruding under the blanket of dough as it bakes.  It is best served the day it is made, either for dessert or as a snack.

This is best served warm the day it is made.  It does not freeze well.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 1 large loaf.

<DirT>
Comments:  Schiacciare means &quot;to crush or flatten&quot;, and schiacciata is a flatbread that can change character depending on the toppings and season of the year.  At home, the dough was prepared weekly and topped with oil and herbs, or sometimes vegetables and onions.  But in the fall, when grapes were plentiful, Grandma Galasso would sweeten the dough with sugar, then crush the grapes with her fingers and spread them on top of the dough.  A second sheet of dough was placed over the top of the grapes and the Schiacciata was baked.
</DirT>
<DirT>
I use red seedless grapes, but I don&apos;t crush them.  The result is a sweet-tart harvest bread, with the grapes almost protruding under the blanket of dough as it bakes.  It is best served the day it is made, either for dessert or as a snack.

             Grape Harvest Bread II - {Schiacciata Con L'Uva}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1                cup  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  5 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 2 3/4)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  rosemary needles -- finely minced
  2 1/2           cups  red seedless grapes -- stemmed, washed,
                        and dried
  1              large  egg -- slightly beaten

Dissolve the yeast in the water in a large bowl and let sit for 5 minutes.  Stir in 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.

In a small bowl, mix 2 1/2 cups of the flour with the salt and add it to the yeast mixture.  Work the ingredients with your hands until a ball of dough forms.  Add additional flour as needed, but do not make the dough too stiff.  Knead the dough for about 5 minutes or until it is smooth.

Grease a large bowl with 1/2 teaspoon of the olive oil and turn the dough in it.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Brush a 17 1/2- by 11 1/4-inch baking sheet with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil.  Place a piece of parchment paper, cut to fit the bottom and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

After the dough has risen, punch it down and turn it out onto a floured surface.  Spread it out roughly with your hands and sprinkle the rosemary over the top.  Fold the dough over the rosemary and knead it a few times to evenly distribute the rosemary.  Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 20- by 16-inch rectangle.  Place the dough in the pan, stretching it about 1 inch over the sides of the pan.  Brush the dough with the remaining olive oil; scatter the grapes evenly over the top and press them into the dough with your hands.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the sugar over the grapes.

Bring the overhanging pieces of dough from the 2 longest sides toward the middle and pinch the seam together.  Cut most of the excess dough off the 2 remaining short sides, leaving about 1/2 inch extending.  Then fold the dough in on itself, pinching the ends closed.  Use a fork to crimp the 2 short ends.  The finished size should be about 15 by 8 inches.

Re-roll the dough scraps and make a decorative pattern on top.  I use a small knife to cut leaves and vines and I use small balls of dough to make a bunch of grapes.

Cover the dough and allow it to rise for 30 minutes.  Brush the top with the beaten egg and sprinkle the top evenly with the remaining sugar.

Bake on the middle rack for 35 to 40 minutes or until the dough is nicely browned on top and bottom.

Let the schiacciata cool for 30 minutes.  Then carefully lift it out with the parchment paper onto a wire rack.  Let it cool to warm.  Carefully pull the parchment paper away from the bottom, or leave it in place and remove after cutting the schiacciata into serving pieces.  This is best served warm the day it is made.

This recipe yields 1 large rectangular flat bread.

Comments:  Walking through the miles and miles of vineyards at Castello Banfi is meditative.  From the back of the castello, Mount Sant'Amiata, a now defunct volcano, casts a looming presence over the sloping vines.  This unforgettable landscape builds hope if you are a winemaker of good harvest to come and spectacular wines to follow.  When it is vendemmia, (harvest season), the grapes will be plucked and carried away on huge trucks to the winery.  There they begin their slow transformation into wine.  Grapes that are not good enough for the crush are good enough for schiacciata con l'uva, a sweet, flat yeast bread embedded with grapes.

             Green Beans And Fontina - {Fagiolini E Fontina}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  green beans -- cleaned
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2         pound  Italian Fontina cheese -- diced

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the beans and boil, uncovered, until tender but still firm.  Drain.

In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat.  Add the beans and toss well.  Add the cheese and stir to coat the beans with the cheese as it melts.  Place the beans on a platter and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Whether this combination of Fontina cheese and green beans exists in Italy I do not know, but it is a favorite on our Thanksgiving table each year.  This cheese works beautifully in so many cooked dishes because of its creamy texture, allowing it to melt easily.  Be sure to buy Italian Fontina, which has a brown rind and a seal confirming that it was made in the Valle d'Aosta.

                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  escarole, dandelion greens, or chicory -- washed
  1              pound  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into quarters
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick) -- plus
  1           teaspoon  butter
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  grated Pecorino Romano cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the greens, and boil rapidly for 6 to 7 minutes, or until the greens are wilted and tender.  Drain the greens in a colander, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.

With the back of a spoon, press as much water as possible out of the greens and place them on a cutting board.  With a knife, coarsely chop the greens into 1- to 2-inch pieces and place in a bowl.

Put the potatoes in a pot, cover with water, and boil until fork-tender, about 15 minutes.

Drain the potatoes well and place in a bowl.  Add 4 tablespoons of the butter and the milk, and mash with a potato masher or an electric mixer until smooth (or leave them slightly lumpy).  If the potatoes are too dry, add 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.  With a spoon, mix in half the cheese and the salt and pepper.  Add the chopped greens and combine.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Grease an 8-inch square baking dish with the 1 teaspoon butter, and spread the potato mixture in the pan.  Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and drizzle it over the top, then sprinkle on the remaining cheese and bake until hot, about 20 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  My mother tells the story of how her mother in early spring gathered bitter, wild endive (cicoria) and dandelions in her apron.  She boiled them until tender, then tossed them into boiling chicken or beef broth, along with some potatoes.  It was a very satisfying peasant dish, and for my grandmother, the greens were a gift from nature.

The combination of greens and potatoes has remained for me a culinary example of simplicity and frugality in the kitchen.  The potatoes in this dish were lumpy, mashed with a fork, because Grandma had a weakness in her arm that sapped her strength.  She always served them with meat drippings that she had saved, but I have left it out because of today's health consciousness.

Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1 1/2            cup  Italian parsley leaves
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 2/3) -- plus
                        extra for brushing the eggplant
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt -- or more to taste
                        Grinding of black pepper
  1             medium  eggplant - (abt 1 lb) -- washed and dried
                        Fine sea salt -- as needed

In a food processor or blender, pulse the garlic and parsley.  Drizzle in the 1 cup olive oil a little at a time with the motor running until a thick emulsion is formed.  Season with the salt and pepper.  Stir in the lemon juice.  Transfer the sauce to a 9- by 12-inch rectangular dish and set aside.

Preheat the grill for 5 minutes.  If you do not have a grill, preheat your oven broiler.

Cut off the stem top of the eggplant and discard.  Cut the eggplant into 1/4-inch thick slices.  Place the slices in a colander and liberally salt in between them.  Allow the slices to "sweat" for 20 minutes to rid them of their excess water.  Rinse and dry the slices.

If using a grill, brush the eggplant lightly on both sides with olive oil and grill them turning once or twice until the slices soften and show grill marks.  Transfer the slices to the dish with the parsley sauce and turn them in the sauce to coat them.

If using the broiler, place the slices on a foil-lined grill pan; brush the slices with olive oil and broil them on both sides until the slices begin to soften and brown slightly.  Transfer the slices to the dish with the parsley sauce.

Cover the dish and allow the eggplant to marinate in the sauce at room temperature for at least an hour before serving.

Serve with slices of crusty bread.

Variation:  Add sun-dried tomatoes to the eggplant for a wonderful taste combination.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Even vegetables are cooked alla griglia (on the grill) in Umbria.  Why not enjoy this eggplant salad in parsley sauce at your next cookout?

                     Gubbian Flat Bread - {Brustengo}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  3 1/2           cups  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying

Mix the flour, water, and salt together in a bowl.  I like to use one with a pourable spout.

Pour the oil to a depth of 1/2-inch into a 10-inch heavy-duty skillet or frying pan and heat until hot.  Test the hotness of the oil by dropping a small dribble of batter into the skillet; if it browns and bubbles immediately, the oil is hot enough.  I keep a candy thermometer in the oil to make sure it is at 375 degrees.  Pour or scoop and spread about a cupful of the batter into the oil, and when the bread begins to brown around the edges, flip it over carefully to brown the other side.  Use a slotted spoon to remove the bread and allow it to drain on paper towels.

Use up all the batter in the same way.  Depending on the size of your pan, you should be able to get at least 10 to 12 rounds.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 rounds.

Comments:  A pitch-black skillet is what chef Fina uses in the kitchen of the Bossone Garden restaurant when she makes brustengo, the fried flat bread of Gubbio.  If you make the batter ahead of time, it will thicken slightly; it should be pourable, like pancake batter, so thin it down before you use it, if necessary.  Serve the bread warm as is or with prosciutto, dried sausage, and olives for an antipasto.

               Helen's Taralli - {Taralli Di Elena Julian}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 4)
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  5              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  olive oil or lard
     1/2           cup  grated Pecorino-Romano cheese

In a large bowl, combine 3 cups of the flour with the baking powder and pepper, and set aside.

In another large bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, olive oil, and cheese with a whisk.  Add the flour mixture and mix to form a firm dough.  Add more flour as needed to keep dough from getting sticky.  Knead until smooth and pliable.

Roll the dough out on a floured surface.  Break off small balls of dough about 1 inch in diameter and roll into ropes 10 inches long and 1/2 inch wide.  Hold the rope in the middle with your fingers and twist the 2 ends together, forming a twist about 4 inches long.  Place the twists on towels.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a baking sheet.

In a large pot of boiling water, drop the twists a few at a time and let come to the surface.  They will rise to the surface in about 1 minute.  Remove with a slotted spoon and place on brown paper to drain.  Arrange the twists on baking sheet and bake for about 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden brown.  Cool on a rack.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  These are not the traditional ringlike taralli; instead, they are shaped as twists, and the dough has cheese in it.  As these bake, the smell of black pepper and cheese permeates the house.  They are served at Eastertime and disappear very quickly in my house.  The original recipe came from Helen Julian, whose ancestral home is Cumblebas, Italy.

Categories    : Italian                         Pasta
                Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        cut in half lengthwise
  6                     scallions, white part only -- cut thin rounds
     1/2           cup  minced arugula leaves
     1/2           cup  minced fresh Italian parsley leaves -- without stems
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1              pound  homemade or store-bought fusilli
     1/2         pound  feta cheese -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  minced fresh basil leaves

Heat the olive oil in a medium-size saute pan over medium heat, add the garlic halves, and cook slowly, pressing on the cloves with a wooden spoon to flavor the oil.  When the edges of the cloves begin to turn golden brown, remove and discard them.  Cook the scallions in the olive oil, stirring, until they soften.  Stir in the arugula, basil, and parsley and cook slowly for 1 minute.  Stir in the salt.  Keep the sauce over low heat while the fusilli are cooking.

Cook the fusilli as directed.  When al dente, drain the fusilli, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.  Return the fusilli to the cooking pot, along with the reserved cooking water, add the sauce, and mix to evenly coat the fusilli.  Transfer to a serving bowl or plat≠ter, sprinkle the feta cheese over the top, and serve.

Tip:  Spray a chef's knife with vegetable or olive oil spray before mincing the herbs to prevent them from sticking to the knife blade.

Note:  The sauce will keep covered at room temperature for 3 days or may be refrigerated for longer storage.

Note:  This is also a great marinade for fish or chicken.

This recipe yields 1 cup.

Comments:  This quick herb sauce teamed with Sardinian feta cheese can be made several days ahead and is perfect on short cuts of pasta like fusilli.  Do not substitute dried herbs for fresh as ahead and that would be the sauce's ruination.  The flavor of this sauce is developed by the slow cooking of the herbs for just l minute so their delicate oils will not be destroyed.

          Homemade Bread Crumbs - {Briciole Casalinghe Del Pane}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Condiments
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2               cups  bread crumbs
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely ground black pepper -- to taste

In a skillet, heat the oil and butter and mix well.  Add the bread crumbs and stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the crumbs absorb all the oil-butter mixture and are golden brown.  Season with salt and pepper if desired, and remove the crumbs to a bowl.  When cool, transfer the crumbs to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator.  They will keep for several months.

Variation:  Add minced fresh herbs such as parsley, oregano, and/or basil to the cooled crumbs.  Bread crumbs containing herbs should be used within a week.

Grated cheeses, such as Parmigiano-Reggiano, Pecorino, and Swiss, can also be added to bread crumbs, along with some hot red pepper flakes if you'd like.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

In a skillet, heat the oil and butter and mix well.  Add the bread crumbs and stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the crumbs absorb all the oil-butter mixture and are golden brown.  Season with salt and pepper if desired, and remove the crumbs to a bowl.  When cool, transfer the crumbs to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator.  They will keep for several months.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Variation:  Add minced fresh herbs such as parsley, oregano, and/or basil to the cooled crumbs.  Bread crumbs containing herbs should be used within a week.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grated cheeses, such as Parmigiano-Reggiano, Pecorino, and Swiss, can also be added to bread crumbs, along with some hot red pepper flakes if you&apos;d like.

                Homestyle Broccoli - {Broccoli Casalinghi}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  broccoli
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  crushed red pepper flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  grated Pecorino-Romano cheese

Trim off the thick woody stems from the broccoli and cut the broccoli into 1 1/2-inch florets, separating the florets.  Set aside.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic and saute until the garlic begins to soften.  Add the pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute.  Add the broccoli and stir to coat with the oil.  Cook for 2 minutes, stirring, then reduce the heat to medium low, cover, and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add 1/4 cup of water to the pan, cover, and cook until the broccoli is crisp-tender, about 6 minutes; add additional water if needed to keep the broccoli from burning.

Transfer the broccoli to a serving dish and sprinkle with salt and pepper and the cheese.  Serve immediately.

Note:  I always add a little olive oil to vegetables that are boiled because it helps to retain their color.  In this dish, the broccoli remains vibrant because of the olive oil.  At home, bread crumbs fried in olive oil were sometimes sprinkled over the broccoli.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Broccoli is one of those vegetables with a negative image.  We had it many ways when I was a kid, and I admit it was not my favorite.  Many people think that steamed or boiled broccoli is just bland; I agree.  I cook it the way it was done at home, in a frying pan with olive oil, garlic, and very little water.  The result is tender broccoli, still verdant green and very tasty.

  2              large  zucchini sliced
  1              large  onion sliced
  2                     nice-sized potatoes - (to 3) -- diced
                        = (the amount depending on how much you

                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        A chunk of parmesan cheese

Layer the potatoes, onions, zucchini, tomatoes, herbs, season with salt and pepper, drizzle olive oil and drop the chunk of cheese all in a large pot.  Let it all cook down slowly till the potatoes are soft.  Add some water if necessary, but chances are that you may not need it since there is water in the zucchini as well as the tomatoes.

This is good, hot, cold, warm or even better on the next day.  Serve it with a nice crusty Italian bread for dipping.  Top with grated cheese.  When times were tough, and meat was really expensive, my family added a couple of hot dogs in the pot too.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This is great all summer long since all the ingredients are fresh and readily available.  Enjoy!

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh spinach -- washed and stemmed
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  diced onion
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/4         pounds  potatoes -- peeled and quartered
  1              pound  carrots -- peeled and quartered
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- plus
  12       tablespoons  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg

Place the spinach in a skillet, cover the pan, and cook over medium-high heat for about 4 minutes, or until the spinach wilts.  Drain the spinach in a colander, squeezing out as much water as possible.  Place on a cutting board and cut it into strips.

Dry out the skillet, pour in and heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, then add the onion, sauteing until soft and golden.  Add the spinach, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the pepper.  Stir, cooking the mixture for 2 to 3 minutes.  Keep warm.

Place the potatoes, carrots, and remaining salt in a pot.  Cover the vegetables with water and boil until very tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain the vegetables in a colander.  Return vegetables to the pot and "dry" them over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes.

Place the vegetables in a food processor, blender, or bowl.  Add the butter and puree or mash by hand until very smooth.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add 1/4 cup of cheese and the nutmeg, and combine well.

Grease a large casserole dish with the remaining olive oil.  Fit a 12- or 16-inch pastry bag with a star tip.  Fill bag with some of the carrot-potato mixture, then pipe out twelve 2-inch circles into the prepared casserole dish.  Using a circular motion, fill circles with the mixture to build up the sides so that they are about 1 inch high.  If necessary, reheat circles in a 350 degrees oven for about 8 minutes.  Remove from oven.

Divide the spinach mixture among the circles, placing about 1 1/2 tablespoons in the center of each.  Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the tops and serve immediately.

Note:  To make this ahead, grease a large casserole with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Form the circles, cover them, and refrigerate until serving time.  Heat circles in a 350 degrees oven for about 15 minutes or until hot.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The word contorni refers to the vegetables that accompany the main course.  I made this colorful vegetable combination for my family to go with a roast pork.  My son Chris, who is suspicious of all vegetables, actually enjoyed these.  This is a beautiful dish, easy to prepare ahead.

                  Mad Tomato Sauce - {Salsa Arrabbiata}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  fresh plum tomatoes
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3              large  garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  crushed red pepper flakes
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  minced fresh basil

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut the tomatoes in half.  Place them cut-side down on a baking sheet and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are just slightly soft.  Transfer the tomatoes to a food processor or blender and pulse until very smooth.  Set aside.

In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil.  Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until the garlic is soft.  Add the pureed tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes.  Pour the sauce into a sieve set over a bowl and strain, using a wooden spoon to press on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard the solids.  Add the salt, pepper, and basil; stir to blend.  The sauce is best when freshly made but can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.

Note:  This sauce is great over any type of short, chunky macaroni.  I like it with orecchiette.

This recipe yields 3 1/2 cups.

Comments:  My grandmothers and mother made tomato sauce every week and firmly believed that you had to cook the tomatoes all day long in order to produce a good sauce.  What made a lengthy cooking time necessary were the tough cuts of meat, such as chuck and pork butt, that were put in to simmer and flavor the sauce.  I don't have all day to cook sauce, but I'd bet a bushel of tomatoes that even my grandmothers and mother would like tomato sauce done my way.

Cut the tomatoes in half.  Place them cut-side down on a baking sheet and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are just slightly soft.  Transfer the tomatoes to a food processor or blender and pulse until very smooth.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil.  Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until the garlic is soft.  Add the pureed tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes.  Pour the sauce into a sieve set over a bowl and strain, using a wooden spoon to press on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard the solids.  Add the salt, pepper, and basil; stir to blend.  The sauce is best when freshly made but can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  This sauce is great over any type of short, chunky macaroni.  I like it with orecchiette.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 3 1/2 cups.

Comments:  My grandmothers and mother made tomato sauce every week and firmly believed that you had to cook the tomatoes all day long in order to produce a good sauce.  What made a lengthy cooking time necessary were the tough cuts of meat, such as chuck and pork butt, that were put in to simmer and flavor the sauce.  I don&apos;t have all day to cook sauce, but I&apos;d bet a bushel of tomatoes that even my grandmothers and mother would like tomato sauce done my way.

Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  raisins or candied citron -- diced
  1 3/4         pounds  Swiss chard or spinach -- stemmed and washed
  1                     container skim-milk ricotta cheese - (15 o -- well drained
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        === PASTRY DOUGH ===
  1 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  potato starch
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4           cup  sugar
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into bits
  2              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  water

To prepare the filling, soak the raisins in warm water for 30 minutes.  Drain and dry them, then dice them and place them in a large bowl.

Put the Swiss chard or spinach in a soup pot with no additional water.  Cover the pot and cook over medium heat just until the leaves wilt down; this will take about 4 or 5 minutes.  Drain the leaves in a colander and squeeze them with the back of a spoon to extract as much water as possible.  Coarsely chop the greens and add them to the bowl with the raisins.  Stir in the drained ricotta cheese, salt, nutmeg, and sugar.  Mix well, then cover and refrigerate while you make the dough.

To prepare the dough, in a food processor or bowl, mix together the flour, potato starch, salt, and sugar.  Pulse in the butter or use a pastry blender to reduce the butter to small bits.  Add 1 of the eggs and the water and pulse or mix until a ball of dough is obtained that is moist but holds together.  If the dough seems dry, add 1 drop of water at a time until you get the right consistency.  Flatten the ball into a disk and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly butter or spray a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Set it aside.

Divide the dough in half.  Roll out each half on a floured surface to a 12-inch circle.  Fold one dough circle in quarters, then lift it and unfold it, draping it into the tart pan.  Trim the dough even with the top edge of the tart pan.

Add the filling to the tart pan, spreading it evenly.  Fold the second piece of dough in quarters, place it on top of the filling at the center, then unfold the dough and trim it even with the edges.  Reroll the scraps of dough and use a cookie cutter to make cutouts for the top of the pastry.  Beat the remaining egg slightly and with a pastry brush paint the top crust evenly with the egg wash.  With a scissors make a V in the center of the crust.

Bake the pie for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.  Cool the pie on a rack for 20 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields one 9-inch pie.

Comments:  This recipe for erbazzone, a specialty of Reggio Emilia and Piacenza, comes from longtime friend Raffaella Neviani's mother, Mara, who lives in Cavriago, not far from Reggio Emilia.  Mara made this savory, country torta (pie) one night when I came to visit.  It is usually made with Swiss chard or spinach.  When it is encased in a slightly sweetened pastry crust it is called erbazzone; when made without a crust it is called scarpazzone.  This pie actually has an ancient history going back to Roman times.  Of course there are many variations of the recipe; some use a pastry made with only lard, water, and salt.  The filling can be flavored with pancetta, or onions and parsley.  Mara's filling included ricotta cheese and raisins.  Cook the Swiss chard or spinach dry in a soup pot with only the water clinging to its leaves after cleaning it.  This rustic pie is delicious served hot or at room temperature.  It also makes an unusual picnic food.

             Mint And Walnut Sauce - {Salsa Di Menta E Noce}

Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  walnut halves
  1                cup  fresh mint leaves - (packed) -- washed, dried,
                        and stemmed
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  Pici -- (see recipe)
                        Freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- for sprinkling
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled

Place the nuts, mint, salt, and garlic in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade.  Process the mixture until the nuts and mint are finely minced.  Add the olive oil through the feed tube a dribble at a time while the motor is running.  Process until the sauce is blended and grainy in texture.

Cook the pici as directed.  While the pici are cooking, heat the sauce in a small saucepan over low heat.  Drain the pici, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.  Stir the water into the warm sauce.  Return the pici to the pasta pot, pour in the sauce, and stir over low heat until the sauce evenly coats the pici.  Transfer the pici to a platter and serve with  grated cheese.

Note:  The sauce can be made up to 1 week ahead and refrigerated.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a special pasta sauce from antiquity that the Etruscans from the town of Chiusi used to serve.  Pici, a thin spaghetti, is excellent with this sauce, and the pasta can be made in no time in a food processor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1              large  Spanish onion -- diced
  2                     celery ribs -- diced
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves - (packed) -- chopped
  5                     plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and pureed
  1 3/4         pounds  potatoes -- peeled and diced
  1              pound  eggplant -- peeled and diced
  1              pound  zucchini -- diced
     1/2           cup  water
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  yellow pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into thin strips

In a large deep skillet or a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and saute until soft.  Add the celery and basil and saute until the celery is soft.  Add the tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, zucchini, water, and salt and pepper, and stir well.  Cover and cook over low heat for 20 minutes.

Add the pepper strips and cook for about 10 minutes more, or until the vegetables are tender but not mushy.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

Comments:  Ciambotta, similar to French ratatouille, is a hearty vegetable stew of eggplant, zucchini, tomatoes, and unlike ratatouille, potatoes.  The slow cooking blends the flavors of the vegetables and prevents them from losing their shape.

                    Mixed Vegetables - {Tutto Insieme}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  baking potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  2             medium  zucchini -- cut into chunks
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" rounds
  2                     red onions -- thinly sliced
  1             medium  fennel, white bulb only -- cut 1/2" thk slices
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Grinding of black pepper

Put all the vegetables and the oil in a large saute pan and cook over medium heat for 3 or 4 minutes.  Cover the pan and continue cooking until the vegetables are cooked, but still al dente.  A knife should be able to pierce them without resistance but the vegetables should retain their shapes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Comments:  I love the name tutto insieme, (everything together), given to this quick mixed vegetable dish that goes well with any meat, fish, fowl, or game course.

                Molded Spinach - {Lo Sformato Di Spinaci}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     bags spinach - (10 oz ea) -- stemmed, washed,
                        and drained
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground nutmeg
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  4                     eggs
  1                cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/3           cup  fresh bread crumbs

Coat eight 3- by 1 1/2-inch deep ramekins or heavy-duty foil cups with butter spray and refrigerate.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Working in two batches, wilt the spinach leaves in a covered saute pan, without any additional water, for about 3 minutes.  Drain the spinach in a colander and use a wooden spoon to squeeze as much of the water out of the leaves as possible.

Return the saute pan to the burner and melt the butter.  Stir in the spinach, salt, nutmeg and heavy cream and cook the mixture, stirring frequently, for about 4 minutes or until thickened.

Transfer the mixture to a bowl and let cool for 10 minutes.

In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with a hand mixer until frothy.  Stir in the cheese and bread crumbs.

Stir the egg mixture into the spinach mixture, blending well.

Divide the spinach mixture between the ramekins and place them on a baking sheet.

Bake for 30 minutes or until lightly browned on top.  Remove the molds from the oven and invert them onto a serving dish.  Unmold and serve immediately.

For an interesting sauce:  Puree 1 pound of yellow tomatoes and then strain the puree to remove the seeds.  Saute 3 tablespoons diced onion and 1 small clove of minced garlic in 1 tablespoon of butter or olive oil until soft.  Add the pureed tomatoes and mix well.  If desired, add 1/3 cup dry white wine or heavy cream and salt to taste.  Simmer for 25 minutes.  The sauce can be refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for up to 3 months.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Dense sformato di spinaci is easy to put together and impressive looking when done in small individual molds.  Vary the cheeses in the filling from Parmigiano-Reggiano to Italian Fontina or mozzarella.  Nutmeg seems to be the perennial partner of spinach wherever I travel in the central and northern regions of Italy and the addition of heavy cream creates a pleasing velvety texture.  Serve the spinach molds as a side dish with meat or fish entrees.

               Mustard Greens With Olives And Cheese - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  salt -- for cooking greens
  2             pounds  mustard greens, leaves only -- washed
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  black oil-cured olives -- pitted, and
                        cut in quarters
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
     1/4           cup  grated Pecorino cheese
                        = (or crumbled Sardinian feta cheese)

Fill a soup pot with water and bring to a boil, add 1 teaspoon of salt and the mustard greens, and cook, uncovered, for 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain the mustard greens in a colander and, when cool enough to handle, squeeze out all the excess water.  Chop the greens coarsely and set them aside.

In a saute pan, heat the olive oil, add the garlic and olives, and stir until the garlic softens but does not turn brown.  Add the mustard greens and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Transfer the mixture to a serving dish and add salt and pepper to taste.  Sprinkle the cheese over the top and serve immediately.

Note:  This dish can also be used as a sauce for dressing one of the hollow-tube pastas cut into short pieces such as rigatoni, penne, or ziti.

Did you know that if green vegetables such as mustard greens, broccoli, and green beans are boiled uncovered, they will retain their green color?  The acids in the vegetables evaporate during the cooking process, and when vegetables are cooked with a lid, these acids can turn green vegetables a dull gray-green color.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Mustard greens were popular in Italy in the Middle Ages and have all but disappeared today.  A check of many of Italy's best markets, including the one in Padova, did not yield a trace of this ruffled-edge, green leafy vegetable, but that did not discourage me from reintroducing them on a garden segment of Ciao Italia.  I learned how to cook them from my mother.  She cooked mounds of this pungent, mustard-tasting vegetable in large amounts of boiling water, then drained and squeezed the greens dry.  She mixed them into scrambled eggs and put them between slices of coarse bread for lunch.  They were never a requested food from me.  Now older and wiser, I can't wait to plant mustard greens each year in my home garden and I like them sauteed with dark-as-midnight, pungent black olives and cheese.

A check of many of Italy&apos;s best markets, including the one in Padova, did not yield a trace of this ruffled-edge, green leafy vegetable, but that did not discourage me from reintroducing them on a garden segment of Ciao Italia.  I learned how to cook them from my mother.  She cooked mounds of this pungent, mustard-tasting vegetable in large amounts of boiling water, then drained and squeezed the greens dry.  She mixed them into scrambled eggs and put them between slices of coarse bread for lunch.  They were never a requested food from me.  Now older and wiser, I can&apos;t wait to plant mustard greens each year in my home garden and I like them sauteed with dark-as-midnight, pungent black olives and cheese.

                      Olive Sauce - {Salsa Di Oliva}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  Kalamata olives -- pitted
     1/2         pound  Cerignola olives -- pitted
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/3           cup  fresh Italian parsley leaves -- stems removed
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper

Place the olives and garlic in the bowl of a food processor and pulse for 10 seconds.  Add the parsley and thyme and pulse again for 10 seconds.  With the motor running, add the olive oil through the feed tube in a slow stream.  The sauce should look finely minced and have some texture to it.  Transfer the sauce to a bowl and stir in the salt and black pepper.

Store the sauce in a jar in the refrigerator.  Bring the jar to room temperature when ready to use.  After removing some of the sauce, pour a thin layer of olive oil over the top to prevent air from getting in and allowing bacteria to grow.

Variation:  Add julienned roasted sweet red and yellow peppers after mixing the pasta with the sauce and a few coarsely chopped black oil-cured olives for color and contrast.

Note:  If you prefer a hot-tasting olive sauce, add 1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes to the sauce.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 cups.

Comments:  It is written that the olive is a gift from the gods.  Certainly no food is more revered than the oil extracted from this ancient fruit that is known today for its health benefits as well as its culinary fame.  In this no-cook olive sauce two types of olives, Kalamata and Cerignola, are blended together to make a piquant sauce that is sensational not only on pasta like Pici but on fish, bruschetta, and pizza and mixed into bread dough.  The intensity of the flavors allows one to use the sauce sparingly (1/2 cup will sauce about 1/2 pound of pasta) and it will keep for a couple of weeks in the refrigerator if the top is covered with a thin layer of olive oil.  If you do not have an olive pitter to remove the pits, use a wide-bottomed jar to smash each olive; this easily removes the pit.

           Oven-Bake Artichoke Heart And Potato Casserole - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  artichokes - (2 lbs)
  4               cups  chicken broth or water
  1                     bay leaf
  2                     baking potatoes - (1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/8" slices
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2 1/2           cups  whole milk, light cream, or heavy cream
  6        tablespoons  grated Pecorino cheese

Cut the stem ends of the artichokes, and remove the lower outer two layers of artichoke leaves and discard them.  Cut 1/2-inch off the artichoke tops and discard them.

Place the artichokes upright in a pan just large enough to hold them snugly.  Pour in enough of the chicken broth or water to cover them.  Add the bay leaf.  Bring the artichokes to a boil, then lower the heat and cook them, covered, until you can easily pull away an artichoke leaf.  Drain the artichokes and allow them to cool.  Discard the bay leaf.

Remove the remaining large outer leaves.  (Save them to nibble on as a snack.)  With a spoon carefully remove the hairy chokes and discard them.  You are now left with the artichoke hearts.  Cut the hearts into 1/4-inch slices and set them aside.

Toss the potatoes in a bowl with the salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Lightly butter a 14- by 2 1/2-inch deep casserole or au gratin baking dish.  Make a layer of potatoes in the dish, overlapping the potatoes slightly.  Place half of the artichoke slices over the potatoes, then make another layer of potatoes and artichoke hearts, ending with a final layer of potatoes.

Slowly pour the milk or cream over the potatoes.  Cover the dish with a sheet of aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes.  Uncover the dish, sprinkle on the cheese, and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese has browned slightly.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Vegetables are such an important part of the Italian diet that I devote two episodes each season to what is growing in the vegetable garden.  The year that we filmed in Sicily the crew and I visited local markets as well as home gardens.  And it was clear that vegetables make up a big part of the Sicilian diet.  Eggplant and artichokes are particular favorites.  I have a particular fondness for artichoke hearts baked with layers of potatoes; the dish is similar to scalloped potatoes.  Instead of struggling to remove the chokes from the artichokes before cooking them, cook them intact; the choke will then effortlessly come out with a spoon.

                Oven-Baked Tomatoes - {Pomodori Al Forno}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  fresh plum tomatoes
  1                cup  chopped cooked broccoli
     3/4           cup  diced Provolone cheese - (abt 3 oz)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1 1/2      teaspoons  anchovy paste
     1/2           cup  toasted fresh bread crumbs
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh parsley
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Core the tomatoes and cut them in half lengthwise.  Gently squeeze out some of the juice and pulp.  (Reserve for another use such as stock, or discard.)  Trim a small piece off the bottom of each tomato so it will sit without tilting.  Place the cut halves in a buttered baking dish large enough to hold them in a single layer.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a bowl, combine the broccoli and cheese.  Set aside.

In a frying pan, heat the olive oil.  Add the garlic and saute until soft.  Stir in the anchovy paste, add the bread crumbs, and mix well.  Add the bread crumb mixture to the broccoli and cheese.  Add the parsley and pepper and mix well.

Divide the broccoli mixture evenly among the tomato halves.  Bake the tomatoes until the cheese is bubbly and the crumbs are beginning to brown, about 25 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  In late summer, when I am inundated with plum tomatoes, I make this stuffed tomato dish, which was frequently on the dinner table at home.  Use plump, fully ripe tomatoes.  The stuffing can vary according to the whim of the cook, but I think the added touch of anchovy is very nice.

                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     red-skinned potatoes - (to 7) -- washed
  2             medium  zucchini
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
                        Leaves from 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
                        = (or 1 tbspn dried rosemary)
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut the potatoes and zucchini into 1-inch chunks, 1/2-inch thick.  Put the zucchini in a bowl, cover, and set aside.

Mince the garlic with the rosemary and sea salt until the mixture is almost a paste.  Set aside.

In a 14- by 9-inch baking dish, mix the olive oil and garlic paste.  Add the potatoes and coat well with the mixture.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, basting frequently with a brush.

Add the zucchini to the baking dish and toss the vegetables well.  Bake an additional 20 to 25 minutes, or until the zucchini are soft but not mushy and the potatoes are golden brown.  Sprinkle with pepper and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  In this recipe, garlic in minced with sea salt and fresh rosemary, and the vegetables are tossed in the mixture.  Sometimes I vary this recipe by adding fresh tomato wedges about 10 minutes before the dish is done.  Serve it with roasted chicken, fish, or meat.  I like to serve this on Thanksgiving because it goes together so quickly and is easy to bake along with the turkey.

<IngR name="olive oil" unit="cup" qty="1/2"></IngR>
<IngR name="Coarsely-ground black pepper to taste"></IngR>
<DirS>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut the potatoes and zucchini into 1-inch chunks, 1/2-inch thick.  Put the zucchini in a bowl, cover, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mince the garlic with the rosemary and sea salt until the mixture is almost a paste.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 14- by 9-inch baking dish, mix the olive oil and garlic paste.  Add the potatoes and coat well with the mixture.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, basting frequently with a brush.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the zucchini to the baking dish and toss the vegetables well.  Bake an additional 20 to 25 minutes, or until the zucchini are soft but not mushy and the potatoes are golden brown.  Sprinkle with pepper and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  In this recipe, garlic in minced with sea salt and fresh rosemary, and the vegetables are tossed in the mixture.  Sometimes I vary this recipe by adding fresh tomato wedges about 10 minutes before the dish is done.  Serve it with roasted chicken, fish, or meat.  I like to serve this on Thanksgiving because it goes together so quickly and is easy to bake along with the turkey.

                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  shelled fresh peas - (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  diced parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  4             ounces  diced prosciutto
  1           teaspoon  sugar

Put the peas in a pot with the olive oil, garlic, parsley, and salt.  Add just enough water to barely cover the peas and cook over medium-low heat uncovered for no longer than 2 minutes.

Gently stir in the prosciutto and sugar and cook 1 minute longer.

           Potato And Spinach Pie - {Torta Di Patate E Spinaci}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  medium potatoes - (4 to 5) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1 1/2" chunks
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              large  egg
  6             ounces  mozzarella, Asiago, or other cheese -- cubed (1 1/2 cups)
  1                     bag fresh spinach - (10 oz) -- stemmed, washed,
                        and drained
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled, halved
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
  1           teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick) -- diced

Place the potatoes in a 2-quart pot and cover with water.  Bring water to a boil and cook the potatoes until tender, about 12 minutes.  Drain the potatoes, but reserve 1/4 cup cooking water.

Place the potatoes in a bowl.  Add the cooking water, 1 tablespoon of oil, salt, and egg.  With a potato masher or an electric mixer, beat the potatoes until smooth.  If they seem too dry, add a little more water.  Fold in the cheese and set the mixture aside.

Place the spinach in a dry skillet, cover with a lid, and cook until the spinach wilts, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain the spinach in a colander.

In the same skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil, add the garlic, and press on the garlic with a wooden spoon to release its juice.  When the garlic begins to turn color, remove and discard it.

Return the spinach to the skillet, add the pine nuts, and saute the mixture for about 2 minutes.  Turn off the heat, add the nutmeg, and blend.  Set the mixture aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  With the remaining tablespoon of oil, brush the bottom and sides of a 9-inch round cake pan.

Place half the potato mixture in the pan, smoothing the top.  Add the spinach mixture, spreading it evenly on top of the potatoes.  Place the remaining potato mixture on top of the spinach, spreading to cover the spinach.  Dot with the diced butter and bake for about 40 minutes, or until the top begins to crust over.

Place the pan under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes to brown the crust.  Let cool for about 3 minutes, then cut the pie into wedges and serve immediately.

Variation:  Instead of making a pie, form balls from the spinach and potato mixture.  Roll the balls in flour, beaten egg, and bread crumbs and fry in vegetable oil.  Serve as an accompaniment to roasted meats.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  I almost forgot to include the recipe for my grandmother's spinach and mashed potato pie, until my mother reminded me.  This vegetable and potato combination is delicious, and you can vary the cheese with whatever is on hand.

       Potato And Swiss Chard Molds - {Timballi Di Patate E Coste}

Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  all-purpose potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  1 1/2         pounds  Swiss chard -- tough stems removed
  2             ounces  prosciutto or ham -- diced (3/4 cup)
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino Romano cheese
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  egg white
  2 1/2    tablespoons  minced flat-leaf parsley
     1/3           cup  toasted pine nuts
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste

Put the potatoes in a large pot, cover with cold salted water, and bring to a boil.  Cook until tender.  Drain well.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Wash the Swiss chard well, being careful not to tear the leaves.  Add the chard to the boiling water, cover, and boil for about 10 minutes, or until tender.  Carefully drain in a colander and let cool.

Place the potatoes in a bowl, ad the prosciutto, cheese, olive oil, and egg white, and beat until smooth.  Mix in the parsley, pine nuts, and salt.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease eight 4-ounce ramekins or 3- by 1 1/2-inch aluminum foil baking cups with olive oil.  Line each cup with Swiss chard, making sure that no gaps remain and that the chard overhangs the edges by about 1/2 inch.  Divide the potato mixture evenly among the lined molds, and smooth the tops.  Fold the overhanging edges of the Swiss chard over to enclose the filling.

Place the molds on a baking sheet and cover each one tightly with a piece of aluminum foil.  Bake for about 15 minutes or until heated through.  Carefully remove the aluminum foil and invert the molds onto a serving platter or individual dishes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  These charming little round molds of Swiss chard are filled with a potato, prosciutto, and pine nut filling.  They can be assembled two hours before baking.

                 Potato Fritters - {Frittelle Di Patate}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             medium  all-purpose potatoes - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino Romano cheese
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

Peel the potatoes and grate fine.  (You should have 3 cups.)  Place in a bowl, add the remaining ingredients (except the oil), and mix well.

In a deep fryer or deep heavy pot, heat the oil to 375 degrees.  Drop tablespoonfuls of the potato batter into the oil, and fry the fritters until nicely browned.  Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain on brown paper.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  These golden-brown, crusty potato fritters have a wonderful Old World look about them, and making them always becomes a family affair.  As soon as I make them, they are gone!  Finely grating the potatoes allows the fritters to cook evenly and quickly.

Comments:  These golden-brown, crusty potato fritters have a wonderful Old World look about them, and making them always becomes a family affair.  As soon as I make them, they are gone!  Finely grating the potatoes allows the fritters to cook evenly and quickly.

                     Potato Pie - {Tortina Di Patate}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  toasted bread crumbs
  1              pound  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  1 1/4           cups  milk
     1/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  2        tablespoons  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  3        tablespoons  finely-minced parsley leaves
  2                     eggs

Use 1 tablespoon of the butter to grease an 8-inch baking pan.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the bread crumbs over the butter and set the pan aside.

Put the potatoes in a saucepan, cover them with cold water, and cook the potatoes until they are soft.  Drain the potatoes and return them to the saucepan.  Heat the potatoes briefly on low heat to "dry them".

Transfer the potatoes to a ricer and rice them over a large bowl, or mash them with a hand masher until they are smooth.  Stir in 1/4 cup of the milk, the cheese, and 1 tablespoon of the butter.  Cover the bowl and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a small saucepan melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat.  Whisk in the flour to form a smooth paste.  Slowly pour in the remaining milk, whisking continually.  Cook the mixture until it thickens slightly, just enough to coat a spoon.  Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the salt, nutmeg, and parsley.  Stir in the eggs, one at a time, and blend well.

Transfer the sauce to the bowl with the mashed potatoes and combine the two until the sauce and the potatoes are well blended.

Spread the mixture in the prepared pan.  Sprinkle the remaining bread crumbs evenly over the top of the potatoes and dot with the remaining butter.

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until heated through and the top is nicely browned.  Serve immediately directly from the pan.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  At first this sounds like just another mashed potato recipe, but the dish is elevated to something more with the addition of a cream sauce that is folded into the potatoes before being baked.  Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and a whiff of nutmeg complete the nice balance of flavors.  Serve this with roasted chicken or with steak.

               Potatoes With Dried Tomatoes And Thyme - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  all-purpose potatoes -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  butter -- softened, plus
  4        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  3        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  diced Dried Tomatoes In Olive Oil -- (see recipe)

Put the potatoes in a large pot, cover with salted water, and bring to a boil.  Cook until tender enough for a fork to pierce them easily.  Drain and let cool.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Brush a baking dish with the softened butter, and sprinkle the thyme over the butter.

Wrap the potatoes, one at a time, in a clean dish towel and, using a meat pounder, flatten into disks about 1/2-inch thick.  Place them carefully in the baking dish, sprinkle with salt, and drizzle the melted butter over the top.

Bake the potatoes, uncovered, for about 35 minutes, or until nicely browned.  Sprinkle the tomatoes over the potatoes and bake for 5 minutes longer.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  These twice-cooked potatoes, flavored with dried tomatoes and thyme, are a good accompaniment to Roast Pork Tenderloin with Juniper Berries (see recipe), and you can cook the potatoes along with the roast for a no-fuss company meal.

                     Roasted Vegetable Calzones - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1              small  yellow squash
  1              small  zucchini
  1             medium  fennel bulb -- trimmed
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- peeled
  1             medium  sweet yellow pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into 2" squares
  3              large  garlic cloves -- unpeeled
  1                cup  diced mozzarella cheese - (abt 5 oz)
     1/4           cup  prepared tomato sauce
     1/4           cup  minced fresh flat-leaf parsley - (packed)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        A grinding of black pepper
                        === DOUGH ===
  1             recipe  Nonna's Sponge Dough -- (see recipe)
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
                        Coarse sea salt -- for sprinkling

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Spray a 17- by 11 1/2-inch baking pan with olive oil spray and set aside.  Cut the yellow squash, zucchini, fennel, and onion lengthwise into quarters.  Cut the quarters into 2-inch chunks.  Spread them in a single layer on the baking pan.  Add the yellow pepper and garlic cloves to the pan.

Spray the vegetables lightly with olive oil spray and place the pan on the middle rack of the oven.  Roast the vegetables for 45 minutes, until browned, turning them once, halfway through the cooking time.  Remove the vegetables from the oven.

With your fingers, slip the skins from the garlic cloves and discard them.  In a large bowl, mash the garlic with a fork.  Add the remaining roasted vegetables, the cheese, tomato sauce, parsley, oregano, salt, and pepper.  Gently toss all the ingredients with a spoon to mix well.  Set aside.

Lightly coat two baking sheets with olive oil spray and set them aside.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a floured surface.  Knead it for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide the dough in half.

Work with half the dough at a time, keeping the remaining dough covered with a cloth or bowl.  Roll the dough into a 12-inch long log.  Cut the log into six pieces.  On the floured surface, roll each piece of dough into a 6-inch circle.  Spread a generous 1/4-cup of the vegetable filling on one half of each piece of dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border.  Fold the dough over to form a turnover.  Pinch the edges closed with your fingers, then use a fork dipped in flour to crimp and seal the edges.

Space the calzones about 1 inch apart on the baking sheets.  Cover them with towels and let rise for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Cut an X in the center of each calzone with scissors.  Brush the tops with the beaten egg and sprinkle each one with a little coarse sea salt.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the calzones are golden brown on top and the bottom crust is firm.  Transfer the calzones to cooling racks to cool slightly.  These are best eaten warm.

Calzones can be frozen for up to 2 months.  Wrap individually in aluminum foil and put into plastic bags.  Thaw, unwrapped, at room temperature and reheat in a preheated 325 degrees oven for about 5 minutes.

Note:  If you have perforated pizza pans, use them instead of baking sheets.  They will help to ensure even browning on the underside of the calzones and prevent a soggy bottom crust.

This recipe yields 12 calzones.

Comments:  Travel through the region of Puglia at the heel of Italy's boot and you will eventually meet up with calzoni, those small pockets of dough with their fillings of cheese, the local salame, and/or vegetables, according to the whim of the cook.  Among the most delicious are calzoni di magro (literally, "meager" calzones), so called because only vegetables are used in the filling.  Roasting the vegetables adds depth of flavor.  Mashed roasted garlic, a few herbs, and just a dab of tomato sauce are all the seasoning they need.  The first bite conjures up magnificent memories of Puglia.

Prepare these in stages if you like.  Make the dough, punch it down after the first rise, cover the bowl tightly, and refrigerate overnight.  Bring the dough to room temperature the next day and allow to rise again before proceeding with the recipe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast - (0.25 oz)
     1/4           cup  warm filtered or
                        bottled noncarbonated water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
     1/2           cup  warm 1% low-fat milk -- (110 115 degrees)
  3              large  eggs -- room temperature
  4 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 5)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened

In a medium bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the water and mix with a spoon until the yeast dissolves.  Let the mixture proof for about 5 minutes.  Small clusters of chalky-looking bubbles should appear on the surface.  Stir in the milk.  With a fork, beat in the eggs one at a time.  Set the mixture aside.

To make the dough in a bowl, mix together 4 1/2 cups of the flour, the sugar, and salt.  Break up the butter over the dry ingredients and work it in with your hands until a crumbly mixture is obtained.  Add the yeast mixture and mix with your hands until a ball of dough is formed.  Add additional flour if necessary to obtain a dough that is soft but not too sticky.

Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead it for 3 to 4 minutes, until a smooth ball of dough forms.  Let the dough rest on the work surface for 10 minutes, covered with a towel or inverted bowl.  Knead the dough again for 5 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.

Lightly spray a large bowl with cooking oil spray or lightly coat with butter.  Gather up the dough, place it in the bowl, and turn to coat.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until doubled in size, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.

When the dough has risen to approximately two times its size, use two fingers to make two indentations into the center of it.  If the indentations do not close up, the dough is sufficiently risen and ready to use.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 pounds.

             Small Onions In Vinegar - {Cipolline Sott'Aceto}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  red wine vinegar
  2              whole  bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  whole black peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  whole cloves
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1              piece  cinnamon stick - (abt 2" long)
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt
  1              pound  boiling onions -- peeled, left whole

In a non-aluminum saucepan, boil the vinegar with all the ingredients except the onions for 3 or 4 minutes.

Make a small in each onion with a knife and add them to the vinegar mixture and cook 2 minutes.  Turn off the heat and allow the onions to steep, covered, in the vinegar for several hours.

Transfer the onions and the vinegar mixture to a jar, cap and store in the refrigerator.  They will keep for a month.

This recipe yields 2 to 3 pints.

Comments:  Onions, red ones, white ones, yellow ones, and flat ones called cipolline are always in my garden and are ready for harvesting when the tops flop over and turn brown.  I harvest and dry them in my garden shed until the onion papers are brittle, then store them in mesh bags in a dark, not cold area.  I could not cook without onions and often marinate them in vinegar and spices to use as a condiment with meats, poultry, fish or for dressing up a dull salad.  I have even added them to fruit salads!  In a pretty jar, they make a great hostess gift.

            Small Stuffed Squash - {Piccoli Zucchini Ripieni}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              small  Jersey Golden squash - (small orange size)
                        = (or 2 zucchini, abt 10" long)
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  toasted fresh bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a baking dish.

If using the Jersey Golden squash, cut off the tops; if using zucchini, cut them into 3-inch lengths.  Gently scoop out the insides of each squash, making sure to leave a shell about 1/4-inch thick; reserve 1 1/2 cups of the pulp.

If using zucchini, scoop out and discard the seeds; then scoop out the pulp, leaving 1/4-inch thick walls.  Reserve 1 1/2 cups of the zucchini pulp.  Set aside the hollowed-out squash.

In a skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter.  Add the bread crumbs and stir to coat well.  Remove the crumbs to a bowl.  Add the remaining 3 tablespoons butter to the skillet and cook the reserved squash pulp until soft but not mushy.  Stir in the thyme and salt and pepper.

Fill the squash with the cooked squash pulp, packing it in tightly.  Place the filled squash in the baking dish.  Cover and bake until tender, about 25 minutes.  Sprinkle the bread crumbs over the squash and bake, uncovered, for 5 minutes more.  Serve immediately.

Note:  This dish is great served alongside grilled chicken, lamb, or pork.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  My husband, Guy, has always liked to grow vegetables and flowers.  Every year in early January, colorful seed catalogues from all over the fifty states are strewn across the kitchen table and the delicate process of planning the garden begins.  We always lean toward a mostly Italian-style garden, some of the seeds even coming from Italy.  One year we planted a non-Italian variety of squash called Jersey Golden.  They are like little golden pumpkins and are perfect for stuffing.  Small zucchini can also be used in this recipe.

                    Spinach Tart - {Torta Di Spinaci}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  6        tablespoons  cold butter -- cut into pieces
  2        tablespoons  ice water - (to 2 1/2)
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  spinach -- stemmed, washed,
                        and drained
  1                cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  1                cup  diced Swiss cheese - (4 oz)
  1              large  egg -- slightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  2             medium  tomatoes -- sliced 1/4" thick
     1/2           cup  pine nuts

In a large bowl or in a food processor, mix the flour and salt together.  Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs, or pulse to form a coarse mixture.  Slowly add the water and mix or process just until a ball of dough begins to form.  Do not overmix.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Place the spinach in a saucepan without any additional water, cover, and cook over medium heat until wilted, about 5 minutes.  Drain well and squeeze out as much water as possible.  Coarsely chop the spinach and set aside.

In a small saucepan, heat the milk until hot.  Set aside.

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter.  Add flour and whisk to form a paste.  Slowly whisk in the milk and cook, whisking continually, until the mixture starts to thicken and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.  Using a wooden spoon, stir in the nutmeg and half the Swiss cheese, and stir until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth.  Transfer the sauce to a medium bowl and cool for 5 minutes.  Stir in the egg and blend well.  Set the sauce aside.

Roll the chilled dough between two sheets of waxed paper to a 10 1/2-inch round.  Fit it into a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Trim the edges.  Place a sheet of aluminum foil over the dough and fill it with uncooked beans, rice, or pastry weights to prevent puffing while baking.  Bake the tart shell for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and weights and let cool for 10 minutes.  (Leave the oven on.)

Add the spinach to the cream sauce and mix well.  Stir in the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.  Spread the spinach mixture evenly in the tart shell.  Arrange the tomato slices in a circle on top of the filling, and sprinkle on the remaining Swiss cheese and the pine nuts.

Bake the tart for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and the top is lightly browned.  Cool the tart for 5 minutes, then cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Spinach is one of the first leafy vegetables to appear in my Italian garden.  It is such a versatile vegetable I have many uses for it, including this tart, with a dense spinach and creamy cheese sauce filling.

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter.  Add flour and whisk to form a paste.  Slowly whisk in the milk and cook, whisking continually, until the mixture starts to thicken and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.  Using a wooden spoon, stir in the nutmeg and half the Swiss cheese, and stir until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth.  Transfer the sauce to a medium bowl and cool for 5 minutes.  Stir in the egg and blend well.  Set the sauce aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll the chilled dough between two sheets of waxed paper to a 10 1/2-inch round.  Fit it into a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Trim the edges.  Place a sheet of aluminum foil over the dough and fill it with uncooked beans, rice, or pastry weights to prevent puffing while baking.  Bake the tart shell for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and weights and let cool for 10 minutes.  (Leave the oven on.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the spinach to the cream sauce and mix well.  Stir in the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.  Spread the spinach mixture evenly in the tart shell.  Arrange the tomato slices in a circle on top of the filling, and sprinkle on the remaining Swiss cheese and the pine nuts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the tart for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and the top is lightly browned.  Cool the tart for 5 minutes, then cut into wedges and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Spinach is one of the first leafy vegetables to appear in my Italian garden.  It is such a versatile vegetable I have many uses for it, including this tart, with a dense spinach and creamy cheese sauce filling.

                Spinach With Cream - {Spinaci Alla Panna}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     bags fresh spinach - (10 oz ea) -- stemmed, washed,
                        and drained
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Put the spinach in a large pot with just the water clinging to its leaves, cover, and cook until wilted, 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain well and squeeze dry.

In a skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the spinach, cream, nutmeg, and salt and stir well.  Sprinkle on the cheese.  Turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let sit for a few minutes, until the cheese melts.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Fresh spinach in the northern Italian style -- butter, a touch of cream, and a dash of nutmeg -- becomes a sophisticated contorno (vegetable side dish) when served with Chicken in Paper or Grilled Chicken.

            Spring Spinach, Prosciutto And Fontina Tart - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  spinach -- stemmed and washed
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- mashed
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- diced
  8                     dried tomatoes in olive oil -- drained and diced
                        = (homemade or store-bought)
  1             recipe  Straight Dough -- (see recipe)
     3/4         pound  Italian Fontina cheese -- diced
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds

Place the spinach in a large saucepan, without any additional water, and cook it over medium-low heat until it wilts.  Drain in a colander and squeeze out as much water as possible.  Coarsely chop the spinach and put it in a small bowl.

Wipe the saucepan dry and heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic and prosciutto and cook until the prosciutto starts to brown.  Add the prosciutto and garlic to the spinach.  Stir in the dried tomatoes.

Lightly spray a 9- by 2-inch springform pan with olive oil spray and set aside.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide the dough in half.  Work with one piece at a time, keeping the remaining dough covered with a cloth or bowl.

Roll one piece of dough out on the floured surface into a 14-inch round.  Line the springform pan with the dough, letting the excess dough hang over the sides of the pan.  Spread half of the spinach mixture over the bottom of the dough.  Spread half of the cheese over the spinach, then repeat the spinach and cheese layers.

Roll the remaining piece of dough out into an 11-inch round.  With a pastry wheel, trim a 1 1/2-inch-wide strip from two opposite sides of the round, reserving the trimmings.  Then cut the remaining dough into 8 long 1-inch-wide strips.  Place 4 of the strips 2 inches apart over the filling.  Place the remaining strips across the fist strips, at right angles, to create a lattice pattern.

With scissors, cut off the excess dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang.  Turn the dough over toward the center of the tart and press it down below the rim of the pan.  (Gather the dough scraps and trimmings together and reserve for another use, as suggested above.)

Brush the top of the tart with the beaten egg.  Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the top and let it rise for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Bake the tart for 30 to 35 minutes, until the crust is golden brown. Cool the tart on a rack for 30 minutes. Carefully release the spring on the pan and remove the sides of the pan. Place the tart, still on its base, on a serving dish and cut into wedges to serve.

Note:  This tart can also be made in a 2-inch by 9- or 10-inch deep-dish pie pan.

This recipe yields one 9-inch tart; 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  In the spring, when crunchy, crisp spinach appears in my garden, I gather the leaves for this delicious tart.  A bonus is that you will have enough leftover Straight Dough (about 10 ounces) to make a small pizza, miniature rolls, or a handful of breadsticks.  You can make and refrigerate the filling for the tart the day before assembling it.  Serve the tart as a luncheon dish with a marinated carrot or tomato salad, accompanied by glasses of Pinot Grigio.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
  1             medium  avocado
     1/2        recipe  Nonna's Sponge Dough -- (see recipe)
  1             medium  mango -- peeled, seeded,
                        and thinly sliced
  10                    cherry tomatoes - (to 15) -- cut in half
  2                     eggs -- slightly beaten
     1/4           cup  half-and-half
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh basil
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt

Spray a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom with olive oil spray.  Place the pan on a sheet of aluminum foil and bring the edges of the foil up around but not over the sides of the pan, folding it down over itself as necessary.  (This will prevent any leakage in the oven.)  Set the pan aside.

Pour the lemon juice onto a plate.  With a small sharp knife, peel the avocado, cut it in half lengthwise, and remove the pit.  Cut the avocado into thin slices and place them on the plate with the lemon juice.  Turn the slices to coat both sides with lemon juice to prevent discoloration.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Roll the dough out into a 12-inch circle.  Place the dough in the tart pan, letting the excess dough overhang the sides, without stretching the dough: Allow enough slack so the dough will not shrink from the edges when cut.

With the rolling pin, roll over the edge of the pan to cut off excess dough.  (Add the excess dough to the Sponge Dough and shape into a round to make a bonus loaf, or freeze for future use.)

Arrange the mango slices around the inside edge of the tart pan, overlapping them slightly.  Make a circle of the avocado slices, partly covering the mango slices and overlapping the avocado slices slightly.  Fill in the center with the tomato halves.  Cover the tart with a towel and let it rise for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, half-and-half, sugar, and basil together.  Sprinkle the tart with the salt and pour the egg mixture evenly over the top.

Place the tart on a baking sheet and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the edges of the crust are browned and the egg mixture is set.  Remove the pan to a cooling rack and let cool for 45 minutes.

Remove the aluminum foil and the ring of the tart pan.  With a table knife, gently loosen the tart from the bottom of the pan and slip it onto a serving dish.  Cut the tart into wedges with a sharp knife.  The tart is best served slightly warm or at room temperature and best eaten the day it is made.

This recipe yields one 10 1/2-inch tart; 6 servings.

Comments:  Make this elegant tart in the summer, when mangoes, avocados, and tomatoes are in season.  The glistening fruit and vegetables look almost like stained glass on top of the tart.  It is the perfect warm-weather luncheon or supper.  The recipe uses only half of Nonna's Sponge Dough, but while you are at it, why not turn the remaining dough into a round loaf of bread?

Be sure to use a ripe mango when making this tart, but one that is not so soft that it feels soggy; an overripe mango will be difficult to cut into neat slices.  Press your thumb against the mango: at the peak of ripeness, the flesh should yield to slight pressure.  If it is hard, it is under-ripe and the taste will be bitter.

                     Straight Dough - {Pasta Diritta}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry yeast - (0.25 oz)
  1 3/4           cups  warm water -- (110 115 degrees)
                        = (filtered or bottled noncarbonated)
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 4 1/2)
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt

To make the dough using the fontana method, in a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup of the water, stirring to mix well.  Let the yeast proof for about 5 minutes, or until tiny clusters of chalky-looking bubbles appear on the surface.  Stir the remaining 1 1/4 cups water and the olive oil into the proofed yeast.

Mound the flour on a work surface and make a hole in the center of the flour (this is the fontana).  Sprinkle the salt over the flour.  Carefully pour the yeast mixture into the hole.  Using your fingers, begin bringing the flour from the inside wall of the fontana into the liquid, working in a clockwise movement as you incorporate the flour.  Be careful not to break through the wall; if any liquid does leak out, catch it with some of the flour, a shaggy, lumpy mass will form; add just enough flour to make a dough that holds together.  Push the excess flour to the side with a bench knife.

Now you are ready to knead the dough: Knead until you have a soft ball of dough that is slightly tacky but not sticking to your hands, about 5 minutes.  Lightly spray a large bowl with oil spray, put the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat it with oil.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour.

To make the dough by hand in a bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water in a large bowl and proof as directed above, then add the remaining 1 1/4 cups water and the olive oil.  Begin adding the flour to the yeast mixture, 1 cup at a time, mixing it in well with your hands.  Add the salt with the third cup flour.  Add just enough flour so that the dough comes together in a shaggy mass.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and follow the directions above for kneading and rising.

To make the dough in an electric mixer, pour the amount of warm water indicated in the recipe for dissolving the yeast into the bowl of the mixer and sprinkle the yeast over the top.  Attach the dough hook or batter paddle to the mixer and on low speed, mix the yeast into the water.  Let the yeast proof as directed above, then add the remaining water into the bowl and stir on low speed to blend the yeast and water.

Add the flour 1 cup at a time, stirring on low speed to blend the ingredients.  Add the salt with the third addition of flour.  Turn the speed to medium-high and add just enough additional flour to create a dough that moves away from the sides of the bowl and clings to the dough hook or batter paddle.  Stop the machine and feel the dough.  It should be soft, but not sticky or gummy.

If it is too sticky, add more flour, a tablespoon at a time, until the right consistency is obtained.  If the dough is dry and crumbly, add a little water, about a teaspoon at a time, until the dough becomes soft and smooth.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and follow the directions above for kneading and rising.

When the dough has risen and is almost doubled in size, it is ready to be used in recipes.

This recipe yields 1 pound, 14 ounces dough.

Comments:  This dough is called straight dough because is doesn't use a sponge and because it is uncomplicated to put together, requireing just four ingredients:  water, yeast, unbleached flour and salt.  The ingredients may be combined by hand, or in a heavy-duty mixer.

                 Stuffed Artichokes - {Carciofi Ripieni}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  artichokes - (abt 3/4 lb)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  acini di pepe or pastina
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  3             ounces  Asiago cheese -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley
                        juice of 1/2 lemon

Cut off the stems and remove any tough outer leaves from the artichokes.  Trim any needlelike thorns with a scissors.  With a sharp knife, cut the artichokes in half lengthwise.  Use a melon ball scoop to scrap out the fuzzy chokes and discard.  Also discard the yellowish interior leaves.

In a saucepan just large enough to hold them, place the artichokes cut-side down.  Fill the pan with enough water to just cover them.  Add the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of oil.  Cover the pot and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-high and gently boil the artichokes for about 20 minutes, or until a leave is easily detached from the base.  Carefully drain the artichokes in a colander and set aside to cool.

Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan.  Add the salt and pasta, and boil until tender, about 10 minutes.  The pasta will absorb most of the water.  Drain in a colander and place in a bowl.  Add the butter, half the cheese, pepper, and parsley.  Mix well

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

With the remaining tablespoon of oil, grease a 7-inch casserole dish.  Add the artichokes cut-side up in a single layer.  Fill each cavity with some of the pasta mixture, mounding it up slightly.  Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the artichokes.  Cover the casserole with aluminum foil and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until hot.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

               Stuffed Cabbage - {Cavolo Ripieno Di Carne}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  green cabbage
  2             slices  stale Italian bread -- cut into chunks
     1/2           cup  beef broth or water
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick)
     1/4           cup  minced onion
  1 1/2         pounds  ground veal or beef
                        = (or a combination)
  1         tablespoon  fresh rosemary
                        = (or 1 tspn crushed dried rosemary)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon

In a large pot of boiling salted water, parboil the cabbage for about 8 minutes, or until the leaves are wilted.  Drain and let cool.

Meanwhile, soak the bread in the beef broth or water for 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened.  Squeeze dry with your hands and set aside.

In a heavy skillet, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter and saute the onion very slowly over low heat until deep brown and almost caramelized.  Remove the onion to a large bowl.  Add the ground meat to the skillet and brown over medium-high heat.  Add the meat to the onion, along with the herbs, spices, and bread.  Mix well with your hands, but do not overmix.

Using about 3 tablespoons of the meat mixture, form an elongated roll about 3 inches long.  Set on a plate and continue to form rolls with the remaining meat mixture.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Remove the core from the cabbage with a knife and carefully peel off the leaves, one at a time, keeping them whole if possible.

Place a meat roll on the bottom of a cabbage leaf, fold over the sides, and roll up like an egg roll; secure with toothpicks.  Repeat with the remaining meat rolls.  Place the cabbage rolls seam-side down in a baking dish in a single layer.  Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and pour over the cabbage rolls.  Add 1/2 cup water.  Cover the casserole with foil and bake for 45 minutes.  Serve immediately.

Note:  These were always served with boiled potatoes.  They can be frozen for future use after baking, or they can be baked a day ahead and reheated.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Cabbage was another one of those dreaded vegetables that we children seemed to get plenty of.  My mother made stuffed cabbage, boiled cabbage, baked cabbage, and a meatball and cabbage soup.  For stuffed cabbage, she carefully parboiled the cabbage first, just to loosen the leaves from the core.  This made the leaves pliable and easy to roll.

           Stuffed Eggplant Bundles - {Involtini Di Melanzane}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     firm eggplant abt 8" long - (1 1/4 lbs)
  1        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- more or less
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  minced fresh mint or basil
     2/3           cup  chopped Dried Tomatoes In Olive Oil -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat a charcoal or gas grill or the broiler.  Trim off the ends of the eggplant, and stand the eggplant on end.  With a sharp knife, cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices.  You should have 10 to 12 slices.

Grill or broil the eggplant slices until golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes on each side.  Remove to a dish and let cool.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a baking dish.

Lay the eggplant slices on a work surface and brush each slice with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.  Sprinkle with a little sea salt.  Sprinkle the mint or basil, tomatoes, and cheese evenly over the slices.  Starting from a narrow end, roll each slice up like a jelly roll, and place the bundles seam-side down in the baking dish.  Drizzle a little olive oil over the top, and sprinkle with pepper.

Cover the dish with foil.  Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the rolls are heated through.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Involtini are neat bundles of stuffed meat, fish, or vegetables.  The fillings can be as varied as the cook's imagination.  Eggplant works especially well as involtini, and grilling the eggplant first imparts a wonderful roasted flavor.  If dried tomatoes in olive oil are not at hand, substitute thinly sliced fresh tomatoes.

            Tomato And Herb Tart - {Torta Di Pomodori Ed Erbe}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     fresh plum tomatoes -- sliced thin rounds
                        Salt -- to taste
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  3        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
  3        tablespoons  fresh parsley leaves
  3        tablespoons  fresh oregano leaves
  1              small  onion -- peeled and quartered
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     sheet prepared frozen puff pastry -- thawed
                        = (from a 17 1/4-oz package)
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2         pound  Swiss cheese -- diced

Layer the tomato slices in a colander, sprinkling each layer with salt.  Let the tomatoes "sweat" while preparing the other ingredients.

With a knife, mince together the garlic, thyme, parsley, oregano, and onion.  Place the mixture in a small bowl and blend in the pepper and olive oil.  Set the mixture aside.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Lightly grease the bottom of a deep 10 1/2-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Set aside.

On a floured surface, roll the puff pastry into a 14-inch circle and line the bottom and sides of the tart pan, cutting off any overhanging dough.  Prick the dough uniformly with a fork, or line the shell with dried beans to keep it from puffing up.  Bake the shell for 10 minutes, watching carefully so that it does not brown too much.

Remove the shell from the oven, and remove and discard the beans, if used.  Immediately brush the bottom of the tart shell with the mustard.  Fill the shell evenly with the cheese.  Rinse and dry the tomato slices, then place them in overlapping circles over the cheese.  Spread the garlic and herb mixture evenly over the tomatoes.  Place the tart in the oven and bake for 25 minutes.

Cool the tart slightly on a rack, then carefully remove the sides of the pan.  Place the tart on a serving dish and cut into wedges.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  I love making this colorful tart with ripe tomatoes and fresh herbs from my garden.  It is similar to a quiche, but contains no eggs.  It is perfect as a luncheon course, and I also often serve it for dinner with soup or salad.  You can vary the cheese filling, combining favorites, and change the herbs to suit your fancy.  Store-bought puff pastry speeds the preparation time.

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOMATO SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- peeled and minced
  3             pounds  boneless pork butt -- cut into 1" chunks
     1/2         pound  sweet Italian sausage
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cans  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz ea)
  1                can  tomato puree - (28 oz)
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  5                     fresh basil leaves - (to 6) -- shredded
                        === STUFFING ===
  9              large  sweet bell peppers -- washed and dried
  1              pound  ground sirloin
  1              pound  ground pork
  1              pound  ground veal
  2               cups  cooked rice
  1                cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1              large  onion -- peeled and minced
  4                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
  3          teaspoons  sea salt
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  7               cups  Tomato Sauce -- (listed above)

To make the sauce, in a sauce pot heat the olive oil and cook the onion until it softens.  Stir in the pork butt chunks and Italian sausage and brown on all sides.  Stir in the garlic and cook until the garlic softens.  Lower the heat and stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato puree, salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer the sauce for about 1 hour.  Stir in the basil.  The sauce is now ready to use.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut 1/4 -inch off the tops of the peppers.  Carefully remove the seeds with a spoon, then rinse the peppers and set them aside.

In a large bowl, combine the sirloin, pork, veal, rice, cheese, onions, eggs, parsley, salt and pepper.  Mix gently with your hands.  Fill the cavities of the peppers with some of the mixture, being careful not to overpack them or they will split in the oven while baking.

Ladle 1 1/2 cups of tomato sauce in each of 2 large baking pans.  Arrange the peppers upside down in the pans.  Ladle 2 cups of the sauce over each pan of peppers.  Cover the pans tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the peppers are soft.  Remove the pans from the oven, remove the foil, and carefully turn the peppers right-side up.  Serve the peppers immediately with additional sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 9 stuffed peppers.

Comments:  This is one of the most magical dishes of southern Italy, especially from around the province of Avellino, in Campania.  I have often grown sweet bell peppers in my garden, but the sweetness of those I have had from Campania far outshines anything I have ever tasted here.  It is the variety, the intensity of the Mediterranean sun, and the long growing season that accounts for this.  Or maybe it is the proximity of grumpy Mount Vesuvius that has lent richness to the soil over the centuries.  Whatever the reasons, these delicious peppers and the variety of seasonings and stuffings they encase are a favorite of many.  My mother makes hers with ground beef, ground pork, and ground veal and keeps this meat mixture moist by baking the stuffed peppers upside down.  They can be baked a day ahead and are even better as leftovers.  They make a great entree for a party.  Serve a salad and crusty bread and let the party begin!

               Vegetable Frittata - {Frittatina Di Verdure}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/3           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === FRITTATA ===
     1/4         pound  chunk pancetta -- cut into cubes
     1/2         pound  green beans -- julienned
  2              small  new potatoes -- peeled and cubed
  4              small  carrots -- peeled and cubed
  4                     eggs
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     slightly green tomatoes -- thinly sliced
  2              small  zucchini -- cubed
     1/2           cup  shredded arugola
     1/4         pound  ricotta salata cheese -- in chips

Combine the salad dressing ingredients in a jar and set aside.

Fill a plastic bag with ice cubes and 3 cups of water and set aside.

Cook the pancetta in a 10-inch nonstick saute pan until crispy.  Drain the pancetta on paper towels and set aside.

Fill a 1-quart saucepan with 3 cups of water.  Bring the water to a boil and add 1 teaspoon of salt.  Cook the beans uncovered until al dente, just tender; they should retain their crunch.  Remove the beans with a slotted spoon and transfer them to the bag with the ice water.  (This step stops the cooking process and allows the beans to retain their vibrant color.)  Allow the beans to remain in the bag for 3 or 4 minutes, then remove the beans with a slotted spoon and allow them to drain on paper towels.  Add the potatoes to the boiling water and cook until al dente; remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon and set them aside.  Cook the carrots in the same water and drain them as described for the green beans.

Whisk the eggs in a bowl with the parsley and salt.  Set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a non-stick 10-inch skillet.  Pour in the egg mixture and cook until the eggs are set.  Slide the frittatina onto a serving dish.  Cut it into 4 wedges.  Arrange the tomato slices over the top of the frittatina, then the beans, potatoes, carrots, zucchini, arugola, and pancetta.

Pour the dressing over the top and sprinkle the cheese over the dressing.  Serve immediately.

Variation:  If you cannot have eggs in your diet, use Egg Beaters, substituting 1 cup for the 4 eggs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Pietro Cardoni's Umbrian garden had everything I needed to make this vegetable frittatina, and the beauty of this "recipe" allows you to use a variety of your favorite vegetables in this tasty omelet whose flavor is lifted by a balsamic vinegar dressing.  Instead of folding the vegetables into the egg mixture, they are cooked separately to retain their al dente texture, and placed on top of the frittata along with some aged ricotta cheese (ricotta salata) and peppery tasting arugola.  A great luncheon idea!  Other vegetables could include small broccoli or cauliflower flowerets, asparagus, sweet peppers, summer squash, and sugar snap peas.  Get inspired!
