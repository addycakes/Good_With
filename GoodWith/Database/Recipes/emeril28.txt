            Angel Hair-Covered Fried Scallops With Curry Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CURRY SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  4          teaspoons  curry powder
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  fresh orange juice
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        === FOR THE SCALLOPS ===
  16             large  sea scallops
  2              large  eggs -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water
                        Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4         pound  cooked angel hair pasta
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

For the Curry Sauce:  In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and sautÈ until tender, about 3 minutes.  Add the ginger, garlic, and curry powder, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the chicken stock and orange juice, and bring to a boil.  Cook until reduced by 1/2, about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the cream and cook until thickened, about 1 minute.  Strain and serve with the scallops.

For the Scallops:  In a deep fryer or a deep, heavy saucepan, heat vegetable oil to 360 degrees.

Lightly coat the scallops with the eggwash and season the scallops with Essence and salt.  Wrap each scallop with strands of cooked pasta until completely covered like a rubber band ball.  Place the covered scallops in batches in the hot oil and cook just until golden brown, turning, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Serve hot, 4 scallops per person, with the curry sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  thinly-sliced smoked salmon
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  1                cup  sour cream
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  unflavored gelatin
     1/2           cup  minced scallions
  1              large  ripe avocado -- peeled, pitted,
                        and cut into thin slices
  1                jar  salmon roe - (15 oz)
                        Toasted croutons or crackers -- for dipping

Line a 4-cup round mold with plastic wrap.  Lay about 1/3 of the salmon over the plastic wrap, overlapping each slice slightly and hanging the ends over the edge, to cover the mold.  Chop the remaining salmon into 1/2-inch pieces and set aside.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the cream cheese and sour cream until creamy and well combined.  Add the hot pepper sauce and salt and stir well.

In a small saucepan, heat the lemon juice over very low heat.  Pour into a 1/2-cup ramekin and sprinkle with the gelatin, stirring until the gelatin is dissolved.  Remove from the heat and stir into the cream cheese mixture.  Fold in the chopped smoked salmon and scallions.

Spoon 1/3 of the mousse into the mold, top with a layer of avocado slices, then gently spread with 1/2 the salmon roe.  Spread 1/3 of the mousse on top of the roe, and top with the remaining avocado slices and roe.  Spread the remaining mousse over the top and fold the overhanging salmon strips over to completely enclose the mousse.  Cover with the plastic wrap and chill until firm, about 3 hours.

To unmold, place the mold in a bowl of warm water for 10 seconds.  Unwrap the plastic from the bottom of the mold and invert the mold onto a serving plate.  Gently shake to release the mold and unwrap completely.  Serve with toasted croutons or crackers.

This recipe yields about 20 servings as an hors díoeuvre.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     yellow onion -- quartered
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  black peppercorns
  2                     lobsters - (1 1/2 to 2 lbs ea)
  4               cups  mesclun greens
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  ripe avocados -- peeled, pitted,
                        and cut into 1/2" pieces
     1/2           cup  homemade mayonnaise
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  white truffle oil
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh chervil
  1         tablespoon  shaved fresh truffle
  8                     chives

In a large, heavy pot, bring 2 gallons of water, the bay leaves, onions, 1 teaspoon of salt, and peppercorns to a boil.  Add the lobsters to the water and simmer, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes.

Twist tails off lobster bodies and discard bodies.  With kitchen shears remove thin hard membrane from underside of each tail by cutting just inside outer edge of shell.  Remove meat from each tail and cut into bite-size pieces.  Spread the claw and tail meat on a plate and place in the refrigerator to cool, about 15 minutes.

In a medium bowl lightly dress the mesclun greens with the olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Divide the mixture among 4 salad plates.  Cut the avocados in half and remove the seeds and skins.  Place 1/2 an avocado on each salad plate.

Transfer the lobster meat to a medium bowl.  Add the mayonnaise, lemon juice, truffle oil, shallots, chervil, truffle and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and toss lightly to just combine.

Divide the lobster salad among the 4 avocado halves, and garnish with chives.  Serve.

                      Baby Shrimp-Stuffed Artichokes

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  artichokes -- rinsed well
     1/2                lemon -- cut into wedges
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/2         pound  baby shrimp
  3          teaspoons  Emerilís Original Essence -- see * Note
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh oregano
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  2               cups  breadcrumbs
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.

One at a time, cut the stems from the artichokes to leave a neat, flat base.  Lay an artichoke on its side, and cut away the upper third with a sharp knife.  With kitchen shears, remove the prickly leaf tips from each remaining leaf.  Rub the cut sides and bottom with a lemon wedge, squeezing lemon juice onto the cut areas.

Place the prepared artichokes and the lemon wedges in the boiling water and simmer, partially covered, until the bottom is tender and can be pierced with a sharp knife and an outer leaf pulls out easily, about 25 minutes.  Drain upside down in a colander.

While the artichokes are cooking, heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the green onions and garlic, and cook, stirring for 1 minute.  Add the shrimp, 1 teaspoon Essence, salt, parsley, oregano and lemon peel, stirring to mix well, and cook until the shrimp are pink, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

When the artichokes are cool enough to handle, press the leaves gently back so that the artichoke opens to reveal the inner choke and prickly leaves.  Pull out the cone of undeveloped white leaves and gently scrape out the choke with a spoon so as not to damage the heart.

In a large bowl combine the bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons olive oil, Parmesan, lemon juice, remaining 2 teaspoons Essence and shrimp mixture.  Adjust seasoning to taste.  Gently pull the leaves outward from the center until the leaves open slightly.  Fill the artichoke cavities with bread stuffing, then pack a little bit into the space between the leaves.

Place the artichokes in a large baking dish and drizzle the tops with remaining olive oil.  Pour 1/2 cup of water into the bottom of the dish.  Bake until the artichokes are golden brown and the bread crumbs develop a nice crust, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Serve warm.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
  1                cup  dry red wine
     1/2           cup  minced shallots
     1/2      teaspoon  black peppercorns
  4                     monkfish fillets - (6 oz ea)
  2          teaspoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  8                     thin bacon slices
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- cut 10 pieces
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the vinegar, wine, shallots and peppercorns.  Bring to a boil over high heat, and cook until the reduced to about 1/2 cup in volume, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Strain into a clean saucepan.

Season the monkfish lightly on both sides with the Essence and salt.  Place 2 slices of bacon on a flat surface.  Lay 1 fillet on top, skin-side down, and wrap the bacon completely around the fish.  Secure with toothpicks, and repeat with the remaining fish and bacon.

In a large, heavy skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the fillets, skin-side down, and cook for 5 minutes on the first side.  Turn the fillets and cook for an additional 5 minutes on the second side.  Remove the fish to a platter and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm.

Bring the wine reduction to a simmer over medium-low heat.  Whisk in the butter, one piece at a time, allowing each piece to become completely incorporated before adding the next piece.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Spoon 1 tablespoon of sauce on the bottom of 4 serving plates, and place 1 bacon-wrapped monkfish fillet on top.  Spoon the remaining sauce over the fish, and garnish with chopped parsley.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the vinegar, wine, shallots and peppercorns.  Bring to a boil over high heat, and cook until the reduced to about 1/2 cup in volume, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Strain into a clean saucepan.

Season the monkfish lightly on both sides with the Essence and salt.  Place 2 slices of bacon on a flat surface.  Lay 1 fillet on top, skin-side down, and wrap the bacon completely around the fish.  Secure with toothpicks, and repeat with the remaining fish and bacon.

In a large, heavy skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the fillets, skin-side down, and cook for 5 minutes on the first side.  Turn the fillets and cook for an additional 5 minutes on the second side.  Remove the fish to a platter and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm.

Bring the wine reduction to a simmer over medium-low heat.  Whisk in the butter, one piece at a time, allowing each piece to become completely incorporated before adding the next piece.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Spoon 1 tablespoon of sauce on the bottom of 4 serving plates, and place 1 bacon-wrapped monkfish fillet on top.  Spoon the remaining sauce over the fish, and garnish with chopped parsley.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  chopped onions
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne -- to taste
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
  2              large  egg yolks
  4                     boiled pigeons -- skin and bones
                        removed, and meat diced
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped Preserved Lemon -- (see recipe)
  6                     sheets warka or phyllo dough
  8        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  1                     fresh cinnamon stick -- ground
                        Shaker of confectionersí sugar

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a sautÈ pan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter.  Add the onions.  Season with salt and cayenne.  SautÈ until translucent, about 2 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small sautÈ pan, over medium heat.  Add the almonds and sprinkle with sugar.  SautÈ until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.

Stir the flour into the onions and continue to cook for 1 minute.  Stir in the lemon juice and stock and bring to a boil.  Add the egg yolks into the hot liquid and mix well.  (You want the eggs to curdle.)  Continue to cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the mixture thickens.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.  Stir in the pigeon and Preserved Lemon and season with salt and cayenne.

Brush each sheet of phyllo with the melted butter and place each sheet on top of each other, butter-side up.  Line a 9-inch pie pan with the buttered phyllo.  Spoon the pigeon mixture into the pan and spread evenly.  Fold the overlapping phyllo into the pie, brushing with extra butter to seal the pie completely.  Brush the top of the pie with the remaining butter.

Place on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool before slicing.  Slice the pie into individual servings.  Sprinkle the entire pie with the confectionersí sugar and freshly grated cinnamon.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Transfer mixture to a medium mixing bowl.  Add the remaining half of the beans and gradually add the flour until the mixture becomes firm enough to form into a loose ball.  Add salt, pepper, and hot sauce.  If too thick, adjust consistency with bean cooking liquid.

Form cakes using a 4-ounce ice cream scoop.  Dredge in seasoned flour prior to cooking.  Heat a large non-stick sautÈ pan to medium heat and add olive oil.  Cook black bean cakes for 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy.

Place a scant 1/4 cup of Lime Crema on a plate, place Bean Cake on top and garnish with a healthy dollop of Chunky Guacamole.

For Lime Crema:  In a small bowl combine all ingredients.

For Chunky Guacamole:  In a medium mixing bowl, combine all ingredients.  Mash together with a spoon, being careful not to mix too much.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 first course servings.

Serving Size  : 18    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast                       Snacks


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  dried blueberries or other dried fruit
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  5        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1            package  active dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  4               cups  all-purpose flour - (to 4 1/2)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg white -- slightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                cup  honeyed cream cheese -- for spreading

Place the blueberries, sugar and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in the bowl of a food processor, and pulse to make a thick paste.  Grease a large baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of oil and set aside.  Warm the milk in a small saucepan to 110 degrees, and set aside.

Combine the yeast, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 1 tablespoon of oil in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Add the milk to the bowl, and with the mixer on low speed, beat the mixture for 4 minutes to dissolve the yeast.  Add the flour, salt, and blueberry paste to the bowl, and mix on low speed until the dough begins to come together.  Increase the mixing speed to medium and beat until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms a tight ball, about 2 minutes.

Oil a large mixing bowl with 1 tablespoon of oil.  Remove the dough from the mixer and place it in the oiled mixing bowl, turning to lightly coat with oil.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel, and set in a warm, draft-free place.  Let the dough rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.

Remove the dough from the bowl and turn it onto a lightly floured surface.  Roll the dough into a 12-inch by 10-inch rectangle.  Cut the dough with a sharp knife into 18 pieces (about 1/4-cup each).  Gently roll and pull each one into a long thin ribbon, about 1/2-inch in diameter and 14-inches in length.  Bring the ends up to form a U-shape and twist to form a wreath, bringing the ends down and across as though making a bow, pressing down to seal the ends.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.   Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the pretzels in batches of 6.  Cook, turning once, about 2 minutes on each side.  Remove from the water and drain on paper towels.

Combine the beaten egg with 2 tablespoons of water.  Brush the pretzels with the mixture and sprinkle with a combination of the remaining sugar and 1/2-teaspoon cinnamon.  Place on the prepared baking pan and bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.

Remove the pretzels from the oven, and serve warm with honeyed cream cheese.

This recipe yields 18 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  butternut squash - (abt 1 1/2 to 2 lbs)
  1              pound  fresh green Poblano chiles - (abt 4)
                        = (or 1 cup canned Poblanos)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped yellow onion
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
  1                cup  grated Monterey Jack

With a vegetable peeler, peel the squash, then cut in half, and remove the seeds.  Cut the squash into 1/4-inch pieces.

Roast the peppers by placing them over a stovetop gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, about 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler, or on top of a gas or charcoal grill.)  Place the blackened peppers in a plastic or paper bag, and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.  Remove the stems and seeds, and chop.

Heat the oil in a large skillet or sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the squash, salt, and chili powder, and stir well.  Cover and cook until the squash is almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 to 12 minutes.

Stir in chiles and cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes.  Sprinkle the cheese over the vegetables and cover.  Lower the heat to medium-low and cook until the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes.

Serve hot out of the pan.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  1                     cabbage - (abt 2 to 2 1/2 lbs)
  2              large  Idaho potatoes - (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
  12            ounces  lean bacon -- cut 1/2" dice
  2               cups  lengthwise-sliced peeled yellow onions
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  homemade chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-sodium chicken broth)

  1                cup  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  6               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Powdered sugar
                        Steenís Pure Cane Syrup -- (optional)

Bring 3 cups of water to a boil with the salt.  Add the rice and cook until it is soft and slightly mushy, about 30 minutes.

In a bowl dissolve the yeast in the 1/2 cup warm water.  Add the rice and stir well to mix.  Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, draft-free place for at least 4 hours or overnight.

Beat the eggs with the sugar, flour and cinnamon, and fold into the rice mixture to make a thick batter.  Let rise, covered, in a warm place for 30 minutes.

In a large saucepan, heat the oil to 360 degrees.  Drop the batter by tablespoonfuls into the hot oil and cook, turning, until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving, and drizzle with Steenís syrup, if desired.

This recipe yields about 24 cakes, or 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  confectionersí sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-chopped lemon zest
  3        tablespoons  honey
     1/3           cup  flour
  3        tablespoons  rolled oats -- lightly toasted
  12                    fresh figs
     1/2           cup  simple syrup -- cooled
                        = (equal amounts water and sugar heated
                        until sugar dissolves)
  2        tablespoons  port
  6        tablespoons  heavy cream
  2             ounces  goatsí cheese
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
                        Goatsí Cheese Ice Cream -- (see below)
                        Spicy Fig Sauce -- (see below)
  1         tablespoon  baby thyme sprigs
                        === GOAT CHEESE ICE CREAM ===
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  milk
  4                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  corn syrup
  4             ounces  goat cheese
                        === SPICY FIG SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice -- warm
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh figs
  1                     star anise
  3              whole  black peppercorns

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

To make the tuiles:  In a mixer fitted with a paddle, cream the butter, sugar, and lemon zest.  Add the honey and flour and mix well.  Spread about 1/2 teaspoon of the batter onto a Silpat-lined or nonstick sheet pan.  Use a small offset spatula to spread the tuile into a 1 3/4-inch circle.  Repeat the process, making at least 18 tuiles (the extra will allow for breakage).

Sprinkle the top of each tuile with a pinch of rolled oats, reserving 1/2 tablespoon for garnish.  Bake for 5 minutes, or until golden brown.  (The tuiles may be cut with a ring cutter after cooking for a more precise shape.)  Immediately transfer the tuile to a countertop or other flat surface to cool.

To prepare the figs:  Cut the tops off 6 of the figs.  Use a small spoon to press a cavity into each fig and dip the whole fig in the simple syrup.  Fill the figs with the port.  (If the figs have any holes in the bottoms, cut small pieces off the tops to fill the holes.)

Place the filled figs on a sheetpan and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes, or until they have softened.  Slice the remaining 6 figs in half lengthwise and then cut them crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices.  Warm the slices in the remaining simple syrup.

To make the goat cheese cream:  Thoroughly combine 2 tablespoons of the heavy cream with the goat cheese and granulated sugar.  Whisk the remaining 1/4 cup cream until it reaches soft peaks and fold into the goat cheese mixture.

To assemble, place 3 to 4 fig slices on one half of each plate.  Place a small spoonful of the goat cheese cream on the figs and top with a tuile.  Spoon another small spoonful of the cream, 3 to 4 fig slices, another tablespoon of the cream, and a tuile on top of the first stack.  Build another layer with a spoon of cream, figs, another spoonful of cream, and a tuile.  Place a roasted fig alongside the stacked figs and top with a quenelle of Goat Cheese Ice Cream.  Spoon the Spicy Fig Sauce around the plates and sprinkle with the thyme sprigs and the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oatmeal.

For Goat Cheese Ice Cream:  Prepare an ice water bath.  Bring the cream and milk to a boil.  Whisk together the egg yolks, and sugar, and slowly pour in some of the hot cream to temper the eggs.  Pour the eggs into the cream and continue to cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the mixture coats the back of a spoon and steam rises from the top.  Whisk together the corn syrup and goat cheese and then whisk this mixture into the cream mixture until smooth.  Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and chill over the ice water bath.  Freeze in an ice cream machine.  Keep frozen until ready to use.  (Makes approximately 3 cups)

For Spicy Fig Sauce:  Cook the sugar in a heavy-bottomed sautÈ pan over medium heat for 3 minutes, or until golden brown.  Add the orange juice and bring to a boil.  Add the figs, star anise, and peppercorns, bring to a boil, and cook for 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh sieve, pushing on the solids to remove as much liquid as possible.  If necessary, thin with a little warm water to a make a sauce consistency.  (Makes 1/2 cup)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the tuiles:  In a mixer fitted with a paddle, cream the butter, sugar, and lemon zest.  Add the honey and flour and mix well.  Spread about 1/2 teaspoon of the batter onto a Silpat-lined or nonstick sheet pan.  Use a small offset spatula to spread the tuile into a 1 3/4-inch circle.  Repeat the process, making at least 18 tuiles (the extra will allow for breakage).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sprinkle the top of each tuile with a pinch of rolled oats, reserving 1/2 tablespoon for garnish.  Bake for 5 minutes, or until golden brown.  (The tuiles may be cut with a ring cutter after cooking for a more precise shape.)  Immediately transfer the tuile to a countertop or other flat surface to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the figs:  Cut the tops off 6 of the figs.  Use a small spoon to press a cavity into each fig and dip the whole fig in the simple syrup.  Fill the figs with the port.  (If the figs have any holes in the bottoms, cut small pieces off the tops to fill the holes.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the filled figs on a sheetpan and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes, or until they have softened.  Slice the remaining 6 figs in half lengthwise and then cut them crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices.  Warm the slices in the remaining simple syrup.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the goat cheese cream:  Thoroughly combine 2 tablespoons of the heavy cream with the goat cheese and granulated sugar.  Whisk the remaining 1/4 cup cream until it reaches soft peaks and fold into the goat cheese mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble, place 3 to 4 fig slices on one half of each plate.  Place a small spoonful of the goat cheese cream on the figs and top with a tuile.

Recipe By     :Courtesy of Julia Child
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheese                          Egg Dishes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  softened butter
  2        tablespoons  finely-grated Parmesan
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1                cup  hot milk
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
  1              pinch  nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  4                     egg yolks
  5                     egg whites
  1                cup  coarsely-grated Swiss cheese

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Butter a 6-cup soufflÈ or straight-sided baking dish with 1 1/2 tablespoons butter.  Dust the interior of the dish with the Parmesan and knock out the excess.

In a large saucepan, melt the remaining butter over medium high heat.  Stir in the flour and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the butter and flour foam and froth.  Remove the pan from the heat and beat in the hot milk, then simmer over medium heat and stir slowly until thick, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the seasonings, then the egg yolks, 1 by 1.

Whip the egg whites to stiff, shining peaks, then whisk 1/4 of them into the sauce to lighten it.  Delicately fold the remaining egg whites into the sauce, alternating with the grated Swiss cheese.

Turn the soufflÈ mixture into the prepared dish and set in the oven.  Reduce the heat to 375 degrees and bake until the soufflÈ has puffed 1 or 2 inches above the rim and has browned on top, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     slabs baby back ribs - (to 6)
                        = (abt 10 to 12 ribs per slab)
                        Chinese five-spice powder -- to taste
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ORANGE-CHIPOTLE GLAZE ===
  1                cup  orange juice
  2               cups  cider vinegar
  1                can  chipotle peppers in adobo sauce - (7 oz) -- pureed in the
                        blender or finely chopped
  1                cup  soy sauce
  8               cups  sugar

Preheat a home smoker to 200 degrees.

Season the ribs on both sides with spices.  Place the ribs in the preheated home smoker, and smoke for 20 minutes.  Remove the ribs from the smoker and allow to cool.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Wrap the ribs in plastic wrap, then in foil, place on a baking sheet, and bake at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.  Remove the ribs from the oven and allow to cool while still wrapped.

Prior to serving, spoon the Orange-Chipolte Glaze over the ribs, liberally coating both sides.  Serve 1 slab of ribs per person, and pass the Orange-Chipotle Glaze at the table.

For Orange-Chipotle Glaze:  In a heavy 3-gallon non-reactive stockpot, reduce the orange juice to 1/4 cup.  Add the remaining ingredients and cook over medium-high heat until the sugar has melted and the sauce has reduced to 4 cups and coats the back of a spoon, about 20 to 30 minutes.  Note:  Be sure to use a large pot as specified, and also watch carefully while reducing the glaze -- it has a tendency to overboil!  (Makes 4 cups sauce)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  crushed achiote seeds
                        = (or substitute chili powder)
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
  3          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  turmeric
  1 1/2       teaspoon  ground cumin -- divided
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     chicken - (abt 3 lbs) -- quartered
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  thinly-sliced white onions
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     3/4           cup  chopped seeded tomatoes
                        Banana leaves

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a bowl mix together the achiote seeds, lime juice, 2 teaspoons of the garlic, turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin and 1/2 teaspoon salt to make a smooth paste.  Place the chicken in a glass dish and coat with the paste.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let marinate refrigerated for at least 4 and up to 8 hours.

In a large sautÈ pan heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, bay leaves, Essence, 1 teaspoon cumin and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and sautÈ until caramelized, about 10 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and sautÈ until soft.  Add the chicken pieces and any reserved marinade to the pot and brown on all sides.  Remove the pan from the heat.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Line a baking dish with banana leaves.  Place 1 banana leaf on a work surface, and place 1 chicken piece in the middle.  Spoon 1/4 of the onion-tomato mixture onto the chicken and wrap the leaf around the chicken as though sealing a package.  Place in the lined baking dish and repeat with the remaining chicken and sauce.

Bake the chicken until cooked through and tender, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and serve the chicken wrapped in the leaves with the accumulated pan juices.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

In a bowl mix together the achiote seeds, lime juice, 2 teaspoons of the garlic, turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin and 1/2 teaspoon salt to make a smooth paste.  Place the chicken in a glass dish and coat with the paste.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let marinate refrigerated for at least 4 and up to 8 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large sautÈ pan heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, bay leaves, Essence, 1 teaspoon cumin and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and sautÈ until caramelized, about 10 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and sautÈ until soft.  Add the chicken pieces and any reserved marinade to the pot and brown on all sides.  Remove the pan from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Line a baking dish with banana leaves.  Place 1 banana leaf on a work surface, and place 1 chicken piece in the middle.  Spoon 1/4 of the onion-tomato mixture onto the chicken and wrap the leaf around the chicken as though sealing a package.  Place in the lined baking dish and repeat with the remaining chicken and sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the chicken until cooked through and tender, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and serve the chicken wrapped in the leaves with the accumulated pan juices.

       Chile-Scrambled Eggs, Fried Oysters, Emeril's Pico De Gallo

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  masa harina
  1         tablespoon  Emeril's Original Essence -- see * Note
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1               pint  oysters -- drained
  6               cups  vegetable oil
  4                     corn tortillas
  9              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  chopped green onion, white and green tops
  1         tablespoon  minced red chile peppers
  2               cups  Emerilís Pico De Gallo -- (see below)
     1/2           cup  sour cream
                        === EMERIL'S PICO DE GALLO ===
  1 1/2         pounds  plum tomatoes -- cored, seeded,
                        and diced
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped white onion
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  minced seeded jalapeÒo or serrano chiles -- (abt 2 medium)
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Season the masa harina with the Essence and cumin in a shallow bowl.  Dredge the oysters in the mixture a few at a time to coat evenly, and shake off the excess.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat the oil in a large, heavy saucepan to 360 degrees.  Add the oysters and fry, without crowding and turning occasionally, until golden and cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Remove the oysters with a long-handled spoon and drain on paper towels.

Place the corn tortillas on a baking sheet, sprinkle with water and warm in the preheated oven for 3 minutes.  Lightly beat the eggs in a bowl with the salt, and set aside.

Heat the butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the green onions and chili pepper to the pan and cook over medium-high heat for 1 minute.  Add the eggs to the pan and, stirring constantly, scramble to desired consistency.

Place 1 warm tortilla on each serving plate.  Divide the scrambled eggs and oysters among the plates, then top each portion with 1/4-cup of the Pico de Gallo and 2 tablespoons of sour cream.  Serve immediately, passing the remaining Pico de Gallo at tableside.

For Emerilís Pico de Gallo:  Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and stir well.  Cover and allow to rest at room temperature for 1 hour for the flavors to blend.  (Makes about 3 cups)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
  8                     eggs
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/3           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1                cup  bleached flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        === TO FINISH ===
  1              pound  confectionersí sugar
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1              stick  butter -- room temperature
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/3           cup  boiling water
  2               cups  heavy cream
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- melted
     3/4           cup  simple syrup - (equal amounts of sugar
                        and water simmered until sugar dissolves)
  3             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- shaved into curls
  10            scoops  vanilla bean ice cream - (to 12)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

For the cake:  Put the eggs and 1 cup of the sugar in a large mixing bowl and, with an electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk, beat on medium-high speed until the mixture is pale yellow, thick and has tripled in volume, about 8 minutes.  Sift the cocoa, flour and baking powder together in another large mixing bowl.  Add the egg mixture and fold to mix thoroughly.

Grease 2 (9- by 2-inch) round cake pans with the butter.  Sprinkle each with a tablespoon of the remaining sugar.  Pour the cake batter evenly into the pans and bake until the cake springs back when touched, about 25 minutes.  Let cool for about 2 minutes.  Using a thin knife, loosen the edges of the cakes and flip onto a wire rack.  Let cool completely.

Sift together the confectionersí sugar and cocoa powder into a medium-size bowl.  Add the butter and mix with an electric mixer until incorporated.  Add the vanilla and boiling water and mix until smooth.  Let cool.  In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the cream and the chocolate.  On medium speed.  Whip until stiff peaks form, set aside.

To assemble the cake:  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place a wire rack over it.  Using a serrated knife, cut each cake in half horizontally.  Brush the tops of three of the layers with 1/4 cup of the simple syrup.  Place the bottom layer on a 9-inch round of cardboard and set it on the wire rack.  Spread 3/4 cup of the mousse evenly on top of the cake.  Top with a second layer of cake.  Spread another 3/4 cup of the mousse over the top of the cake.  Repeat the same process with the third layer.  Top with the fourth layer.  If necessary, shave off any uneven pieces of the cake with a serrated knife so that it is smooth and even on all sides.  Chill for 2 hours.

Spread the frosting evenly over the sides and top of the cake.  Refrigerate until the frosting sets.  Place the chocolate curls on top of the cake.  Slice and serve with the ice cream.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     sheets frozen puff pastry
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  milk -- for egg wash
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  6                     saffron threads
  1                cup  crËme fraiche or sour cream
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  minced chives
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     3/4         pound  jumbo lump crabmeat -- picked over
                        to remove any cartilage and shell
  1              ounce  Sevruga caviar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  24                    baby asparagus spears -- trimmed, and
                        lightly steamed until tender
                        Halved red grape tomatoes -- for garnish
                        Chives -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Roll out each sheet of pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 10-inch square.  Cut out 3 (3- by 5-inch) rectangles and paint with the egg glaze.  Transfer to lightly greased cookie sheet and bake until puffed and brown, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to a rack and cool.

In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, gently heat the white wine.  Remove from the heat and stir in the saffron.  Let infuse for 10 minutes, then strain the wine into a clean bowl.  Stir the crËme fraiche into the saffron wine, and set aside.

In a bowl combine the mayonnaise, chives and lemon juice, and stir well.  Fold in the crabmeat, and then gently fold in the caviar, being careful not to break the eggs.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Split each pastry into 2 layers.  Place 1 layer on each of 4 plates.  Spread a layer of crabmeat salad on top of the pastry, and lay 3 asparagus spears on top.  Drizzle a bit of saffron crËme fraiche over the asparagus, then top with pastry, and continue layering, ending with a layer of pastry on top.  Drizzle saffron crËme fraiche over the pastry layer, and continue with the remaining 3 servings.  (Each napoleon will have 2 crabmeat and asparagus layers, and 3 pastry layers.)

Serve garnished with grape tomatoes and chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Pies


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh ripe peaches
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2              pints  fresh raspberries -- picked over
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  2               cups  heavy cream
  4                     egg yolks
                        === CINNAMON CRUST ===
  2               cups  bleached all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  lard
  3        tablespoons  ice water - (to 4) -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  cinnamon sugar -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Put the peaches in a shallow baking pan and rub with the olive oil.  Season with the salt and pepper.  Bake until very tender, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool completely.  Peel and stone the peaches, reserving the peels and stones.

Put the peaches in a food processor, reserving any juice, and puree until smooth.  Combine the reserved peach juice with the cornstarch to make a slurry.  Combine the slurry with the peach puree and cook over medium heat until thick, about 5 minutes.  Add the honey and mix well.  Cool and refrigerate until ready to use.

For the ice cream, in a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the peach peels and stones, the raspberries, sugar and the cream.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Remove the stones, then puree the mixture using a hand-held blender or food processor.  Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve.  Place the mixture back in the saucepan.

In a separate small bowl, whisk the yolks until smooth.  Add 1/2 cup of the cream mixture to the yolks and whisk well.  Add the yolk mixture back to the cream and continue to cook for 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh sieve.  Cool in an ice bath until chilled.  Freeze in an ice cream machine according to manufactures directions.  Keep frozen until ready to use.

For the crust, combine the flour, cinnamon, sugar, and salt, in a medium-size mixing bowl.  Add the lard and work it in with your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the water 1 tablespoon at a time, working it in with your hands.  Add only as much as you need for a smooth ball of dough to form.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

To assemble, remove the crust from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature.  Lightly dust the work surface with flour.  Divide the dough in half, saving half for later use.

Roll the dough out 1/8-inch thick into a 14-inch circle.  Using a 6-inch round cutter, cut the dough into 6 circles.  Spread a sixth of the peach filling in the center of each round, fold the dough over, and crimp the edges together with a fork.

Heat a deep-fryer to 360 degrees.  Fry the pies, 2 to 3 at time, until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels.  Season with the cinnamon sugar.

Serve each pie with a scoop of the Roasted Peach and Raspberry Ice Cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

     1/2           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  Armagnac
  8              large  ripe figs - (to 12) -- washed, stemmed,
                        and halved
  11            ounces  goat cheese -- softened
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  ricotta
  3                     egg yolks
     1/3           cup  flour
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                     nine-inch blind-baked savory piecrust -- (see below)
  8                     paper-thin slices prosciutto
                        === SAVORY PIE CRUST ===
  1 1/4            cup  flour
  1              stick  cold butter
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  ice water

For Savory Pie Crust:  In a food processor, combine the flour, butter and salt and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Drizzle in the water and pulse until the mixture comes together.  Turn out of the food processor and form into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

In a small saucepan heat honey and Armagnac and whisk to combine well.  Pour into a glass casserole or shallow bowl and place figs cut-side down on top of mixture.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Into a large mixing bowl place the goat cheese, butter, and Ricotta, and beat ingredients with a mixer on high speed until smooth.  Add egg yolks 1 at a time, then the flour, rosemary, thyme, salt and white pepper, mixing well to incorporate.

Pour the cheese mixture into the prepared pie crust and bake in preheated oven until top is golden and filling is set, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Remove from oven and allow to cool for 30 minutes before serving with the macerated figs and shaved prosciutto.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  pasta sheets
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  crumbled goat cheese
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped toasted walnuts
     1/2           cup  minced fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced lemon peel
                        === SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped shallots
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Asiago or Parmesan

In a bowl combine the goat cheese, walnuts, basil, oil, garlic and lemon peel, and mix well.  Set aside.

Put pasta sheet on work surface with long side facing you and put packed teaspoon of filling 2 inches apart lengthwise along half of the pasta sheet (you should have 10 to 12 mounds).  Around each mound of filling brush dough very lightly with water.  Fold dough lengthwise in half over mounds of filling, gently pressing around mounds to force out any air, and seal edges well.  With a fluted pastry wheel trim edges and cut between mounds of filling to separate ravioli.

Line a large tray with a dry kitchen towel and arrange ravioli in 1 layer.  Make more ravioli with remaining 2 pieces of dough and remaining filling in same manner, transferring to kitchen-towel-lined tray and arranging in 1 layer.  Ravioli may be made 8 hours ahead and chilled on towel-lined tray, covered loosely with plastic wrap.

Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the walnuts and cook, stirring, until brown and fragrant, about 3 minutes.  Remove nuts from the pan.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, shallots and garlic, and sautÈ for 1 minute.  Add the wine and cream, and bring to a boil.  Cook over medium-high until the liquid has thickened and reduced by nearly 50 percent in volume, about 4 minutes.  Stir in the basil, salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Cook the ravioli until they are tender and rise to the surface, carefully stirring to keep them from sticking together, 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain in a colander.  Transfer the cooked ravioli to the pan with the sauce, and gently toss to coat and heat through.

Divide the ravioli among 6 serving plates or shallow bowls, and sprinkle each serving with grated cheese.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                          Greek Stuffed Eggplant

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  eggplants - (abt 1 1/4 lbs ea) -- split lengthwise
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  ground lamb or lamb sausage removed
                        from casings and crumbled
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onion
     1/2           cup  chopped green bell peppers
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3             medium  Roma plum tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley leaves
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh oregano
  1                cup  bread crumbs
  1                cup  crumbled Feta

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Halve the eggplants lengthwise and with a sharp knife score the pulp in a diamond pattern, being careful not to pierce the skins.  Scoop out the pulp with a spoon, leaving a 1/2-inch shell.  Chop the pulp.

Place the eggplant shells on a greased baking sheet and lightly brush the inside of each half with about 1 teaspoon of olive oil.  Bake until the shells are softened but not brown, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool.

In a heavy skillet heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat.  Add lamb and cook, stirring, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon to drain on paper towels.

Add the onions and bell peppers to the fat in the pan and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, eggplant, salt, Essence and pepper, and cook until the eggplant is soft, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook until they give off their liquid, 3 minutes.  Add the parsley and oregano, and stir well.

Remove from the heat.  Stir in 3/4 cup of bread crumbs and mix well into the vegetables.  Stir in the feta, and re-season as needed.

Divide the filling among the eggplant shells, and sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of bread crumbs over the tops.  Bake until the tops are golden and the stuffing is heated through, about 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     swordfish fillets - (6 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === CAPONATA RELISH ===
     1/3           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped yellow onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1              large  eggplant - (abt 2 lbs) -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  chopped seeded tomatoes -- (abt 4 large)
  1                cup  chopped pitted green olives
  1                cup  toasted pine nuts
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped fresh basil leaves

Preheat a gas or charcoal grill.

Rub both sides of the fillets with olive oil and season lightly with the salt and pepper.  Grill until the fish is cooked, but still slightly rare in the center, turning once, about 7 minutes.   Remove from the heat and serve with the Caponata Relish.

Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and sautÈ for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, and sautÈ for 30 seconds.  Add the eggplant and salt, and cook until softened, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and sautÈ until thickened, about 12 minutes.

Add the olives and pine nuts, and stir in the vinegar mixture 1 tablespoon at a time until the desired consistency and flavor is reached.  Stir in the basil and remove from the heat.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.  (Makes about 5 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        === PESTO OIL ===
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cups  basil leaves - (loosely packed)
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        === GRILLED VEGETABLES ===
  4             medium  zucchini -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/4" slices
  4                     red or yellow bell peppers -- roasted, seeded,
                        and peeled
  2             medium  eggplants - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- cut 1/4" rounds
  2              large  yellow onions -- cut 1/4" rounds
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a medium bowl mix the ricotta cheese with salt and half a cup of Pesto Oil.

Lightly grease a large rectangular baking dish, then spoon 1/2 cup of Puttanesca Sauce onto the bottom of the dish.  Cover with a layer of lasagna noodles.  Top the lasagna with a layer of ricotta, then a layer of eggplant, zucchini, onion and red pepper, a layer of grated mozzarella, and a layer of puttanesca sauce.  Repeat layering the lasagna, ricotta, vegetables, mozzarella and sauce in this manner until all ingredients have been used, ending with mozzarella on top.

Bake until the lasagna is bubbling and golden brown, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Allow to rest 10 minutes before serving, drizzled with some of the remaining pesto oil.

For Puttanesca Sauce:  In a large pot heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and sautÈ until soft and lightly caramelized, about 6 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook an additional 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and the remaining ingredients and simmer until the sauce is thickened and slightly reduced, about 40 minutes.  Adjust seasoning to taste, cover and set aside.

For Pesto Oil:  In the bowl of a food processor or blender place the garlic and basil and process on high while adding the olive oil in a steady stream.  Continue to process until well blended, season with salt to taste and set aside until ready to assemble lasagna.

For Grilled Vegetables:  Light the grill or pre-heat the broiler.

In a large shallow bowl, toss the eggplant, zucchini, bell pepper and onion with the oil and salt.  If using the broiler, arrange the vegetables in a single layer on 2 lightly greased or non-stick baking sheets.  Grill or broil in batches, turning the vegetables once, until they are tender, lightly browned, and have released most of their moisture, about 5 to 6 minutes per side.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  chicken pieces
  2               cups  distilled white vinegar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  distilled white vinegar
  2               cups  finely-chopped scallions
  2                     Scotch bonnets -- seeded, minced
                        = (please wear gloves)
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  4        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  5          teaspoons  ground allspice
  2                     bay leaves
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried thyme -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
                        === JAMAICAN BARBECUE SAUCE ===
  1 1/4           cups  ketchup
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  Jamaican hot pepper sauce
  2        tablespoons  Jerk marinade -- reserved from above
  3                     scallions -- minced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
     1/3           cup  dark brown sugar
     1/3           cup  distilled white vinegar
  3        tablespoons  dark rum

Rinse chicken pieces well in 2 cups of the vinegar, drain, transfer to 2 sealable plastic bags and set aside.

In the bowl of a food processor combine remaining 1 teaspoon vinegar, scallions, Scotch bonnets, soy sauce, lime juice, allspice, bay leaves, garlic, salt, sugar, thyme, and cinnamon.  Reserve 2 tablespoons of the jerk marinade for the Jamaican Barbecue Sauce.

Rinse chicken pieces well under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels.  Divide chicken pieces between 2 heavy-duty gallon plastic sealable bags and divide marinade evenly between the 2.  Turn bags over to evenly distribute marinade, and refrigerate chicken for at least 24 hours and up to 2 days.

On an oiled grill rack set about 6 inches above red-hot coals, grill chicken (in batches if necessary), covered, for 10 to 15 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.  Transfer to a warm platter and keep warm until serving.

Serve with Jamaican Barbecue Sauce, alongside fried plantains, rice, or bread of choice.

For Jamaican Barbecue Sauce:  In a medium non-reactive saucepan combine all ingredients except rum and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar.  Reduce heat to a simmer and continue to cook another 12 minutes, until sauce is thick and flavorful and coats the back of a spoon.  Remove from heat and stir in rum.  Cool sauce to room temperature before serving.  (Makes about 2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Rinse chicken pieces well under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels.  Divide chicken pieces between 2 heavy-duty gallon plastic sealable bags and divide marinade evenly between the 2.  Turn bags over to evenly distribute marinade, and refrigerate chicken for at least 24 hours and up to 2 days.

On an oiled grill rack set about 6 inches above red-hot coals, grill chicken (in batches if necessary), covered, for 10 to 15 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.  Transfer to a warm platter and keep warm until serving.

<DirT>
Serve with Jamaican Barbecue Sauce, alongside fried plantains, rice, or bread of choice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Jamaican Barbecue Sauce:  In a medium non-reactive saucepan combine all ingredients except rum and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar.  Reduce heat to a simmer and continue to cook another 12 minutes, until sauce is thick and flavorful and coats the back of a spoon.  Remove from heat and stir in rum.  Cool sauce to room temperature before serving.  (Makes about 2 cups)

  8             ounces  bacon -- cut 1/2" dice
  2             pounds  lamb shoulder or lamb chops -- cut 1" pieces,
                        bones reserved
  2        tablespoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  flour
  2               cups  diced yellow onions
  1                cup  diced carrots
  1                cup  diced leeks
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2                     bay leaves
  2               cups  Guinness or Murphyís Stout
  1                cup  beef stock
  1              pound  very small potatoes - (abt 1" dia)
                        = (or quartered larger potatoes)

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until the fat is rendered and just brown.  Remove the bacon and drain on paper towels.  Remove all but 3 tablespoons oil from the pan.

Season the lamb with the Essence and salt, and sprinkle with the flour.  Add the meat and bones to the pan and sautÈ until brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Remove the meat and bones from the pan.

Add the onions, carrots and leeks to the pan and sautÈ over medium-high heat until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, parsley, thyme and bay leaves, and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the stout, beef stock and potatoes, and return the meat and bones to the pot.  Stir well and bring to a boil.

Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until the lamb and vegetables are tender, about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally and skimming any fat that forms on the surface.

Remove from the heat, adjust seasoning, to taste, and discard the lamb bones.  Serve hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  6                     strips bacon -- diced
     1/4         pound  ham -- diced
     1/2         pound  ground veal or ground pork
                        = (or 1/4 lb of each)
  1              pound  ground beef
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onion
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped carrot
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced mushrooms
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pinch  ground cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1                cup  dry white wine
  3               cups  chicken stock
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     chicken livers -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh spinach pasta
                        Bechamel Sauce -- (see below)
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        === BECHAMEL ===
  6        tablespoons  butter
  6        tablespoons  flour
  4 1/2           cups  milk
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg

In a large pot heat the butter over medium high heat.  Add the bacon and ham and sautÈ until caramelized and light brown, about 10 minutes.  Add the ground meats and cook over high heat until well-browned, stirring constantly, about 20 minutes.

Add the onions, carrots, celery, and mushrooms and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, cloves and nutmeg to the pan and cook for 2 minutes.  Add tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the wine and cook until almost evaporated.

Add stock and simmer over medium-high heat until sauce is thickened and flavorful, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Add the chicken livers to the pot and cook 5 minutes.  Stir in the cream and parsley, and adjust seasoning if necessary.  Set aside until ready to assemble lasagna.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Butter a large rectangular baking dish, then spoon 1/2-cup of meat sauce onto the bottom of the dish.  Cover with 1 sheet of fresh pasta.  Top the lasagna with a layer of meat sauce (making certain that pasta is completely covered), a layer of bÈchamel, then a light dusting of cheese.  Repeat layering lasagna, sauces, and cheese in this manner until all have been used, ending with a topping of bÈchamel and cheese.

Bake until the lasagna is bubbling and golden brown, about 1 hour.  Allow to rest 10 minutes before serving.

For BÈchamel:  In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat and stir in the flour, stirring constantly until smooth, about 2 minutes.  Slowly whisk the milk into the flour, stirring vigorously to blend together.  Set over high heat and quickly bring to a boil for 1 minute, stirring.  Allow to cook another 5 minutes, or until floury taste is gone.  Remove from heat and add salt and nutmeg to taste.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

     1/2         pound  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" wedges
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
     1/4           cup  small-diced red bell peppers

     1/2           cup  chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan Reggiano
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
  3        tablespoons  Creole mustard
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  5          teaspoons  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     3/4           cup  bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  water
                        === SOUR CREAM REMOULADE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chervil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a small, heavy saucepan, place the potatoes, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and enough water to cover by 1 inch.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer and until the potatoes are fork tender, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and drain in a colander.

Return the potatoes to the saucepan.  Add the cream, butter and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.  With the heat on medium-low, mash until well blended, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

In a medium sautÈ pan heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and peppers, and sautÈ until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and sautÈ for 1 minute.  Remove the pan from the heat and let cool.

In a bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, cooked vegetables, crab meat, green onions, grated cheese, parsley, Creole mustard, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 2 teaspoons Essence, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Mix to incorporate.

In a shallow bowl, season the flour with 1 teaspoon of the Essence.  In another bowl, whisk the remaining egg with the water.  In a third bowl, combine the bread crumbs and 1 teaspoon of the Essence.

Divide the crab-potato mixture into 1/3-cup portions, and form into patties about 1-inch thick.  Dredge both sides of each cake in the seasoned flour, dip in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off, then dredge in the seasoned bread crumbs, covering both sides completely.  Set aside on a baking sheet to bread the remaining mixture.

In a large, heavy skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over high heat.  Carefully add the cakes to the pan being careful not to overcrowd, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side.

Remove the cakes from the pan and drain on a paper-lined plate.  Season the cakes with the remaining teaspoon of Essence and serve immediately with Sour Cream Remoulade Sauce.

For Sour Cream Remoulade Sauce:  Mix all ingredients together and season with salt and pepper.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 10 cakes, 5 servings.

In a small, heavy saucepan, place the potatoes, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and enough water to cover by 1 inch.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer and until the potatoes are fork tender, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and drain in a colander.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the potatoes to the saucepan.  Add the cream, butter and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.  With the heat on medium-low, mash until well blended, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium sautÈ pan heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and peppers, and sautÈ until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and sautÈ for 1 minute.  Remove the pan from the heat and let cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, cooked vegetables, crab meat, green onions, grated cheese, parsley, Creole mustard, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 2 teaspoons Essence, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Mix to incorporate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a shallow bowl, season the flour with 1 teaspoon of the Essence.  In another bowl, whisk the remaining egg with the water.  In a third bowl, combine the bread crumbs and 1 teaspoon of the Essence.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the crab-potato mixture into 1/3-cup portions, and form into patties about 1-inch thick.  Dredge both sides of each cake in the seasoned flour, dip in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off, then dredge in the seasoned bread crumbs, covering both sides completely.  Set aside on a baking sheet to bread the remaining mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large, heavy skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over high heat.  Carefully add the cakes to the pan being careful not to overcrowd, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the cakes from the pan and drain on a paper-lined plate.  Season the cakes with the remaining teaspoon of Essence and serve immediately with Sour Cream Remoulade Sauce.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Sour Cream Remoulade Sauce:  Mix all ingredients together and season with salt and pepper.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 cakes, 5 servings.

       Meringue Shells With Macerated Strawberries And Whipped Crea

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  fresh strawberries -- hulled, quartered
     1/4           cup  Grand Marnier
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  2          teaspoons  grated orange zest
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  3              large  egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
                        === HAZELNUT CHOCOLATE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  orange liqueur
  8             ounces  bittersweet or semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  toasted chopped hazelnuts

In a bowl combine the strawberries, 2 tablespoons of the Grand Marnier, 1/4 cup of the sugar, and the orange zest.  Let macerate for at least 2 hours, and up to 8 hours, tightly covered, and refrigerated.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Line a large baking sheet with foil and grease lightly with butter.

In a mixing bowl, beat 3 egg whites and 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar with a mixer until soft peaks form.  Gradually add 3/4 cup of the sugar and beat until the meringue forms stiff, shiny peaks.  Spoon the meringue into 6 equal mounds on the greased sheet, and using the back of a spoon, spread slightly out and make an indentation in the center.

Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 1 hour.  Turn the oven off and leave in the oven until dry, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and transfer to a rack to cool completely.

In a mixing bowl, beat the heavy cream until soft peaks begin to form.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup of the sugar and the remaining 2 tablespoons of the Grand Marnier, and beat just until stiff peaks begin to form.

Place 1 meringue on each of 6 plates, and fill with 1/2 cup of the macerated strawberries.  Top with a dollop of whipped cream, and drizzle warm Hazelnut Chocolate Sauce over the top.  Serve immediately.

For Hazelnut Chocolate Sauce:  In a medium saucepan, bring the cream and orange liqueur to a gentle boil.  Remove from the heat, add the chocolate, and whisk until melted and well blended.  Whisk in the hazelnuts and cover to keep warm until needed.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  firm ripe tomatoes
                        Salt -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped shallots
  2        tablespoons  flour
  6        tablespoons  heavy cream
  6                     egg yolks
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  Emerilís Essence -- see * Note
  1                cup  finely-grated cheddar cheese
  4                     egg whites
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated dry jack cheese

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut the upper half from each tomato and scoop out the seeds and pulp.  Sprinkle insides of the tomatoes lightly with salt, and invert on paper towels to drain for 20 minutes.

In a small, heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the shallots and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Stir in the flour, and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Whisk in the cream, and simmer, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the egg yolks, salt, Essence and cheddar.

In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with a pinch of cream of tartar until stiff peaks form.  Fold 1/4 of the egg whites into the cheese-egg yolk mixture.  Gently incorporate the remaining egg whites.

Spoon the batter into the tomato shells, filling them 3/4 full.  Place the tomatoes in a baking dish, and sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of dry jack cheese over each.  Place the tomatoes in the oven and immediately lower the heat to 375 degrees.

Bake until the soufflÈs have risen and are golden brown on top, about 20 to 25 minutes (but do not open the door during the baking time).  Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  monkfish
  1         tablespoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  flour

  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2               cups  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes and
                        their juice
     1/2           cup  white wine
  2               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-sodium chicken stock)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt

  1 1/2           cups  cooked white rice

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Cut the fish into 2-inch pieces.  Season with 1 tablespoon of the Essence and set aside.

In a large, heavy stockpot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the flour and stir constantly with a heavy wooden spoon until it becomes a dark roux the color of chocolate, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Add the celery, onions and bell peppers, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are wilted, 6 minutes.  Add the bay leaves and garlic, and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, wine, stock, salt and cayenne, and stir well.  Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes.

Add the fish and cook until it flakes with a fork, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Stir in the green onions and parsley during the last 5 minutes of cooking time.  Remove the bay leaves and serve hot in soup bowls ladled over rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a large, heavy stockpot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the flour and stir constantly with a heavy wooden spoon until it becomes a dark roux the color of chocolate, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Add the celery, onions and bell peppers, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are wilted, 6 minutes.  Add the bay leaves and garlic, and cook for 2 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pinch  ground saffron
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  sweet paprika
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3             pounds  lamb shoulder -- trimmed ,and
                        cut into 2" pieces
  1                cup  grated yellow onions -- rinsed, and
                        squeezed dry
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  dark veal or chicken stock
     2/3           cup  finely-chopped fresh parsley -- plus extra
                        for garnish
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
  1              pound  cracked green olives -- drained, pitted
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice - (to 5)
                        Pine Nut And Preserved Lemon Couscous -- (see recipe)

In the cup of a small food processor, combine the saffron, ginger, pepper, cumin, paprika, garlic, salt and 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Process until smooth.

In a large mixing bowl, toss the shoulder with the above mixture.  Mix well.  Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in large cast-iron or heavy bottom pot over medium heat.  Add the lamb and sear for 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the onions.  Season with pepper.  Cook for 2 minutes.  Stir in the stock.  Add the herbs and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered until the meat is very tender, about 2 hours.

Using a slotted spoon, remove the meat from the pan and set aside.  Remove any scum that has risen to the surface of the liquid.  Add the olives to the cooking liquid, increase the heat to high and boil for about 10 minutes or until the mixture is like a thick gravy.  Stir in the lemon juice and reseason if necessary.

About 30 minutes before serving, preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Place the meat in a shallow ovenproof serving dish and cook until the meat is lightly crisped, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Serve the lamb with the Pine Nut And Preserved Lemon Couscous.  Garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- plus
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  sour cream
  1                cup  blueberries, raspberries, or
                        blackberries, or any combination -- rinsed well,
                        and patted dry
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/4           cup  melted butter
  1                cup  chopped roasted pecans

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Grease a 10-inch cake pan with the tablespoon of butter, and lightly dust with flour.  Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar with a mixer on high speed.  Into a separate bowl, sift all the dry ingredients.  Add dry ingredients in 3 stages into the butter, alternating with the eggs 1 at a time, beating after the addition of each.

Fold the sour cream into the batter.  Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan, and arrange the berries evenly over the top.

To make the streusel topping, place all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and blend.  Evenly sprinkle the topping over the top of the berries.

Bake in the oven until golden brown and risen, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.  Let cool 15 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields about 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil -- plus
  6               cups  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  warm water
  1                cup  powdered sugar -- (optional) topping
  1                cup  honey -- (optional) topping

In the bowl of a food processor, mix the dry ingredients.  Stir in 1 tablespoon of the oil and the water, and process until smooth.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead until the dough is just elastic and comes together, being careful not to over work.  Shape the dough into a ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces.  Flatten each piece and roll into a 7-inch circle, making as thin as possible.  Poke a hole in the center with the handle of a wooden spoon or your finger.

In a large sautÈ pan or deep fryer, heat the oil to 360 degrees.  Slip the rounds 1 at a time into the hot oil and cook for 2 minutes, turning once with a long-handled spoon.  Drain on paper towels and repeat with the remaining dough.

Sprinkle the fried bread with powdered sugar and drizzle with honey, as desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 12 fried breads, 6 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  vegetable oil
  1              large  long eggplant - (abt 2 lbs)
  1           teaspoon  Emeril's Essence -- plus
  1         tablespoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  flour
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
  1                cup  powdered sugar

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Heat the oil in a large, heavy sautÈ pan to 360 degrees.

Peel the eggplant and cut in half lengthwise.  Cut each half into 1/4-inch thick slices (like long French fries).  Toss the slices with 1 teaspoon Essence and the salt to coat evenly.  Season the flour with the remaining tablespoon of Essence.  Beat the eggs and milk in a shallow bowl.

Lightly dredge the eggplant slices in the flour to coat, shaking off any excess.  Dip the coated strips into the egg wash, then back into the flour.  In batches, fry the eggplant strips in the hot oil until golden, turning with a long-handled spoon as they cook to brown evenly, about 2 minutes.

Put the powdered sugar in a small decorative bowl for passing at the table.  Remove eggplant and drain on paper towels.  Dip in powdered sugar as you eat.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer portions.

  1           teaspoon  bourbon
                        === RASPBERRY COULIS ===
  2              pints  fresh raspberries
                        = (may substitute blackberries)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                cup  water
  1           teaspoon  orange zest
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
                        Few drops lemon juice

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.  In a mixing bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, butter, and 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar and mix well.  Press onto bottom of springform pan and bake until golden, about 8 minutes.  Set aside to cool.  When completely cooled, butter the sides of the pan.

In a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups sugar, zests, and vanilla and beat until light and creamy.  Add the flour, then the eggs and yolks 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition.  Add the sour cream, vanilla bean seeds, and bourbon and mix until smooth.  Pour mixture into prepared pan.  Wrap the pan in foil and place in a roasting pan.  Fill the roasting with enough hot water to come half way up the sides of the pan.  Bake for 1 1/2 hours.

Transfer cake to a cooling rack and let cool completely.  Refrigerate cake overnight before serving.  Serve with raspberry coulis.

For the Raspberry Coulis:  Combine raspberries, sugar, water, and orange zest and cook until berries are soft and liquid is syrupy, about 10 minutes.  Let cool slightly then puree in a blender.  Strain through a fine sieve, transfer to a bowl, and refrigerate, covered, until completely chilled.  Stir in Grand Marnier and lemon juice.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  1                cup  chopped green onions
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- sliced
  4              pints  oysters and their liquor -- picked over to
                        remove any bits of shell
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  8                     boiled fresh artichoke hearts -- cut 1/2" slices
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2           cup  bread crumbs -- seasoned with
  1           teaspoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 2-quart baking dish with 1 tablespoon of butter.

Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet or sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  Add the green onions and garlic, and sautÈ for 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms and sautÈ until they give off their liquid, 3 to 4 minutes.

Add the oysters and their liquor, the parsley, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, salt, cayenne, and black pepper.  Cook until the oysters just start to curl and are no longer opaque, and the liquor starts to evaporate, 3 to 5 minutes.  Stir in the parsley and remove from the heat.

In a separate pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.  Saute the artichoke hearts until just warmed through.  Remove from the heat and spread in an even layer to completely cover the bottom of the casserole.

In a separate pan, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter over medium-high.  Add the flour and stir constantly until thick, 2 minutes.  Add the cream, and bring to a boil.  Cook until thick, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add to the oyster mixture, stirring to mix well.  Stir in 1/4 cup of the cheese.

Pour the mixture into the casserole on top of the artichoke hearts.  Sprinkle the seasoned bread crumbs over the top of the casserole, and top with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  Bake until the top is bubbly and has a golden crust, 15 to 25 minutes.  (If necessary, broil for 3 minutes to brown the top evenly.)  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 2-quart baking dish with 1 tablespoon of butter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet or sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  Add the green onions and garlic, and sautÈ for 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms and sautÈ until they give off their liquid, 3 to 4 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the oysters and their liquor, the parsley, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, salt, cayenne, and black pepper.  Cook until the oysters just start to curl and are no longer opaque, and the liquor starts to evaporate, 3 to 5 minutes.  Stir in the parsley and remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a separate pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.  Saute the artichoke hearts until just warmed through.  Remove from the heat and spread in an even layer to completely cover the bottom of the casserole.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a separate pan, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter over medium-high.  Add the flour and stir constantly until thick, 2 minutes.  Add the cream, and bring to a boil.  Cook until thick, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add to the oyster mixture, stirring to mix well.  Stir in 1/4 cup of the cheese.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the mixture into the casserole on top of the artichoke hearts.  Sprinkle the seasoned bread crumbs over the top of the casserole, and top with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  Bake until the top is bubbly and has a golden crust, 15 to 25 minutes.  (If necessary, broil for 3 minutes to brown the top evenly.)  Serve hot.

Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  butter -- cold
  1 1/2           cups  ground pecans
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
  5                     egg yolks
  2               cups  milk -- plus
  1         tablespoon  milk
     1/4           cup  butter -- at room temperature
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  heavy whipping cream
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2                     ripe bananas
  32                    roasted pecan halves
                        Confectionersí sugar -- for dusting

To prepare the tart:  Combine the cold butter, 1/2 cup of the pecans, 1/3 cup of the granulated sugar, 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons of the flour, and the salt in a food processor and process until crumbly.  Add 1 of the egg yolks and 1 tablespoon of the milk and process until the dough forms a ball.  Roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thick and cut into a 9-inch circle.  Line an 8-inch tart pan with the dough, place on a sheet pan, and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Bake crust for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.

To prepare the pecan cream:  Combine the softened butter, the whole egg, the remaining 1 cup of ground pecans, 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar, the cream, and 1/4 teaspoon of the vanilla in a mixing bowl.  Spread a 1/4-inch layer of the mixture in the bottom of the tart.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, or until the pecan cream is set.  Remove from the oven and set aside.

To prepare the pastry cream:  Bring the remaining 2 cups milk and 1/3 cup granulated sugar to a boil.  Whisk together the remaining 4 egg yolks and 1/3 cup granulated sugar in a bowl.  Sift the remaining 2 tablespoons flour and the cornstarch together over the egg yolk mixture and whisk until smooth.  Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon vanilla and one third of the milk mixture and whisk until combined.  Return the remaining milk mixture to a boil.  Pour the yolk mixture into the milk, stirring continuously, until thickened and remove from the heat.

To prepare the tart:  Cut the bananas into 1/4-inch thick slices and arrange in a single layer over the pecan cream in the tart shell.  Spoon the pastry cream over the bananas and smooth with spatula.  Lower the oven to 350 degrees and bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool slightly, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Cut the tart into 6 slices and place a slice in the center of each plate.  Arrange the toasted pecans on each slice and dust with confectionersí sugar.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIE CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              stick  cold butter -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  3        tablespoons  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  pine nuts - (abt 3 oz)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1                cup  chopped yellow onion
  10            ounces  fresh spinach -- stems removed,
                        well rinsed, and chopped
                        = (or a 10-oz pkg frozen chopped spinach,
                        thawed, squeezed to remove excess liquid)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  crumbled goat cheese or feta -- (abt 3 oz)

Into a large bowl sift the flour and salt.  Add the butter pieces and shortening and work them into the flour by hand until the dough starts to come together and form small pea shapes.  Work the ice water into the dough 1 tablespoon at a time with your fingers until it just comes together, being careful not to over mix.

Form the crust into a disk shape, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to rest for at least 30 minutes before rolling out.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Remove the prepared pie dough from the refrigerator and roll into an 11-inch circle.  Transfer to a tart pan with a removable bottom and press the dough up to the top of the sides, trimming any excess.  Cover the tart crust with a sheet of parchment paper and place a layer of uncooked beans in the bottom.  Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then remove the parchment and beans and cook for an additional 10 minutes until the crust has colored lightly.  Remove the crust from the oven and let cool.

On sheet pan toast pine nuts in the middle of the oven until just golden, 3 to 5 minutes, and cool.  In a large heavy skillet heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the spinach, salt, and pepper and cook until the liquid is evaporated, 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.

In a large bowl whisk the eggs and cream.  Stir in the spinach, 1/4 cup of the pine nuts and cheese and mix well.  Pour into the prepared pie crust and sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of pine nuts over the top.

Bake in the oven until golden and the center is set, about 30 to 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsalted shelled pistachios
  1                cup  sugar
  2               cups  milk (do not use low-fat or nonfat)
  3               cups  heavy cream
  12             large  egg yolks
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  1                cup  whipped cream -- for garnish
  1                cup  unsalted shelled pistachios -- toasted, and
                        coarsely chopped, for garnish

Finely grind 1 cup of the pistachios and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a food processor, being careful not to turn the mixture into butter.  Bring the milk and cream to a boil in heavy large saucepan.  Remove from heat.

Combine the egg yolks and remaining 1/2-cup sugar in a mixing bowl and whisk to blend.  Gradually whisk 1 cup of the hot milk mixture into the eggs.  Gradually add the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream into the hot cream in the saucepan.  Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 6 minutes.

Remove from the heat and strain into a large bowl.  Add pistachio mixture and almond extract.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to keep a skin from forming, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.

Remove from the refrigerator and pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine.  Freeze according to the manufacturerís instructions.  After the ice cream is made, transfer to an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.

Garnish with whipped cream and toasted pistachios.

This recipe yields about 2 quarts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  12            ounces  assorted wild mushrooms, such as morel,
                        chanterelle, wood ear, shiitake -- cleaned, stems
                        removed, thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  sliced shallots
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2          teaspoons  fresh chopped thyme
  2          teaspoons  white truffle oil
                        Potato Crisps -- (see below)
     1/2           cup  finely-grated aged Asiago - (abt 2 oz)
  12            slices  fresh black or white truffle -- (optional) garnish
                        Fresh arugula -- tossed with
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for garnish
                        === POTATO CRISPS ===
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  2              large  baking potatoes, like russets - (abt 1 lb) -- peeled, and
                        sliced on a mandolin into 1/8" slices
  1           teaspoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms, shallots, salt and pepper, and sautÈ until soft and most of the mushroom liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes.  Add the chicken stock, cream and thyme, and simmer until the liquid has reduced by 50 percent in volume, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the truffle oil.

Place 2 potato crisps on each of 4 serving plates.  Spoon 1 generous tablespoon of mushroom filling on top, topped with 1 teaspoon of grated Asiago.  Continue layering the napoleon so that you have 3 layers of potatoes and 3 layers of mushrooms in all, ending with mushrooms on top.

Garnish the top of each napoleon with 3 slices of truffle, and sprinkle of Asiago.  Arrange the arugula around the outer edge of the plate and serve.

For Potato Crisps:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Brush 2 large baking sheets well with oil.  Arrange the potato slices in 1 layer on the sheets.  Brush with the remaining oil, and bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes, switching the sheets halfway through baking.

Transfer with a spatula to cooling racks.  Sprinkle with the Essence and salt, and set aside.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms, shallots, salt and pepper, and sautÈ until soft and most of the mushroom liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes.  Add the chicken stock, cream and thyme, and simmer until the liquid has reduced by 50 percent in volume, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the truffle oil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 2 potato crisps on each of 4 serving plates.  Spoon 1 generous tablespoon of mushroom filling on top, topped with 1 teaspoon of grated Asiago.  Continue layering the napoleon so that you have 3 layers of potatoes and 3 layers of mushrooms in all, ending with mushrooms on top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Garnish the top of each napoleon with 3 slices of truffle, and sprinkle of Asiago.  Arrange the arugula around the outer edge of the plate and serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Potato Crisps:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush 2 large baking sheets well with oil.  Arrange the potato slices in 1 layer on the sheets.  Brush with the remaining oil, and bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes, switching the sheets halfway through baking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer with a spatula to cooling racks.  Sprinkle with the Essence and salt, and set aside.
</DirT>

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Into a large bowl sift together the flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  Add the butter into the dry ingredients and work with your fingertips until it resembles dry crumbs.  Add the caraway seeds, treacle, buttermilk and raisins and work with your fingers until just mixed and a wet dough is formed, being careful not to over mix.

Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and form into a round.  Press down on the dough with the palm of your hand and press to form a flat round about 1 1/2 inches high.

With a knife, cut a 1/4-inch deep cross in the center of the dough.  With a pastry brush paint the dough with the cream and sprinkle the top with the oats.  Place on a baking sheet and bake until light brown and cooked through, about 30 to 40 minutes.

Remove from the oven and cool slightly on a wire rack before slicing.  Serve warm with plenty of sweet butter.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  Muscat de Beaune de Venise
                        = (or other sweet white dessert wine,
                        such as White Port or Sauternes)
  2              pints  fresh raspberries
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  melted bittersweet chocolate
                        === DRIED PEARS ===
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
  2             medium  firm ripe pears -- stems removed

In a small saucepan, combine 1/4 cup of the sugar and the wine, and dissolve, stirring, over medium-low heat, and slightly reduced, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.  Combine the raspberries and syrup in a bowl and toss gently to combine.

In a bowl whip the heavy cream until it is nearly doubled in volume.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and whip until it forms stiff peaks.

Spread 1 tablespoon of chocolate on the bottom of a dessert plate, and top with 1 pear slice.  Layer with 1 tablespoon of cream, raspberries, 1 teaspoon of chocolate, and 1 pear slice, and repeat to make 6 layers in all, finishing with raspberries and chocolate on top.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients, to make 4 napoleons in all.

For Dried Pears:  Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.

In a small saucepan combine the sugar and water, and dissolve, stirring, over medium-low heat.  Add the lemon juice and cardamom, and stir.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

With a mandoline or other slicing machine, thinly slice the pears lengthwise to 1/8-inch thickness.  Dip the pear slices in the syrup and shake to remove any excess.  Arrange the slices tightly in a single layer on the baking sheets.

Bake in the oven until crisp, about 2 to 3 hours, switching the baking sheets several times during the cooking process.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- plus
  3        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  corn kernels
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
     1/2           cup  chopped pecans
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  cooked white rice
  2               cups  buttermilk
  1           teaspoon  Emerilís Essence -- see * Note
  4              large  eggs -- separated, and
                        at room temperature
     1/3           cup  sifted flour
                        Vegetable oil

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

In a heavy skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the corn and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the onions, pecans and salt, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.

In a large bowl stir together the rice, buttermilk, melted butter and Essence.  Fold in the cooled corn mixture.  In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the yolks at medium speed until thickened, about 4 minutes.  Blend in the flour, then stir into the rice mixture.

In a separate bowl beat the egg whites until they hold medium-stiff peaks, about 3 minutes.  Fold the whites into the rice mixture, being careful not to deflate.

Grease the skillet with 2 tablespoons of oil, then drop 2 tablespoons of batter onto the skillet for each pancake.  Cook until just golden brown on the bottom and bubbles form on the surface of the top, about 2 minutes.

Flip the cakes and cook until just brown on the other side, about 1 minute.  Remove from the pan and serve hot as an accompaniment to grilled or roasted meats or chicken.

This recipe yields about 24 pancakes, or 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  golden raisins
     1/2           cup  dark rum
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  1                cup  water
     1/2           cup  long-grain white rice
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- plus
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
  2              large  eggs
  1              large  egg yolk
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
                        Sweetened whipped cream

Place the raisins in a small bowl.  In a small saucepan heat the rum over medium heat.  Pour the rum over the raisins, cover and let soak at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.  Drain.

Scrape the vanilla beans into a small ramekin and reserve.  Combine water, rice and vanilla bean in a heavy, medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.  Uncover, discard the vanilla bean, and let cool.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Butter one large 6 to 8-cup soufflÈ dish with the tablespoon of butter, and place inside a roasting pan.

Melt the remaining teaspoon of butter in a small skillet.  Add the almonds and sugar, and cook, stirring, until the sugar is caramelized, about 5 minutes.  Spread the nuts on a sheet of aluminum foil to cool, separating them with a fork.

In a large bowl whisk together the milk, brown sugar, eggs, egg yolk, salt and reserved vanilla seeds.  Stir in the raisins, sugared almonds and 1 1/2 cups cooked rice.  Pour into the buttered dish.  Add enough hot water to the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the dish.  Bake until the pudding is set in center and brown around edges, about 1 hour 5 minutes.

Remove the dish from the water and cool at least 15 minutes before serving.  Serve warm with whipped cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1                     carrot -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  2               cups  chicken broth

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Wash the chicken in hot water and dry thoroughly.  Season the cavity with salt and black pepper and stuff with the onion, lemon, and celery leaves.  Rub the chicken lightly with softened butter and season all over with salt and pepper.  Tie the drumsticks ends together and set the chicken, breast-side up, in an oiled v-shaped rack or on an oiled roasting pan in the oven.

Roast for 15 minutes at 425 degrees, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees, baste the chicken, and roast for 15 minutes.  Add the chopped onion and carrot to the pan, basting them and the chicken.  Continue roasting the chicken until the juices run clear, for a total of 45 minutes plus an additional 7 minutes for each pound.  (In other words, a 3 1/2 pound chicken would take a basic 45 minutes plus an additional 25 minutes, for a total 70 minutes or 1 hour and 10 minutes of cooking time.)

Remove the chicken and spoon the fat out of the roasting pan.  Into the pan, stir in the herbs and blend in the broth and, stirring constantly, boil for several minutes on the stovetop to concentrate the flavor.  Correct the seasoning and strain the sauce into a warm sauceboat.  Carve the chicken and serve with the warm sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

             Roasted Beet, Fennel, Mache And Gorgonzola Salad

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  medium red beets -- washed, stems and
                        leaves removed
     1/2         pound  medium golden beets -- washed, stems and
                        leaves removed
     1/2           cup  unsalted shelled sunflower seeds
  1                     fennel bulb -- cored, halved,
                        and cut into 1/8"-thick slices
  6               cups  mache
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  grapeseed or vegetable oil
  6             ounces  blue cheese -- crumbled
  8                     French bread croutons -- as accompaniment

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Wrap the red beets in 1 large piece of aluminum foil, and the golden beets in another large piece of aluminum foil, closing the packets tightly.  Roast in the oven until tender, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven, unwrap the beets and cool.  When the beets are cool enough to handle, peel and cut into 1/2-inch cubes.  Place the beets in a small bowl.

Spread the sunflower seeds on a small baking sheet and toast lightly in the oven, about 3 minutes, shaking once during cooking to turn.  Remove from the oven and cool.

Place the fennel and mache in a large bowl.

In a small bowl, mix together the shallots, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and whisk in the oil in a steady stream to emulsify.  Toss the beets with a small amount of the dressing, and the fennel and mache with the remaining dressing.  Adjust seasoning to taste with salt and pepper.

Divide the mache and fennel among 4 salad plates.  Arrange the beets on top of the greens, and top with the crumbled cheese.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of seeds over each salad and serve with toasted French bread croutons.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon fillet pieces - (4 oz ea)
  2          teaspoons  olive oil -- plus
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  Yukon gold or fingerling potatoes -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/4" slices
  5                     artichoke hearts -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme leaves
  1              pinch  cayenne
                        === CHORON SAUCE ===
  1                cup  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
  3        tablespoons  dried tarragon
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
     1/3           cup  white vinegar
  2               cups  dry red wine
  2        tablespoons  parsley
  4                     egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  water
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- melted and warm

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Lightly rub the salmon fillets with 2 teaspoons olive oil, and season the top with salt and pepper.  Place on a baking sheet and roast uncovered in the oven until firm and cooked through, but still slightly rare in the center, 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before gently lifting the skin from the bottom of each fillet.  Set aside.

In a medium pot place the sliced potatoes and 1 teaspoon of salt.  Cover with water by 2 inches, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and gently boil until the potatoes are just fork tender, about 7 minutes.  Drain and rinse under cold running water.  Drain and let cool.

In a bowl, whisk together the mustard and lemon juice.  Slowly drizzle in the remaining 1/2 cup olive oil and whisk until an emulsion is formed.  Whisk in the lemon zest, thyme, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and cayenne.

In a bowl gently toss the cooked potato slices with some of the vinaigrette.  Remove and arrange in a circular pattern on each of 4 plates.  Top the potatoes with the cooled salmon fillets.  Place the chopped artichoke hearts in the bowl and toss with the rest of the vinaigrette.  Arrange the artichoke hearts around the salmon.  Top the salmon with a little of the Choron Sauce.

For Choron Sauce:  In a saucepan, combine the tomatoes, tarragon, shallots, vinegar, and wine, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced to a thick syrup and dark brown, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the parsley.  Let cool while making the hollandaise sauce.

In a stainless steel bowl set over a pot of simmering water over medium heat, whisk the egg yolks with the lemon juice, water, mustard, salt, and cayenne together until pale yellow and slightly thick.  (Be careful not to let the bowl touch the water.)  Remove the bowl from the pot and whisking vigorously, add the butter, 1 teaspoon at a time, until all is incorporated.  Add the tomato mixture to the sauce and whisk together until well blended.  Place over a pot of warm water, off the heat, and cover to keep warm, stirring occasionally until needed.  (Makes about 2 cups)

  4                     wooden skewers -- soaked overnight
                        Creole seasoning -- see * Note
     1/4           cup  torn basil leaves
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Place eggplant in a shallow baking dish.  Season the eggplant with 1/4 cup of the olive oil and salt and pepper.  Place the eggplant in the oven and roast for 20 to 30 minutes, until tender.

In a large saute pan, heat 1/2 cup of the olive oil.  Add the garlic cloves and cook, over medium heat, for 10 minutes to infuse the oil with garlic flavor.  Remove the garlic from the oil.  Fry the bread in the oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the oil and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.  Season with salt, pepper and the Parmesan cheese.

To a large bowl, add the peppers.  Sprinkle the sliced tomatoes with salt and add to the peppers.  Add the onions and mix well.  Season the onion mixture with salt and pepper, remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Toss well and set aside.

Skewer the shrimp.  Season with salt, pepper and Creole seasoning.  Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Grill the shrimp for 2 minutes per side, or until cooked through.  Remove from the grill and remove the shrimp from the skewers.  Remove the eggplant from the oven and cut into large pieces.

To serve: Place the eggplant in a large bowl.  Top with the pepper mixture and the shrimp.  Top with the fried bread.  Add basil and parsley.  Toss well.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     magret duck breast halves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  canola oil
                        Port -- (optional)
                        === FOIE GRAS AND SWEET CORN CUSTARD ===
  4             ounces  fresh foie gras -- cut  3/4" cubes
  3                     eggs
  1                cup  heavy or whipping cream
     1/2           cup  milk
  4               ears  sweet corn -- blanched, and
                        kernels removed from cobs - (abt 3 cups)
  3                     scallions -- finely chopped
  1 1/2    tablespoons  masa harina or yellow cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        Fine dry bread crumbs -- for dusting ramekins

With a sharp knife carefully trim excess fat from edges of duck halves.  Score skin and fat in a diamond pattern, with 1/4-inch between scores.

Season with salt and pepper on both sides.  Transfer to a platter or glass baking dish in 1 layer and refrigerate, uncovered and skin-side up, overnight.

In two skillets over medium heat sautÈ duck breast halves in canola oil, fat-side down, for 15 minutes, periodically draining off extra fat.  Turn breasts over and continue to cook another 5 minutes for medium-rare.  Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes before carving.  Deglaze pan with Port, creating a pan jus.  Serve with Foie Gras and Sweet Corn Custard.

For Foie Gras and Sweet Corn Custard:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

In a small heavy non-stick skillet, cook foie gras over medium heat until fat is rendered and foie gras is golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine eggs, heavy cream and milk and whisk well to combine.  Add 2 tablespoons rendered foie gras fat and remaining ingredients, except butter and bread crumbs, and mix well.  With a large spatula, fold in cooked foie gras.

Grease 8 (6-ounce) ramekins with the butter and lightly coat with fine dry breadcrumbs.  Divide custard filling between the prepared ramekins and place on heavy baking sheet.  Bake uncovered for 30 minutes, or until custard has risen slightly and is set and golden brown on the top.

Serve warm, turned out of the ramekins with the slices of duck breast draped over the custards.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  sweet potatoes - (abt 2 lbs)
  4        tablespoons  peanut oil
  12                    Roma plum tomatoes - (abt 2 lbs) -- halved, stems
                        removed, and seeded
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  curry powder
  2               cups  thinly-sliced yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  2               cups  smooth peanut butter
  2             quarts  chicken broth
  10            ounces  unsweetened coconut milk

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Lightly coat the sweet potatoes with 1 tablespoon of the oil.  Place on a baking sheet and roast until fork tender, turning once, 35 to 45 minutes.

Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a small stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add the curry powder and toast until aromatic, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.  Add the onions and cook until soft, 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Season with the cayenne, then add the peanut butter, and stir well.  Add the tomatoes, peeled potatoes, chicken stock, and coconut milk and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes.

Remove the pot from the heat, and puree with a hand-held immersion blender, or in batches in a blender or food processor.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve hot.

This recipe yields about 2 quarts.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  all-purpose flour - (3 1/2 cups)
  1                cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2         pound  vegetable shortening
  1              large  egg
     3/4      teaspoon  vanilla
  1                cup  water
     1/2         pound  sesame seeds

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a large bowl or pan, mix together the flour, sugar and baking powder.  Add the shortening and work it in with your hands until well mixed.  Add the eggs and vanilla, and 3/4 cup of water, and work in well.  The dough should hold together but not be sticky.  If needed, work in a little more water, 1 teaspoon at a time.

Place the seeds in a shallow baking pan.  Pinch off a small amount of dough, about the size of a small fist, and cover the remaining dough with a damp dish towel.  Roll the dough out into a long rope, about 1-inch in diameter.  Cut the dough into 2-inch pieces.

Drip a small amount of water through a fine mesh sieve, and sprinkle over a small portion of the sesame seeds to wet them (but do not wet the seeds until they will be used).  Roll the dough in the seeds, pressing slightly to make them adhere.  Place the seeded dough onto a large ungreased baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

Bake on the bottom rack of the oven until the bottoms are golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Turn the cakes over and place the baking sheet on the top rack of the oven to bake for an additional 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on cooling racks.  Serve at room temperature, or keep in tins for up to 2 weeks.

This recipe yields 40 cookies.

Add the eggs and vanilla, and 3/4 cup of water, and work in well.  The dough should hold together but not be sticky.  If needed, work in a little more water, 1 teaspoon at a time.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the seeds in a shallow baking pan.  Pinch off a small amount of dough, about the size of a small fist, and cover the remaining dough with a damp dish towel.  Roll the dough out into a long rope, about 1-inch in diameter.  Cut the dough into 2-inch pieces.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drip a small amount of water through a fine mesh sieve, and sprinkle over a small portion of the sesame seeds to wet them (but do not wet the seeds until they will be used).  Roll the dough in the seeds, pressing slightly to make them adhere.  Place the seeded dough onto a large ungreased baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake on the bottom rack of the oven until the bottoms are golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Turn the cakes over and place the baking sheet on the top rack of the oven to bake for an additional 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on cooling racks.  Serve at room temperature, or keep in tins for up to 2 weeks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     sheets phyllo dough -- thawed
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  8             ounces  thinly-sliced smoked salmon
  1                cup  Lemon CrËme Fraiche -- (see below)
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/4                cup minced red onion
  5             ounces  salmon caviar
  5               cups  baby greens
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === LEMON CREME FRAICHE ===
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest
     3/4           cup  crËme fraiche

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and lightly grease with butter.

Place 1 phyllo sheet on a work surface and brush with melted butter.  Top with a second sheet and brush with butter.  Continue layering until all 6 sheets have been buttered, buttering the top sheet.  Cut the phyllo stack to make 12 equal stacks, about 4 1/2-inch by 2-inch each.  Place on the prepared sheet and bake until golden, turning the sheet halfway through baking, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Transfer the baked phyllo to a cooling rack.

Place 1 phyllo stack on a plate and top with 1 slice of salmon.  Spoon 1 tablespoon of Lemon CrËme Fraiche on top and sprinkle with onion.  Top with another phyllo rectangle, salmon, crËme fraiche, and onion.  Continue the process, ending with 3 layers in all.  Top each stack with 2 tablespoons of salmon caviar.

Place the greens in a large bowl.  In a small bowl whisk together the remaining lemon juice and Dijon mustard.  Slowly add the oil in a thin stream, whisking to emulsify.  Season with the salt.  Toss the greens with the dressing.  Arrange the greens around the outer edges of the napoleons and serve.

For Lemon CrËme Fraiche:  Combine all the ingredients.  Refrigerate until ready to use.  (Makes 1 cup)

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  champagne vinegar
  1                     lemon -- zested
  1                cup  sugar
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2                lemon -- zested
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  good quality caviar - (to 4)
     1/2         pound  smoked sturgeon
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives -- for garnish

For the Lemon Gastrique:  Combine champagne vinegar, lemon zest, and sugar in a medium non-reactive saucepan and bring to a boil.  Continue to cook until sugar has melted and liquid has reduced to nappÈ consistency and coats the back of a spoon, about 4 to 5 minutes.

Remove to a non-reactive bowl and set aside to cool to room temperature before drizzling over Smoked Sturgeon Napoleons with Caviar Cream.  Can be made well in advance and refrigerated until ready to use, but should be returned to room temperature before serving.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

On a lightly floured work surface, roll out puff pastry to a thickness of 1/8 inch.  Using cookie cutter or a very sharp knife, cut pastry into 12 (3-inch) portions of the desired shape.  Place pastry pieces on top of a sheet pan covered with parchment paper, cover pastry with another sheet of parchment paper and top with another sheet pan of the same size.

Bake in a preheated oven until crispy and golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Remove pastry from oven and transfer to a cooling rack.  Set aside until ready to assemble napoleons.

In a large bowl with an electric mixer whip heavy cream and lemon zest to soft peaks.  Season with salt and pepper and carefully fold in caviar.

On 4 appetizer plates, arrange 1 piece of baked puff pastry on top of a 1/2 teaspoon of the caviar cream (this will anchor the Napoleon).  Divide smoked sturgeon into 8 portions.  Top each piece of puff pastry with 2 tablespoons of caviar cream and 1 of the portions of smoked sturgeon.  Top with another piece of puff pastry and repeat layering process, ending with a piece of puff pastry.  Drizzle each napoleon with lemon gastrique and serve immediately, garnished with chopped chives and any extra caviar cream.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer portions.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
  1              pound  very small squid - (bodies 4" long) -- cleaned, and
                        tentacles left attached
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  minced onion
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2               cups  chopped seeded tomato
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  salt

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  18                    mussels -- cleaned, scrubbed,
                        and beards removed
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced tasso
     1/4           cup  minced onion
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  chili sauce
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4        tablespoons  flour
  2              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                cup  bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  grated Manchego, or Parmesan
                        Olive oil -- for frying
                        === ROASTED GARLIC AIOLI ===
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2         tablespoon  roasted garlic puree
  1                cup  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-cracked black pepper

In a heavy-bottomed pot set over a medium-high heat, add the wine, lemon juice, and the mussels.  Cover the pot and bring to a boil.  Turn off the heat and remove the mussels.  Remove the mussels from their shells, and roughly chop them.  Separate 9 mussel shells so that you will have 18 half shells.  Strain and reserve the cooking broth.

In a sautÈ pan over a medium-high heat, heat the olive oil.  Add the tasso and cook, stirring until the fat is rendered, about 2 minutes.  Add the onions and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring.  Add the chopped mussels, chili sauce, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  Cook for 5 minutes, stirring, and fill the reserved mussel shells half way with the stuffing.

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the flour and stir to make a light roux, being careful not to let it brown.  Slowly add the reserved mussel broth and the remaining salt and pepper, whisking constantly.  Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

With teaspoon, place a dollop of the sauce over each mussel, and seal the edges with the cupped side of the spoon.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.

In a small mixing bowl whisk together the eggs and water.  In a separate bowl, combine the bread crumbs and cheese.  Remove the mussels from the refrigerator, and dip each mussel, stuffing-side down into the egg wash, followed by the bread crumbs.

Heat the oil in a deep fryer or deep sautÈ pan to 360 degrees.  Fry the mussels in batches, stuffed-side down, until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Serve hot with the Roasted Garlic Aioli.

For Roasted Garlic Aioli:  In a food processor or blender, blend the egg, mustard, lemon juice, and garlic for 20 seconds.  With the machine running, slowly pour in the oil through the feed tube and process until the mixture emulsifies.  Season with salt and pepper and pulse to blend.  Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate until needed, keeping only for 1 day.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE TART DOUGH ===
     3/4          cups  flour
     1/4           cup  cake flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  6        tablespoons  chilled butter -- diced
  2        tablespoons  chilled vegetable shortening
     1/4           cup  ice water -- or as needed
                        === FOR THE TART TATIN ===
  6                     Golden Delicious apples -- cored, peeled,
                        and halved
  1                     lemon -- zested and juiced
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream -- as accompaniment

In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, place the flours, sugar and butter.  Pulse 5 or 6 times in 1/2-second bursts to break up the butter.  Add the shortening, turn on the machine and immediately add the ice water, pulsing 2 or 3 times.  The dough should look like a mass of smallish lumps and should just hold together in a mass when a handful is pressed together.  If the mixture is too dry, pulse in more water by droplets.

Turn the dough out onto the work surface and with the heel of your hand, rapidly and roughly push egg-size blobs into a 6-inch smear.  Gather the dough into a relatively smooth cake, wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours (or up to 2 days).

Slice the halved apples into 4 lengthwise wedges each, and toss in a large bowl with the lemon juice and zest and 1/2 cup sugar.  Drain the apples after macerating 20 minutes.

In a 9-inch skillet melt the butter over high heat.  Stir in the remaining sugar and cook until the syrup bubbles and caramelizes, and turns a brown color.  Remove the pan from the heat and arrange a layer of apple slices in a neat pattern on the caramel in the skillet, then arrange the remaining apples neatly on top.

Return the pan to moderately-high heat and cook for about 25 minutes, covering the pan after 10 minutes.  Every few minutes press down on the apples and baste them with the exuded juices.  When the juices are thick and syrupy, remove the pan from the heat.

On a lightly floured surface, roll the chilled dough into a circle, 3/16-inch thick and 1-inch larger than the top of the pan.  Drape the dough over the apples, pressing the edge of the dough between the apples and the inside of the pan.  Cut 4 small steam holes on the top of the dough.  Bake until the pastry has browned and crisped, about 20 minutes.

Unmold the tart onto a serving dish (so the pastry is on the bottom), and serve warm or cold with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, as desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

In a 9-inch skillet melt the butter over high heat.  Stir in the remaining sugar and cook until the syrup bubbles and caramelizes, and turns a brown color.  Remove the pan from the heat and arrange a layer of apple slices in a neat pattern on the caramel in the skillet, then arrange the remaining apples neatly on top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the pan to moderately-high heat and cook for about 25 minutes, covering the pan after 10 minutes.  Every few minutes press down on the apples and baste them with the exuded juices.  When the juices are thick and syrupy, remove the pan from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On a lightly floured surface, roll the chilled dough into a circle, 3/16-inch thick and 1-inch larger than the top of the pan.  Drape the dough over the apples, pressing the edge of the dough between the apples and the inside of the pan.  Cut 4 small steam holes on the top of the dough.  Bake until the pastry has browned and crisped, about 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Unmold the tart onto a serving dish (so the pastry is on the bottom), and serve warm or cold with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, as desired.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1                cup  warm water
  1            package  active dry yeast - (2 1/4 tspns)
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
                        === TOPPING ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  6             ounces  exotic mushrooms, such as chanterelle,
                        shiitake or wood ear -- rinsed well,
                        dried, and thinly sliced
  1 1/4           cups  prosciutto in thin strips - (abt 4 oz)
  2        tablespoons  white truffle oil
  6             ounces  soft mild goat cheese such as Montrachet -- crumbled
  6             ounces  Fontina -- grated
  3             ounces  thinly-sliced Teleme cheese

Heat 1 cup of water to 110 degrees.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the water, yeast, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until the yeast is dissolved.  Add 1 1/2 cups flour to the yeast mixture, mixing by hand until all the flour is incorporated and no lumps remain.  Continue adding flour 1/4 cup at a time working the dough by hand after each addition until all the flour is incorporated, yet the dough remains slightly sticky.

Lightly oil a large mixing bowl with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.  Place the dough in the oiled bowl and turn to coat with olive oil.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set in a warm, non-drafty place.  Allow the dough to rise until nearly double in size, about 1 hour.

Remove the dough from the bowl and briefly work by hand, separating into 2 equal-sized discs.  Place the dough on a lightly greased sheet pan, cover with plastic wrap, and set in a warm, non-drafty place to rest for 15 minutes, or until ready to use.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms and sautÈ just until their juice has evaporated, stirring from time to time, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.

With your hands, gently stretch 1 dough disc to a 6-inch round.  Place the dough round on a lightly greased baking sheet, and pat out to a 10 to 12-inch round, about 1/8-inch thick.  Repeat with the remaining dough disc.  Top each piece of dough with half of the mushrooms, half of the proscuitto, and 1 tablespoon of truffle oil.  Sprinkle the cheeses over the mushrooms, and bake until the dough is brown and the cheese is bubbly, about 15 minutes, switching the pans between racks after 7 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 2 (10-inch) pizzas.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     thin veal cutlets - (abt 2 1/2 oz ea)
                        Emeril's Essence -- see * Note
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  bread crumbs
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4         pound  pancetta or 3 strips bacon -- chopped
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  1                can  Italian-style tomatoes - (28 oz)
  1                cup  tomato puree
  1         tablespoon  fresh chopped basil
  1           teaspoon  fresh chopped parsely
  1           teaspoon  fresh oregano
  1           teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
                        Parmesan cheese
  8             ounces  mozzarella -- thinly sliced

* Note:  See the "Bayou Blast - {Emeril's Creole Seasoning}" recipe which is included in this collection.

Cover a work surface with plastic wrap.  Space the cutlets evenly on the plastic, leaving a 3-inch space between each cutlet.  Cover all the veal with another piece of plastic.  Using a meat mallet, pound the cutlets to an 1/8-inch thickness.  Lightly season the veal on both sides with Essence, salt and pepper.

Place the flour in a shallow bowl and season with 1 tablespoon of Essence.  Place the breadcrumbs in another shallow bowl and season with 1 tablespoon of Essence.  Beat the eggs and milk together in a shallow bowl.  Dredge the flattened veal chops in the seasoned flour and shake off excess.  Dip in the egg wash, and then coat both sides with the breadcrumbs.

Heat the butter and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a heavy large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  SautÈ the veal until golden on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.  Remove from the skillet and place on a plate.   Add the pancetta to the pan and fry in the remaining fat.  Remove from the pan.

Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the onion and cook, stirring, until the onion is translucent, about 6 minutes.  Add garlic and sautÈ until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the wine, and cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan over high heat for 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and the puree, the basil, parsley, oregano, and dried red pepper flakes.

Bring the sauce to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium and add the cooked pancetta.  Simmer until the sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.

Arrange the cooked veal cutlets on top of the sauce, spooning sauce over each one.  Top each cutlet with a sprinkling of Parmesan, then with a slice of mozzarella.  Lower the heat to medium-low, and cook, covered, until the veal is tender and the cheese melts, 5 to 6 minutes.  Serve immediately, 2 cutlets person, with herbed egg noodles.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the onion and cook, stirring, until the onion is translucent, about 6 minutes.  Add garlic and sautÈ until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the wine, and cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan over high heat for 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and the puree, the basil, parsley, oregano, and dried red pepper flakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring the sauce to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium and add the cooked pancetta.  Simmer until the sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the cooked veal cutlets on top of the sauce, spooning sauce over each one.  Top each cutlet with a sprinkling of Parmesan, then with a slice of mozzarella.  Lower the heat to medium-low, and cook, covered, until the veal is tender and the cheese melts, 5 to 6 minutes.  Serve immediately, 2 cutlets person, with herbed egg noodles.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  old-fashioned rolled oats
     1/2           cup  slivered almonds
     1/2           cup  unsweetened flaked coconut
     1/4           cup  hulled green pumpkin seeds
     1/4           cup  sunflower seeds or pine nuts
     1/2           cup  crushed pecans or walnuts
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  honey
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  raisins or chopped dates
     1/2           cup  dried cranberries or blueberries
                        = (or a combination)

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

In a large bowl stir together oats, almonds, coconut, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, pecans, cinnamon and salt.  In a small saucepan melt butter with honey over low heat, stirring.  Add vanilla and pour butter mixture over oat mixture and stir until combined well.

On a large baking sheet, spread the granola evenly in a thin layer.  Bake, stirring every 5 minutes to keep from sticking or burning, until golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes.  (Do not overcook; the granola will crisp more when cooled.)  Cool the granola on the pan on top of the stove and stir in dried fruits.  Granola may be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.

Serve at room temperature in a bowl with milk, or as a snack.

This recipe yields about 6 cups.
