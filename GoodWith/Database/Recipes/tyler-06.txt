                           'Green Eggs And Ham'

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PESTO ===
  1              bunch  fresh basil leaves
     1/2         bunch  fresh flat-leaf parsley
     1/2         clove  garlic -- sliced
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus more if needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === EGGS AND HAM ===
  4             slices  Tuscan bread
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     garlic clove
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme -- leaves only
  8             slices  prosciutto
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
  8                     eggs
  1        small piece  Parmesan -- for garnish
                        Basil leaves -- for garnish

Put the basil, parsley, garlic, pine nuts, cheese, and olive oil into a blender.  Blend until the paste is fairly smooth, adding more oil or some water if it is too thick.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper; set aside.

Heat a dry cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.  Brush the bread slices with olive oil and fry them on both sides until golden brown.  Rub them gently with the garlic clove and keep the toast warm.  Now add a little oil and the thyme to the pan and fry the prosciutto slices until they are crisp, about 1 to 2 minutes; set aside.

Meanwhile, fill a large skillet with water, bring it to a boil, and add the vinegar and a large pinch of salt.  Reduce the heat until the water is just barely bubbling.  Crack each egg into a small bowl and carefully slide the egg into the water.  Cook until the eggs are set, about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes.  Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and dab the bottom with paper towels to dry them off.

To assemble, put a slice of toast on a plate and place 2 poached eggs on top.  Spoon a tablespoon of pesto over each egg and top with some crisp prosciutto.  Using a vegetable peeler, thinly shave a few slices of Parmesan over everything and garnish with some basil leaves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  large scallops
     1/2         pound  thin-sliced bacon
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  good-quality mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  hot chili paste
                        = (Sriracha Hot Chili Paste recommended)
  1                     lime -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro -- plus
                        more for garnish
  2              heads  Bibb lettuce -- washed
  3                     avocados -- sliced

Heat the broiler.  Wrap each scallop in a piece of bacon and secure it with a toothpick.  Place the bacon wrapped scallops onto a baking sheet, drizzle them with olive oil, and season them with salt and pepper.  Cook them under the broiler for about 10 to 15 minutes until the bacon is cooked through, turning once.

Make the spicy mayo by combining the mayonnaise, chili paste, lime juice, and chopped cilantro.  Stir well and refrigerate until ready to use.

To serve, carefully peel away the lettuce leaves and line a large platter with the lettuce cups.  Top each with a bacon wrapped shrimp, 2 slices of avocado, and a spoonful of spicy mayonnaise.  Garnish with cilantro leaves.

This recipe yields about 20 to 25 appetizers.

Put the remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large, oven-proof saute pan over medium-high heat.  Remove the chicken from the marinade and season it with salt.  Brown the chicken on both sides, then place the pan in the oven and roast until the chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.  Serve garnished with cilantro leaves.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                           Blueberry-Lemon Tart

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cold, in chunks
  1              large  egg -- separated
  2        tablespoons  ice water -- plus
  1           teaspoon  ice water
                        === FILLING ===
  4              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  1                cup  fresh lemon juice - (abt 5 lemons)
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  1                     lemon -- zested
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  1               pint  blueberries

To make the pastry, pulse the flour, sugar, and salt together in a food processor.  Add the butter and pulse until the dough resembles cornmeal.  Add the egg yolk and 2 tablespoons ice water and pulse again until the dough pulls together.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle.  Roll the dough up onto the pin and lay it inside a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Press the dough into the edges of the pan and fold the excess dough inside to reinforce the rim.  Cover the tart pan with plastic wrap and put it into the refrigerator for another 30 minutes to rest.

To bake the shell, heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Put the tart pan on a baking sheet and prick the bottom of the dough with a fork.  Cover the shell with a piece of parchment paper and fill it with pie weights or dry beans.  Bake for 25 minutes.  Remove the parchment and weights.  Lightly beat the egg white with 1 teaspoon water and brush it onto the bottom and sides of the tart shell; set aside to cool.

Whisk together the eggs, sugar, lemon juice, cream, zest, and salt.  Add the blueberries to the cooled tart shell and pour the filling over the blueberries.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.  The curd should jiggle slightly when done.  Cool to room temperature, remove from the tart ring, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  coriander seeds
  2        tablespoons  mustard seeds
  1         tablespoon  juniper berries
  1         tablespoon  whole black peppercorns
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                cup  kosher salt
  2               cups  water
  1              bunch  fresh thyme leaves
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     bone-in pork loin roast - (4 to 5 lbs)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a small dry skillet over medium heat toast the coriander, mustard seeds, juniper berries, and peppercorns until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Put them on a plate to cool.  In a bowl mix the sugar and salt with 2 cups of water until dissolved.  Put the pork roast into a deep bowl or a large plastic bag.  Pour in the sugar and salt water.  Add the toasted spices, thyme, and bay leaves.  Add more water until the meat is covered.  Let it sit in the brine in the refrigerator for 2 to 6 hours.

Remove the pork roast from the brine about 1/2 hour before you will be ready to cook it to allow it to come up to room temperature.  When ready to cook, heat a grill to high heat.  Dry the pork, rub it with olive oil, and season it with pepper.  Sear the pork on all sides to get grill marks.  Move the roast to an upper rack (or over indirect heat) and put a drip pan underneath it.  Cook the pork until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees, about 30 to 45 minutes.  Remove to a platter, cover loosely with foil, and allow it to rest for 10 minutes.

Before carving, add any accumulated juices to the drippings in the pan.  Spoon these over the sliced pork.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

                    Caesar Salad With Crunchy Croutons

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CROUTONS ===
     1/2                loaf crusty Italian bread
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === DRESSING ===
  4                     anchovy fillets
  1                     garlic clove -- smashed
  2                     lemons -- juiced
  1         tablespoon  water
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  2              heads  romaine lettuce
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan -- for garnish

Make the Croutons:  Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Hand-tear the bread into small pieces and put them into a bowl.  Add the olive oil, Parmesan, and thyme leaves; season with salt and pepper.  Mix this well to combine all the flavors.  Spread the cubes out onto a baking sheet and bake until they are golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Let them cool before tossing them onto the salad.

Make the Dressing:  Put the anchovies, garlic, lemon juice, and water into a blender and process for 30 seconds until the mixture is smooth.  With the blender running, pour the olive oil in slowly for the dressing to emulsify.  Stir in the Parmesan and a couple of grinds of black pepper.  Season, to taste, with salt and set aside.  (Refrigerate the dressing if you will not be using it right away.)

Assemble the salad:  Tear the lettuce into a large bowl.  Add enough dressing to coat the salad to your liking.  Add the croutons and some extra Parmesan and toss the salad well.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
     1/4           cup  honey
  1         tablespoon  yellow mustard
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
  2              whole  garlic cloves
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  8                     boneless skinless chicken thighs
  1                     fresh pineapple
  16                    wooden skewers -- soaked in water for
                        30 minutes
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for brushing
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a saucepan over medium heat, add the ketchup, soy sauce, honey, mustard, sugar, garlic, and lemon juice.  Bring to a simmer and cook gently until thickened, about 10 minutes.  Set aside and cool.

Heat an outdoor grill or a grill pan.  Cut each chicken thigh into 2 pieces.  Peel the pineapple and cut it into 1 1/2-inch chunks.  Alternating between the chicken and pineapple, thread the pieces onto the skewers.  Brush them with olive oil and season them with salt and pepper.  Remove the garlic cloves from the barbecue sauce and discard; put about half the sauce into a small bowl for later.  Brush skewers with some of the sauce.  Cook them on the grill, basting regularly with the barbecue sauce, until cooked through, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Serve with reserved barbecue sauce on the side for dipping.

This recipe yields 16 skewers.

Remove the garlic cloves from the barbecue sauce and discard; put about half the sauce into a small bowl for later.  Brush skewers with some of the sauce.  Cook them on the grill, basting regularly with the barbecue sauce, until cooked through, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Serve with reserved barbecue sauce on the side for dipping.

  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  4                     radishes -- thinly sliced

For the Mole:  Tear the ancho, anaheim, and chipotle chiles into large pieces and toast them in a dry skillet over medium heat until they change color a bit, about 2 minutes.  Put them into a bowl with the raisins and cover them with hot water.  Soak unti softened, about 30 minutes.

In the same skillet over medium heat, add the almonds, sesame seeds, peppercorns, cinnamon stick, oregano, and thyme.  Toast for 2 minutes, grind in a spice grinder, and add the powder to a blender.

In the same skillet over medium-high heat add the olive oil, onions, garlic, and serrano.  Cook until lightly browned, then add the tomatoes.  Cook until vegetables are softened, about 10 to 15 minutes, then add to the blender.  Add the chocolate and the soaked chiles and raisins to the blender along with some of the chile soaking liquid.  Puree, adding more soaking liquid as needed, to make a smooth sauce.  (This makes about 4 cups sauce, the recipe uses 2 cups, the extra can be frozen).

Pour the lemon juice over the chicken and season it well with salt and pepper.  Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed skillet and brown the chicken on all sides; remove the browned chicken to a plate leaving the oil in the pan.  Pour 2 cups of the mole sauce into the hot skillet and simmer for about 5 minutes.  Add the chicken stock and return the chicken pieces to the pan.  Simmer, covered, until the chicken is cooked through, about 20 to 25 minutes.

Meanwhile, put the onion and radish slices into a bowl.  Add the lime juice and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt.  Mix well and serve with the chicken.

           Chinese Deep-Fried Fish With Spicy Black Bean Sauce

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  red snapper - (2 to 3 lbs) -- cleaned, scaled
  1                cup  rice flour
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
  4                     scallions -- sliced thin
  1              piece  ginger - (abt 1") -- peeled, chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced thin
  1                     serrano chile -- sliced thin
     1/2           cup  fermented black beans*
  2               cups  low-sodium chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  water
                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish

* Can be found at Asian markets and gourmet shops.

Remove the head from the fish (or have your fishmonger do this) and cut the fish into 2-inch thick steaks.  Put the rice flour on a plate and season it well with salt and pepper; dredge the fish pieces in the rice flour, shaking off any excess.

In a deep pot or a wok large enough to hold the fish, heat the vegetable oil to 350 degrees.  Carefully put in the fish and deep-fry until it is browned, crisp, and cooked through, about 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove the fish pieces and drain them on paper towels; place them onto a platter.

Carefully drain all but 3 tablespoons of oil from the wok.  Stir-fry the scallions, ginger, garlic, and chiles for about 2 minutes.  Add the black beans and fry for another minute.  Pour in the chicken stock, bring to a boil, and simmer until the sauce begins to thicken, about 10 minutes.  In a small bowl mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water making sure to get out all the lumps.  Pour this slurry into the black bean mixture (it will thicken immediately) and cook for another 2 minutes.  Pour the sauce over the fish pieces, garnish with cilantro leaves, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                     Citrus-Marinated Grilled Turkey

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry
                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CITRUS MARINADE ===
  4                     tangerines, clementines, or oranges
  1               head  garlic -- halved
  1                     red Thai bird chili -- chopped (optional)
  4             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  whole black peppercorns
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
                        === TURKEY ===
  1                     free-range organic turkey - (12 to 14 lbs)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Put all the marinade ingredients into a bowl and pour over a generous amount of olive oil.  Squeeze everything together with your hands to blend all the flavors.

Have the butcher cut the turkey into 4 pieces and remove the bones from the breast.  (Save the neck and backbone for the gravy.)  To marinate, put the turkey on a large platter and pour on the marinade; turn the turkey over in the marinade to make sure it is well coated on both sides.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.

Remove the turkey from the refrigerator about 1/2 hour before you are ready to grill it.  Heat the grill to medium and wipe the grate with some oil.  Wipe the marinade from the turkey and season it well with salt and pepper.  Put the turkey on the grill, skin-side down, and cook for 30 minutes.  Turn the bird over and continue grilling, basting with more olive oil, until the juices run clear and the internal temperature of the thigh is 180 degrees, about 1 hour total.  Set aside, cover with foil, and let it rest for about 10 minutes before carving.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Put all the marinade ingredients into a bowl and pour over a generous amount of olive oil.  Squeeze everything together with your hands to blend all the flavors.

<DirT>
Have the butcher cut the turkey into 4 pieces and remove the bones from the breast.  (Save the neck and backbone for the gravy.)  To marinate, put the turkey on a large platter and pour on the marinade; turn the turkey over in the marinade to make sure it is well coated on both sides.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the turkey from the refrigerator about 1/2 hour before you are ready to grill it.  Heat the grill to medium and wipe the grate with some oil.  Wipe the marinade from the turkey and season it well with salt and pepper.  Put the turkey on the grill, skin-side down, and cook for 30 minutes.  Turn the bird over and continue grilling, basting with more olive oil, until the juices run clear and the internal temperature of the thigh is 180 degrees, about 1 hour total.  Set aside, cover with foil, and let it rest for about 10 minutes before carving.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- softened
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan -- plus
                        more for garnish
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped mixed herbs
                        = (such as parsley, chives, and thyme)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             pounds  creamer potatoes
  8               ears  corn
  4             pounds  kielbasa -- cut into pieces
  8              dozen  hard-shell clams
                        = (such as cherrystone or littleneck)

Dig a shallow pit in the sand and line it with large stones.  Pile wood on top of the coals.  Burn the wood for 1 to 2 hours until the rocks are red hot; rake off the ashes.  Set 1 cinder block on each corner of the pit to form the base; lay a barbecue grate on top to make a table.

While the stones are heating prepare the herb butter:  Mix the butter with the cheese and herbs; season it with salt and pepper.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

Place a thick layer of seaweed on the grate.  Place a layer of potatoes on the rack and cover them with a thin layer of seaweed.  Put the corn on next and then another thin layer of seaweed.  Now put on the kielbasa and top it with a thin layer of seaweed.  Next mound the clams on top and cover with a thick layer of seaweed.  Cover the entire bake with burlap or a tarp soaked in sea water.  Keep the tarp wet by pouring sea water over the top if needed.  Cook until the clams open and the potatoes are tender, about 1 hour.

Pull the husks back from the corn and remove the silk.  Brush generously with the herb butter and garnish with grated Parmesan.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE BRINE ===
  1                cup  kosher salt
  1                cup  brown sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  whole coriander
  1 1/2    tablespoons  whole mustard seeds
  1 1/2    tablespoons  whole black peppercorns
  1 1/2    tablespoons  whole allspice
  4             sprigs  fresh marjoram
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme leaves
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     brisket - (2 1/2 to 3 lbs)
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     onion -- halved
  6                     carrots -- coarsely chopped
  1               head  celery including leaves -- coarsely chopped
  1               head  garlic -- halved
  3             sprigs  fresh marjoram
  2                     bay leaves
  1              small  cabbage -- cut 6 to 8 wedges
                        Herbed Root Vegetables -- (see recipe)

Combine all the brine ingredients, except the brisket, in a large non-reactive bowl.  Add the brisket (you may have to cut it into 2 pieces) and rub the spice mix into the meat.  Pour cold water over until the meat is covered.  Weight the brisket down with a small plate so that it is completely submerged; cover and refrigerate.  The meat can be brined overnight or as long as 10 days.  The longer the brining the more pickled the meat.

Heat the oven to 300 degrees.

Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add the olive oil.  Add the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, marjoram, and bay leaves and cook until starting to soften, about 10 minutes.  Remove the meat from the brine and rinse it well.  Set the meat on top of the vegetables and add water to just cover the meat.  Bring to a boil skimming any foam that surfaces.  Reduce the heat to a simmer, place the lid on the pot, and cook for 15 minutes.  Add the cabbage pieces, cover, and put it into the oven; cook for 3 hours.

Remove the meat, cover it with foil, and let it rest for 20 minutes.  Cut the fat off the corned beef, slice the meat against the grain, and serve it in shallow bowls with the cabbage wedges, some cooking liquid, and the Herbed Root Vegetables.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Combine all the brine ingredients, except the brisket, in a large non-reactive bowl.  Add the brisket (you may have to cut it into 2 pieces) and rub the spice mix into the meat.  Pour cold water over until the meat is covered.  Weight the brisket down with a small plate so that it is completely submerged; cover and refrigerate.  The meat can be brined overnight or as long as 10 days.  The longer the brining the more pickled the meat.

Heat the oven to 300 degrees.

<DirT>
Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add the olive oil.  Add the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, marjoram, and bay leaves and cook until starting to soften, about 10 minutes.  Remove the meat from the brine and rinse it well.  Set the meat on top of the vegetables and add water to just cover the meat.  Bring to a boil skimming any foam that surfaces.  Reduce the heat to a simmer, place the lid on the pot, and cook for 15 minutes.  Add the cabbage pieces, cover, and put it into the oven; cook for 3 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the meat, cover it with foil, and let it rest for 20 minutes.  Cut the fat off the corned beef, slice the meat against the grain, and serve it in shallow bowls with the cabbage wedges, some cooking liquid, and the Herbed Root Vegetables.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HOLLANDAISE ===
  2                     egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === HASH AND EGGS ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2               cups  chopped corned beef
  2               cups  chopped Herbed Root Vegetables -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives -- plus
                        more for garnish
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar

Make the Hollandaise:  Put the egg yolks, mustard, cayenne, and water into a blender.  Blend this together and then slowly start pouring in the warm butter with the blender running.  Stop the machine when all the butter has been incorporated.  Taste and adjust the seasoning with lemon juice, salt, and pepper.  Thin the hollandaise with a little water if it is too thick.  Keep warm while you fry the hash and poach the eggs.

Fry the Hash:  Heat the oil and butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, add the onion, and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the corned beef, vegetables,and chives; cook until the bottom is brown and crisp, about 5 to 10 minutes.

Poach the Eggs:  Meanwhile, fill a large skillet with water, bring it to a boil, and add the vinegar and a large pinch of salt.  Reduce the heat until the water is just barely bubbling.  Crack each egg into a small bowl and carefully slide the egg into the water.  Cook until the eggs are set, about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes.  Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and dab the bottom with paper towels to dry them off.

Serve:  Place 1/4 of the hash onto a warm plate or shallow bowl.  Top with a poached egg and a couple of tablespoons of hollandaise; garnish with chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                      Cornmeal With Okra - {Cou-Cou}

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  corn ears
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2               cups  okra -- frozen or fresh
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme -- leaves only
  6               cups  water or chicken stock
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  yellow corn meal
                        Freshly-ground nutmeg -- to taste

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Put the whole ears of corn into the oven (do not shuck the corn) and cook until the outside is charred and the inside feels soft when pressed, about 30 minutes.  When it is cool enough to handle, pull out the silk and remove the husk.  Cut the kernels off the cob and set aside.

If using frozen okra, put it into a strainer and run it under cool water for a few minutes to thaw.  Remove the stems from the okra and cut them into thirds.  Heat 1 tablespoon each of butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook the onion until it begins to soften, then add the corn, okra, and thyme.  Cook for 1 minute and set aside.

Butter a 13-inch by 9-inch pan with 1 tablespoon butter.  Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan and add 1 teaspoon salt.  Gradually sprinkle in the corn meal, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.  When it is all incorporated, stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons butter and the sauteed vegetables.  Reduce the heat to low, season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, to taste, and cook for 10 minutes stirring occasionally.  Pour into the buttered dish and let cool.

Slice the cooled cornmeal into squares and serve.  You can also fry the cornmeal squares for a few minutes in butter or olive oil to make them crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  spinach
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- lightly smashed
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground nutmeg
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Wash the spinach in several changes of water to get rid of any grit.  Drain the spinach but keep some of the water clinging to the leaves.  Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the spinach and garlic.  Cook, turning frequently, until the spinach has wilted down evenly.  Remove the garlic and put the spinach into a colander and let it drain well.  Press out as much liquid as you can from the leaves and chop them coarsely.

Heat the skillet again over medium-high heat and add the cream and nutmeg; cook until it reduces a bit, about 5 minutes.  Add the spinach and parmesan and season with salt and pepper.  Cook until the spinach is hot, about 5 more minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  mussels
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled, smashed
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
     1/2                lemon -- thinly sliced
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  low-sodium chicken broth
                        Crusty French bread -- for serving

Scrub the mussels with a vegetable brush under running water; discard any with broken shells or that remain opened when tapped.

In a large pot over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter in the olive oil.  Add the garlic, thyme, and lemon slices and cook until everything has softened, about 5 minutes.  Add the mussels and stir to coat them with all the flavors.  Add the wine, then the chicken broth; cover the pot and steam for 10 to 12 minutes until the mussels open.

Remove the mussels from the pot.  Take the meat out of 10 of the mussels and put them back into the pot along with the remaining butter.  Using an immersion blender, buzz the liquid until the sauce thickens and becomes creamy; taste and adjust seasoning.  Divide the remaining mussels among the serving bowls and spoon over the sauce.  Serve with plenty of crusty French bread to dip in the sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  Yukon gold potatoes
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme -- leaves chopped
  4             sprigs  fresh rosemary -- leaves chopped
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  green olives -- pitted, chopped
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained and rinsed
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/2         bunch  fresh parsley -- leaves chopped
     1/2                lemon -- juiced

Peel the potatoes and slice them into thin 1/8-inch thick slices.  Put them into a large bowl and toss with the thyme, rosemary, and olive oil; season with salt and pepper.  Place a large skillet onto the grill and coat the bottom with olive oil.  Place the slices into the pan, overlapping them in 1 layer until the entire surface is covered with potatoes.  Drizzle some more olive oil over the top.  Cook over medium-high heat until the bottoms are browned and crisp.  Turn the potatoes over and cook the other side until they are browned and crisp.

In a food processor add the olives, capers, garlic, and parsley.  Process, adding some olive oil in a thin stream, until you have a smooth puree.  Mix in the lemon juice and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.

Coat the bottom of a large platter with some of the salsa, pile the potatoes on top, and drizzle on some more salsa.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
  2               cups  panko bread crumbs*
  3                     eggs
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             pounds  halibut, snapper, or
                        other firm flesh white fish
  8                     corn tortillas
     1/2          head  napa cabbage -- shredded
                        Pink Chili Mayo -- (see recipe)
                        Lime wedges -- for garnish

* Available in the Asian section of your market.

To fry the fish:  Fill a large heavy-bottomed pot about 1/3 full of peanut oil.  Heat to 375 degrees.  While the oil is heating, put the breadcrumbs into a shallow dish.  Break the eggs into another shallow dish, season with salt and pepper, and beat them with 2 tablespoons of water.

Cut the fish into 1-inch wide strips.  Dip them into the egg, then coat them well with the breadcrumbs.  Set aside and let them rest for 10 minutes.  Cook the fish a few pieces at a time until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.

To make the tacos:  Heat a dry cast-iron skillet over medium heat.  Warm a corn tortilla in the pan until it softens, about 30 seconds.  Place a fish strip on it, top with some of the shredded cabbage, and a big dollop of Pink Chili Mayo.  Squeeze on some lime juice, roll up, and eat!

This recipe yields 8 servings.

               French Fries With Roasted Garlic Mayonnaise

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ROASTED GARLIC MAYONNAISE ===
  1               head  garlic -- sliced in half
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1         tablespoon  water
  1 1/2           cups  canola oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        === FRENCH FRIES ===
  8             medium  Idaho potatoes
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Sea salt
     1/2         bunch  chives -- finely chopped

Heat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place the garlic onto a sheet of aluminum foil, top it with the thyme, drizzle it with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and season it with salt and pepper.  Close the foil up and roast the garlic until it is soft, about 35 to 40 minutes.  When it is cool enough to handle, squeeze the soft pulp into a bowl and set aside.

In a non-reactive bowl or in a food processor, combine the egg yolks, mustard, water, and salt and pepper.  Whisk or pulse with the machine to break up the yolks.  If you're making the mayonnaise by hand, put the bowl on a damp towel to keep it from moving around while you work.  Then drizzle in the oils, whisking constantly, to form an emulsion.  If the mayonnaise breaks, stop drizzling and whisk until it comes together again.  If you're using the food processor, pour in the oils in a thin stream with the machine running.  Then whisk or process in the garlic and lemon juice.  Taste and adjust seasoning with more lemon juice, salt, or pepper.  Thin the mayonnaise with more water if it is too thick.

Pour the vegetable oil into a deep fat fryer or heavy saucepan to reach halfway up the sides and heat to 325 degrees.  While the oil is heating, peel the skin off the potatoes and cut them into uniform 1/4-inch sticks using a knife, mandoline, or French fry cutter.  Rinse the potato sticks well and dry them thoroughly to keep the hot oil from splattering.  Fry the potatoes in batches so the pot isn't crowded and the oil temperature does not drop too much.  Cook the potatoes until soft but not browned, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove them and drain on paper towels.

Increase the oil temperature to 375 degrees.  Cook the par-fried potatoes in batches a second time until golden and crispy, about 2 to 4 minutes.  Drain on fresh paper towels.  Salt the French fries while they are still hot and garnish with chives.  Serve immediately with the Roasted Garlic Mayonnaise as a dip.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Caution:  Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness.  To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell.

                        === RICE ===
  2               cups  long-grain white rice -- rinsed

  3        tablespoons  sesame oil
  4                     scallions -- sliced thin
  1              piece  ginger - (abt 1") -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/2           cup  frozen peas -- run under cool
                        water for 2 minutes to thaw
  1                     carrot -- finely chopped
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  3        tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce

                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish

In a pot with a tight fitting lid, add the rice and 4 cups cold water.  Put in the ginger and salt.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside for about 10 minutes.

Heat a wok or large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  When it is hot, pour in the sesame oil.  Add the scallions, ginger, and garlic; stir-fry for 1 minute until fragrant.  Stir in the peas and carrots and cook for about 2 minutes.  Pour in the eggs and stir-fry until they are cooked, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the ginger from the rice and add the rice to the wok; stir everything together and break up any clumps of rice.  Add the soy and hoisin and stir some more.  Taste for seasoning and add some salt if needed.  Stir in the cilantro leaves and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     eggs
  8             slices  thick-cut bacon -- cut 1/2" pieces
  2                     shallots -- thinly sliced
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives -- plus
                        more for garnish
  1                     large head frisee lettuce -- torn bite size

Fill a large skillet with water, bring it to a boil, and add the vinegar and a large pinch of salt.  Reduce the heat until the water is just barely bubbling.  Crack each egg into a small bowl and carefully slide the egg into the water.  Cook until the eggs are set, about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes.  Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and dab the bottom with paper towels to dry them off; set aside and keep warm.

Put the bacon and shallots into a cold skillet with a tablespoon of olive oil and cook over medium heat until the bacon is browned and crisp; be careful not to let it burn.  Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, and set aside.  Meanwhile, get a jar with a tight fitting lid.  Add the mustard, remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil, red wine vinegar, and lemon juice.  Shake well to combine the ingredients, add the chives, taste, and season with salt and pepper.

Put the frisee into a large bowl and toss it with the dressing the cooked bacon and shallots.  To serve, place a large mound of salad onto a plate and top with a poached egg.  Garnish with some chives and a drizzle of olive oil.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     garlic cloves -- smashed and chopped
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme -- leaves only
  1                     chicken - (4 to 4 1/2 lbs) -- cut in half
  4                     portobello mushrooms -- brushed clean, and
                        stems removed
  2              small  radicchio heads -- halved
                        Watercress -- to serve

Put the garlic onto a cutting board and sprinkle it with about 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Using the side of a large knife, slowly mash the garlic into a paste.  Put the garlic paste into a small bowl and blend in 1/2 cup olive oil, parsley, and thyme leaves.  Pour half the mixture over the chicken and season it with salt and pepper.  Set the chicken aside to marinate while you prepare the other ingredients for grilling.

Heat the grill to medium-high.  Drizzle half the remaining marinade into the mushrooms and half onto the cut side of the radicchios.  Season both with salt and pepper and place them on the grill over indirect heat.  Grill until the mushrooms and radicchio are soft, about 10 to 15 minutes; set them aside to cool while you cook the chicken

Put the chicken on the grill and cook for about 15 to 20 minutes per side, or until cooked through and juices run clear.  Set aside until cool enough to handle.

To serve, cut the chicken into pieces, cut the mushrooms into quarters, and cut the radicchio into wedges.  Gently toss everything together with some fresh watercress and an extra drizzle of olive oil.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  2             pounds  boneless skinless chicken -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  2             slices  fresh ginger -- smashed

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
     1/2           cup  cornstarch -- plus
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch -- for slurry
     1/2           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame oil
  4                     dried red Thai chilies
  4                     scallions -- thinly sliced, plus
                        more for garnish
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 1") -- peeled, chopped fine
  3                     thick strips orange zest
     1/2           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  honey
                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish
                        Steamed white rice -- for serving

Put the chicken into a bowl with the remaining marinade ingredients.  Stir well to combine all the flavors, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Heat 2 inches of peanut oil in a wok or deep skillet to 375 degrees.  Mix the egg, cornstarch, water, and sesame oil in a large bowl until smooth and season with salt and pepper.  Add the marinated chicken and coat it well with the batter.  When the oil is hot, cook the chicken pieces in batches until they are browned and crisp, about 4 to 5 minutes per batch.  Drain on paper towels.

When you have fried all the chicken, pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil.  Over high heat, add the chilies, scallion, garlic, ginger, and orange zest.  Stir-fry for 1 minute then pour in the soy sauce, chicken stock, vinegar, and honey and bring it to a boil.  Mix the remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water until smooth.  Pour the slurry into the boiling sauce, in 2 additions, until the sauce thickens.  Add the chicken pieces and cook until they are heated through, about 2 more minutes.  Garnish with scallions and cilantro leaves.  Serve with white rice.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Put the chicken into a bowl with the remaining marinade ingredients.  Stir well to combine all the flavors, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat 2 inches of peanut oil in a wok or deep skillet to 375 degrees.  Mix the egg, cornstarch, water, and sesame oil in a large bowl until smooth and season with salt and pepper.  Add the marinated chicken and coat it well with the batter.  When the oil is hot, cook the chicken pieces in batches until they are browned and crisp, about 4 to 5 minutes per batch.  Drain on paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When you have fried all the chicken, pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil.  Over high heat, add the chilies, scallion, garlic, ginger, and orange zest.  Stir-fry for 1 minute then pour in the soy sauce, chicken stock, vinegar, and honey and bring it to a boil.  Mix the remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water until smooth.  Pour the slurry into the boiling sauce, in 2 additions, until the sauce thickens.  Add the chicken pieces and cook until they are heated through, about 2 more minutes.  Garnish with scallions and cilantro leaves.  Serve with white rice.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  basmati rice
  2               cups  water
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 1") -- peeled, halved,
                        and smashed
  6                     green cardamom pods
  1              pinch  kosher salt

Rinse the rice to get rid of excess starch.  Put it into a heavy bottomed pot with a tight fitting lid.  Add the water, ginger, cardamom, and salt and give it a good stir.  Bring it to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook gently for about 15 minutes.  You will see holes poking through the rice and most of the water should be absorbed.  Let the rice stand off the heat, covered, for about 5 minutes.  Remove the ginger and discard, fluff the rice and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  green beans
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     loaf crusty Italian bread
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  4        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             pounds  mixed mushrooms -- sliced
                        = (such as button, cremini, shiitake)
  2                     shallots -- sliced
  1                cup  heavy cream

Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add a big pinch of salt and the green beans.  Cook for about 5 minutes, the beans should still be crisp, they will be cooked more in the oven.  Drain them and set aside.  Butter a baking dish large enough to hold the green beans with 1 tablespoon butter and set aside.

Heat the oven to 375 degrees.

Tear the bread into 2-inch pieces, put them into a bowl, and add 1 tablespoon chives, 1 tablespoon thyme, 1 tablespoon rosemary, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, and 3 tablespoons olive oil.  Stir well to coat and spread onto a baking sheet.  Bake just until the bread just starts to turn golden, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and set aside.

Meanwhile, melt the remaining butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and shallots, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the mushrooms have released their liquid, about 10 minutes.  Pour in the heavy cream, add the remaining thyme and chives, and cook for another 5 minutes.  Add the green beans and stir well.  Put the green bean mixture into the prepared baking dish, top with the croutons, and sprinkle on the remaining Parmesan.  Bake until everything is hot and bubbling, about 20 to 25 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GARLIC AND HERB OIL ===
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  4             sprigs  fresh rosemary -- leaves chopped
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme -- leaves chopped
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ANTIPASTO PLATTER ===
  10                    baby artichokes
  2                     lemons -- halved
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more as needed and for garnish
  2             medium  eggplant -- sliced thick
  4             medium  zucchini -- sliced
  4                     red bell peppers -- halved, cored
  1              bunch  scallions
  5                     tomatoes -- halved
     1/2         pound  alfonso olives -- for garnish
     1/2         pound  ricotta salata -- crumbled for garnish
                        Fresh basil leaves -- for garnish
                        Fresh chervil leaves -- for garnish

To make the Garlic and Herb Oil, put all the ingredients into a small saucepan and put it over low heat.  Cook for about 5 minutes, just until it becomes aromatic.  Set aside and allow the oil to cool.

Bring a large pot of water to a simmer.  Squeeze in the juice from 1 lemon and throw the lemon halves in as well.  Trim and halve the artichokes and remove the chokes.  Put them into the pot and cook them until they are tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain and set aside.

Heat the grill to low.  Have a large shallow dish filled with 1 cup olive oil.  Coat the eggplant, zucchini, peppers, artichokes, scallions, and tomatoes separately with the oil.  Grill the vegetables, basting generously with the Garlic and Herb Oil, until tender and soft: about 10 minutes for the eggplant, 8 minutes for the zucchini, 15 minutes for the peppers, 10 minutes for the artichokes, and 5 minutes for the scallions and tomatoes.  Arrange them on a large platter and garnish with the olives, cheese, and herbs.  Squeeze over the remaining lemon juice and drizzle with a bit of olive oil.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     baby eggplants
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     tomatoes
     1/4           cup  fennel seeds
  4                     ahi tuna steaks, 1 1/2" thk - -- (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1                     big strip lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  smoked paprika
  2        tablespoons  creme fraiche or sour cream
                        Fresh basil leaves -- for garnish

Prepare ingredients for grilling:  Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut the eggplants in half, toss them in some olive oil, and season them with salt and pepper.  Put them cut-side down on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes in half, toss them in some olive oil, and season them with salt and pepper; set aside.  Toast the fennel seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat just until they become fragrant, about 1 minute.  Grind them to a powder in a spice mill.  Brush some olive oil onto the tuna steaks and sprinkle them with the ground fennel.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to grill.

Make the sauce:  Cook the chicken stock with the lemon peel over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes, or until it has reduced by half.  Take the pan off the heat and discard the lemon peel.  Stir in the paprika and creme fraiche and season it with a little salt and pepper.  Buzz the sauce with an immersion blender (or process it in a regular blender) until it is foamy.

Get grilling:  Heat the grill; brush the grate with some olive oil.  Season the tuna with salt and pepper and drizzle over some olive oil.  Grill them until medium-rare (or to your liking), about 3 to 4 minutes per side.  Grill the tomatoes and eggplant until slightly charred.  Put the grilled tomatoes and eggplant into a bowl and toss them with some of the sauce.

To serve:  Top the tuna steaks with the grilled tomato and eggplant salad.  Spoon some more warm sauce over and garnish with torn basil leaves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GARDEN PUREE ===
     1/2         pound  sugar snap peas -- trimmed
  1              pound  English peas -- shelled
                        = (or 1 cup frozen petite peas)

     1/2         pound  haricots verts or tender green beans -- trimmed
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  ricotta cheese
  3                     scallions, green parts only -- roughly chopped
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GRILLED LAMB AND LOBSTER ===
  4                     lamb chops - (1 1/2" thick)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  1                     tomato -- seeded, chopped
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     lobster tails -- halved
                        Mint leaves -- for garnish

Make the Garden Puree:  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the peas, asparagus tips, and green beans and cook until bright green and crisp tender, about 3 minutes.  (If you're using frozen peas, you can throw them in during the last minute to thaw.)  Drain, transfer to a bowl of salted ice water to stop the cooking, and drain again.  Save a few pieces of each vegetable to use as garnish.  Puree the cooled greens in a food processor while pouring in the olive oil.  Add the ricotta and scallions and process again.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper; set aside.

For the lamb chops:  Brush the lamb chops with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill over medium-high heat for about 8 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

For the lobster:  In a small saucepan over low heat melt the butter with the tomato, thyme, salt, and pepper.  Cook for about 5 minutes to break down the tomato; set aside.  Coat the lobster tails with olive oil and season them with salt and pepper.  Grill them shell-side down for about 5 minutes.  Turn them over and spoon on some of the tomato butter; cook for another 5 minutes.  Remove from the grill and keep warm.

To serve:  Spoon a generous mound of the Garden Puree onto a plate.  Place a lamb chop on top of the Garden Puree and place a lobster tail next to that.  Spoon some more tomato butter over the lobster.  Garnish the lamb chop with the reserved vegetables and some mint leaves.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === STEAKS ===
  3                     ancho chiles -- seeded, and
                        torn into pieces
     1/4           cup  chili powder
  2        tablespoons  coriander seed
  1         tablespoon  cumin seed
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  2          teaspoons  sweet paprika
     1/2                cinnamon stick
  4                     strip steaks, 1 1/2" thk - (abt 2 lbs)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CRAB SALAD ===
  1              pound  lump crabmeat -- picked over for
                        shells
     3/4           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  2        tablespoons  chili sauce
                        = (such as Srirachi Hot Chili Sauce)
                        Juice of 1/2 lime -- plus

In a small dry skillet over medium heat, add the chiles, chili powder, coriander, cumin, oregano, paprika, and cinnamon stick.  Heat just until the ingredients become fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Put the spices into a grinder and pulse to a powder.  Massage the dry chili rub into the steaks; cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.

For the Crab Salad:  Put the crabmeat in a bowl and add the mayonnaise, shallots, cilantro, chili sauce, and lime juice.  Mix gently to combine the ingredients without breaking up the large lumps of crabmeat.  Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.

Remove the steaks from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before you want to grill them to bring them up to room temperature.  Heat the grill; brush the grate with some olive oil.  Season the steaks with salt and pepper and place them on the hot grill.  Cook for 6 to 7 minutes per side for medium-rare.  When the steaks are cooked to your liking, put them on a platter, cover them with aluminum foil, and let them rest for 5 minutes.  Serve a generous scoop of crab meat on top of the steaks.  Garnish with lime wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              pound  new potatoes -- scrubbed
  1              pound  baby carrots -- trimmed and scrubbed

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === HERB BUTTER ===
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  mixed chopped fresh herbs
                        = (like thyme, mint, chives, parsley, or

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Put the olive oil and butter into a large pot over medium-high heat.  Add the vegetables and toss to coat them well with the fat; season with salt and pepper.  Add 1 cup water and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to a simmer, cover the pot, and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Herb Butter by combining the soft butter and herbs together; season with some salt and pepper.

To serve, spread some Herb Butter in the bottom of a bowl.  Add the hot vegetables and dot with more Herb Butter.  Moisten with some of the cooking liquid and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                  Horseradish And Salt-Crusted Prime Rib

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     prime 3-rib beef roast - (abt 6 lbs)
  4                     red onions -- halved
  4                     carrots -- cut in chunks
  4                     parsnips -- cut in chunks
  2              heads  garlic -- halved
                        === HORSERADISH AND SALT CRUST ===
     1/2           cup  prepared horseradish
  5                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary -- chopped
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme -- chopped
     1/2           cup  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Put the onions, carrots, parsnips, and garlic into the bottom of a large roasting pan.  Place the roast, rib-side down, on top of the vegetables.  In a small bowl mash together the horseradish, garlic, rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil to make a paste.  Smear the paste generously over the entire roast and drizzle with some extra oil.  Roast for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours or approximately 20 minutes per pound for medium-rare.  Check the internal temperature of the roast in several places with an instant-read thermometer, it should register 125 degrees for medium-rare.

Remove the beef to a carving board, cover it with foil, and allow it to rest for 20 minutes.  Note: the internal temperature of the meat will continue to rise about 10 degrees.  Remove the vegetables and set aside.  Pour the pan juices into a fat separator and set aside to allow the fat and beef juices to separate.  Use the juices to serve with the meat and save the fat for Yorkshire pudding.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Buying And Trimming:  When ordering the rib roast from a butcher, be sure to request a "top choice" roast cut from the small loin end; the best being ribs 12 through 10.  Have the butcher cut off the chine/backbone.  The rib bones look best if they are shortened and frenched, have the butcher do this for you as well.

  4               cups  water
  3             stalks  celery -- roughly chopped

                        Freshly-grated Parmesan

Make the Pasta Dough for Ravioli and set aside to rest.

Cook the potatoes:  Put the potatoes into a pot, cover them with water, add salt, and bay leaf.  Bring to a boil and cook the potatoes until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain them and set aside until cool enough to handle; remove the bay leaf.

Make the garden puree:  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the snap peas, peas, asparagus tips, and green beans and cook until bright green and crisp tender, about 3 minutes.  (If you're using frozen peas, you can throw them in during the last minute to thaw.)  Drain, transfer to a bowl of salted ice water to stop the cooking, and drain again.  Reserve half the vegetables and puree the other half in a food processor with the scallions, 2 tablespoons olive oil and salt and pepper, to taste.  Fold in the ricotta and set aside.

Roll out the dough:  Cut the ball of dough in half, cover and reserve the piece you are not using to prevent it from drying out.  Dust the counter and dough with a little flour.  Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine set at the widest setting 2 or 3 times.  Guide the dough with your hand as it emerges from the rollers to prevent it from puncturing or stretching.  Dust the sheets with extra flour whenever the dough gets sticky.  Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again 2 or 3 times.  Continue reducing the setting and rolling until the machine is at its narrowest setting; the dough should be about 1/8-inch thick.  Roll out the other half.  Cut the pasta sheets into 3-foot long lengths.

Assemble the lasagne:  Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lay a 6-inch section of each long pasta sheet in a row on a sheet pan, letting the remaining pasta sheet hang over the edge of the pan.  Spread 2 heaping tablespoons of garden puree on top and scatter over some of the reserved vegetables; break apart 1 or 2 potatoes by hand and place them over the vegetables along with some basil leaves.  Fold the pasta sheet over to cover the filling letting the remaining length hang over the other side of the pan.  Continue to layer on more puree, vegetables and pasta until you have 4 layers.  Top with puree, vegetables, and basil leaves, then grate on some Parmesan and drizzle over some olive oil.  Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lobsters
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     leeks -- halved lengthwise
  2                     onions -- halved
  2             stalks  celery -- in big chunks
  2                     carrots -- in big chunks
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme
  4                     strips orange zest
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/2           cup  cognac
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  whole peppercorns
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Finely-grated orange zest -- for garnish
                        Finely-chopped chives -- for garnish
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        Grilled Brie And Tomato On Crusty Bread -- (see recipe)

Dispatch the lobsters by plunging a sharp knife directly behind its head.  Cut the lobster in half lengthwise; make sure to collect the juices that will run out.  Remove the claws and tail pieces and set aside.  Remove the head sac and liver and discard them; cut the body into pieces.  Alternately, you can have your fishmonger do this.

Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat and melt 3 tablespoons butter in it.  Add the chopped lobster bodies and heads and their juices, the leeks, 1 onion, celery, carrots, 1/2 the thyme, 1/2 the orange zest and the tomato paste.  Cook until the shells are red and the vegetables are soft, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat and carefully pour in 1/4 cup cognac.  Ignite the cognac with a long kitchen match and let the alcohol burn off.  Return to the heat, sprinkle in the flour, stir, and cook for another 2 minutes.  Add water to cover and stir up all the browned bits on the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon.  Add the cream and bring to a boil.  Immediately decrease the heat and gently simmer until the soup is reduced and thickened, about 30 to 45 minutes.  Strain this into a clean pot and season with salt and pepper if needed; keep warm.

Meanwhile, heat the oven to 400 degrees.  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons butter in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat.  Add remaining onion, thyme, bay leaf, and orange zest along with the peppercorns and let this mixture cook for about 5 minutes.  Add the lobster claws and tails; toss to coat with the fat and flavors.  Remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour in the remaining 1/4 cup cognac.  Ignite the cognac with a long kitchen match and let the alcohol burn off.  Put the pan into the oven and roast until the lobster pieces are cooked through, about 15 minutes.  Remove the lobster pieces and set aside.  When they are cool enough to handle, remove the lobster meat from the claws and tails.  Chop the meat roughly and add it to the strained bisque.

To serve, ladle the bisque into warmed soup bowls.  Top with the Grilled Brie and Tomato, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  elbow macaroni - (1 lb)
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4               cups  milk
     1/2        medium  onion -- stuck with
  1                     clove
  4                     garlic cloves
  1                     bay leaf
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  grated Cheddar -- plus
  1                cup  Cheddar in big chunks
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook the macaroni in a large pot of boiling salted water until done, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Drain and toss it with 2 tablespoons butter; set aside.

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Coat a large baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter and set it aside.

Put the milk into a saucepan and add the clove-studded onion, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, and mustard.  Warm over medium-low heat until the milk starts to steam, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let the flavors infuse while you make the roux.

In a large pot over medium heat add 2 tablespoons butter and the flour.  Cook, stirring, for about 2 to 3 minutes; don't let the roux color.  Strain the infused milk onto the roux, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.  Cook, stirring often, for about 5 minutes until the sauce is thick.  Remove from the heat and add 1/2 the grated Cheddar and 1/2 the Parmesan; stir until it is melted and smooth.

Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Pour this over the macaroni, add the chunks of Cheddar, and mix until well blended; put this into the prepared baking dish.  Sprinkle the remaining Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses evenly over the top.  Bake until the top is golden and crusty, about 25 to 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

<DirT>
Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Coat a large baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter and set it aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the milk into a saucepan and add the clove-studded onion, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, and mustard.  Warm over medium-low heat until the milk starts to steam, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let the flavors infuse while you make the roux.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large pot over medium heat add 2 tablespoons butter and the flour.  Cook, stirring, for about 2 to 3 minutes; don&apos;t let the roux color.  Strain the infused milk onto the roux, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.  Cook, stirring often, for about 5 minutes until the sauce is thick.  Remove from the heat and add 1/2 the grated Cheddar and 1/2 the Parmesan; stir until it is melted and smooth.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Pour this over the macaroni, add the chunks of Cheddar, and mix until well blended; put this into the prepared baking dish.  Sprinkle the remaining Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses evenly over the top.  Bake until the top is golden and crusty, about 25 to 30 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  Yukon gold potatoes
  2             pounds  parsnips
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives

Peel and cut the potatoes and parsnips into even-sized pieces.  Put them into a large pot, cover them with cold water, and add a large pinch of salt.  Bring to a boil and simmer until the vegetables are fork tender, about 20 to 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small pot gently heat the cream and butter over low heat.  When the vegetables are done drain them well.  Put the vegetables back into the pot over medium heat.  Gently stir them to remove any excess moisture; be careful not to burn them.

While the potatoes and parsnips are still warm, press them through a potato ricer or food mill into a bowl.  Add the warm cream a little at a time and beat with a wooden spoon until the potatoes are fluffy.  Season with salt and pepper and gently stir in the chives.  Serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GREEN OLIVE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  green olives -- pitted
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained, rinsed
     1/2         bunch  fresh parsley leaves
     1/2         bunch  fresh cilantro leaves
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  sherry vinegar
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === MUSSELS ===
  4             pounds  mussels -- cleaned, trimmed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     shallots -- chopped

Pour in the white wine, cover, and cook, shaking the pot occasionally, until all the mussels have opened, about 10 minutes.  Stir in the Green Olive Sauce, pour the mussels onto a platter, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  mushrooms -- sliced
                        = (Champignons de Paris recommended)
  3        tablespoons  salted butter -- divided
  12                    fresh eggs - (2 per person)
  2        tablespoons  creme fraiche
  1                     Handful chives -- finely chopped, plus
                        extra for garnish
     1/2    tablespoon  crushed white peppercorns*
                        Salt (recommended: Fleur de Sel)

*Cook's note:  To crush peppercorns cover them with a cloth and crush with a rolling pin.

Cut the mushrooms into thick slices, and on high heat saute in 2 tablespoons of butter in a non-stick frying pan on low heat.

In a medium bowl whisk the eggs by hand for 10 or 15 minutes until a frothy mousse forms on top.  Add creme fraiche and chives.  Season the eggs with sea salt and white peppercorns.

In a separate, large, non-stick frying pan melt 1 tablespoon of butter on a low heat, taking care not to burn it.  Pour in the eggs and cook for about 2 minutes.

Cook' note: the slower you cook it, the better the omelette.

When the omelette is cooked around the edges but still runny in the middle, add mushrooms.  Cook until the eggs are firm, or to taste.

Using a spatula ease the omelette onto a plate and flip it in half.  Slice into six portions.

Garnish with finely chopped chives and serve with a green salad.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        and smashed
  4             sprigs  fresh cilantro
  4                     skin-on salmon fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish
                        Lime wedges -- for garnish

In a bowl large enough to accommodate the salmon, mix the sake, soy sauce, mirin, and miso until the miso has dissolved.  Add the garlic, ginger, cilantro, and salmon fillets.  Cover and marinate for at least 20 minutes and up to 2 hours in the refrigerator.

Heat the oven to 400 degrees.

Season the salmon with salt and pepper on both sides.  Heat the oil in an ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  When the oil is hot, add the salmon skin-side down.  Put the pan into the oven and roast until the salmon is cooked medium-rare, about 12 to 15 minutes.  Serve garnished with cilantro leaves and lime wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Pasta Dough For Ravioli II

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1           teaspoon  salt
  6              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

To make the pasta dough:  In an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and salt.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to mix.  Pour in 1 tablespoon olive oil and continue to mix until a smooth dough is formed.  If the dough is too dry drizzle in a bit of water, if it is too wet sprinkle in some more flour.  Dust some flour on a work surface, knead and fold the dough until it is elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes.  Brush the surface of the dough with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

To make the dough by hand:  Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface, shape into a mound, and make a well in the center.  Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork.  Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall and mix it with the beaten eggs.  Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall.  Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a smooth dough.  Dust some flour on the work surface; knead and fold the dough until it is elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes.  Brush the surface of the dough with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

To roll out the dough:  Cut the ball of dough in half, cover and reserve the piece you are not using to prevent it from drying out.  Dust the counter and dough with a little flour.  Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine set at the widest setting 2 or 3 times.  Guide the dough with your hand as it emerges from the rollers to prevent it from puncturing or stretching.  Dust the sheets with extra flour whenever the dough gets sticky.  Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again 2 or 3 times.  Continue reducing the setting and rolling until the machine is at its narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick for ravioli.  Roll out the other half.

This recipe yields enough for 48 ravioli.

  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     fresh chorizo sausages -- cut into slices
  3             medium  potatoes -- peeled, cubed
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  8              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  mixed baby greens -- for garnish
     1/2                lemon -- juiced

Heat the oven to 375 degrees.

Pour 3 tablespoons olive oil into a 12-inch non stick, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chorizo and fry for 5 minutes; add the potato and onion and fry until the onions start to soften, about 5 minutes.  Reduce the heat and cover the skillet; cook until the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove the cover, raise the heat, and cook until the potatoes are brown and crispy, about another 5 minutes.

Meanwhile break the eggs into a large bowl, add the milk, season with salt and pepper, and whisk until frothy.  Pour the egg mixture into the pan, shaking the pan to distribute the eggs evenly.  Put the pan into the oven and cook until puffy and set, about 12 to 15 minutes.  Turn out onto a cutting board and let it cool to room temperature.

Toss the baby greens with the remaining oil and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.  Place the greens on top of the tortilla, cut it into thin wedges, and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     kirby cucumbers
                        = (or 2 regular cucumbers)
     1/4           cup  kosher salt
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  rice vinegar
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  coriander seed
  1         tablespoon  mustard seed
  1         tablespoon  whole allspice berries
  1                     cinnamon stick
  3                     whole cloves
  1                     bay leaf

Wash and dry the cucumbers.  Using a sharp knife or a mandolin, slice the cucumbers thinly and place in a colander.  Sprinkle with salt and toss to coat.  Place the colander over a bowl and allow it to sit, covered, for about 1 hour.  Rinse off the salt and dry the cucumber slices well.  Place them into a sterilized quart jar.

In a small saucepan add the remaining ingredients.  Stir to dissolve sugar and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and allow it to cool.  Pour the brine over the cucumbers in jar.  Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.  Will keep, refrigerated, for about 2 weeks.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

Tips on Sterilizing Jars

Properly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years.  Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods.

Sterilizing Tips:

Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks.  Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal.  Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed.

To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water.  Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray.  Leave in a preheated 175 degree oven for 25 minutes.  Or, boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.

Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from either boiling water or the oven.  Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.

As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars.  All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean.  This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.

After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food.  It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products.

Tips on Sterilizing Jars
</DirT>
<DirT>
Properly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years.  Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Sterilizing Tips:
</DirT>
<DirT>
Jars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks.  Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal.  Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water.  Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray.  Leave in a preheated 175 degree oven for 25 minutes.  Or, boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Use tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from either boiling water or the oven.  Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
As a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars.  All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean.  This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.
</DirT>
<DirT>
After the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food.  It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  whole almonds
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more as needed
  1           teaspoon  red chili flakes
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  feta cheese -- crumbled
  1                cup  pitted green olives
  1              bunch  fresh basil -- leaves hand-torn
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  5             medium  Japanese eggplant -- chopped
  3             medium  zucchini -- chopped
  3                     tomatoes -- seeded, chopped
  1         tablespoon  capers -- drained
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz) -- drained, and
                        hand crushed
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar

Put the almonds into a large skillet over medium heat.  Gently toast the nuts, being careful not to let them burn, for about 3 minutes.  Add 3 tablespoons olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes, 1 chopped garlic clove, and salt and pepper to taste.  Cook for another 3 minutes and transfer to a plate to cool.  Crush the almonds roughly and put them into a bowl along with the feta cheese, olives, and 1/3 of the basil leaves.  Mix well to combine all the ingredients.

Put 3 tablespoons olive oil and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes into the skillet over medium heat.  Add the onions, remaining garlic, and 1/3 of the basil leaves and cook until the onions start to soften, about 5 minutes.  Put in the eggplant and cook until it is soft, about 10 minutes, adding more olive oil if necessary.  Add the zucchini, fresh tomatoes, and capers; season with salt and pepper.  Continue cooking until these vegetables are soft but still whole.  Add the canned tomatoes, vinegar, and remaining basil leaves.  Continue to cook for another 15 minutes; remove from the heat and set aside to cool.

To serve, put the ratatouille into a bowl or platter and top with the feta, olive, and almond mixture.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MAYONNAISE ===
  4              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1                     lemon -- juiced
  1         tablespoon  water
  1 1/2           cups  canola oil
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === REMOULADE ===
  2               cups  Mayonnaise -- (listed above)
  2        tablespoons  cornichons or sour gherkins -- minced
  3        tablespoons  capers -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley leaves
  1 1/2                 anchovies -- minced
  1         tablespoon  ketchup
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper

First make the Mayonnaise:  In a non-reactive bowl or in a food processor, combine the egg yolks, mustard, lemon juice, and water.  Whisk or pulse with the machine to break up the yolks. If you're making the mayonnaise by hand, put the bowl on a damp towel to keep it from moving around while you work.  Then drizzle in the oils, whisking constantly, to form an emulsion.  If the mayonnaise breaks, stop drizzling and whisk until it comes together again.  If you're using the food processor, pour in the oils in a thin stream, with the machine running.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and more lemon juice.

For the Remoulade:  Chop all the ingredients together and add them to the mayonnaise in the food processor; pulse a few times for them to blend.  Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields approximately 2 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREPES ===
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  cold water
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted, plus
                        more to cook crepes
                        === CHEESE FILLING ===
  1 1/2           cups  ricotta cheese
  4             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  1              large  egg
  3        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  1                     orange -- zest finely grated
                        === STRAWBERRY SAUCE ===
  1              quart  strawberries -- hulled, sliced
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1                     orange -- zest finely grated
                        Melted unsalted butter -- for sauteing
                        blintzes
                        Confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

Make the batter:  Combine the milk, water, eggs, flour, sugar, and salt in a blender.  Blend on medium speed for 15 seconds, until the batter is smooth and lump-free.  Scrape down the sides of the blender and pour in the melted butter.  Blend it again for a few seconds just to incorporate the butter.  Refrigerate the batter for 1 hour to let it rest.

Make the filling:  In a small bowl combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, egg, confectioners' sugar, and zest and blend until smooth.  Chill until ready to use.

Make the sauce:  Combine the strawberries, sugar, water, cornstarch, and zest in a small pot over medium heat.  Bring to a simmer and stir gently until the berries release their natural juices.  The consistency should remain a bit chunky, it will thicken up when it cools down.

Make the crepes:  Put an 8-inch crepe pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat and brush with a little melted butter.  Pour 1/4 cup batter into the pan and swirl it around so it covers the bottom evenly; pour back any excess.  Cook until the crepe batter sets and the bottom is lightly browned, about 2 minutes.  Use a heatproof rubber spatula to loosen the crepe and flip it.  Cook it on the other side for about 1 minute.  Slide them onto a plate and continue making the crepes until all the batter is used.  Cover the stack with a towel to keep them from drying out.  Makes about 10 crepes.

Assembly:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Spoon 1/4 cup of the cheese filling along the lower third of the crepe.  Fold the bottom edge away from you to just cover the filling; then fold the 2 sides in to the center.  Roll the crepe away from you a couple of times ending with the seam side down.  Put an ovenproof skillet over medium heat and brush with melted butter.  Pan-fry the blintzes top-side down until crisp and golden, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Flip them over, transfer the pan to the oven, and bake for 10 minutes so the cheese mixture sets.  Using a spatula, transfer the blintzes to serving plates.  Spoon the strawberry sauce on top, dust with confectioners' sugar, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the crepes:  Put an 8-inch crepe pan or nonstick skillet over medium heat and brush with a little melted butter.  Pour 1/4 cup batter into the pan and swirl it around so it covers the bottom evenly; pour back any excess.  Cook until the crepe batter sets and the bottom is lightly browned, about 2 minutes.  Use a heatproof rubber spatula to loosen the crepe and flip it.  Cook it on the other side for about 1 minute.  Slide them onto a plate and continue making the crepes until all the batter is used.  Cover the stack with a towel to keep them from drying out.  Makes about 10 crepes.

<DirT>
Assembly:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon 1/4 cup of the cheese filling along the lower third of the crepe.  Fold the bottom edge away from you to just cover the filling; then fold the 2 sides in to the center.  Roll the crepe away from you a couple of times ending with the seam side down.  Put an ovenproof skillet over medium heat and brush with melted butter.  Pan-fry the blintzes top-side down until crisp and golden, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Flip them over, transfer the pan to the oven, and bake for 10 minutes so the cheese mixture sets.  Using a spatula, transfer the blintzes to serving plates.  Spoon the strawberry sauce on top, dust with confectioners&apos; sugar, and serve immediately.

                         Roast Chicken Times Two

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     organic free-range chickens - -- (2 to 2 1/2 lbs ea)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     red onion -- quartered
  1                     lemon -- halved
  1               head  garlic -- halved
  2            bunches  fresh thyme
  4                     bay leaves
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
  2             pounds  mixed mushrooms
                        = (such as button, cremini, shiitake, or
                        oyster)

Heat the oven to 400 degrees.

Pat the chickens dry with paper towels.  Season the cavities with salt and pepper.  In a large bowl combine the onion, lemon, garlic, 1 bunch thyme, bay leaves, and 3 tablespoons olive oil; season it with salt and pepper and mix it well.  Stuff each bird with half the mixture.

Using 2 (3-foot) pieces of kitchen twine, tie up each chicken: Tuck the wing tips between the wings and the body.  Put the mid point of the twine under the chicken, bring the ends up and around the wings, and pull them tight against the body.  Bring the ends of the twine up underneath the legs, wrap the string around them, pull the legs together, and tie them tightly.

Place the chickens breast-side up in a roasting pan, drizzle over some olive oil, and season them with salt and pepper.  Toss the mushrooms around the chicken, scatter over the remaining thyme, drizzle over some more olive oil and season everything with salt and pepper.  Roast the chickens for 1 to 1 1/2 hours; baste them with the pan juices every 20 minutes.

The chicken is done when a thermometer reads 165 degrees when inserted into the thickest part of the thigh (the legs should wiggle easily in their sockets.)  Remove the chickens from the pan, cover them with foil, and let them stand for 10 minutes to rest.  Serve 1 chicken with the roasted mushrooms and pan juices.  Refrigerate the other chicken for another meal.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings, plus a chicken for another meal.

                Roasted Rack Of Lamb With Icicle Radishes

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     racks lamb - (abt 15 lbs total)
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Juice and zest of 1 orange
     1/2         bunch  fresh rosemary -- needles stripped
                        from the stem
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2            bunches  icicle radishes -- trimmed, well-washed
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1             bottle  red zinfandel wine
  1                cup  kalamata olives -- pitted
  2            bunches  watercress -- trimmed, well-washed

Ask the butcher to remove the chine bone (back bone) from each rack of lamb, to clean and "french" the ribs, and trim the fat cap on the meat.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

In a small bowl, mix the olive oil with the orange juice, zest, and half of the rosemary to flavor the oil.  Pour the rosemary oil over the lamb and rub it into the meat really well; season with a generous amount of salt and pepper.  Place the racks of lamb side by side in a large roasting pan, with the rib bones facing up; wrap the bones in foil to prevent blackening in the oven.  Toss the radishes with a little oil and put them in the roasting pan next to the lamb.

Roast until the internal temperature of the meat at the thickest point registers 130 degrees for medium-rare doneness, about 40 to 50 minutes.  The radishes should be tender and golden.

Remove the racks of lamb to a carving board to rest, tent them with foil.  Drain the excess fat from the roasting pan and set the pan on two burners over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle the flour into the pan drippings and stir to cook out the starchy taste of the flour.  Gradually pour in the wine, stirring constantly to scrape up the brown bits and avoid lumps.  Toss in the remaining rosemary and simmer for 15 minutes to reduce, season with salt and pepper.  Add the olives and cook another 2 minutes to heat through.

To serve:  Cut the racks of lamb between the ribs into chops.  Arrange 2 lamb chops on each plate with the roasted radishes, the olive-wine sauce, and a small pile of watercress.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALMON ===
  1 1/2         pounds  salmon fillet

                        === COUSCOUS ===
  1 1/2           cups  quick-cooking couscous
  2               cups  boiling water
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     lemon -- juiced

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1               pint  cherry tomatoes -- cut in halves
  1                     cucumber -- sliced thin
  4                     scallions -- sliced thin
     1/2           cup  fresh watercress leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh mint leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill
                        === DRESSING ===
  3        tablespoons  creme fraiche
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     big handful mixed chopped herbs
                        = (such as mint, parsley, chives, or dill)
     1/2           cup  fresh watercress leaves
                        Sea salt -- to taste

Grill the salmon:  Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat.  Coat the salmon with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill about 5 minutes per side, depending on how thick your salmon filet is.  Remove and let cool.

Make the couscous:  Put the couscous into a bowl and pour over 2 cups boiling water.  Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, juice of 1/2 lemon, and salt and pepper to taste.  Stir gently, cover, and let sit until the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.  Fluff with a fork, making sure to separate all the grains.  Add the tomatoes, cucumbers, scallions, watercress, herbs, remaining olive oil, and remaining lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.  Gently toss the couscous to combine all the ingredients.

Make the dressing:  Combine all the ingredients in a blender and process until smooth, green, and creamy.  If necessary, thin the dressing with a tablespoon or two of warm water.  Taste and adjust seasoning.

Assemble the salad:  Put a large piece of lavash bread onto a plate and pile on some of the couscous.  Break the salmon apart by hand and place a big chunk on top of the couscous.  Drizzle over some of the dressing and roll up the wrap.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                          Salt And Pepper Shrimp

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  extra-large shrimp -- shells on
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
  2              large  eggs
  1                cup  chilled club soda
  3               cups  cornstarch
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     serrano chilies -- sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 1") -- peeled, chopped fine
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro -- plus
                        more for garnish
  1         tablespoon  low-sodium soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sake

With kitchen shears, cut through the shell of the shrimp down the back to the tail.  Remove the vein and rinse them well.  Butterfly the shrimp by cutting almost all the way through the shrimp with a knife.  Pat dry and set aside.

Heat 2 inches of peanut oil in a wok or deep skillet to 375 degrees.

While the oil is heating, whisk the eggs and club soda together in a large bowl.  Whisk in 2 cups cornstarch making sure to get out any lumps.  The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream.  Season generously with salt and pepper ó remember it is called Salt and Pepper Shrimp!

Put the remaining cornstarch on a platter and season it well with salt and pepper.  Working in batches, dredge the shrimp in the cornstarch and shake off any excess.  Dip the shrimp in the batter and let the excess batter drip off.  Slide the shrimp into the hot oil and cook about 3 minutes until golden brown, turning them once during cooking.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Scoop out any floating bits of batter from the oil, they will burn.  Season the shrimp with salt and pepper while they're still hot and put them onto a serving platter.

When all the shrimp have been cooked, carefully pour out all but 2 tablespoons oil into a safe container.  Add the chilies, garlic, and ginger and stir-fry for about 1 minute.  Take the wok off the heat and pour in the soy sauce and sake.  Cook for 1 minute, then pour this mixture over the fried shrimp.  Garnish with cilantro.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                        Juice of 3 oranges
                        Juice of 3 lemons
                        Juice of 3 limes
                        Zest of 1 orange -- finely grated
                        Zest of 1 lemon -- finely grated
                        Zest of 1 lime -- finely grated
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  ripe cantaloupe -- halved, seeded,
                        peeled, and cut into small cubes
     1/2         bunch  fresh mint -- hand-torn, plus
                        more for garnish
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     fresh red chili -- cut into paper-thin
                        circles

Start by assessing the scallops at the fish store.  I usually inspect every one just to make sure that they're all in perfect shape, i.e. not torn, and fresh with a sweet ocean smell.  The next step is to remove the side mussel that connects the scallop to its shell; it's not hard to miss; just pull it off with your fingers.  Keep the shells to serve the ceviche in.  Using a sharp knife, slice the scallops in half lengthwise into discs; the thinner they are, the faster they'll "cook".  Put the scallops in a glass bowl and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper.

Put the citrus juices, zest, and sugar in a blender and give it a whirl to combine.  Add the olive oil and blend again to emulsify.  Pour the marinade over the scallops; there should be enough juice to allow the scallops to float freely.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours, until the scallops are opaque, i.e. cooked from the acid in the fruit.

In a separate bowl, combine the cantaloupe, mint, and chili; season with salt and pepper and toss gently to combine.

To serve:  Spoon the scallop ceviche into the shells with a little bit of the citrus juice, and top with a spoonful of the cantaloupe salad.  Garnish each serving with some fresh mint.

This recipe yields 12 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        recipe  Pasta Dough For Ravioli II -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  medium-size raw shrimp -- cleaned, shelled
  1              bunch  fresh basil leaves -- plus
                        more for garnish
  1              bunch  fresh chervil -- plus
                        more for garnish
  1              bunch  fresh chives -- plus

  1              large  egg white -- plus
  1                     egg -- for wash
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1               pint  grape tomatoes
  2                     shallots -- finely chopped
     1/2         bunch  fresh chervil -- plus
                        more for garnish
                        Flour -- for dusting

Make the Pasta Dough for Ravioli and set aside to rest.

Make the filling:  In the bowl of a food processor add the shrimp, 1/2 bunch basil leaves, 1/2 bunch chives, 1/2 bunch chervil, egg white, and 2 tablespoons olive oil; season this with salt and pepper.  Pulse until it is finely chopped but not pureed.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Roll out the dough:  Cut the ball of dough in half, cover and reserve the piece you are not using to prevent it from drying out.  Dust the counter and dough with a little flour.  Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine set at the widest setting 2 or 3 times.  Guide the dough with your hand as it emerges from the rollers to prevent it from puncturing or stretching.  Dust the sheets with extra flour whenever the dough gets sticky.  Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again 2 or 3 times.  Continue reducing the setting and rolling until the machine is at its narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick for ravioli.  Roll out the other half.

Form the ravioli:  Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash.  Dust the counter with flour, lay out 1 long sheet of pasta, and brush the top surface with the egg wash.  Drop the filling by the tablespoonful about 2-inches apart onto 1/2 of the pasta sheet.  Fold the other 1/2 over the filling like a blanket.  Gently press out the air pockets around each mound of filling.  Use a sharp knife to cut the sides around each mound and press the edges with your fingers to make a tight seal.  Dust a sheet pan with flour to prevent the ravioli from sticking and lay them out to dry slightly while assembling the rest.

Make the sauce:  Heat the broiler.  Put the tomatoes onto a baking sheet, drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.  Broil until the tomatoes burst, about 10 minutes.  In a large skillet over medium-high heat add the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil.  Put in the shallots and cook them until they are soft, about 5 minutes.  Chop the remaining basil, chives, and chervil and add them to the pan.  Fold the tomatoes into the pan and cook for another 5 minutes; keep warm while you cook the ravioli.

Cook and sauce the ravioli:  Place the pasta into a large pot of boiling salted water and cook for about 4 minutes, they'll float to the top when ready; do not overcrowd the pot.  Lift them from the water with a large strainer or slotted spoon into the tomato sauce.  Gently coat the ravioli with the sauce and serve garnished with more chopped herbs.

This recipe yields 24 ravioli.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        === TEMPURA ===
  1              pound  large shrimp -- peeled with tails on
  1                cup  rice flour -- plus
  1                cup  rice flour -- for dusting
  1                cup  cold seltzer water
  2              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame oil
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
  2                     red bell peppers -- sliced into strips
  2                     avocados -- peeled, sliced thick
  1                     lemon -- sliced very thin
  12                    green beans
  8                     shiitake mushrooms -- halved
  4                     scallions

Make the Dipping Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in a bowl.  Set aside to allow the flavors to develop.

Prepare the shrimp:  Butterfly the shrimp by cutting down the back, being careful not to cut all the way through.  Open the shrimp like a book and rinse well with cold water.

Make the Tempura Batter:  Put the flour in a bowl and whisk in the seltzer to get out all the lumps.  Add the egg yolks and blend it in well.  Flavor with sesame oil and a pinch of salt.  The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream.

Time to fry:  Heat about 2 inches of peanut oil to 375 degrees in a wok or deep skillet.  Dry the shrimp and vegetables well.  Dust them with flour to soak up any remaining moisture and shake off the excess.  Dip them into the batter one by one.  Drop 4 or 5 pieces at a time in the hot oil, do not overcrowd the pan.  Fry until golden brown, turning once, about 3 minutes.  To keep the oil clean between batches, skim off the small bits of batter that float in the oil.  Remove the fried shrimp and vegetables from the oil and drain on paper towels; season them with salt.  Serve with the dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Make the Dipping Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in a bowl.  Set aside to allow the flavors to develop.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare the shrimp:  Butterfly the shrimp by cutting down the back, being careful not to cut all the way through.  Open the shrimp like a book and rinse well with cold water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make the Tempura Batter:  Put the flour in a bowl and whisk in the seltzer to get out all the lumps.  Add the egg yolks and blend it in well.  Flavor with sesame oil and a pinch of salt.  The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Time to fry:  Heat about 2 inches of peanut oil to 375 degrees in a wok or deep skillet.  Dry the shrimp and vegetables well.  Dust them with flour to soak up any remaining moisture and shake off the excess.  Dip them into the batter one by one.  Drop 4 or 5 pieces at a time in the hot oil, do not overcrowd the pan.  Fry until golden brown, turning once, about 3 minutes.  To keep the oil clean between batches, skim off the small bits of batter that float in the oil.  Remove the fried shrimp and vegetables from the oil and drain on paper towels; season them with salt.  Serve with the dipping sauce.

Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     lemon -- halved
  1               head  garlic -- halved
  3                     bay leaves
  8                     peppercorns
                        Sea salt -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  large shrimp -- peeled
  2               cups  coconut milk
     1/2           cup  lime juice - (abt 6 to 8 limes) -- plus
                        more for drizzling
  1                     red onion -- sliced thin
  2                     serrano chiles -- sliced thin
     1/2         bunch  freshly-chopped cilantro leaves -- plus
                        more for garnish
  4                     coconuts
  2               cups  rock or kosher salt -- for serving
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling

Make the ceviche:  Put a large pot of water over high heat and add the lemon, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns and salt, to taste.  When it comes to a boil add the shrimp and turn off the heat.  Let the shrimp poach just until they are cooked through, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove the shrimp to a sheet pan and refrigerate.  When they are cool slice them in half lengthwise.

Combine the coconut milk, lime juice, onion, chiles, and cilantro in a large bowl and season it with salt.  Add the cooled shrimp and let them marinate, refrigerated, for about 1/2 hour.

Prepare the coconut shells:  Take a hammer and hit the coconut repeatedly (not too hard) around its equator, turning the coconut in your hand.  It will eventually split into 2 halves.  Drain the liquid from the coconuts.

To serve:  Pour the salt onto a large platter and nestle the coconut halves into the salt so they stand upright.  Divide the ceviche among the coconut halves; garnish with drizzles of lime juice, olive oil and cilantro.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1                cup  milk
  4                     thick slices firm white bread -- crust removed,
                        and cut into cubes - (abt 2 cups)
  2             pounds  ground beef
  2             pounds  ground pork
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan -- plus
                        more for serving
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  mozzarella cheese -- cut 10 (1") cubes
  2               cups  heated Sugo Sauce -- (listed below)
  1              pound  dried spaghetti
  8                     fresh basil leaves
                        === SUGO SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/2         bunch  fresh basil leaves -- hand torn
  1                cup  pitted Alfonso olives
  2        tablespoons  capers -- drained
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz) -- drained, and
                        hand crushed, liquid reserved
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat; cook the onions, garlic, and parsley until softened, about 10 minutes.  Scrape out onto a plate and allow the mixture to cool; set the pan aside.

Pour the milk over the bread into a medium bowl and let it soak while the onions are cooling.  Combine the meats in a large bowl and add the egg and Parmesan.  Season with salt and pepper.  Squeeze the excess milk from the bread and add the bread to the bowl along with the cooled onion mixture.  Using your hands, gently combine all the ingredients until they are thoroughly mixed.  Don't overmix or the meatballs will be tough.  Divide this mixture into 10 pieces and form them into patties.  Place a mozzarella cube onto each patty and bring up the sides around the cheese to form a ball completely enclosing the cube.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat the remaining oil in the skillet over medium heat and brown the meatballs on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Put them into the oven and bake until the meatballs are cooked through, about 15 minutes.

Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Drain the pasta and put it onto a large serving platter.  Pour on half the Sugo Sauce and mix well.  Place the meatballs over the spaghetti and garnish with the basil leaves.  Serve immediately along with the extra sauce and Parmesan.

For the Sugo Sauce:  Pour the olive oil into a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion, garlic, and half the basil and cook until soft, about 10 minutes.  Add the olives, capers, and remaining basil.  Carefully add the tomatoes (nothing splashes like tomatoes) and about 1/2 cup of the reserved liquid; cook until the sauce is thick, about 15 minutes.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Heat the broiler.  Put the cherry tomatoes onto baking sheets, drizzle over some olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.  Broil until the tomatoes burst, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove from oven and allow them to cool a bit.

In a large bowl add about 1/4 cup olive oil, juice of 2 limes, onion, chili, chopped cilantro, cheese, and the tomatoes.  Mix carefully to avoid breaking up the tomatoes too much.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper; set aside.

Heat the grill or a grill pan to medium.  Rub the meat with some olive oil and season it generously with salt and pepper.  Grill the tenderloin, browning it on all sides, until it is medium-rare, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove the meat to a cutting board, cover it with aluminum foil, and allow it to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.

Slice the meat thin, place it on a platter, and spoon on the cheesy tomato dressing.  Garnish with a drizzle of olive oil and cilantro leaves.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings, a big platter full!

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SALSA ===

                        and cut into chunks
  1                     red onion -- chopped
  6                     red radishes -- chopped, plus
  1                     red radish -- sliced for garnish
  2                     limes -- peeled, and
                        cut into segments
  1                     handful fresh cilantro leaves
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  Southwest Spice Mix -- (see recipe)
                        === SALMON ===
  1                     salmon fillet - (2 to 3 lbs)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed

  2        tablespoons  Southwest Spice Mix -- (see recipe)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried chickpeas
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more for drizzling
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              small  red chile -- chopped
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2                     fresh bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  sweet paprika
  1           teaspoon  whole cumin seed
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (28 oz)
  1                cup  water
  2                     red bell peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        and chopped
  1              pound  calamari -- cleaned, and
                        cut into rings

Quick soak the chickpeas by putting them into a large heavy-bottomed pot and covering them with water by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil and boil for 2 minutes; remove from heat, cover, and let soak for 1 hour.  Drain the chickpeas and return them to the pot.  Cover them with fresh water by about 2 inches, add 1 tablespoon salt, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer the beans until they are tender, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  Drain and set aside.

Clean out the pot and put it back on the stove over medium-high heat.  Heat the olive oil and cook the onion, garlic, chili, thyme, and bay leaves until the onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes.  Add the paprika and cumin and cook for 1 minute.  Hand-crush the tomatoes and add them with their juice to the pot along with 1 cup of water.  Add the chickpeas, roasted peppers, and calamari and season with salt and pepper.  Turn the heat down and simmer until all the flavors have blended and the calamari is tender, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Serve in small dishes with a drizzle of olive oil.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHORT RIBS ===
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3             pounds  short ribs
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  3                     carrots -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  sweet paprika
  1           teaspoon  caraway seeds
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme
     1/2           cup  honey
  1                cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  beef stock
                        === SCALLOPS ===
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1                     orange -- zest finely grated
  1              pinch  saffron -- (optional)
  1              pound  diver scallops
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Fresh watercress -- for garnish

For the short ribs:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large casserole heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Season the meat with salt and pepper and brown on all sides.  Remove the short ribs and set aside.  Add the onion, carrot, paprika, caraway, and thyme to the pan and cook until softened, about 10 minutes.  Pour in the honey, red wine, and stock and bring it to a boil.  Return the meat to the pan; the liquid should just about cover the meat.

Place the pot in the oven and put on the lid loosely to allow the steam to escape and the sauce to thicken.  Cook until the meat is very tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  Place the meat on a platter and keep it warm.  If necessary, cook the liquid over high heat until it is thick and syrupy.  Remove from the heat and return the meat to the pan while you make the scallops.

For the scallops:  In a saucepan over high heat, add the chicken broth, cream, orange zest, and saffron, if using.  Cook until the liquid is reduced and thick, about 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, pat the scallops dry with paper towels.  Season them well with salt and pepper.

Put a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 3 tablespoons olive oil.  Sear the scallops without moving them for 1 to 2 minutes.  When nicely browned, turn them over and sear them on the other side.  Remove the scallops and set aside.  Pour out any excess oil and add the cream mixture to the pan.  Let this reduce over high heat for about 2 minutes.  Return the scallops to the pan and cook until they are heated through, about 1 more minute.

Serve the sticky short ribs topped with the creamy scallops; garnish with watercress.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  2             pounds  sweet potatoes -- for 1 1/2 cups puree
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  1              pinch  salt
  3                     eggs
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        === PASTRY ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
                        more for dusting
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cold, and
                        cut into small chunks
  2        tablespoons  ice water -- plus
                        more if needed
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  pecans
  1            package  frozen cranberries - (8 oz)
  1            package  amaretto cookies - (2.3 oz, abt 12)
                        = (such as Amaretti di Saronno)

Heat the oven to 375 degrees.

Prick the sweet potatoes with a fork and bake them until they are soft, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and set aside until they are cool enough to handle.

While the potatoes are cooking make the pastry: combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl.  Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Pour in the ice water and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky.  Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time.  Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes.

Sprinkle the counter and a rolling pin lightly with flour.  Roll the dough out into a 10-inch circle.  Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin and lay it inside a 9-inch pie pan.  Press the dough firmly into the bottom and sides so it fits tightly.  Trim the excess dough around the rim and pinch the edges to form a border.  Place a piece of parchment paper over the crust and fill with uncooked beans or pie weights.  Bake the pie crust until it sets, about 20 minutes.  Remove the parchment and beans.  Brush the bottom with the beaten egg white and set aside.

While the crust is cooking make the filling: When cool enough to handle, peel the sweet potatoes and puree the pulp in a food processor with 1/2 stick butter and a pinch of salt.  Measure 1 1/2 cups puree into a bowl.  In another bowl beat the eggs and sugar until the sugar has melted.  Add the eggs to the sweet potato puree and whisk well.  Add the cream, orange zest, cinnamon, and nutmeg and stir well to combine.  Pour the mixture into the pie shell.  Place the pie pan on a sturdy cookie sheet to catch any spills.  Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees and bake until the pie is set but still jiggles slightly, about 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow it to cool.

Meanwhile, put the pecans on a baking sheet and bake them with the pie for about 10 minutes to toast them.  Remove them from the oven and let them cool.  Thaw the cranberries in a strainer set over a bowl to catch the liquid.  Put the cookies, pecans, and cranberries into a food processor and pulse them a few times until they are coarsely chopped.  Sprinkle the topping evenly over the cooled pie and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                        = (Burgundy recommended)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying, plus
                        more to drizzle
  3        tablespoons  butter

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Bouquet Garni

     1/2         pound  garden peas
  1              pound  white mushrooms -- cut in half

                        Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley -- as garnish
                        Finely-chopped chives -- as garnish
                        === GARLIC PUREE ===
  2              heads  garlic -- halved horizontally
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              sprig  thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

                        Olive oil -- for frying
  6             slices  bread

To make the marinade, place the beef in a large glass or plastic container.  Add 8 sprigs of thyme, carrots, garlic, red onions, orange peel, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves, and the wine.  Mix well to coat, then cover and refrigerate for 4 hours.

Remove beef from the marinade and blot dry on paper towels.  Heat the oil and butter and the remaining 4 sprigs thyme in a heavy-bottomed saucepan on a high heat.  When the oil begins to smoke, remove the thyme.  Add the beef and brown evenly on all sides.  Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Strain the marinade into the beef and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up the flavorful bits in the bottom of the pot.  Add bouquet garni and beef stock.  Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the liquid starts to thicken, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Cover and cook on low heat for 2 hours.

After about 2 hours add the baby carrots, garden peas, and mushrooms, along with a pinch of sugar to balance out the acid from the red wine.  Turn the heat up slightly and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes more, until the vegetables and meat are tender.  Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with chopped parsley and chives.  Squeeze some of the roasted garlic onto the croutons, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and serve with the stew.

Garlic Puree:  Put garlic on a sheet of aluminum foil.  Drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Add a sprig of thyme and fold the foil around the garlic.  Cook for 30 to 40 minutes or until garlic is tender and golden brown.

Croutons:  Heat about 1/4-inch of the olive oil in a frying pan.  When the oil is hot, add the bread in batches and fry until golden on both sides, about 1 minute per side.  Remove from pan and dry on paper towels.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving suggestion:  Buttery mashed potatoes with chives and warm croutons with garlic puree

                          The Ultimate Omelette

Recipe By     :Tyler Florence
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes
                Omelets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              stick  butter
  18                    eggs - (3 per person)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  crushed white peppercorns
  1              bunch  chives -- finely chopped
  1              bunch  chervil -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  sea salt
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        Roasted mushrooms -- as accompaniment
                        Watercress -- as accompaniment
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
  1                     non-stick 9" saute pan
                        Heat resistant spatula
  1                     four-ounce ladle

Cook's note:  The individual omelettes (3 eggs) need to be cooked individually.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

To clarify the butter, put it in a small pot over low heat and slowly bring to a simmer.  Cook over low heat until the butter separates.  When the milk solids fall to the bottom and the golden butter-fat rises to the surface remove from heat.  Set aside

Cook's note:  I like to clarify the butter because whole butter has milk solids that will burn.  This gives your omelette dark spots.

Crack the eggs into a medium mixing bowl and pour in cream.  Add pepper and whisk until well incorporated and foamy.

Preheat the pan over medium heat.  When the pan is heated, add 2 or 3 tablespoons of clarified butter.  Turn the heat down slightly.  Using a 4-ounce ladle, add 1 ladle of eggs into the pan.  Using a spatula, start stirring quickly.

Cook's note:  This is to heat the eggs through so they set like a custard.  Keep swirling them around so the eggs aren't in 1 spot long enough to burn.

Once the eggs begin to set, stop stirring.  Put the pan in the oven and cook for 1 1/2 minutes.  When you remove the omelette from the oven it should still have a soft custard touch.  Sprinkle with chopped herbs, a pinch of sea salt and cracked white pepper.

Cook's note:  Using an oven glove to hold the handle, tip the pan sideways and roll the omelette onto a plate with a spatula.

Serve with roasted mushrooms and watercress.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FISH STOCK ===
  1              whole  red snapper - (2 to 3 lbs) -- scaled, gutted
  1             medium  onion -- quartered
  4                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1                     serrano chili -- halved
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2                     bay leaves
  8              whole  black peppercorns
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        === SOUP ===
  8                     corn tortillas -- cut 1/2" strips
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     lime -- juiced, plus
                        Lime wedges -- for garnish
  1             medium  onion -- sliced, for garnish
  4                     ripe tomatoes -- cut into chunks for
                        garnish
  2                     ripe avocados -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks for garnish
                        Cilantro leaves -- for garnish

For the stock:  Remove the fillets from the fish (or have your fishmonger do it), wrap them, and set them aside in the refrigerator.  Rinse the carcass well with water, chop it into 3 pieces, and place it in a stock pot.  Add the onion, garlic, serrano, thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns.  Add cold water to cover the ingredients by 1-inch and put the pot over medium-high heat.  Bring it to a boil, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.  Strain and discard the solids, season it with salt.  Makes about 6 to 7 cups stock.

For the tortillas:  Heat about 1/2-inch vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Cut the tortillas into 1/2-inch wide strips.  Fry the tortilla strips in batches and drain them on paper towels; season with salt and pepper while they are still hot.

For the fish:  Drizzle the fish filets with olive oil and lime juice and season with some salt.  Cover the fish and put it back in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 15 minutes but no longer than 1 hour.

For the soup:  Heat the stock to simmering.  Slice the marinated fish into thin strips.  Place 3 pieces of fish into the bottom of a large soup bowl.  Top with some onion, tomato, avocado, and cilantro leaves.  Ladle in the hot stock and squeeze in a lime wedge.  Top with tortilla strips and serve.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  turkey wings
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- halved
  4                     carrots -- chopped
  1               head  garlic -- smashed
     1/2         bunch  fresh sage
     1/2         bunch  fresh thyme
  8                     black peppercorns
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the oven to 400 degrees.

Put the turkey wings* into a small roasting pan and roast them until they are golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large stock pot over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, carrots, garlic, herbs, and peppercorns and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the turkey wings.  Pour some water into the roasting pan and scrape up all the browned bits on the bottom; add this to the pot.

Cover everything in the pot with cold water by 1-inch and bring to the boil, skimming any foam that rises to the surface.  Reduce the heat and simmer for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Strain out the solids and discard.

Wipe out the pot and put it over medium heat.  Melt the butter with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and add the flour.  Cook this roux, stirring frequently, until it is golden brown.  Slowly whisk in the strained stock being careful to work out any lumps.  Cook until the gravy has thickened, about 10 to 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 5 to 6 cups.

*Cook's note:  Also add the backbone and neck from the turkey you are grilling.
