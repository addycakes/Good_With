                   Apple Tortelli - {Tortelli Di Mele}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  tart apples
  1                cup  fresh sheepís milk ricotta
  1                     egg
  4                     amaretti cookies -- crushed
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus more
                        for grating over pasta
  1              pinch  salt -- plus more to taste
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
  12       tablespoons  butter
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Core the apples, maintaining the peel, and place on a sheet pan.  Roast in the oven 20 minutes, until soft and juicy.  Remove and allow to cool.  Squeeze flesh from peel and discard peel.

In a large bowl, combine the apple flesh with the ricotta, egg, amaretti, 1/4 cup cheese and salt and mix well to combine.

Roll out the pasta to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine, then cut into 2-inch squares.  In center of half of the squares, place a scant tablespoon full of the apple and cheese mixture.  Moisten the edges of these squares with water, then top each square with an un-filled square, and press with your fingers to seal the edges.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12-to 14-inch sautÈ pan, heat the butter until it foams and subsides.

Meanwhile, drop the pasta in the boiling water and cook 3 minutes.  Drain the pasta, reserving the cooking liquid, and add the pasta to the pan with the butter.  Add a splash of the pasta water if necessary to keep the sauce from becoming too "tight."  Toss over high heat 1 minute to coat.

Divide pasta evenly among 6 warmed pasta bowls, top with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CAKE ===
  1           envelope  active dry yeast
     1/8           cup  cake flour -- plus
  5               cups  cake flour
     1/4           cup  warm water
     3/4         stick  sweet butter -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sweet butter -- to grease the pan
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  5              large  eggs -- plus
  2                     egg yolks
                        === FOR THE RUM SYRUP ===
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  dark rum

Preheat the oven to 385 degrees.  Butter, then flour, a 12-cup muffin pan, and set aside.

In a small mixing bowl, stir together the yeast and warm water until the yeast dissolves.  Add 1/8 cup flour, stirring until a paste is formed.  Set aside for 10 minutes.

In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer for about 5 to 6 minutes, until a light ribbon is formed.  Remove the beaters and clean all of the butter mixture into the bowl.

Place a dough hook attachment on the mixer and add the yeast mixture, the remaining flour, the salt, the eggs and yolks and mix well, about 8 to 9 minutes, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.

Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and divide it into 12 equal portions.  Place each portion into a cup of the prepared muffin pan, cover with a towel and allow to stand for one hour, to rise by double.

Place the cakes in the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until cooked through or when a toothpick entered at the center exits clean.  Remove and allow to cool on a cake rack for 20 minutes.  Remove the cakes from the pan and place them on a sheet tray.

In a small saucepan, heat the water and sugar to boiling and stir to dissolve the sugar.  Lower heat to a very high simmer and cook 15 minutes to form a simple syrup.  Remove from heat, add rum, stir to mix and allow to cool 5 minutes.

Poke the tops of the cakes with a popsicle stick to form 8 to 10 slender holes.  Spoon the rum syrup over the cakes and into the holes, and repeat twice with the syrup that drains out of the bottom.  Serve with unsweetened whipped cream.

This recipe yields 12 individual cakes.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              piece  dried salt cod -- soaked for 48 hours,
                        changing the water 3 to 4 times
  1              bunch  thyme, leaves only
  1              bunch  parsley, leaves only
  1              bunch  marjoram, leaves only
  1              bunch  oregano, leaves only
     1/2           cup  Oven Roasted Tomatoes -- (see recipe),
                        cut into chunks
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus more
                        for drizzling
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  real balsamic vinegar

Once the cod has soaked for the requisite time, remove from the water and pat dry.  With a very sharp fillet knife, slice the cod into very thin slices and set aside.

In a small, non-reactive bowl, combine the herbs and oven-roasted tomatoes and toss with the lemon juice, olive oil and salt and pepper, to taste.

Divide the baccala evenly among 4 chilled dinner plates.  Top each serving with a mound of the salad, drizzle with best-quality extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter -- plus
  6        tablespoons  butter
     1/2         pound  ground pork
     1/4         pound  ground veal
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus more for
                        garnishing pasta
  1         tablespoon  flour
  1                cup  milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  Bechamel Sauce - {Besciamella} -- (see recipe)

In a large skillet, heat the butter over high heat until it foams and subsides.  Add the ground pork and veal and cook over high heat until it begins to brown in its own fat.  Drain the excess fat and add the Parmigiano, the flour and the milk and reduce heat to a simmer.  Cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly, then remove from heat and allow to cool.  Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg and stir in the egg.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Roll the pasta out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine and cut it into rectangles measuring 4 inches by 6 inches.  Divide the meat filling evenly among the rectangles and roll the pasta around the filling, jelly-roll style making 14 to 16 canneloni.  Blanch until tender in boiling water.  Remove and put in an ice water bath.

In an 8- or 9-inch square, oven-proof casserole, spoon half the tomato sauce across the bottom in an even layer.  Carefully lay each pasta package in the casserole so that they are in a single layer.  Top with the remaining tomato sauce, then the bÈchamel.  Finish with the freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and bake in the oven 20 to 25 minutes, until the sauces and cheese are bubbling and the edges of the pasta are crispy and browned.

Serve immediately from the cooking dish.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  dry white beans, such as Cannellini
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
     1/2         sprig  fresh rosemary, leaves only -- finely chopped
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  fresh ricotta
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
  8        tablespoons  butter
  1              bunch  thyme, leaves only
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- for grating

Soak the beans overnight in plenty of cold water to cover.  Drain the beans and cover with plenty of fresh water.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Cook the beans over medium-high heat for 1 1/2 hours, until beans are easily mashed with a fork.  Drain the beans, add the garlic, rosemary, olive oil, ricotta and salt and pepper to taste, and mash the bean and cheese mixture with a fork or in the bowl of a food processor.  Mixture should be pliable but not completely homogenous.  Set aside.

Divide the Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough into 3 balls of equal size, and roll each out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut each sheet into 4-inch squares.  Place a tablespoon of the bean mixture in the center of each square.  Fold each square in half, corner to corner, to form a triangle, then fold the other corners around to meet each other and form the tortelloni.  Place the tortelloni on a sheet tray dusted with flour until ready to cook.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 14- to 16-inch saute pan, heat the butter over medium-high heat until it foams and subsides.

Meanwhile, drop the tortelloni in the boiling water and cook 2 minutes.  Drain the pasta, reserving the cooking liquid, and add to the pan with the butter.  Add the thyme leaves and a splash of the pasta cooking water and toss over high heat 1 minute to coat and emulsify.

Divide the pasta evenly among 4 warmed pasta bowls, grate the cheese over each serving and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a mixing bowl, stir together the bread crumbs, 2 cups of the cheese, eggs, butter and nutmeg until a ball is formed.  Feed the ball into a meat grinder set over barely boiling chicken stock and grind &quot;noodles&quot; into the broth.  They will set as they hit the stock.  When all the noodles are in the broth, lower the heat to simmer and cook 5 to 6 minutes.  Serve in deep bowls with plenty of grated cheese.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PASTA ===
  1                cup  water
  2               cups  dried bread crumbs
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
  2                     eggs
  10       tablespoons  water
                        === FOR THE BEANS ===
  2               cups  dried borlotti -- soaked overnight in
                        cold water
  8                     fresh sage leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary  - (3" ea)
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             ounces  pancetta -- minced
  2             medium  onions -- minced
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh basil leaves
  2        tablespoons  best-quality tomato paste
  2               cans  peeled tomatoes - (16 oz ea) -- and their juices
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for grating

For the dough:  Bring 1 cup of water to a boil.  Pour the bread crumbs into a bowl and add the boiling water.  Let stand 10 minutes.

Mound the flour on a work surface.  Using a wooden spoon, make a well in the mound that looks like a volcano crater.  Add the eggs, 10 tablespoons water, and soaked bread crumbs to the well.  Blend them together with a wooden spoon.  Then gradually stir in the flour by making shallow scrapings along the walls of the well and incorporating the flour into the liquids.  Use a pastry scraper to catch any liquids that might escape from the flour crater.  Once the mixture has become a rough dough, knead it by hand 10 minutes, or until elastic.  It should be quite stiff and not very sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it stand at room temperature 30 minutes.

To shape the pisarei:  These little pasta curls are shaped by taking a pea-sized piece of dough, pressing it with the tip of the thumb, then pulling the thumb back and up in a quick motion.  The dough thins and curls, forming a C-shape in profile.  After youíve made several pieces, a rhythm will develop and shaping the pisarei will become automatic.  Have handy several large flat baskets lined with kitchen towels for drying the pasta.

Take 1/4 of the dough (keep the rest wrapped in plastic wrap) and divide it into 10 pieces.  Roll out each piece with the flat of your palm to form a long cord 1/4- to 1/2-inch in diameter.  Keep the cords covered with plastic wrap.  Take out 1 cord and cut it into pea-sized pieces.  Use the tip of you thumb to curl each piece into the work surface and then pull back and up.  It is a flicking motion. Spread the pieces on the baskets without letting them touch.

Cooking the beans:  Place the beans in a large pot and add enough cold water to cover by about 3 inches.  Add sage leaves and rosemary.  Cover and bring to a very slow bubble over medium heat.  Adjust the heat so that the water bubbles slowly.  Cook, covered, 1 hour, or until the beans are just tender enough to eat but not at all mushy.  Drain the beans in a colander, and return them to the pot.

Making the tomato sauce:  While the beans are cooking, heat the olive oil and pancetta fat in a heavy 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and parsley.  Saute the onions to a rich golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Add the garlic, basil and tomato paste, and cook about 30 seconds.  Add the tomatoes and their liquid, breaking them up as they go into the pan.  Bring to a lively bubble and cook, uncovered, 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Finishing the beans:  Place the beans in a large pot with the tomato sauce and the 1 cup water, and bring the bean/tomato mixture to a gentle bubble.  The mixture should bubble very slowly.  Partially cover and cook 1/2 hour, until the beans are very tender (but not falling apart), and have the consistency of a thick soup.  Stir frequently to check for sticking.  Add more water if the mixture threatens to burn.

Cooking the pasta and serving:  Place 6 quarts water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop in the pisarei and boil 5 to 6 minutes, until they float and are light.  Drain in a colander.  Pour the beans into the heated serving bowl and fold the two together, taking care not to break up the pasta.  Sprinkle with a few spoonfuls of the cheese, and serve.  Pass the rest of the Parmigiano-Reggiano separately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Bones, wings, and scraps of 3 chickens -- excess fat removed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     carrots -- coarsely chopped
  2                     onions -- coarsely chopped
  4                     celery ribs -- coarsely chopped
  1        tablespoons  black peppercorns
  1              bunch  parsley stems
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste

In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil until smoking.  Add the chicken bones and scraps and brown all over, stirring to avoid burning.  Remove the chicken parts and reserve.

Add the carrots, onions and celery and cook until soft and browned.  Return the chicken bones to the pot and add 3 quarts of water, the tomato paste, peppercorns, and parsley, stirring to dislodge the browned chicken and vegetables bits from the bottom of the pan.

Bring almost to a boil, reduce to a simmer and allow to cook at a low simmer for 2 hours, until reduced by half, occasionally skimming excess fat.

After cooking, remove from heat and strain out all solids, pressing them with the bottom of a ladle to extract out all liquids.  Stir the stock to facilitate cooling and set aside.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 quarts.

  8                     sage leaves

Soak the chestnuts in salted water for 12 hours or overnight.  Drain the chestnuts, peel them, and place in a heavy-bottomed saucepan with the milk and cream.  Add enough water so that the chestnuts are completely covered and cook over medium-high heat, taking care not to scorch the milk, until the chestnuts are easily mashed with a fork, about 30 to 45 minutes.

Drain the chestnuts, reserving the cooking liquid, mash and allow to cool.  Once cool, place in a bowl and add the cheese, eggs, nutmeg and black pepper.  If necessary, add some of the cooking liquid to bring the mixture to the proper consistency.  It should hold its shape when a tablespoon-sized ball is removed from the batch, but should not be so stiff that you risk tearing the delicate pasta that will envelop it.

Divide the prepared pasta dough into 3 equal-sized balls and roll each ball out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut each sheet of pasta into 4-inch squares.  Place a tablespoon of the chestnut filling in the center of each square and fold the squares, corner to corner, then join the remaining corners to form the tortelli.  Set the tortelli on a sheet tray dusted with flour, and cover with clean, damp kitchen towels.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop the tortelli into the boiling water and cook 2 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a 14- to 16-inch saute pan, heat the butter until it foams and subsides.  Add the sage and allow to rest.  Drain the pasta, reserving the cooking liquid, and add to the saute pan with the butter.  Add a few splashes of the pasta cooking water and toss over high heat 2 minutes to coat and emulsify the sauce.  Divide the pasta evenly among 4 warmed pasta bowls, top with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     roaster chicken - (abt 5 to 6 lbs)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary -- leaves removed,
                        and minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed
  2              large  yellow onions -- coarsely chopped
  1              pound  portobello mushrooms -- cut 1" cubes
  4             ounces  pancetta -- finely diced
  1                cup  white wine
  16            ounces  tomato puree
  1                cup  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1              pinch  sugar
  1              pinch  red chili flakes

Cut chicken into 8 pieces.  Combine the garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper and enough olive oil to make a somewhat dry paste.  Divide the paste evenly among the 8 pieces and let sit, covered and refrigerated, for 2 hours.

In a Dutch oven, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over high heat until smoking.  Brush the excess rub from the bird and sear each piece of meat on all sides in the hot oil.  Remove seared meat to a plate lined with paper towels.

Add the onions, the mushrooms and the pancetta and cook over high heat until onions are golden brown and fat has been rendered from pancetta.  Drain the excess oil, then add the wine and stir the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to dislodge the browned bits.  Add the tomato puree, chicken stock, sugar and chili flakes and bring to a boil.  Return the chicken to the pan.  Cook for 20 minutes, covered, then 15 to 20 minutes more, uncovered.

Remove from heat, cut each quarter in half, and divide meat evenly among 4 warmed dinner plates, giving each plate 1 section of breast and 1 section of leg.  Top with the sauce and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  chicken livers
  8             ounces  duck livers
  4                     bay leaves
  1                     garlic clove -- lightly crushed
  1         tablespoon  brandy
     3/4           cup  dry Marsala
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              small  fresh white or black truffle -- shaved very thin
                        with a truffle slicer
                        Good-quality crusty bread

Trim the livers of all connective tissue and cut away any green areas.  In a glass or stainless steel bowl, combine the bay leaves, garlic, brandy and Marsala.  Toss with the livers.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Drain the livers, reserving the marinade.  Pat them dry with paper towels.  In a large heavy skillet, heat the 4 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat.  Add the livers, the reserved bay leaves, and garlic, and toss 20 seconds or until the livers lose their red color.  Pour in the marinade and boil about 2 minutes.  The livers should be firm but still pink inside.  Scoop them out of the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.

Continue boiling down the liquid until all of it has evaporated and the butter sputters.  Add the 2 tablespoons of stock to the pan and scrape the contents over the livers.  Cool to room temperature.  Puree the livers in a food processor until smooth.  Season aggressively with salt and freshly ground pepper.

Have a large bowl of ice handy.  In a medium bowl, whip the 10 tablespoons butter with a portable beater at medium speed until fluffy.  Gradually beat in the liver puree, then set the bowl over ice and continue beating at medium speed 8 to 10 minutes, or until the mixture has lightened in color and is very fluffy.  Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.

To serve, bring the mousse close to room temperature.  Spoon it into individual 3-inch ramekins or crocks, or mound it in a 3-cup terrine.  Sprinkle generously with the shaved truffle.  Accompany with bite-sized pieces of crusty bread.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  butter
  4                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  fine sugar
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa
     1/2           cup  sweetened cocoa
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  sassolino or other sweet liqueur
     1/2           cup  broken-up biscotti in large pieces
     1/2           cup  whole toasted almonds

Place the butter in a large bowl and soften it with the back of a spoon.  Cream the butter, egg yolks and sugar, then blend in the cocoa, the vanilla extract, the liqueur, the biscotti and the almonds.

Working quickly to avoid melting the butter, turn the mixture out and form it into the shape of a sausage.  Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and let it set in the freezer for 4 hours.

Serve slightly thawed, sliced like a salami.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

CAUTION, The American Egg Board states:  "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of food poisoning.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell.

         Crepes With Peas - {Crespelle Ai Piselli And Parmigiano}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  4                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  milk
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2                cup  freshly-shucked peas
  2 1/2           cups  ricotta -- drained in a straine
                        lined with cheesecloth for 30 minutes
  1                cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/4           cup  butter -- cut small chunks

First make the crespelle:  Place the flour in a large mixing bowl.  Crack the eggs over the flour and whisk them in.  Add salt and whisk in milk, a little at a time, until all milk is incorporated.  Allow the batter to stand for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan and add the peas.  Cook slowly over medium heat until quite soft, about 15 minutes.  Allow peas to cool.  Stir the peas into the ricotta.

Heat a 6-inch, non-stick pan until hot and brush with olive oil.  Reduce heat to medium and pour 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons batter into the pan.  Cook 20 to 30 seconds, until pale golden, and then flip.  Cook on other side 20 seconds and remove to a plate.  Continue the process until all the batter has been used, yielding between 17 and 19 crespelle.  Fill each crespelle with 3 tablespoons of the cheese ricotta and fold in half.  Continue filling crespelle until all are full.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Butter the bottom and all sides of 10- by 8-inch ceramic baking dish.  Lay the filled crespelle in an overlapping layer in the baking dish.  Grate the Parmigiano-Reggiano over the crespelle, dot with the remaining butter and place in oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until piping hot and crispy on top.  Remove and serve hot, or allow to rest and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 18 crespelle, 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  type 00 pasta flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg -- beaten
  5 1/2           cups  cold water
     1/4         pound  lardo or pork fat back -- cut fine dice, plus
  2        tablespoons  lardo or pork fat back in fine dice
     1/4         pound  pancetta -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped rosemary leaves
  2                     fresh garlic cloves -- finely minced
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Combine the flour, salt and egg in a large mixing bowl.  Add 2 cups water and beat with a whisk for 5 minutes or until very smooth.  Quickly stir in the remaining water.  Allow to stand 1 hour.  (The batter will appear very thin, almost milk-like -- this is fine.)

Stir together 1/4 cup lardo, pancetta, garlic, rosemary and black pepper in a mixing bowl until smooth and set aside.

To cook the borlenghe, heat a 14- to 16-inch non-stick pan over medium heat and brush with 1/4 teaspoon of the remaining lardo.  Pour enough batter to just coat the pan (just like a crespella) and return to heat.  Cook 4 minutes on the first side and turn carefully.  (The texture will not be like a crespella, or anything else, for this is an original and distinct delicacy.  It may crack, but keep going.)  Continue until all the batter is finished, or about 10 to 12 borlenghe.

To serve, reheat borlenghe quickly in the same pan, spread with 1 tablespoon pancetta mixture, sprinkle with grated cheese and serve warm, folded into quarters.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  rabbit livers
  2        tablespoons  capers -- rinsed, drained
  2                     anchovy fillets -- rinsed, patted dry
  1         tablespoon  hot red pepper flakes
  1                cup  dry red wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12            slices  Italian peasant bread, cut 3/4" thick

Preheat the grill or broiler.

In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil slowly over medium heat.  Add the onion and cook slowly until soft but not brown, about 10 minutes.  Add the livers, capers, anchovies and red pepper flakes and cook until lightly browned, about 8 minutes.  Add the wine and cook until only 3 to 4 tablespoons of liquid remain, about 8 minutes.

Transfer the liver mixture to a food processor and pulse on and off until blended but still lumpy -- it should not be smooth like a puree.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and remove to a small mixing bowl.

Grill or toast the bread on both sides and spread each piece with 1 heaping tablespoon of the liver mixture.  Divide among 6 to 8 plates and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  fresh duck meat cut from the bone -- run through the
                        largest holes of butcherís grinder
  2             pounds  pancetta -- run through the
                        same grinder
  2        tablespoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  4        tablespoons  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
                        Sheep casings, 8 feet -- (abt 1/2 lb)
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1                     red onion -- finely chopped
  1                cup  dry red wine
     1/2           cup  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley

In a mixing bowl, stir together the duck and pancetta with your hands until well mixed.  Add pepper, salt and white wine and mix until well blended, again with your hands.  You must move quickly here or your body temperature could change the texture of the fat.

Set up the sausage stuffer and place the casing over the funnel feeder.  If you do not have a sausage stuffer, form the sausage into 1/4-pound logs by hand, and be careful handling them.  Stuff the sausage into the casings, twisting every 3 1/2 to 4 inches so that each sausage is about 4 ounces, and form 22 to 25 sausages.  Prick them all over with a needle and set aside in a cool place until ready to cook.

In a 12- to 14-inch skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat and add sausages.  Cook until golden brown, about 7 minutes a side, then add the onions and garlic.  Cook until soft and golden, about 8 to 9 minutes.  Remove the sausages and set on a plate.

Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 5 or 6 minutes.  Add the red wine and stock, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits into the mixture.  Return the sausages to the pan.  Cook over medium heat covered, for 15 minutes, turning occasionally.  Stir in the parsley and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  flour
  1              pinch  salt
     1/2         pound  butter -- cut into chunks
  1                     egg -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  very cold water
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  eggplants -- peeled, and sliced
                        lengthwise into 1/4"-thick slices
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     red onion -- finely chopped
     1/2         bunch  mint leaves -- chopped
     1/2         bunch  thyme leaves
     1/2         bunch  oregano leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  thick tomato puree
                        Pecorino Toscano -- for grating

Preheat the grill or broiler.

Mound the flour and salt in the center of a cutting board.  Using a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Mix in the egg and cold water and work the dough just enough so that it comes together.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 30 minutes.

Brush the eggplant slices with olive oil and grill on both sides until marked and crispy, about 3 minutes per side.  Set aside.

Meanwhile, in a 12- to 14-inch skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat until just smoking.  Add the garlic and onion and sautÈ over high heat until light golden brown.  Add the mint, thyme, oregano and salt and pepper to taste and cook 5 minutes more.  Stir in the tomato puree, bring to a boil, simmer until very thick and stew-like and remove from heat.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Roll the dough out to an even 1/8-inch thickness and fit it into a 10-inch tart pan.  Blind bake the pastry shell for 20 minutes, until golden brown, then remove from oven and allow to cool.

Layer the eggplant slices and tomato sauce mixture in the tart shell, alternating layers and ending with a layer of eggplant.  Cut the slices if necessary to fit the pie shell.  Top with abundant grated cheese and bake in the oven 20 minutes, until the cheese is browned and the sauce is bubbling.  Let cool 15 minutes, then slice and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE DOUGH ===
  2           packages  dry yeast
  3               cups  type 00 flour
     1/3           cup  olive oil
     2/3           cup  white wine
  2                     egg yolks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === FOR SPREADING ===
     1/4         pound  squaquerone cheese
     1/4         pound  crescenza, stracchino cheese

Mix the yeast with a 1/4 cup of warm water and set aside for 5 minutes.

Mound the flour in the center of the work space and make a well in the center.  Add the olive oil, the wine, the yolks, salt, and the yeast and water mixture and proceed as for making pasta.  When the dough has started to come together as a ball, knead for about 10 minutes to form a smooth dough.  Cover and set in a warm, dry place for 1 hour.

Roll the dough out to form a cylinder 3 inches in diameter.  Rip off small pieces by hand (do not use a knife, as it will impede proper rising) and roll each piece out to form a relatively flat disk.  Set aside to rise for 30 minutes.

Heat the tile molds in the oven at 425 degrees for 30 minutes.  Remove the tile molds and pat the risen pieces of dough onto the mold and replace in the oven to cook for 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove and continue process until dough is all cooked.

Eat them as they come out of the oven, spread with squaquerone or stracchino.

This recipe yields 25 tigelle.

          Fried Dough With Salami - {Gnocco Fritto Con Affetati}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  milk
  1            package  dry yeast
  1              pound  whole wheat flour
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pinch  salt
  2               cups  lard
  1              piece  fatback -- sliced thinly
                        on a slicer
  1              pound  thinly-sliced assorted cured meats
                        (prosciutto, testa, mortadella, capacolla)

In a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer.  Remove from heat, allow to cool to a temperature that is comfortable on the inside of the wrist, then dissolve the yeast in the milk.

Place the flour in a large bowl and, after the yeast has foamed, stir the mixture into the flour, along with the oil, the salt, and enough water to make a soft dough.  Cover the dough with a damp cloth and allow it to rise for 1 hour in a warm, dry place.

In a tall-sided pot, heat the lard to 375 degrees.  Cut the dough into pieces the size of a toddlerís fist and, once the oil has come to temperature, cook the dough in the oil, a few pieces at a time, until it is golden brown.  Remove from the oil and drain on a plate lined with paper towels.  Serve with the sliced meats and sliced fatback.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Rinse the fish in cold water, then soak for 48 hours in 4 changes of cold water.  In a large bowl, combine the semolina flour, the all-purpose flour, the baking powder, baking soda, salt, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and enough water so that a loose batter is formed.

In a tall-sided pot or deep fryer, heat the olive oil to 375 degrees.

Dip each fillet in the batter, allowing the excess to drip off, then dip in the bread crumbs to coat.

When the oil is at temperature, gently drop the fillets in the oil and cook until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes.

While the fish cooks, in a medium-sized bowl, combine the parsley, onion and tomatoes and toss with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.  Remove the fish from the oil, season with salt and pepper, briefly drain on a plate lined with paper towels, and serve with 1/4 of the salad mounded atop each portion.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
  1 1/2         pounds  frog legs -- skinned, and

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     duck legs and thighs -- skinned
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- cut 1/4" dice
  1             medium  carrot -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1                     celery stalk -- cut 1/4" dice
  4              whole  fresh sage leaves
  2               cups  dry red wine -- (preferably Sangiove
                        di Romagna)
  1                can  peeled whole plum tomatoes
  1                cup  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for grating

Wash the duck pieces, remove all visible fat and set aside for cicciolli.  Pat dry.

In a thick-bottomed casserole or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil until almost smoking over medium-high heat.  Season the duck pieces with salt and pepper and cook until brown on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes.

Remove the duck pieces to a plate and add the onion, carrot, garlic, celery, and sage to the casserole and cook over low heat until softened, 7 to 9 minutes.  Add the wine, tomatoes and chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Add the duck pieces, then lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hour.

Remove the duck pieces, and when cool enough to handle pull all meat off the bones.  Return the meat to the pot and simmer uncovered 30 minutes, or until quite thick.  Season with salt and pepper and set aside.

Divide the prepared pasta dough into 3 evenly-sized balls.  Roll each ball out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut the pasta into 2-inch squares, and roll each square around a dowel, corner to corner, to form quills.  Place the garganelli on a sheet tray dusted with semolina, cover with a damp towel and set aside.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, place enough ragu to coat but not overwhelm the pasta and toss over medium heat to heat through.

Drop the garganelli in the boiling water and cook 2 minutes, until tender yet al dente.  Drain the pasta, reserving the water, and add the pasta to the ragu.  Toss over high heat 2 minutes to coat, adding a splash of the pasta cooking water if necessary to keep the sauce at the proper consistency.

Divide the pasta among 4 warmed pasta bowls, grate Parmigiano over each bowl and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Wash the duck pieces, remove all visible fat and set aside for cicciolli.  Pat dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a thick-bottomed casserole or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil until almost smoking over medium-high heat.  Season the duck pieces with salt and pepper and cook until brown on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the duck pieces to a plate and add the onion, carrot, garlic, celery, and sage to the casserole and cook over low heat until softened, 7 to 9 minutes.  Add the wine, tomatoes and chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Add the duck pieces, then lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the duck pieces, and when cool enough to handle pull all meat off the bones.  Return the meat to the pot and simmer uncovered 30 minutes, or until quite thick.  Season with salt and pepper and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the prepared pasta dough into 3 evenly-sized balls.  Roll each ball out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut the pasta into 2-inch squares, and roll each square around a dowel, corner to corner, to form quills.  Place the garganelli on a sheet tray dusted with semolina, cover with a damp towel and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, place enough ragu to coat but not overwhelm the pasta and toss over medium heat to heat through.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drop the garganelli in the boiling water and cook 2 minutes, until tender yet al dente.  Drain the pasta, reserving the water, and add the pasta to the ragu.  Toss over high heat 2 minutes to coat, adding a splash of the pasta cooking water if necessary to keep the sauce at the proper consistency.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the pasta among 4 warmed pasta bowls, grate Parmigiano over each bowl and serve immediately.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1              whole  egg -- plus
  2                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  sweet butter -- plus
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- melted together
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === FILLING ===
  2               cups  fresh ricotta (sheepís milk is best)
     1/2           cup  pine nuts
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1                     lemon -- zested and juiced
  3                     eggs

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

To make the pastry, make a well in the flour, and place egg, yolks, sugar, butter and olive oil mixture in the center and proceed as you would with fresh pasta, i.e. bring flour in bit by bit until the liquid in the well is thick enough to bring together with your hands.  Knead until the dough is smooth, then allow to rest 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the filling by mixing together the ricotta, pine nuts, sugar, lemon zest, juice and eggs in a bowl until creamy.

To assemble, roll out the pastry to form 2 (12-inch) circles.  Place one circle down to line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pan.  Spread the ricotta mixture evenly over this layer.  Place the remaining circle of dough over the top and pinch together the edges.

Place in the oven to bake for 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove and serve warm or at room temperature with vin Santo from Cappezzana.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Guinea hens -- quartered
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  white wine
  1                cup  commercial balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  capers -- rinsed
     3/4           cup  pitted olives
  2        tablespoons  prosciutto -- cut 1/4" dice
  3                     anchovies -- rinsed, filleted
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2               cups  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2            bunches  chives -- finely sliced
  4        tablespoons  good-quality balsamic vinegar

Rinse the hen pieces and dry well.  Season aggressively with salt and pepper.  In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the oil over high heat until smoking.  Sear the hen pieces until browned on all sides.  Add the white wine and vinegar and allow to completely evaporate, turning the meat to coat with the liquid.

Add the capers, olives, diced prosciutto, anchovies and the tomato paste and cook 5 minutes.  Add the Brown Chicken Stock and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer 30 minutes, until the hen is cooked through.  Season with salt and pepper, stir in chives and serve, drizzling real vinegar over each portion tableside.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                  Herb Sandwich From Parma - {Erbazzone}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  cake flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  5        tablespoons  lard -- chilled
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- chilled
  7        tablespoons  cold water - (to 10 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- for the pan
                        === FILLING ===
  5             ounces  thinly-sliced pancetta -- minced
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  3                     medium-large onions -- chopped
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2 1/2         pounds  fresh spinach, beet greens, Swiss chard
                        leaves, or a blend -- cooked until barely
                        wilted, squeezed dry, and chopped
  1 1/2           cups  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- (to 2 cups)
                        Salt -- to taste
  3                     eggs -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  high-quality lard or olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- minced

Combine the flours and salt in a bowl.  Make a well in the center and add the cold lard and oil.  Working with your fingertips or a pastry cutter, blend the fat and flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Sprinkle with 7 tablespoons of the water, and toss with a fork until the dough begins to form clumps.  If it is dry, add more water.  Gather the bits of dough into a ball, wrap, and chill at least 30 minutes.

When ready to assemble, halve dough and roll into 2 rounds a little larger than a pizza pan.  Fit 1 round into the pizza pan.

Heat the pancetta with the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat.  Cook about 5 minutes, or until the pancetta has given off much of its fat.  Add the onion and garlic and cook, covered, 15 minutes or until softened.  Uncover, raise the heat to high, and cook another 6 minutes, or until a rich golden brown.  Add the spinach or chard, and saute 3 to 5 minutes, adjusting the heat to prevent burning.

If a brown glaze forms on the skillet bottom, add a little water and simmer, scraping it up with the spatula to incorporate the glaze with the filling.  Cook a minute or so until the liquid evaporates.  Turn the filling into a bowl and cool.  Blend in 1 1/2 cups of the cheese and reserved pancetta mixture.  Taste for seasoning and for enough cheese, and then blend in the eggs.

Preheat the oven to about 400 degrees.  Set the rack as close to the bottom of the oven as possible.  Combine the lard and garlic in a small pan and heat over medium heat 2 minutes, or until the lard has melted.

Spread the filling over the pastry-lined pizza pan, leaving about a 2-inch border.  Dampen the edges with water, top with the remaining dough, and pinch the edges together.  Fold the edges over toward the center of the tart, and crimp.  Make slashes in the top of the crust.

Bake 20 minutes, then brush the crust with the melted lard and garlic mixture, and bake another 20 minutes, or until pale gold and very crisp.  The edges of the tart will be golden brown.  Cut in narrow wedges to serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     extra-large eggs
  6             ounces  frozen chopped spinach -- thawed, squeezed dry
                        and chopped very fine
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 4 cups) -- plus
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- for dusting surface
     1/2      teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             recipe  Ragu Bolognese -- (see recipe)
  1             recipe  Bechamel Sauce - {Besciamella} -- (see recipe)
  8             ounces  Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for grating

Combine eggs and spinach.  Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and spinach mixture and the olive oil.  Using a fork, beat together the spinach, eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.  Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Divide the dough into 3 equal portions and roll each out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.

Bring about 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Set up an ice bath next to the stove top.  Cut the pasta into 20 (5-inch) squares and drop into the boiling water.  Cook 1 minute, until tender.  Drain well and refresh in the ice bath.  Drain on towels and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  In a brownie pan, assemble the lasagne, beginning with a layer of ragu, a sprinkling of grated Parmigiano, a layer of pasta, a layer of bechamel, a layer of ragu, a sprinkling of grated Parmigiano etc. until all sauce and pasta are used up.  The top layer should be pasta with bechamel over it.

Top the lasagne with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and bake in the oven for 30 to 45 minutes, until the edges are browned and the sauces are bubbling.  Remove and allow to cool for 10 minutes before slicing.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

           Meatballs With Ricotta - {Polpettone Con La Ricotta}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatballs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  ground pork
     1/4         pound  ground veal
     1/2         pound  fresh ricotta
  1                     egg -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  6                     pickled gherkins -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  chopped pistachios
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  milk -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, ricotta, egg, Parmigiano-Reggiano, gherkins and pistachios.  Mix only as much as necessary, and form into balls of a 1-inch diameter.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the butter until it foams and subsides.  Place the balls in the butter and brown on all sides.  Add the stock and, if necessary, the milk so that the liquid comes halfway up the sides of the balls.  Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook 15 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through.  Serve with the broth poured over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  cannellini beans
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided, plus
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  red onion -- finely diced
  2                     red bell peppers -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped into 1/2" dice
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2          head  cavolo nero or kale -- stalks removed,
                        and roughly chopped
  1           teaspoon  chili flakes
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- cut 1/4" dice
     1/2         pound  porcini mushrooms or portobellos -- stems removed
  4                     sage leaves -- cut chiffonade
  2                     leeks -- cleaned, and
                        cut into 1/4"-thick rings
     1/2         bunch  mint -- leaves only
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1                     loaf Italian stirato, or baguette -- cut 1/2" slices,
                        on the bias

Soak the beans in cold water to cover by a few inches, for at least 8 hours or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat.  Add the red onion and cook for 5 minutes, until soft and translucent.  Add the red peppers, thyme, oregano and saute over high heat for five more minutes, until the peppers and onions are very soft.  Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper and set aside.

In the same 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil until smoking.  Add the cavolo nero and the chili flakes and cook until wilted and soft, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat, place the cabbage mixture into a bowl, stir in prosciutto pieces and set aside.

Place the mushrooms on a sheet tray and drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper, place in oven and roast for 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool.  Chop the mushrooms into 1/4-inch cubes and place into a bowl with the juices that have exuded during cooking.  Add the sage, season with salt and pepper and set aside.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat until smoking.  Add the leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, until the leeks are very soft and translucent, about 8 or 9 minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool in a bowl.  Tear the mint leaves by hand and add to leeks.  Season with salt and pepper and set aside.

Drain the soaked beans and cook, covered with fresh water, over high heat until the beans are very tender but not waterlogged.  Drain the beans, allow them to cool slightly, then mash with a potato masher or fork, taking care not to "whip" them too much.  Stir in the minced garlic, rosemary, balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper, add more oil if necessary to create a smooth texture, and set aside.

Preheat the grill or broiler.

Grill or toast bread for 2 minutes, until browned and firm.  Taste each of the mixtures for seasoning and moisten any that may be dry with a little extra virgin olive oil and a squeeze of a lemon.  Top each piece of toast with a heaping tablespoon of any of the mixtures and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  2               cups  fresh bread crumbs -- mixed with
  1                cup  ground almonds
  3                     eggs -- lightly beaten
                        === PHEASANT CROQUETTES ===
  1                     pheasant -- roasted, cooled,
                        boned and shredded
     1/4         pound  prosciutto cotto -- cut 1/4" dice
     1/4         pound  Gruyere -- grated
                        Nutmeg -- to taste
     1/4         pound  veal loin -- cut into chunks,
                        and seared
  5                     chicken livers -- sauteed
  1 1/2         pounds  lamb loin -- cut 1-ounce chunks,
                        and seared
     1/2                calfís brain -- blanched, cooled,
                        and cut into slices
  4                     baby zucchini
  4              large  mushroom caps
  2                     apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/2" rings
  1 1/2         liters  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Chopped parsley
                        Lemon wedges

To prepare the batter, in a large bowl, combine the flour, olive oil, and enough milk to form a somewhat loose batter.  Season with salt and set aside.

To prepare the fried cream, combine the eggs and the sugar and whisk until the yolks are pale yellow.  Meanwhile, bring the milk almost to a boil, remove from heat, and pour half of it into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly.  Return the egg and milk mixture to the pan with the rest of the milk and, continuing to whisk, mix in the flour/cornstarch mixture.  Cook over high heat, now stirring with a wooden spoon, until the mixture begins to thicken.  Stir in the lemon zest and vanilla, remove from heat and allow to cool in a wide-surfaced bowl that has been set atop an ice bath.

Once the cream has cooled, spread it onto a small, lightly greased plate with high sides.  Once the cream has solidified, remove it carefully from the plate and roll it in the bread crumbs to which ground almonds have been added.  Pass it through the beaten eggs, then again through the bread crumb and almond mixture.

To make the pheasant croquettes:  In a large bowl, combine the shredded meat, the prosciutto, the Gruyere, and a pinch of nutmeg.  Mix with hands to bring ingredients together but do not overmix.  Form the mixture into 2-tablespoon quenelles and pass through the bread crumbs, the beaten eggs and again through the bread crumbs.

Make spiedini of the veal, livers, lamb, and brains, alternating the type of meat on each stick.  Dip each spiedino in the batter, shaking off the excess, then roll each skewer through the bread crumbs.

In a tall-sided pot, heat the olive oil to 375 degrees.  Working in batches, fry the custard, the pheasant croquettes, the spiedini, the zucchini, the mushroom caps and the apples in the oil until they are golden brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon, salt while draining on a plate lined with paper towels, and serve, arranged on a platter, with the parsley in a side dish, and the lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2        medium  Spanish onion -- cut 1/8" dice
     1/2         small  carrot -- cut 1/8" dice
     1/2                celery rib -- cut 1/8"-thick slice
  1           teaspoon  anchovy paste
  1         tablespoon  hot chili flakes
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  1                cup  dry red wine
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2         pound  fresh boar shoulder -- cut into 1" cubes
                        (may substitute lamb or venison)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)

Roll out the Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough to the thinnest setting and cut into 1-inch wide ribbons.

In a heavy 6- to 8-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil until smoking.  Add the onion, carrot and celery and cook until softened and light brown (about 12 to 15 minutes).  Add the anchovy paste, chili flakes, rosemary, red wine and tomato sauce and bring to a boil.

Season the meat with salt and pepper and drop into the tomato sauce mixture.  Return to a boil and lower to simmer and cook 90 minutes.  The meat should be falling apart with the poke of a fork.  Allow to cool 10 minutes.

In a food processor, barely pulse 4-ounce ladles of meat mixture until "stew" resembles meat sauce.  Check for seasoning and set aside.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Place the ragu in a saucepan and bring to a boil.

Drop the pappardelle into the boiling water and cook until tender yet firm.  Drain the pasta in a colander over the sink and pour into the ragu.  Toss gently to coat and pour into a warm serving bowl and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     baccala or staccafisso -- boned, skin removed
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2        medium  red onion -- chopped 1/4" dice
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  fennel seeds
  2        tablespoons  hot chili flakes
  2               cups  polenta, quick cook-style

Soak the baccala for 3 days in cool water, changing water daily.  Cut into 1-inch cubes.  In a 4-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil until smoking.  Add the onion and garlic and cook over medium-high heat until softened and light golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the baccala and stir until well mixed with the onions.  Add the wine, tomato sauce, fennel seeds and hot chilis and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer 1 hour or until reduced by 1/3.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly oil 2 (10-inch) cake pans.  Make the polenta according to the package directions, and while still hot, pour into cake pans to fill halfway with polenta and allow to cool (about 15 minutes).  Divide baccala over the polenta among 2 pans and place in the oven to bake for 45 minutes.  Remove, allow to rest for 10 minutes, cut into wedges like a cake and serve with "Steamed Fennel Dressed Like A Salad" (see recipe), if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  water
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- for grilling
  1              pound  pork sausage -- removed from casings
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1                     onion -- finely minced
  1                     carrot -- finely minced
  1              bunch  thyme leaves
  1              bunch  oregano leaves
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds -- ground
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1                can  peeled San Marzano tomatoes - (16 oz) -- and their juices
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil.  Add the cornmeal in a thin stream, stirring constantly.  Lower the heat to a simmer, season with salt and cook 5 to 7 minutes, until the consistency of thick oatmeal.  Pour the polenta into a clean but not greased 9- by 13-inch baking dish and allow to cool 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a 12- to 14-inch skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over high heat until just smoking.  Add the sausage and cook over high heat until it begins to brown in its own fat.  Drain the excess fat and stir in the garlic, onion, carrot, 1/2 of the thyme, 1/2 of the oregano, fennel seeds, white wine and tomatoes and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, uncovered, 20 minutes, until mixture has a thick ragu consistency.  Stir in the remaining thyme and oregano.

Meanwhile, preheat the grill or broiler.  Cut the polenta into quarters, then halve each quarter diagonally to make 8 wedges.  Brush the wedges with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, set over the grill and cook until slightly charred and crispy, about 10 minutes.

Divide the polenta wedges equally among 4 warmed dinner plates, top with a ladle of the ragu and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  Idaho potatoes -- peeled and cut
                        into 8 pieces and held in water
  3        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped onion
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus more
                        for garnishing pasta
     1/2           cup  finely-diced mortadella
     1/4         pound  stracchino cheese, or taleggio
     1/2    tablespoon  finely-chopped thyme
     1/2    tablespoon  finely-chopped oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  Ragu Bolognese -- (see recipe)

Boil the potatoes in plenty of water until tender (but not absorbing water).

Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium-low heat and add the onion and garlic.  Sweat over low heat until the aromatics are soft and translucent.  Set aside.

Drain the potatoes, allow to cool a few minutes, then pass through a food mill or ricer.  To the potatoes, add the onion, garlic, Parmigiano, mortadella, stracchino, herbs, and salt and pepper to taste.  If necessary to moisten the mixture, add the egg.  Set aside.

Roll the pasta out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine and cut the sheet into rectangles 3 inches by 1 inch.  In the center of half the rectangles, place a scant tablespoon of the potato mixture.  Top the filled rectangles with the unfilled rectangles and press at the edges to seal.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Warm the Ragu Bolognese in a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.

Cook the pasta in the boiling water for 3 minutes.  Drain and add to the pan with the ragu.  Add the remaining butter and toss over high heat one minute to coat.  Divide the pasta evenly among six warmed pasta bowls, top with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Gnocchi -- (see recipe)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/2                red onion -- finely diced
  2        tablespoons  thyme leaves
  2             pounds  cuttlefish -- cleaned, and cut
                        into 1/2" chunks
     1/2           cup  red wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare the gnocchi according to the recipe and hold in oil until ready to cook.

In a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic and onion and sweat 6 minutes, until soft and translucent.  Add the thyme and cuttlefish and increase heat to medium-high.  Cook, stirring regularly, for 5 more minutes.  Add the wine and salt and pepper to taste and reduce heat back to a simmer.  Cook, uncovered, for 40 minutes, until the mixture has become of a ragu consistency, adjusting the moisture with a bit more wine or olive oil as necessary.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop the gnocchi in the boiling water and cook until they are floating aggressively, about 2 minutes.  Drain the gnocchi, reserving the cooking water, and add them to the pan with the ragu.  Add a little cooking water if sauce is too thick.  Toss over medium-high heat 30 seconds, then serve immediately in 4 warmed pasta bowls.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Prepare the gnocchi according to the recipe and hold in oil until ready to cook.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic and onion and sweat 6 minutes, until soft and translucent.  Add the thyme and cuttlefish and increase heat to medium-high.  Cook, stirring regularly, for 5 more minutes.  Add the wine and salt and pepper to taste and reduce heat back to a simmer.  Cook, uncovered, for 40 minutes, until the mixture has become of a ragu consistency, adjusting the moisture with a bit more wine or olive oil as necessary.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop the gnocchi in the boiling water and cook until they are floating aggressively, about 2 minutes.  Drain the gnocchi, reserving the cooking water, and add them to the pan with the ragu.  Add a little cooking water if sauce is too thick.  Toss over medium-high heat 30 seconds, then serve immediately in 4 warmed pasta bowls.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Gnocchi -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  shelled hazelnuts
  1                cup  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1                     green apple -- cored, peeled,
                        and roughly chopped
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- for grating

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place the hazelnuts on a sheet tray and brown in the oven for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven, allow to cool until it is comfortable to handle them, then slip them from their skins.

Place the nuts in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour the chicken stock over and bring to a boil.  Boil for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and allow to cool.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the nuts and stock, apple, heavy cream and salt and pepper, to taste.  Blend until well combined but not completely homogenous.  Set aside.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, place the hazelnut sauce and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, taking care not to scorch it.

Meanwhile, drop the gnocchi into the boiling water and cook until they float aggressively, about 2 minutes.  Drain the gnocchi, reserving the pasta cooking water, and add the gnocchi to the pan.  Toss over high heat 1 minute to coat, adding a splash of pasta cooking water if necessary to keep the sauce from getting too "tight."  Serve immediately garnished with grated cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     fat garlic cloves -- peeled and crushed
  6              whole  allspice berries -- lightly crushed
  6                     juniper berries -- lightly crushed
  4                     whole cloves -- lightly crushed
  2                     bay leaves
  1 1/2    tablespoons  dried thyme
  10                    duck legs with thighs
  6        tablespoons  coarse sea salt
                        A mixture of rendered duck fat and lard -- 4 lbs in total,
                        proportion being at least 1/2 duck fat

On a wooden board, finely mince the herbs and spices.  Rub the mixture into the surface of the duck, then rub the salt vigorously over all surfaces of the duck, placing it in a large (or 2 smaller) ceramic or earthenware casserole.  Cover the casserole and hold in a cool place or in the refrigerator, permitting the "marinade" to perfume and soften the flesh for 3 days.

Remove any excess salt still adhering to the duck.  Warm the rendered duck fat and the lard in the largest, heaviest pot in the house.  Immerse the duck in the warm fat and cook it over the lowest flame for 2 hours or until the flesh is meltingly tender and beginning to fall from its bones.

Lift the duck from its bath and pack it into clean crocks or jars, ladling the warm fat over it, immersing it completely.  Cover the crocks or jars with oiled parchment, using butcher's twine to secure the paper.  The batu is ready to serve or keep, always in a cool place, for several months.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             square  pork skin, measuring 7" by 7"
     1/2         pound  combined ground pork shoulder
     1/2         pound  pancetta -- ground through large
                        holes at butcher shop
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  cinnamon - (scant)
  1              pinch  cloves - (scant)
  1              pinch  coriander - (scant)
  1              pinch  anise - (scant)
  1              pinch  caraway - (scant)

Lay the skin flat on the work surface.  In a large bowl, combine the meat and fat and spices.  Place the mixture in the center of the square and, using a trussing needle and butcherís twine or sausage casing that has been twisted into a thread, fold the square and sew it to resemble a 3-cornered priestís hat, making sure that all the filling is well-encased within the skin.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil.  Prick the outside of the capello lightly with the needle, taking care not to completely puncture the skin.  Wrap the capello in cheesecloth and boil, covered for 2 hours -- adding more water if necessary.  Drain, pat dry, remove from the cheesecloth and serve in thick slices.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

               Quail With Pancetta - {Quaglie Con Pancetta}

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry
                Quail

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     boneless quail
     1/2         pound  pancetta -- cut 1" cubes
  4        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided, plus
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1             medium  red onion -- cut 1/4" dice
     1/2         pound  coppa, or capocollo -- thinly sliced
  10                    sage leaves -- chopped
  2               cups  cooked borlotti beans
  4            bunches  chives -- cut 1" batons

Check quail for bones or feathers and place in mixing bowl.  Add pancetta, vinegar, 4 tablespoons of the olive oil, honey and black pepper and toss to coat.  Set aside and preheat grill.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil until smoking.  Add the onion and cook until softened and light golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Cut the coppa into julienne and add to the pan with the onions.  Add the sage leaves and the beans and lower heat to medium and cook the beans until soft and fragrant, about 7 to 8 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and keep warm on the side of the stove.

Bring 2 quarts of water to the boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt.  Prepare an ice water bath next to the stove.  Drop the chives into the boiling water and cook 20 to 30 seconds until deep green.  Quickly fish them out with a spider and refresh in the ice bath.  Remove and drain well between 2 towels.  Place the chives in a blender with the remaining 1 cup oil and blend until smooth, 30 to 45 seconds.  Remove and set aside.

Drain the pancetta from the marinade and place in a cold nonstick pan.  Place pan over medium heat and cook until crispy and golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Drain the quails from their marinade and place skin-side down on the hottest part of the grill.  Cook until medium-rare inside, about 4 minutes on the first side and 2 minutes on the back.

Meanwhile arrange the beans on 4 separate plates.  Remove the quail from the grill and place on the piles of beans.  Arrange the pancetta pieces around the beans on the plate.  Drizzle with the chive oil and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     rabbit - (4 1/2 lbs) -- see * Note
     1/2           cup  lardo or fat back
     1/2                fennel bulb -- cored and diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     Italian sausage links -- casings removed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

* Note:  Head, tail and feet removed, gutted, liver reserved, have your butcher remove all of the bones from the rabbit for you.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Season the inside and outside of the rabbit with pepper and set aside.

In a 12 to 14-inch saute pan heat 4 tablespoons of the lardo until smoking.  Add the fennel and the garlic and cook over medium heat until softened and light brown, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the sausage and cook until just cooked, about 6 to 8 more minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Stuff the rabbit cavity with the fennel, garlic, and the remaining lardo, cut into 1/8-inch dice.  Truss the rabbit to seal the openings and place in a casserole.  Baste with the wine and lemon juice and sprinkle with the coarse salt.  Cook in the oven for 1 hour, turning once after 30 minutes of cooking, and occasionally basting with the pan juices.

Remove from the oven, allow to sit 5 minutes.  Serve in 1/2-inch slices with pan juices emulsified with extra-virgin olive oil.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Rabbit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh rabbit legs -- cut from the bone,
                        run through largest holes of grinder
     1/2         pound  pancetta -- run through
                        the same grinder
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
                        Sheep casings, 4 feet -- abt 1/4 lb
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  butter
  6                     white onions -- peeled, and
                        sliced lengthwise 1/4"-thick pieces
  6        tablespoons  commercial balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a mixing bowl, stir together the rabbit and pancetta with your hands until well mixed.  Add pepper, salt and white wine and mix until well blended, again with your hands.  You must move quickly here or your body temperature could change the texture of the fat.

Set up the sausage stuffer and place the casing over the funnel feeder.  If you do not have a sausage stuffer, form the sausage into 1/4-pound logs by hand, and be careful handling them.  Stuff the sausage into the casings, twisting every 3 1/2 to 4 inches so that each sausage is about 4 ounces, and form 10 to 12 sausages.  Prick them all over with a needle and set aside in a cool place until ready to cook.

In a Dutch oven, combine the olive oil and butter and cook over medium heat 1 minute.  Add the onion slices, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, until onions are very soft and browned, or caramelized.  Stir in the balsamic vinegar and tomato paste and cook 5 minutes over low heat.

Grill the sausages until just cooked through, about 6 minutes to the side.  Remove them and place in the pot with the onion mixture.  Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes and serve immediately.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         small  white or black truffle -- shaved
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus more
                        for garnishing pasta
     1/2           cup  fresh sheepís milk ricotta
     1/2           cup  blanched, drained, and chopped spinach
  1              pinch  nutmeg - (scant)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
  7                     very fresh eggs
  12       tablespoons  butter -- melted, kept warm

In a non-reactive bowl, combine 1/2 the truffle shavings, the Parmigiano, the ricotta and the spinach, mix well, and season to taste with nutmeg, salt and white pepper.  Set aside.

Roll out the pasta dough to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  From the thin pasta sheet, cut 12 circles with a 6-inch diameter.  Set 6 of the circles on a sheet tray dusted with flour, cover with plastic wrap and set aside.

In the center of each of the remaining 6 circles, mound an equal portion of the ricotta mixture.  With the back of a small ladle or spoon, hollow out a well in the center of each mound.  Carefully break the eggs, 1 at a time, into a small bowl, and transfer 1 yolk and a bit of white into the center of each well.  It is imperative that the yolk remain unbroken.

Cover each filled circle of pasta with an unfilled circle, and press the edges together with fingers to seal.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Gently, using a wide spatula, lower each ravioli into the water to cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the water and place gently into a 12- to 14-inch saute pan with the remaining butter, shave the remaining truffle over, add a generous grating of Parmigiano-Reggiano and carefully put 1 on each plate.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                           Red Wine Pasta Dough

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  flour - (to 4 cups)
  4                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  sangiovese wine - (to 3 tbspns)

Mound 3 1/2 cups of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, olive oil and sangiovese.  Using a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and wine and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.

As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up from the base of the mound to retain the well shape.  The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.

Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and discard any leftover bits.  Lightly reflour the board and continue kneading for 6 more minutes.  The dough should be elastic and a little sticky.

Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Roll or shape as desired.

This recipe yields about 1 pound of pasta.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2                red onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely minced
     1/2         pound  porcini mushrooms -- thinly sliced,
                        may substitute cremini or portobello
  1           teaspoon  red chili flakes
     1/4         pound  prosciutto di Parma -- cut into lardons
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for grating

Prepare the pasta dough according to the recipe.  Roll it out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine, then cut the resultant sheet into ribbons 1/4-inch wide.  Place the ribbons on a sheet tray dusted with semolina and set aside, covered with clean, damp kitchen towels, until ready to cook.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan, heat oil until smoking.  Add the onions and garlic and cook until light golden brown and wilted, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and sautÈ over high heat 5 minutes, until golden brown.  Season with chili flakes and salt and pepper, to taste.

Drop the tagliatelle into the boiling water and cook 1 minute.  Drain the pasta, reserving the cooking liquid, and add to the pan with the mushrooms.  Toss over high heat 1 minute to coat the pasta, adding a splash of the cooking water if necessary to keep the sauce from being too "tight".  Add prosciutto and toss to mix.  Serve immediately in 4 warmed pasta bowls, topped with Parmigiano-Reggiano.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

        Roasted Pears With Chestnut Honey And Parmigiano-Reggiano

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  pears, Bosc or Anjou -- not quite ripe
  1                cup  Chianti or other dry red wine
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  chestnut honey
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- in 1 piece

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Trim the bottom of the pears so that they stand up on their own.  In a small roasting pan, just large enough to hold the pears, place the pears upright.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fore shank of a pig (zampone) -- shin bone removed
                        by butcher, soaked overnight in cold water
     1/2         pound  ground pork
     1/2         pound  ham skin -- diced small
     1/2         pound  prosciutto cotto -- cut 1/4" dice
  2                     sweet Italian sausage links -- casings removed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  cinnamon - (scant)
  1              pinch  cloves - (scant)
  1              pinch  coriander - (scant)
  1              pinch  anise - (scant)
  1              pinch  caraway - (scant)
  1              pound  borlotti beans -- soaked overnight,
                        and drained
  2        tablespoons  lard
  1                     onion -- diced
  1                cup  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste

Remove the zampone from its bath and rinse in cold water.  Pat dry.

In a large bowl, thoroughly combine the pork meat, ham skin, the prosciutto, the Italian sausage and the spices.  Season the inside of the zampone with salt and pepper and stuff with the pork mixture.  Using a large needle and butcherís twine, truss the leg.  In a large pot, place the zampone with enough water to cover by several inches.  Place over high heat and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer covered for 2 hours.

Meanwhile, boil the soaked beans in water 1 hour, until tender but still slightly firm.

In a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan, heat the lard over high heat.  Add the onion and cook over high heat 5 minutes, until golden brown.  Stir in the Brown Chicken Stock and tomato paste and cook over medium heat 5 minutes.  Add the drained beans and cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Season with salt a pepper and place onto a serving platter.

When the zampone is done, remove from the water, allow to rest 10 minutes, then slice into 1/2-inch rounds and place atop the beans.  Drizzle with real balsamic vinegar and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  sweet Italian sausage
  1                     onion -- roughly chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- roughly chopped
     1/2         pound  seedless green grapes
     1/2         pound  seedless red grapes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Saba -- for drizzling

In a 12- to 14-inch sautÈ pan, heat the oil over high heat until smoking.  Add the sausages and brown on all sides.  Remove to a plate lined with paper towels and set aside.

In the same pan, add the onions and garlic over high heat, stirring with a wooden spoon to dislodge browned bits.  You may also add 1 tablespoon or 2 of water to keep the vegetables from sticking.  Cook vegetables 5 minutes, until tender and golden brown.

Return the sausages to the pan and cook another 3 minutes.  Add the grapes and continue to cook over high heat until the grapes burst.  Their liquids and pulp will mingle with the pan juices from the onions and garlic.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Drizzle with Saba and serve immediately.

         Soft Bread With Favas And Pecorino - {Spianata Con Fave}

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPONGE ===
  1           teaspoon  granulated yeast
  1                cup  flour
  1                cup  warm water
                        === DOUGH ===
  2               cups  flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  flour -- or as needed
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  sweet butter -- at room temperature
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  coarse salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
                        === EXTRA ===
  2             pounds  fresh fava beans
  1              pound  pecorino cheese, abt 6 to 8 months old

Making the sponge:  Start the sponge the night before.  Blend the yeast, 2 tablespoons of the flour, and 1/4 cup of the warm water in a mixing bowl.  Let stand 3 to 5 minutes, until the yeast comes alive with small bubbles.  Beat in the rest of the flour and water, using a wooden spoon.  The batter should be elastic.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and seal it with plastic wrap.  Let stand to rise at room temperature 7 to 8 hours.

Make the dough:  In an electric standing mixture with a dough hook attachment, blend the 2 cups flour and the salt.  Add half the mixture to the sponge, along with the olive oil and lard or butter.  Beat about 5 minutes, making a very elastic dough.  Gradually mix in the rest of the flour mixture.  Knead it by hand about 10 minutes into a soft, but not sticky, dough.

First rising:  Place the dough in an oiled bowl, and seal the top with plastic wrap.  Let it rise at room temperature 2 hours, or until doubled.

Shaping the dough:  Lightly grease a 14- to 16-inch pizza pan.  Punch the dough down.  Roll and stretch the dough to fit the pan.  It should be between 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch thick, and all the way to the panís edge.

Second rising:  Cover the pan with a kitchen towel, and let the dough rise 2 hours.  The dough should be doubled in volume, and should not spring back when poked with a finger.

Baking and serving:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Poke indentations in the top of the loaf with your fingers.  Spread 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil over the top, and sprinkle with the salt and rosemary.  Bake 10 minutes, then lower the heat to 350 degrees and bake another 25 minutes.  The bread is done when the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.

Serve warm, or at room temperature, sliced into wedges, with the peel yourself favas and the pecorino.

This recipe yields 8 to 12 servings.

  1                     egg -- beaten
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- plus more
                        for grating over
  1              pinch  salt
                        Generous grating nutmeg
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
  8        tablespoons  butter
  8                     sage leaves

In a large bowl, combine the flowers, mascarpone, egg, Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and nutmeg.  Mix well to form a dense but not overly-stiff mixture.  Set aside.

Divide the prepared pasta dough into 3 balls of equal size.  Roll each ball out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut each sheet into 5-inch squares.  Place a generous tablespoon of the cheese and flower mixture in the center of each square and fold each square, corner to corner, to form a triangle.  Fold the other 2 corners together to form the tortelli.  Place the tortelli on a sheet tray dusted with flour until ready to cook.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  In a 14- to 16-inch saute pan, heat the butter until it foams and subsides.

Meanwhile, cook the tortelli in the boiling water for 2 minutes.  Drain the pasta, reserving the cooking water, and add the pasta to the pan with the butter.  Add a splash of the pasta water and the sage leaves and toss over high heat 1 minute to coat and emulsify.

Divide the pasta evenly among 4 warmed pasta bowls, grate Parmigiano-Reggiano over, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  chicken livers
  4                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3             pounds  medium-sized zucchini - (abt 5 or 6) -- halved lengthwise
                        scooped out, flesh chopped and set aside
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                     carrot -- finely diced
  1                     celery rib -- finely diced
     1/2           cup  milk
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (16 oz)

In a large bowl, mix the chicken livers, egg yolks, olive oil, bread crumbs, and cheese and season with salt and pepper.  Divide the mixture into 2 equal portions.  Using 1 portion, stuff the hollowed-out canals of the zucchini halves.  Set aside.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the butter over medium heat.  Add the chopped zucchini flesh, carrot and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until the vegetables are softened and slightly browned, about 8 to 9 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and add the remaining chicken livers-bread crumb mixture.  Add the milk and cook, covered, 10 minutes.

Stir in the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer, carefully place the zucchini halves in the sauce and cook, covered, 1 hour over medium-low heat.  Arrange 2 zucchini halves and some of the sauce on each plate, topping with more Parmigiano-Reggiano, if desired, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- cut 1/4" dice
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1 1/2         pounds  Swiss chard -- thick stems removed,
                        roughly chopped
  3               cups  Bechamel Sauce - {Besciamella} -- (see recipe)
  3              whole  eggs -- plus
  2                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  ricotta
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano -- divided
                        Freshly-grated nutmeg -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs -- plus
     1/4           cup  toasted bread crumbs
                        Butter -- for the mold

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over high heat until almost smoking.  Add the onion and garlic and cook over medium-high heat 5 minutes, until soft and light golden brown.  Add the chard and saute over high heat until very soft and tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the pan and press under a plate to remove excess moisture.  Finely chop the Swiss chard.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Place the chard mixture into a mixing bowl and add the besciamela, eggs and yolks, ricotta and 1/4 cup of the Parmigiano and season with nutmeg and salt and pepper.

Butter a bundt cake pan and sprinkle with bread crumbs to coat.  Pour the mixture into the pan, and place the pan in a roasting pan.  Carefully pour cool water into the roasting pan to come up 3 inches on the side of the bundt pan and place in the oven.  Cook until the custard is just cooked through, about 35 minutes, then remove.  The custard is done when a toothpick to the center exits clean.

Allow to rest 15 minutes before edging with a thin knife and turning out onto a plate.  Sprinkle with the toasted bread crumbs and remaining 1/4 cup grated cheese before serving warm.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Add the chard and saute over high heat until very soft and tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the pan and press under a plate to remove excess moisture.  Finely chop the Swiss chard.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the chard mixture into a mixing bowl and add the besciamela, eggs and yolks, ricotta and 1/4 cup of the Parmigiano and season with nutmeg and salt and pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Butter a bundt cake pan and sprinkle with bread crumbs to coat.  Pour the mixture into the pan, and place the pan in a roasting pan.  Carefully pour cool water into the roasting pan to come up 3 inches on the side of the bundt pan and place in the oven.  Cook until the custard is just cooked through, about 35 minutes, then remove.  The custard is done when a toothpick to the center exits clean.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Allow to rest 15 minutes before edging with a thin knife and turning out onto a plate.  Sprinkle with the toasted bread crumbs and remaining 1/4 cup grated cheese before serving warm.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  Spanish onion -- finely chopped
     3/4         pound  porcini mushrooms -- stems removed,
                        finely chopped, (may sub portobellos)
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2    tablespoon  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for grating

Divide the prepared pasta dough into three balls of equal size.  Roll each ball out to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Then, using the machine or a sharp knife, cut each sheet of pasta into ribbons of 1/3-inch thickness.  Place the ribbons on a sheet tray dusted with flour, and cover the tray with a clean, damp dish towel until ready to cook.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil over high heat until smoking.  Add the onions and cook over high heat for 5 minutes, until onions are light golden brown.  Add the mushroom pieces and continue cooking until they have given up most of their water, about 9 to 10 more minutes.  Add the wine and the tomato sauce, butter and salt and pepper to taste and reduce heat to medium.  Cook for 5 more minutes, until mixture is of a ragu consistency.

Meanwhile, cook the pasta in the boiling water for 1 minute.  Drain the pasta, reserving the cooking water, and add the pasta to the ragu.  Toss over high heat one minute to coat the pasta.  Divide the pasta evenly among four warmed pasta bowls, grate Parmigiano over and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  10            ounces  Swiss chard - (to 12 oz)
     1/3           cup  water
  1 1/2           cups  creamy fresh whole-milk ricotta
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-grated nutmeg -- to taste
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        === PASTA ===
  1             recipe  Red Wine Pasta, made with sangiovese -- (see recipe)
                        === SAUCE ===
  10       tablespoons  sweet butter
  1 1/2           cups  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

To make the filling:  Trim the Swiss chardís stalks and reserve for another use.  Wash the leaves well, and without shaking off the water, tuck the leaves into a 4-quart saucepan.  Add 1/3 cup water, cover and cook over medium heat until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain and allow to cool.  Squeeze the leaves as dry as possible, finely chop and transfer to a medium-sized bowl.

Whip the ricotta and stir it into the chard.  Blend in the 3/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and pepper and nutmeg.  Taste for balance.  Beat in the egg.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Filling the pasta:  Stretch and thin the pasta to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut the pasta into long strips about 4 1/2 inches wide.  Cut each strip in half lengthwise.  Keep the strips of pasta covered with plastic wrap until you are ready to work with them.  Create diamond shapes by cutting each of the strips on the diagonal, spacing the cuts every 2 1/4 inches, so that each diamondís sides measure about 2 1/4 inches.  Keep the cut pieces covered while you work with 1 or 2.  Put a narrow row (about 1 teaspoon) of filling in the center of each diamond.

Place the pasta with the long strip of filling perpendicular to you.  Fold the 2 points of the diamond on the left and right of the row of filling over each other, covering the filling.  Pinch together the 2 overlapping pieces of pasta, using your thumb and forefinger to make a row of pinched closures down the length of the pasta.  As you pinch together the pasta, twist it slightly to create an undulating ridge.  This pleating will create a rippling, scalloped appearance.

Twist and seal the ends, creating tails.  Place them in a single layer, without touching, on the towel-lined baskets.  Uncover more of the cut pasta and repeat the process.  Once the first batch is done, stretch and thin the next portion of the dough, and continue.

Cooking and serving the tortelli:  Have a serving bowl and soup dishes warming in a low oven.  Have a large colander ready for draining the tortelli.  Bring 6 quarts water to a strong boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop in the pastas and cook until their tails are pleasingly firm to the bite yet tender enough to eat.  If freshly made, they will take about 3 to 4 minutes.  If they have been done up to 24 hours ahead, they may need 8 to 10 minutes.  While the pasta cooks, melt the butter in a small saucepan.

Gently pour the cooked tortelli into the colander, taking care not to break them.  Carefully pour about 1/3 of the pastas into the heated serving bowl.  Spoon a third of the butter over them, and then a generous sprinkling of the cheese.  Top with another third, and more butter and cheese.  Finally pour in the last portion, top it with the remaining butter and cheese, and serve immediately.  Pass any leftover cheese separately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

To make the filling:  Trim the Swiss chardís stalks and reserve for another use.  Wash the leaves well, and without shaking off the water, tuck the leaves into a 4-quart saucepan.  Add 1/3 cup water, cover and cook over medium heat until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain and allow to cool.  Squeeze the leaves as dry as possible, finely chop and transfer to a medium-sized bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whip the ricotta and stir it into the chard.  Blend in the 3/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and pepper and nutmeg.  Taste for balance.  Beat in the egg.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Filling the pasta:  Stretch and thin the pasta to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine.  Cut the pasta into long strips about 4 1/2 inches wide.  Cut each strip in half lengthwise.  Keep the strips of pasta covered with plastic wrap until you are ready to work with them.  Create diamond shapes by cutting each of the strips on the diagonal, spacing the cuts every 2 1/4 inches, so that each diamondís sides measure about 2 1/4 inches.  Keep the cut pieces covered while you work with 1 or 2.  Put a narrow row (about 1 teaspoon) of filling in the center of each diamond.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the pasta with the long strip of filling perpendicular to you.  Fold the 2 points of the diamond on the left and right of the row of filling over each other, covering the filling.  Pinch together the 2 overlapping pieces of pasta, using your thumb and forefinger to make a row of pinched closures down the length of the pasta.  As you pinch together the pasta, twist it slightly to create an undulating ridge.  This pleating will create a rippling, scalloped appearance.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Twist and seal the ends, creating tails.  Place them in a single layer, without touching, on the towel-lined baskets.  Uncover more of the cut pasta and repeat the process.  Once the first batch is done, stretch and thin the next portion of the dough, and continue.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cooking and serving the tortelli:  Have a serving bowl and soup dishes warming in a low oven.  Have a large colander ready for draining the tortelli.  Bring 6 quarts water to a strong boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop in the pastas and cook until their tails are pleasingly firm to the bite yet tender enough to eat.  If freshly made, they will take about 3 to 4 minutes.  If they have been done up to 24 hours ahead, they may need 8 to 10 minutes.  While the pasta cooks, melt the butter in a small saucepan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Gently pour the cooked tortelli into the colander, taking care not to break them.  Carefully pour about 1/3 of the pastas into the heated serving bowl.  Spoon a third of the butter over them, and then a generous sprinkling of the cheese.  Top with another third, and more butter and cheese.  Finally pour in the last portion, top it with the remaining butter and cheese, and serve immediately.  Pass any leftover cheese separately.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  sweet butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  8             ounces  ground turkey
  8             ounces  ground veal
  8             ounces  ground pork shoulder
  8             ounces  prosciutto -- finely diced
  8             ounces  mortadella -- finely diced
  1                     egg -- beaten
  2               cups  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta -- (see recipe)
                        === FOR THE BRODO ===
  1              pound  beef scraps
  1              pound  beef or veal bones
  1              pound  beef tongue -- cut 4 or 5 pieces
  1              pound  boiler chicken -- cut 6 pieces
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  1                     carrot -- coarsely chopped
  1                     celery rib -- coarsely chopped
  10            liters  cold water  - (to 12)

In a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed, large saucepan, heat the butter and oil until it foams and subsides.  Add the turkey, veal and pork shoulder and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the meat is well-browned and begins to release some of its juices.   Add the prosciutto and mortadella and cook for 5 minutes more.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Place in a food processor and mix to combine.  Add the egg and the Parmigiano-Reggiano and mix well to combine.  Season with salt and pepper to taste and add at least 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg and mix again.  Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.

For the brodo:  Place the beef, bones, tongue, chicken pieces, onion, carrot and celery in a large soup pot, cover with the water and bring almost to a boil, very slowly.  Reduce the heat to simmer before the mixture boils, and allow to cook for 4 hours, skimming off the foam and any excess fat that rises to the surface.  After 4 hours, remove from heat, strain the liquid twice, first through a conical seive and second through cheesecloth and allow to cool.

To assemble the dish:  Cut the prepared Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough into 3 equal portions.  Using a pasta machine, roll out the pasta to the thinnest setting then cut the sheets into 2-inch squares.  Place 1 teaspoon of the tortellini filling in the center of each 2-inch square.  Fold the opposite corners together to form a triangle and press the edges together firmly to seal.  Bring the long points of the triangle together and join with firm finger pressure.  Continue filling and shaping tortellini until all the pasta and filling are used.  Set the tortellini on a sheet tray, covered with a clean, damp towel.

Bring the prepared brodo to a boil and season with salt and pepper.  Drop the tortellini into the brodo and cook until tender, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove tortellini from the brodo with a slotted spoon, and divide among 10 to 12 heated pasta bowls.  Spoon some of the brodo into each bowl and serve immediately, topped with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  2                     eggs -- beaten
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  Basic Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  4             slices  prosciutto di Parma, paper thin
     1/4         pound  Parmigiano-Reggiano -- shaved with peeler
                        into shards

Season the turkey pieces with salt and pepper and place in the beaten egg.  Drain to remove the excess and dredge in bread crumbs, pressing to coat each 1 evenly.  Lay on a plate and refrigerate 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a 14- to 16-inch saute pan (large enough to hold all 4 turkey pieces at the same time) over medium heat, heat the oil and butter until the butter foams and dissipates.  Place the turkey pieces in a pan and cook slowly until golden brown on 1 side, about 6 to 7 minutes.  DO NOT RUSH THIS STEP OR THEY WILL BURN.  Turn and cook the other side.

When both sides are golden brown, pour the tomato sauce and chicken stock around the meat and bring to a boil.  Place 1 slice prosciutto over each piece and sprinkle with shaved Parmesan and place, uncovered, in the oven for 10 minutes.  Remove and place on a warmed serving platter.  Drizzle with spoonfuls of the sauce and serve.

Rinse the mushroom pieces under cold running water to rid them of sand.  If the pieces are small, drop them into a small bowl of water, swish them around, and let the particles settle.  Immediately scoop up the pieces.  Repeat twice more.  Soak the rinsed mushrooms in the hot water 30 minutes, or until softened.  Then lift them out of the liquid and coarsely chop.  Strain the liquid through a sieve lined with a paper towel, and set aside 4 tablespoons for the pan sauce.  (The rest can be frozen for later use.)

Have a serving platter warming in a low oven.  Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch saute pan over medium-high heat.  Take 3 to 4 minutes to quickly brown the veal chops on both sides.  Periodically slip a wooden spatula under each chop to keep it from sticking.

Once the chops are golden brown, lower the heat to medium-low and cook 8 to 12 minutes, turning once.  Check for doneness at 8 minutes.  Take care not to overcook them, or the veal will dry out.  The interior of the chops should be blushed with pink, and they should give a little when pressed with your finger.  Once they are done, remove the chops to the heated platter to keep warm.

Spoon off all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the pan.  Turn the heat to medium-high, and add the onions and garlic.  Cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes, and add the reconstituted mushrooms.  Stir and saute 1 minute.  Add the reserved mushroom liquid and reduce to 4 tablespoons.  Then turn the heat to high, add the wine and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.

Once the wine has reduced by half (in about 1 minute), stir in the stock and simmer 2 minutes.  Off the heat add the lemon juice and the butter, and swirl the pan to create the sauce.  Spoon the sauce over the chops and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fritters

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1                cup  shredded zucchini -- shredded on large
                        holes of a cheese grater
     1/2           cup  shredded potato -- shredded on large
                        holes of a cheese grater
  2        tablespoons  lard -- plus
  2               cups  lard
                        Grated nutmeg -- to taste
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking powder and enough water to form a fairly loose, sticky batter.  Set aside.

Recipe By     :Mario Batali
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1              large  onion -- diced
  1              pound  best-quality pork sausage -- removed from casing
  1                cup  white wine
  1                cup  milk
     1/2           cup  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for grating

Roll the pasta out to the #4 setting, and form into gramigne.  To form into gramigne, cut the dough into fingers that are 1/2-inch thick and 3 inches long.  Starting with the palm of your hand, roll the dough pieces lengthwise.  It should look like a piece of squiggly spaghetti.

In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, heat the olive oil and butter together over high heat.  Add the onion and cook until soft and golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Add the sausage and cook over high heat, draining the excess fat if necessary, until the sausage is very browned and somewhat crispy, about 10 minutes.

Add the wine and, stirring frequently, allow it to evaporate completely.  Sir in the milk, Brown Chicken Stock, tomato paste and salt and pepper to taste and reduce heat to a simmer.  Cook for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop the gramigne into the boiling water and cook for 3 minutes.  Drain the pasta, reserving the cooking water, and add the pasta to the sausage mixture.  Toss over high heat 1 minute to coat, adding a splash of the reserved pasta water if necessary to keep the condiment from getting too "tight."

Divide equally among 6 warmed pasta bowls, top with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2             pounds  chicken or turkey hearts, gizzards, livers -- trimmed of tough
                        tissue and cut into 1/4" dice
     1/8           cup  finely-chopped Italian parsley
  1              large  garlic clove -- crushed
  1                     bay leaf
  2              large  fresh sage leaves
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  best-quality tomato paste
  3               cups  Brown Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  drained canned tomatoes -- crushed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             recipe  Basic Fresh Egg Pasta dough -- (see recipe),
                        cut into 1/2"-thick ribbons
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano -- for garnish

Stir the mushroom pieces into a bowl of cold water, let the particles settle, and lift out the mushrooms.  Repeat with fresh water until there is no sign of grit or debris.  Soak the rinsed mushrooms in the hot water while the meat is browning.  Line a small sieve with a paper towel to strain the liquid.

Heat the oil in a heavy 6-quart pot over medium-low heat.  Add the pancetta and onion, carrot and celery.  Stir them occasionally as they cook, about 8 minutes, or until the onions are soft and clear.  Raising the heat to medium-high, saute the vegetables another 5 minutes, or until they begin to color.

Turn the heat down to medium, and add the hearts, gizzards and liver.  Cook them very slowly, taking 15 to 20 minutes.  Use a wooden spatula to scoop under the meat and turn it, keeping it from sticking.

Lift the mushrooms out of their liquid, reserving the liquid.  Stir the mushrooms, parsley, garlic, bay leaf and sage into the pot.  Saute 2 to 3 minutes over medium-low heat.  Strain the mushroom liquid into the pot.  Cook until the liquid has evaporated.

Blend in the wine and tomato paste.  Stir in stock and tomatoes.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium.  Cook 1 hour, or until the gizzards are tender and the sauce is thick but not dry.  Add water or more stock if necessary.

Season with salt and pepper.  Let the sauce cool a short while off the heat, then skim off the fat.  When ready to eat.  Bring the sauce to a simmer, and set aside.

Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop the pappardelle in the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes, until soft yet still very firm.  Drain the pasta and toss into the pan with the sauce.  Toss over medium heat until properly dressed and serve with Parmigiano over.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
