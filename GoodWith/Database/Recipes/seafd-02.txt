                           Aegean Stuffed Squid

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    squid tubes
  4             ounces  feta cheese
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped bay shrimp
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             quarts  vegetable oil - (or more) -- for frying
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  breadcrumbs -- fresh or dried

Rinse the squid tubes inside and out and thoroughly dry them on a paper towel. 
Crumble the feta cheese into a small bowl and add the shrimp, lemon zest, oregano, salt and pepper.  Stir to thoroughly combine. 
Using a small spoon, loosely fill each squid tube with about 1 1/2 tablespoon of stuffing.  Press the top of the squid tube together and skewer a round wooden toothpick through to securely enclose the stuffing.  Do not overstuff the squid. 
Heat about 2 inches of oil to 375 degrees in a deep-fryer.  Put the flour in one shallow dish and season with salt and pepper.  Put the milk in another shallow dish and the breadcrumbs in a third. 
Dust the stuffed squid with seasoned flour, shaking off excess.  Dip them in the milk, allowing excess to drip off, then thoroughly coat them with breadcrumbs. 
Shake off excess breadcrumbs and add the squid to the hot oil, 3 to 4 at a time.  Fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.  Do not overcook the squid or it will be tough.  Drain the squid on paper towels and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Squid cooks in a flash and is ideal for frying.  Here squid (often called calamari) is given a Greek treatment with a stuffing of feta cheese, shrimp, oregano and lemon.

                        Alaska Fisherman's Chowder

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chowder                         Fish (Ocean)
                Seafood                         Shellfish
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  cod or halibut fillet
     3/4         pound  salmon fillet
  1              pound  king or snow crab legs
  1              pound  live hardshell clams
  5                     bacon slices - (to 6) -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1              pound  Russet or baking potatoes -- scrubbed, diced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  frozen corn kernels -- thawed
  3               cups  fish stock or clam juice
  3               cups  half-and-half
  2         tablespoon  mixed chopped fresh herbs -- (optional)

Rinse the cod and salmon with cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Cut the fish into roughly 1 inch cubes.  Break the crab legs into sections and lightly crack them, leaving them intact.  Scrub the clam shells under cold water. 
In a heavy soup pot, fry the bacon pieces, stirring occasionally, until they begin to curl and most of the fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. 
Use a large spoon to remove and discard all but about 1 tablespoon of the fat.  Add the onion, potatoes, salt and pepper to the pan and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and the potatoes are beginning to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. 
Add the fish stock and half-and-half, bring to a boil and simmer 10 minutes.  Add the fish pieces, crab legs, clams and corn and continue simmering until the fish flakes easily, the clams are open and the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes longer.  Discard any clams that do not open. 
If you like, stir in chopped fresh herbs just before serving.  Pass a pepper mill at the table so each guest can top their chowder with freshly ground pepper. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  This is a good base for a wide variety of chowder possibilities, depending on what you like and whats available at your local market.  We began with Alaska regulars salmon, king crab and halibut, then add clams.  You can add any number of favorite fish or shellfish, including snapper, monkfish and shucked oysters, or halve the recipe and use only one or two of the listed fish or shellfish.  The chowder keeps well for a few days in the refrigerator and, like many hearty soups, tastes better on the second day.

                        orange roughy or halibut
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg
     1/4           cup  milk
  1                cup  whole blanched almonds -- finely chopped
  2             quarts  vegetable oil - (or more) -- for frying
                        === HERB SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  reduced-fat mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  reduced-fat sour cream
     1/2           cup  mixed chopped fresh herbs
                        (parsley, chives, tarragon, thyme,
                        chervil)
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the sauce, combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, herbs and lemon juice in a small bowl and stir to mix.  Add salt and pepper to taste, cover and refrigerate until needed.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups) 
Cut the fish fillets crosswise into 1-inch strips.  Put the flour on a plate with salt and pepper and stir to mix.  In a shallow bowl, whisk the egg with the milk and a pinch of salt.  Put the ground almonds in a third shallow dish. 
Heat about 2 inches of oil to 375 degrees in a deep-fryer.  Dust the fish strips with the seasoned flour, turn to thoroughly coat and allow excess to drip off.  Coat the fish with ground almonds, shaking off excess, then put in the hot oil. 
Fry the fish strips, turning once or twice as they cook, until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and keep warm in a low oven while you fry the remainder. 
Arrange the fish fingers on small individual plates with small bowls of sauce alongside. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 
Comments:  Finely ground nuts add texture, flavor and crunch to fried fish.  Hazelnuts can be used in place of the almonds if you like.  A simple dipping sauce with lots of fresh herbs is perfect with this nutty fish, which makes an ideal first course.

              Au Gratin Potatoes With Smoked Salmon And Ale

Recipe By     :Susan Volland
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     onions -- sliced
  3             pounds  waxy potatoes -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  grated Gruyere or sharp cheddar cheese
  2                     tart apples, such as Granny Smith -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  hot-smoked salmon -- diced
  1             bottle  ale - (12 oz)
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley -- for garnish

Seafood Alternatives:  smoked trout 
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet, add the onions and sautÈ until tender and lightly colored, 8 to 10 minutes; set aside.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
Lightly oil a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.  Arrange one-third of the sliced potatoes in the dish and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.  Add one-third of the cheese, one-third of the onions, half of the apples and half of the salmon. 
Repeat with another third of the potatoes, salt and pepper, followed by the remaining salmon and apples and another third of the cheese and onions.  Finish with the remaining potatoes and sprinkle with the last of the cheese and onions. 
Pour in the ale and water along the edges of the pan and bake for 1 hour, until bubbly, brown and tender. 
Sprinkle with the chopped parsley.  Let stand a few minutes, cut and serve warm. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  This is a tasty variation of the classic scalloped potatoes often prepared with ham.  The apples and ale add a nice tang and keep the dish from being too rich.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  white fish fillets abt 3/4" thick
  2          teaspoons  olive oil - (to 3 tspns) -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Lightly butter or oil a baking dish and arrange the fish fillets in it, tucking under thin ends if necessary so the fillets are in an even layer. 
Brush the tops of the fillets with olive oil if you like, then season lightly with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle the basil evenly over the fish, top with mushrooms, pour in the wine and cover the dish with foil. 
Bake in the preheated oven until opaque through the thickest part, 12 to 18 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets. 
Transfer the fish fillets and mushrooms to individual plates and spoon a little of the cooking juices over.  Serve immediately.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fresh spinach - (packed) -- about 2 oz
  1                cup  parsley sprigs - (loosely packed)
  1                     green pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1              bunch  green onions -- trimmed, and
                        cut in 1" pieces
  2                     eggs
     3/4           cup  milk
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  cooked long-grain rice
  1              pound  salmon fillet -- skin, bones removed

Seafood Alternatives:  halibut, shrimp, scallops 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  In a food processor or blender, combine the spinach, parsley, green pepper and green onions and purÈe (if using a blender you may need to purÈe the greens in 2 to 3 batches). 
Lightly beat the eggs in a large bowl, add the purÈe of greens, milk, salt and pepper and stir to mix.  Stir in the rice.  Rinse the salmon, pat dry with paper towels and cut across into 1/2-inch slices. 
Lightly oil or butter a 2-quart baking dish.  Pour in half the rice mixture and top with the salmon slices, evenly layered.  Pour the remaining rice mixture over and bake, uncovered, in the heated oven until firm and lightly browned on top, 35 to 45 minutes; let sit for 10 minutes before serving.  Cut the baked rice into squares or wedges to serve. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 
Comments:  Green rice, a family dish from a few decades back, makes a delicious comeback here.  The brilliant color of the greens dresses up the rice and pairs beautifully with the pink salmon.  Look for bags of pre-washed spinach in your market or at the salad bar.

     1/2      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2              dozen  medium oysters in shell -- (about 3 1/2" long)

Put the bread cubes and mushrooms in a food processor and pulse for a few seconds to combine.  Add the remaining ingredients, except the oysters, and process until the particles are well chopped and pea-like in texture, about 30 seconds.  Set aside.  Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. 
Shuck the oysters, cutting the muscle but leaving the oyster in the deep cupped shell.  Cover each oyster loosely with 1 rounded tablespoon of the breadcrumb-mushroom mixture, coating the entire surface of the oyster. 
Arrange the oysters on a baking sheet and place on the middle shelf of the oven.  (A thin layer of rock salt on the baking sheet will help the oysters to stay upright.) 
Bake until the topping is golden, 6 to 8 minutes.  Watch the time and the oysters carefully -- they can overcook and dry out quickly.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  This simple topping gets its wonderful earthy flavor from mushrooms, herbs and cheese, making it a perfect finish for baked oysters.  Italian- or French-style hearty-textured bread -- preferably a day old -- will produce the desired crumb consistency; avoid soft, airy loaves.

                    Baked Salmon With Coarse Sea Salt

Recipe By     :Betsy Kuhn
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     salmon fillet pieces - (6 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  coarse sea salt

Seafood Alternatives:  swordfish, steelhead, bluefish 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Rinse the fish under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Pour the olive oil into a shallow baking dish and add the fillets, turning to coat evenly in the oil.  Sprinkle the sea salt over the fillets and bake until just opaque at the center, 10 to 12 minutes. 
This recipe yields 2 servings. 
Comments:  Recipes don't come much simpler than this, but do use coarse sea salt!  The big crystals break down only slightly in the oven, leaving a delicate and clean-tasting crunch.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  sea or bay scallops
     1/2         pound  medium mushrooms
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  3        tablespoons  fine dry bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  minced onion
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1              pinch  crushed red pepper flakes -- or more to taste
  1              pinch  salt

Seafood Alternatives:  shrimp 
Rinse the scallops in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Remove the stems from the mushrooms and reserve both the stems and caps.  Brush a shallow (8- to 9-inch diameter) baking dish with 1 tablespoon of olive oil; preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
Toss the scallops with the flour and arrange them with the mushroom caps in a single layer in the dish.  Pour the wine into the dish along the edge.  Finely chop the mushroom stems and mix them with the bread crumbs, onion, parsley, garlic, pepper flakes and salt.  Sprinkle this mixture over the scallops and mushrooms.  Drizzle with the remaining olive oil. 
Bake in the heated oven until the mushrooms are soft and scallops are cooked through, about 30 minutes.  Serve warm, or cover and refrigerate up to 24 hours. 
To reheat, loosely cover with foil and bake for about 45 minutes in a 350 degree oven. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                       Baked Snapper In Salt Crust

Recipe By     :Betsy Kuhn
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  coarse kosher salt
  2               cups  flour
  1 1/4           cups  water - (to 1 1/2 cups)
  1                     snapper - (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- cleaned and scaled

Seafood Alternatives:  rockfish, sea bass, sea bream 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  In a large bowl, mix the salt and flour.  Add the water and stir to form a slightly stiff yet pliable dough. 
Rinse the fish under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Put the fish on a lightly oiled baking sheet.  Scoop out half the dough and pat it over the fish to form a crust about 1/4-inch thick.  Flip the fish over and form a crust on the other side with the remaining dough.  The entire fish should be enveloped in dough, with no cracks or openings.  (You might have dough left over.) 
Bake the fish until the crust begins to turn golden, about 30 minutes.  Slit the crust, peel it away from the fish and discard it.  Lift the fish away from the bones and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This preparation keeps the fish moist and imparts a mouth-watering but subtle flavor of salt.  The crust takes just minutes to prepare.  Be sure to keep the crust fairly thin; a quarter-inch thick is about right.  A too-thick crust will form a gluey layer next to the fish.  You can also use fish fillets but they should be wrapped in lettuce leaves first, so the salt crust doesn't come into direct contact with the flesh.

          Baked Whole Flounder With Asparagus And Mustard Sauce

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     headless cleaned flounder - (abt 2 lbs)
                        or whole flounder with head and tail -- (abt 3 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  yellow cornmeal - (about)
  1 1/4         pounds  fresh asparagus -- steamed
                        Chopped fresh parsley or chives -- for garnish
                        Lemon slices -- for garnish
                        === MUSTARD SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  2          teaspoons  coarse-grained mustard
  1           teaspoon  honey

For the mustard sauce, combine all the ingredients and stir to mix well.  Refrigerate until needed. 
Rinse fish with cold water and pat dry; set aside.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
Oil the white side of the fish with a little more than half the oil.  Be sure to oil the fins and tail.  Lay fish, oiled-side down, on a rimmed baking sheet.  Brush remaining oil over top side of fish.  Sprinkle fish with salt, pepper, and cornmeal. 
Bake, uncovered, until fish is opaque and flakes when tested with a fork along backbone, 30 to 40 minutes.  While fish is baking, cook asparagus. 
Bone fish in pan, or lift fish from pan with 2 large spatulas and set on a carving board to bone.  To bone at the table, transfer fish to a large serving platter, surround with asparagus and serve Mustard Sauce on the side.  Garnish with chopped parsley and lemon slices. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This showpiece entree is ideal for an elegant dinner party -- but easy enough to make for a special family dinner.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  Chilean sea bass fillet - (to 1 1/2 lbs) -- bones removed,
                        cut into serving pieces
     3/4           cup  orange juice
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  vinegar
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar or honey
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
  1           teaspoon  ginger ground
     1/2      teaspoon  dried hot red pepper flakes

Rinse the Chilean sea bass with cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Set the fish in a shallow dish.  Stir together the remaining ingredients in a small bowl until well combined, then pour over the fish, turning the fish so that it is evenly coated.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 hours. 
Preheat a charcoal grill or the broiler.  Grill or broil the fish about 4 inches from the heat until well browned on one side, 3 to 5 minutes; brush with more marinade and cook on the other side until the fish is no longer opaque in the center, about 5 minutes longer. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  If cooking the Chilean sea bass on a charcoal grill, be sure that the fillet pieces are at least 1 1/2 inches thick to ensure that the fish won't fall apart when it is cooked.

               Barbecued Salmon Burgers On Lemon Dill Buns

Recipe By     :Kathy Casey
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Sandwiches                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless skinless salmon fillet -- well-chopped
  2        tablespoons  bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  minced onion
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  minced or pressed garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt or to taste
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
                        Lemon Sour Cream Butter -- (see recipe)
  4                     Lemon Dill Buns -- (see recipe)
                        (or use quality store-bought buns)
                        Mayonnaise or homemade tartar sauce
                        Summer Slaw -- (see recipe)

To make the burger mixture, thoroughly combine the burger ingredients in a medium bowl.  Divide into 4 portions, shape into patties 1/2-inch thick and 4 inches in diameter. 
Heat the barbecue grill until the coals glow red with white ash around the edge.  The salmon patties are fragile, so handle them carefully; if you chill the patties on a plate in the refrigerator before putting them on the grill, they will hold together better. 
When the barbecue is heated, put the salmon patties on the grill at least 2 inches apart.  Grill until the first side is nicely marked, about 2 minutes, then turn and baste with Lemon Sour Cream Butter.  Continue cooking until the burgers are just cooked through, about 2 minutes longer. 
Split the buns and, if desired, butter lightly with Lemon Sour Cream Butter and toast them on the grill.  Spread the buns with mayonnaise or tartar sauce if using, add the burgers and pile high with Summer Slaw. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  "Let's do burgers tonight" will take on a whole new meaning once you try these delicious burgers-from-the-sea.  Homemade lemon dill buns give the burgers spectacular flavor, but good quality store bought buns can be used as a time-saver.  Barbecuing over fruity woods such as apple, cherry, or pear chips and trimmings adds delicate flavor.  You can ask your fishmonger to skin the salmon for you, and remove the bones.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4              large  tomatoes - (2 lbs) -- peeled, chopped
  1                     onion -- minced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  molasses or dark brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  minced or grated ginger
  1           teaspoon  Tabasco sauce or dried red pepper flakes
     1/3           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  2             pounds  skinless skate wing -- cut 4 serving
                        portions

Heat the oil in a large skillet, add the tomatoes, onion and garlic and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are transluscent, about 5 minutes.  Add the molasses, Worcestershire sauce, ginger, Tabasco sauce, lower the heat to medium and cook uncovered until the vegetables are thoroughly softened and the sauce is thick, 30 to 40 minutes.  Take from the heat, stir in the lemon juice and let cool. 
Just before serving, cut away any membrane from the skate wings.  Preheat the grill or broiler.  Brush the skate wings on both sides with some of the cooled barbecue sauce and let sit while the grill heats. 
Lightly oil the grill top and add the skate wings.  Cook until the fish is nicely browned and somewhat firm, 3 to 4 minutes.  Brush the top with some more barbecue sauce, turn the fish and continue cooking until the fish is opaque through, about 4 minutes longer. 
Transfer the skate to individual plates, brush with more sauce and serve, passing extra sauce alongside. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The tender meat of skate clinging to the strip of cartilage is reminiscent of pork ribs.  You'll be surprised how tasty this combination is. 
When fresh, ripe tomatoes are available, they are preferable here, but canned tomatoes are a fine alternative.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     halibut fillet pieces - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  Japanese-style (panko) dry breadcrumbs
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaves
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  fresh ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === POTATOES ===
  4              large  Yukon gold potatoes (abt 2 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" dice
  6             ounces  brie with rind -- cut in 1/2" cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === VINAIGERTTE ===
  2               cups  loosely-packed fresh mint leaves
  1                cup  fish stock or clam nectar
     1/4           cup  almonds -- sliced and toasted
  1                     jalapeÒo chile -- roasted, peeled,

(The sauce should have the consistency of heavy cream; adjust the consistency with water if necessary.)  This may be made ahead and refrigerated until just before serving. 
Combine the breadcrumbs, thyme, garlic, black pepper and lemon zest in a small bowl; season lightly with salt.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add the canola oil.  Season the halibut pieces with salt and pepper.  When the oil just begins to smoke, add the halibut pieces and sear to a golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. 
Transfer the halibut to a pie tin or baking dish, seared-side up.  Drizzle with the white wine and sprinkle liberally with the seasoned breadcrumb mixture.  Bake in the oven unitl the crust is browned and the fish reaches the desired doneness, 5 to 7 minutes. 
Drizzle some of the mint sauce on individual plates and top with the halibut.  Spoon the brie mashed potatoes alongside, and garnish with fresh mint and lime. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Japanese style (or panko) breadcrumbs have a coarser texture and more crunch than regular breadcrumbs; they are available in Asian markets or the specialty section of some grocery stores.  Fine breadcrumbs make a heavier crust; or make fresh breadcrumbs in a processor (lightly toast first).

               Braised Salmon Steaks With Fennel And Thyme

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon steaks, 1" thick - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  1              large  or 2 small fennel bulbs - (abt 1 lb total)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
                        (or 2 tspns dried thyme)
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  white wine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Thyme sprigs -- for garnish

Rinse the salmon in cold water, pat dry with paper towels.  Trim the base and stalks from the fennel bulb. 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Heat the vegetable oil in a medium frying pan.  Add the sliced fennel and sautÈ over medium heat until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the chopped thyme, white wine, salt and pepper and cook for another minute. 
Transfer the fennel mixture to a lightly buttered baking dish, arrange the salmon steaks on top and season them with salt and pepper.  Top each steak with a sprig of thyme, cover the dish with lightly buttered foil and bake in the heated oven until the fish is just barely opaque through, 10 to 12 minutes. 
Transfer the salmon and fennel to warmed plates, spoon cooking juices over and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The subtle anise flavor of fresh fennel bulb is a delicious compliment to rich salmon steaks.  If fennel bulb is not available, leeks, cabbage, or endive can be used in its place.  Braising is an adaptable technique which retains all of the flavors and moisture of the fish as it cooks.

               Braised Scallops With Grapefruit And Walnuts

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     pink grapefruit
  1              pound  sea scallops
     1/2           cup  flour -- seasoned with
                        Salt -- to taste, and
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  walnut oil or olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped walnuts
  2        tablespoons  minced chives or green onion -- for garnish

Cut both ends from one of the grapefruits just to the flesh.  Set it upright on the chopping board and use the knife to cut away the peel and skin, following the curve of the fruit.  Holding the peeled grapefruit in your hand, slide the knife blade down one side of a section, cutting it from the membrane.  Cut down the other side of the section and remove it.  (Work over a bowl to catch the sections and juice.)  Continue for the remaining sections, turning back flaps of membrane like the pages of a book.  Squeeze the juice from the second grapefruit and combine it with any juice from the first.  Alternatively, you can seed and section a hand-peeled grapefruit, but the membranes will be tough and the pith bitter. 
Lightly coat the scallops in seasoned flour, patting to remove the excess.  Heat the oil in a medium skillet, preferably nonstick.  When the oil is very hot, add the scallops and cook over medium heat until browned, about 1 minute per side.  Transfer the scallops to a plate and set aside. 
Add the grapefruit juice to the skillet and bring to a boil.  Stir in the walnuts, then add the scallops and grapefruit sections to the pan and simmer gently until the scallops are cooked to taste, 2 to 3 minutes. 
Arrange the scallops, grapefruit and sauce on individual plates, sprinkle with chives and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The combination of tangy grapefruit and rich walnuts is a surprisingly tasty one.  This recipe is particularly suited for large sea scallops, but smaller bay scallops can be used as well.  You could also use orange segments and juice in place of some or all of the grapefruit.

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  bell pepper -- roasted
  2                     garlic cloves
  2        tablespoons  low-fat or regular mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  grated mizithra, Parmesan or Romano
                        cheese, or crumbled feta cheese
  1           teaspoon  red or white wine vinegar or lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  cod fillet -- cut serving pieces

Seafood Alternatives:  halibut, sea bass, tuna, swordfish, salmon 
Put the red pepper, garlic, mayonnaise, cheese and vinegar in a blender or food processor and process until well blended.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  The red pepper sauce will keep in a tightly sealed jar for several weeks in the refrigerator.  (Makes about 1/2 cup) 
Rinse the fish in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Lay the fish on a lightly oiled broiler pan or a shallow rimmed baking pan.  Brush generously with the rouille (red pepper sauce), about 1/4 cup. 
Adjust the oven rack so the top of fish is 1 to 1 1/2 inches from the broiler element.  Broil 6 minutes per inch of thickness (4 to 5 minutes for fish 3/4 inch thick).  Turn off the heat and let fish stand in oven until opaque in center of thickest part, 3 minutes or up to 10 minutes more.  Close the oven door after 4 to 5 minutes to hold heat in. 
Serve fish with additional sauce if you wish. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Rouille, a rich roasted red pepper and garlic sauce, is traditionally spooned into French fish soup to add an earthy, robust flavor.  Here we modify and simplify the original recipe to brush over fish before broiling.

In a large shallow dish, combine the mirin, soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger and pepper flakes.  Dip both sides of the pineapple wedges in the soy mixture and set aside. 
Add the fillet pieces to the remaining soy mixture and turn to coat.  Let stand 5 to 15 minutes.  Preheat the broiler. 
Put the fish and pineapple on a broiler pan coated with cooking spray or lightly oiled.  Broil 4 to 5 inches from the heat source until the fish is just opaque through the thickest part, 6 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish. 
Turn the pineapple spears about halfway through cooking.  Fish that is more than 1 inch thick should be turned also.  Serve the fish fillets with a pineapple wedge alongside. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  If time is short, choose a peeled and cored pineapple from your produce department.  For a more leisurely meal, grill these teriyaki-style fillets outside.

              Broiled Halibut Steaks With Cranberry Compote

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     halibut steaks, 1" thick - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1                bag  fresh cranberries - (12 oz)
  1                     ripe but firm pear -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
  3        tablespoons  sugar -- or more to taste
     1/4           cup  water
  1              pinch  ground cloves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  walnut pieces -- coarsely chopped

Rinse the halibut steaks in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. 
In a medium saucepan, heat the vegetable oil.  Add the onion and cook over moderately-high heat until the onions are soft and very lightly browned, about 5 minutes. 
Add the cranberries, pear, sugar and water and stir to mix.  Heat the berries over moderate heat, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 15 minutes; do not boil or the berries will cook to a purÈe. 
Stir in the cloves, salt and pepper and taste the compote for seasoning, adding more sugar if the cranberries are especially tart. 
Preheat the broiler, set the oven rack about 4 inches from the heat and lightly oil the broiler pan rack.  Season each side of the halibut steaks with salt and pepper and set the steaks on the broiler rack.  Broil the halibut for 3 to 4 minutes, turn the steaks and broil on the other side until the fish is just opaque through, 4 to 5 minutes longer.  Meanwhile, reheat the compote and stir in the walnut pieces. 
Transfer the halibut steaks to individual dinner plates, spoon the cranberry compote partly over and alongside the halibut and serve immediately.  Garnish with pear wedges or chopped walnuts if you like. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  During the summer months when fresh berries and fresh halibut are available, try using blackberries or blueberries in place of the cranberries, adding sugar only if necessary.  Boiled or steamed red new potatoes are an ideal accompaniment.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     halibut steaks - (6 to 8 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  reduced-salt soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4           cup  dry sherry
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onion
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- pressed or minced

Seafood Alternatives:  salmon, tuna 
Rinse the halibut briefly with cold water; pat dry with paper towels. 
Combine all the remaining ingredients in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer on low for 5 minutes.  Strain and chill. 
Place the halibut steaks in a shallow non-aluminum pan and cover with the marinade.  Refrigerate for 15 minutes. 
Remove the steaks from the marinade and drain.  Place the steaks on an oiled broiler pan 4 to 5 inches from heat and cook 8 to 10 minutes per inch of thickness, turning halfway through cooking time.  Garnish with additional green onion and roasted sesame seeds (optional). 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The mild flavor of halibut is a natural for teriyaki's garlic, soy and sesame flavor.

            Browned Garlic Butter Linguine With Calamari Rings

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
  6              large  garlic cloves - (to 8) -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  6             ounces  cleaned calamari - (to 8 oz) -- tentacles optional
                        (or 3/4 to 1 lb whole calamari, cleaned)
  12            ounces  dry linguine or fettuccine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley and/or chives
     1/4           cup  grated Romano cheese - (to 1/2 cup)

Seafood Alternatives:  shrimp, clams, crabmeat, lobster meat 
Cut the butter into 4 pieces and melt it in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.  When the butter bubbles, skim the foam from the top and discard.  Add the garlic and simmer gently over medium-low to low heat until the milk solids on bottom of the pan are golden, about 20 minutes.  Scoop the garlic into a small dish, leaving most of the butter in the pan; set both aside.  (The garlic and butter can be made to this point then refrigerated up to several days.) 
Cut the calamari tubes into 1-inch lengths.  For an optional finish, use a sharp knife or scissors to make cuts 1/8-inch apart along both open sides of the tubes, cutting almost to the center. 
Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in large pan.  Add the pasta with 1 teaspoon salt, if desired, and boil uncovered until tender, about 10 minutes. 
While the pasta is cooking, reheat the clarified butter in a medium skillet.  Add the calamari tentacles, if using, and cook over medium-high heat for 1 minute.  Add the calamari rings and continue cooking until both are just opaque and still tender, 1 to 2 minutes longer.  Stir in the garlic and take from the heat. 
Drain the pasta well and put it in a large serving bowl.  Set 1 tablespoon of the parsley aside.  Add the remaining parsley, calamari, garlic and butter to the pasta and toss to coat well.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Divide the pasta and calamari among 4 plates.  Sprinkle with the cheese and remaining parsley and serve right away. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The rich, mellow flavor of tender golden-roasted garlic, usually baked in the oven, is easily and quickly achieved by slowly cooking it in butter.  Any shellfish that you love to dip in butter is a perfect choice for this simple dish.  Serve with Caesar salad or tender greens dressed with a fruit vinaigrette.

             Buffalo Shrimp With Pasta And Blue Cheese Sauce

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  dry fettuccine or papardelle pasta
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     3/4         pound  medium shrimp -- peeled and deveined
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
  1         tablespoon  Tabasco sauce -- or to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives or parsley
                        === BLUE CHEESE SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onions
  2           teaspoon  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1                cup  half-and-half
  4             ounces  crumbled blue cheese - (abt 1 cup)

Seafood Alternatives:  scallops, salmon strips 
To make the blue cheese sauce, combine the onion, oil, garlic and sugar in a medium saucepan.  Cook, stirring, over medium heat until the onion is tender and golden, 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the blue cheese until nearly melted.  Cover to keep warm and set aside. 
Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil in a large pan over high heat.  Stir in the pasta and boil uncovered until tender, 8 to 12 minutes. 
While the pasta cooks, prepare the shrimp.  Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat.  Add the shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until nearly pink, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Stir in the garlic, butter, and Tabasco and cook until the shrimp is just opaque in the center, about 1 1/2 minutes longer.  Take from the heat and stir in the paprika; set aside. 
Drain the pasta well and put it in a large bowl.  Stir in the warm blue cheese sauce.  Gently mix in 2 tablespoons of the chives.  Spoon the pasta onto individual plates and sprinkle with remaining chives.  Top with the shrimp and sauce and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Here's a new twist on the ever popular Buffalo wings -- fiery hot chicken wings served with blue cheese dip and celery sticks.  Buttery and spicy stir-fried shrimp bask on a bed of pasta tossed in blue cheese sauce.  A touch of sugar in the sauce cuts the tanginess of the blue cheese, but you can omit it if you like. 
This flavorful dish would be perfectly paired with a large platter of fresh fruit or clusters of grapes to cut the heat.  A crisp fruity wine will do nicely, too.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  canola oil
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1                     red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped
  3                     celery stalks -- sliced
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1                cup  long-grain white rice
  2               cups  reduced-salt chicken broth or water
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  Tabasco sauce -- or to taste
  1              pound  catfish fillet

Seafood Alternatives:  shrimp, halibut, salmon 
In a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, bell peppers, celery and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and beginning to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. 
Add the rice and cook, stirring, until evenly coated with oil, 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the broth, Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco, bring to a boil, cover and cook over low heat for 5 minutes. 
Meanwhile, rinse the catfish and pat dry.  With a sharp knife, trim the white or grayish fat from the skin side and edges of each fillet.  Cut the catfish into 1-inch strips. 
Lay the catfish strips over the rice, cover and continue cooking until the rice is tender to the bite and the catfish is opaque through, 15 to 20 minutes longer. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 
Comments:  The spunky flavors of Cajun cuisine really wake up the taste buds!

                           Calypso Oyster Stew

Recipe By     :Kathy Casey
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  jarred or freshly shucked extra-small
                        or small oysters with their liquor
     1/2           cup  clam juice or chicken stock -- (to 3/4 cup)
  2             slices  raw bacon -- minced
  1                cup  common or wild mushrooms, such as button
                        mushrooms or chanterelles -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  diced onion
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced celery
     1/2           cup  small-diced carrot
     1/2           cup  diced red bell pepper
     1/2           cup  dry or medium-dry sherry
     1/2      teaspoon  dry thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce - (to 1/2 tspn)
  1                cup  cooked red potatoes in large dice,
                        or quartered
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1 1/4           cups  half-and-half
     3/4      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

Drain the oysters, reserving the liquor, and set aside.  Measure the oyster liquor and add the clam juice or chicken stock to make 3/4 cup total.  Set aside. 
In a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, sautÈ the bacon over medium-high heat until about half cooked, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the mushrooms, onion, celery, carrot and red pepper and reduce the heat to medium.  SautÈ the vegetable mixture about 4 minutes, stirring often. 
Stir in the sherry and thyme, followed by the oyster liquor mixture, Tabasco and potatoes.  Raise the heat and bring to a boil and simmer until the potatoes are nearly tender, about 5 minutes. 
Stir the cornstarch into the half-and-half and whisk this mixture into the gently boiling stew.  Add the oysters immediately.  Heat just until the oysters get plump and their edges are ruffled, 1 to 2 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Spoon into serving bowls and sprinkle with chopped parsley.  Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  A centuries-old favorite recipe for oysters is the oyster stew; fresh oysters simply simmered in heavy cream, topped with a pat of butter and a sprinkle of parsley.  Also delicious and decadent, but a little less rich, this oyster stew is chock-full of colorful fresh vegetables and red potatoes, making for a meal in itself.

                   Catfish Oyster And Black Bean Gumbo

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood
                Shellfish                       Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  finely-diced red pepper
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped celery
  1 1/2           cups  minced shallots
  3        tablespoons  minced or pressed garlic
  20                    fresh okra -- cut 1/2" coins
  2            bottles  beer - (12 oz ea)
  1                cup  clam juice or chicken broth -- fat skimmed
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes - (to 1 tspn)
                        (or Tabasco sauce, to taste)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  minced parsley
     1/2           cup  tomato paste
  3               cups  cooked black beans - (2 15-oz cans) -- drained, rinsed
                        (or 10 oz black beans, cooked)
  1              pound  catfish fillets -- cut into 3/4" pieces
  1              pound  small shrimp -- shelled, deveined
                        (or 1/2 lb rock shrimp)
     1/2         pound  shucked oysters -- drained, liquid
                        reserved if desired
  3               cups  warm cooked rice - (to 4 cups)

Seafood Alternatives:  grouper, snapper, crawfish, squid, flounder, orange roughy 
In a heavy 5-quart pot, heat the oil over medium heat until hot.  Add the red pepper, celery, shallots and garlic and sautÈ until partly softened, 5 minutes, stirring.  Add the okra and sautÈ until tender, 5 minutes, stirring.  Don't worry if the mixture sticks or browns; the caramelized bits will add flavor to the gumbo. 
Stir in the beer, clam juice, Worcestershire sauce, oyster liquid (if using), oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper and parsley.  Whisk in the tomato paste until well-blended.  Add the black beans and simmer uncovered over medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring. 
Stir in the catfish and simmer 1 minute; stir in the shrimp and oysters and simmer until opaque, 1 to 2 minutes.  Do not overcook, because when taken from the heat, the seafood will continue to cook in the hot soup. 
Spoon the rice into individual soup bowls and ladle the gumbo on top. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  Although the ingredient list is long, this robust gumbo is easy to assemble.  Plus, its great made a day in advance.  Just before serving, heat the soup and stir in the seafood to cook.  If okra is not your favorite vegetable, steamed green beans work well in their place.  Traditional gumbo recipes will call for a roux, but not for this one, making this recipe easier, quicker and less caloric a gumbo than many.

In a heavy 5-quart pot, heat the oil over medium heat until hot.  Add the red pepper, celery, shallots and garlic and sautÈ until partly softened, 5 minutes, stirring.  Add the okra and sautÈ until tender, 5 minutes, stirring.  Don&apos;t worry if the mixture sticks or browns; the caramelized bits will add flavor to the gumbo. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir in the beer, clam juice, Worcestershire sauce, oyster liquid (if using), oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper and parsley.  Whisk in the tomato paste until well-blended.  Add the black beans and simmer uncovered over medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir in the catfish and simmer 1 minute; stir in the shrimp and oysters and simmer until opaque, 1 to 2 minutes.  Do not overcook, because when taken from the heat, the seafood will continue to cook in the hot soup. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon the rice into individual soup bowls and ladle the gumbo on top. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Although the ingredient list is long, this robust gumbo is easy to assemble.  Plus, its great made a day in advance.  Just before serving, heat the soup and stir in the seafood to cook.  If okra is not your favorite vegetable, steamed green beans work well in their place.  Traditional gumbo recipes will call for a roux, but not for this one, making this recipe easier, quicker and less caloric a gumbo than many.

      Centerpiece Salmon Salad With Tarragon Honey Mustard Dressing

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Salads/Dressings                Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3         pounds  salmon fillet -- cut in 4 pieces
  2             quarts  mixed salad greens -- washed and torn
                        (a combo of romaine, red leaf, butter
                        lettuce, escarole or watercress)
  12                    asparagus stalks -- cooked and chilled
                        === TARRAGON HONEY-MUSTARD DRESSING ===
  1                     garlic clove -- minced or pressed
     1/4           cup  olive oil, preferably virgin olive oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  Dijon-style mustard
  1           teaspoon  honey
     3/4      teaspoon  dried tarragon leaves
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste

Seafood Alternatives:  trout, halibut, scallops, monkfish 
For the dressing:  Combine all the ingredients, except the salt, in a small bowl and whisk until blended (or shake the ingredients in a jar).  Add salt to taste.  Let stand 30 minutes or overnight to blend flavors. 
Rinse the fish in cold water.  Measure the thickness of the fish and pour water into a deep skillet or sautÈ pan to measure twice that thickness.  Bring the water to a boil, add the salmon, cover the pan and remove it from the heat.  Let stand until the fish is opaque but still moist and shiny in the center of the thickest area, about 10 minutes for a fillet 1-inch thick; up to 20 minutes the fish will remain piping hot without over-cooking. 
Meanwhile toss the salad greens with two-thirds of the dressing.  Arrange the greens on individual plates.  Add the asparagus around the edge. 
Lift the fish from pan and drain well.  Arrange the salmon on top of the greens.  Drizzle the salmon pieces equally with remaining dressing and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Steeped salmon retains its soft blush color.  Serve it hot, tepid or chilled, nestled in a bed of tender salad greens.  As an alternative, the salmon could be cooked in a whole fillet and served on a large platter of colorful greens for a stunning presentation.

                          Cheesy Crab Turnovers

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  crabmeat
     3/4           cup  ricotta cheese, preferably reduced-fat
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped green onion
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon zest
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1            package  frozen puff pastry - (1 lb) -- thawed
  1                     egg white
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds

In a medium bowl, combine the crabmeat, ricotta, Parmesan, green onion, lemon juice, lemon zest and pepper.  (Keep in mind that the cheese and crabmeat are salty, so salt may not be needed.)  Stir to mix well and taste for seasoning.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
Roll out half of the thawed puff pastry dough to a 12-inch square.  Using a knife, cut the dough into four 6-inch squares or nine 4-inch squares.  Spoon crab filling in the center of one dough square (about 2 1/2 tablespoons for large squares, 2 teaspoons for small squares). 
With a small pastry brush, lightly brush 2 edges of the square with water.  Fold one corner of dough over the filling to the opposite corner, forming a triangle.  Using the tines of a fork, press down around the edges of the dough to seal.  Set the turnover on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough and filling. 
In a small bowl, combine the egg white with a large pinch of salt and whisk with a fork.  Lightly brush the top of each turnover with some of the egg white and sprinkle with the sesame seeds. 
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and nicely browned, 12 to 15 minutes for small turnovers, 18 to 20 minutes for large turnovers.  Let cool slightly before serving. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  These small individual pies pair delicate crabmeat with ricotta cheese and lemon, great for a party or just for a family treat!  The turnovers can be prepared small -- for bite-sized pastries -- or larger for knife-and-fork eating. 
Frozen puff pastry is widely available in supermarkets and is a great short cut in the kitchen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  Chilean sea bass fillet - (to 1 1/2 lbs) -- bones removed,
                        cut in serving pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  flour -- more if needed
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  onion -- minced
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- minced or pressed
  1 1/2         pounds  tomatoes -- chopped
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  dried rosemary -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  coriander seeds or ground coriander -- (optional)

Rinse the Chilean sea bass with cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Lightly season the fish with salt and pepper, then coat with flour, shaking off the excess.  Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, add the fish pieces and cook just until lightly browned, about 1 minute on each side.  Transfer to a plate and set aside. 
Add the onion and garlic to the skillet and cook, stirring, until beginning to soften, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, lemon juice, bay leaves, rosemary, oregano, coriander, salt and pepper and cook over high heat, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes. 
Add the fish pieces and press them gently into the tomato mixture, cover the skillet and cook over medium heat until the fish is no longer opaque in the center, 8 to 10 minutes.  Discard the bay leaves, transfer the fish and tomato mixture to warmed dinner plates and serve with rice or pasta. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Add the onion and garlic to the skillet and cook, stirring, until beginning to soften, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, lemon juice, bay leaves, rosemary, oregano, coriander, salt and pepper and cook over high heat, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the fish pieces and press them gently into the tomato mixture, cover the skillet and cook over medium heat until the fish is no longer opaque in the center, 8 to 10 minutes.  Discard the bay leaves, transfer the fish and tomato mixture to warmed dinner plates and serve with rice or pasta.

                   Chiles JalapeÒos Rellenos De Minilla

Recipe By     :Chef Ricardo MuÒoz
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  30             large  fresh jalapeÒo chiles -- cored, deribbed
     1/4           cup  white vinegar
  2        tablespoons  salt
  4               cups  piloncillo or dark brown sugar
                        === MINILLA ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil virgin
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped garlic
  1              pound  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely chopped
  3               cans  water-packed tuna fish - (6 oz ea) -- thoroughly drained
  1         tablespoon  piloncillo or dark brown sugar
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2           cup  dark raisins
  3        tablespoons  chopped green olives
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped capers
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
                        Salt -- to taste

The seeded core and white "ribs" inside jalapeÒo chiles hold most, but not all, of the chile's heat.  Removing them before cooking helps to temper the heat.  Use a small knife to make a slice across the stem end of the chile about two-thirds of the way through.  Slit the chile from the top to the tip.  Gently spread the chile open and cut out the core and ribs with the tip of the knife. 
For the stuffing (minilla), heat the olive oil in a large skillet, add the onion and garlic and cook over medium heat until transluscent, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the tomato and continue cooking until the mixture is thick and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 15 minutes. 
Stir in the tuna, sugar and bay leaves and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring.  Add the raisins, olives, parsley, capers and oregano.  Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring, until the mixture is well blended, about 5 minutes.  Taste for seasoning, adding salt to taste; let cool. 
While the stuffing is cooling, prepare the jalapeÒo chiles.  Put the jalapeÒos, vinegar and salt in a large pot and add enough water to cover the chiles.  Bring to a boil, then drain the chiles and rinse under cold water. 
Return the chiles to the pot and add 2 cups of the sugar with fresh water to cover.  Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Boil for 3 minutes, drain the chiles and rinse under cold water.  Repeat, using the remaining sugar.  Drain the chiles well and thoroughly dry with paper towels. 
Discard the bay leaves from the stuffing.  Using a small spoon, generously fill each jalapeÒo with the stuffing and arrange them on a platter.  Serve at room temperature. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  This recipe has a most surprising combination of ingredients -- jalapeÒos, tuna, raisins and capers among them -- but the result is wonderful flavor.  The chiles are first simmered in water three times to cook them and moderate their fire before they're stuffed with the savory tuna filling. 
Piloncillo is off-white in color and less refined than regular sugar.  Many Latin American markets carry piloncillo (sometimes called panela), but dark brown sugar can be used instead. 
Choose large jalapeÒo chiles, about 3 inches long; they'll be easier to core and stuff.

                Chilled Beet And Orange Soup With Scallops

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             ounces  sea scallops
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  1                can  whole beets - (16 oz)
  1                cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  1                cup  thinly-sliced radishes
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced
  2        tablespoons  minced chives or parsley
  2          teaspoons  grated or minced orange zest
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Thinly-sliced orange and jalapeÒo -- for garnish

Seafood Alternatives:  crabmeat, shrimp, halibut, sea bass 
Rinse the scallops in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Cut them crosswise into thin slices, about 1/4-inch thick.  Combine 1 cup water with the lime juice in a small pan and bring to a boil. Add the scallops and simmer, uncovered, just until opaque through, 1 to 2 minutes.  Drain, discarding the liquid, and chill until ready to serve. 
Drain the beets, reserving the liquid.  Grate the beets and put them in a large bowl with the beet liquid, orange juice, radishes, jalapeÒos, chives, orange zest, salt and pepper.  Cover and chill for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend and set. 
Ladle the soup into shallow soup bowls, top with the scallops and garnish with orange and jalapeÒo slices. 
This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings. 
Comments:  Peppery radishes and hot jalapeÒo pepper pair splendidly with the sweetness of scallops and beets.  The scallops are poached in water and lime juice, then chilled before being added to the soup, but grill them instead if you prefer.

                      Chilled Garden Soup With Crab

                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  regular or spicy tomato juice -- preferably unsalted
  1                ear  fresh tender corn -- husk and silk
                        removed
  2             pounds  very ripe tomatoes -- cored, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1              small  red onion -- coarsely chopped
  1              large  cucumber -- halved, seeded,
                        and coarsely chopped
  1              large  green or red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        coarsely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  flat-leaf parsley leaves -- (loosely packed)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Tabasco sauce -- to taste (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  crabmeat

Seafood Alternatives:  surimi crab, cooked shrimp 
Pour about 1 1/2 cups of the tomato juice into an ice cube tray and freeze until solid.  Trim the stem end of the corn ear and set the ear upright on the chopping board.  Use a sharp knife to cut away a few rows of the kernels at a time, turning the ear until you have cut away all of the kernels.  Put the corn in a small bowl and set aside. 
Put about half the tomatoes, onion, cucumber and bell pepper in the work bowl of a food processor and work the vegetables until finely chopped.  Do not thoroughly purÈe them, as you want to keep some texture and crunch. 
Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and process the remaining vegetables with the garlic, parsley and olive oil.  Stir this mixture into the bowl along with the remaining tomato juice.  You can also prepare the soup in a blender, chopping the vegetables in 4 to 5 batches. 
Season the soup to taste with Tabasco, salt and pepper and chill until ready to serve.  Ladle the soup into soup bowls and sprinkle with the corn kernels.  Arrange the crab decoratively over the soup and add the tomato juice ice cubes.  You may also want to pass the Tabasco separately for those who prefer extra-spicy flavors. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This soup was made with summer in mind; the same sun that draws us all outdoors also ripens the tomatoes, bell peppers, corn and other vegetables that add body and flavor to the soup.  It is similar to gazpacho, a traditional cold Spanish soup.  A handful of sweet crabmeat is the perfect foil for the zesty, fresh flavors of the vegetables.  Any leftover grilled seafood from the night before would be delicious in this recipe: salmon, shrimp, lobster, sea bass, halibut or tuna.

     3/4           cup  minced cilantro
  3                     green onions -- minced
  1                     serrano chile - (to 2) -- seeded and minced
  1         tablespoon  orange juice
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated orange zest
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream, yogurt, cilantro, green onions, chiles, orange juice, orange zest, salt and pepper.  Let the sauce stand one hour; taste and adjust seasonings.  Serve alongside "Sauteed Shrimp And Artichkes." 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  Fresh cilantro lends a zesty tang to this creamy sauce.  If cilantro is difficult to find, use any of your favorite herbs such as dill, tarragon, basil or parsley -- or stir in a bit of pesto -- its great!  Make a day or two in advance, allowing the flavors to blend and mellow.

                      Citrus Splash For Raw Oysters

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pink grapefruit
  1                     tangerine
  1              small  shallot -- minced
  1         tablespoon  champagne or white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  minced chives
     1/4      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes

With a sharp knife, peel the grapefruit and tangerine just deep enough to expose the fruit, removing all the white pulp.  Section the citrus fruits over a bowl to catch the juices, then finely chop the fruit sections.  Add the fruit to the bowl with the juice, add the remaining ingredients and stir to mix. 
This recipe yields 1 cup. 
Comments:  Sweet and tart bits of winter citrus are a terrific contrast to the briny oysters.  This is one of three splashes suggested for a party in the recipe for "Oysters On The Half Shell With A Trio Of Splashes."

                           Citrus Striped Bass

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  orange
  2                     limes
  1                     lemon
  2         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1        large bunch  mint -- rinsed and dried
  1              whole  striped bass - (abt 2 lbs) -- cleaned

Seafood Alternatives:  bluefish, tilapia, rockfish 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Peel strips of zest from the orange, limes and lemon; you will need about 1/2 cup loosely packed in all.  Squeeze the juice from the fruit and put 1/2 cup of it in a small bowl with the olive oil.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and stir to mix well. 
Cut a large piece of heavy-duty foil at least 12 inches longer than the fish.  Lay about half of the mint sprigs in the center of the foil and scatter half of the mixed citrus zests over. 
Thoroughly rinse the fish inside and out and pat dry with paper towels.  Strip the remaining mint leaves from the stems and stuff them into the cavity of the fish.  Lay the fish on the bed of mint, drizzle the juice mixture over and scatter the remaining zest on top. 
Draw up the edges of the foil to thoroughly wrap the fish, carefully sealing the edges so juices don't escape.  Set the package on a baking sheet and bake until opaque through the thickest part, about 30 minutes.  Carefully open the top of the package, allowing steam to escape. 
Set the package, as is, on a serving platter, or carefully lift the fish from the mint bed and place it alone on a platter.  Drizzle some of the cooking juices over individual servings. 
This recipe yields 2 servings. 
Comments:  Hybrid striped bass are among the fish that have taken very successfully to farming.  They are tasty, versatile fish and, when farmed, are generally consistent in size and in availability. 
The citrus zests are used to infuse flavor into the fish as it cooks on a bed of mint.  Using a zester is preferable, leaving the peel in long strips; grating would leave the zest too fine.  If you don't have a zester, cut strips of zest from the fruit with a peeler, then finely julienne the strips.

                         Clam Linguine Primavera

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  small hardshell clams -- (1 1/2" to 3" across)
     3/4         pound  fresh asparagus
  1         tablespoon  olive oil or butter
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
     1/4           cup  minced green onion
     1/4           cup  dry white wine or clam juice
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  8             ounces  dry linguine or 12 oz fresh -- cooked, drained
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese

Seafood Alternatives:  canned clams, live mussels 
Scrub the clams well, then let stand, covered with salted water, while preparing other ingredients.  Discard any that are not tightly closed or that do not close when pressed. 
Slice the asparagus diagonally into 1/4-inch-thick slices, leaving the tips whole.  Heat the oil in a 4- to 5-quart pan over medium heat.  Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Drain the clams well and add them to the pan with the asparagus, green onion, wine and oregano. 
Increase the heat to high, cover and simmer until clams open, 6 to 12 minutes.  As the clams open, transfer them to a bowl and cover to keep warm.  You can take the clams out of their shells if you like, leaving a few in their shells for garnish.  Discard any clams that do not open. 
Add the pasta and cheese to the pan and toss to coat with sauce.  Pour into a serving bowl and garnish with clams. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Pasta is embraced by cooks searching for easy complete meals because of its knack for combining well with practically any other food.  In this version, calms and fresh vegetables cook together in the sauce, transforming plain pasta into a great meal.

                       Clams In Garlic Green Sauce

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  live small hardshell clams
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  bottled clam juice
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  capers -- drained
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Seafood Alternatives:  mussels 
Scrub the clams, discarding any that are not tightly closed or that do not close when touched.  Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or deep frying pan over medium heat.  Add the green onion and garlic; sautÈ until soft, 3 minutes.  Stir in the flour and cook 1 minute. 
Gradually stir in the clam juice and wine; cook and stir until smooth and thick, about 3 minutes.  (The sauce can be made ahead to this point and refrigerated in a covered dish up to 24 hours; rewarm the sauce before proceeding.) 
Stir the parsley and capers into the sauce and season to taste with pepper.  Add the clams, cover and cook until the clams begin to open, 2 to 5 minutes.  As each clam opens, lift it from the sauce with tongs, shaking juice into sauce, and transfer it to a serving platter (or to individual plates). 
Recover the pan and continue until all clams are cooked; discard any clams that do not open.  (If the sauce sticks, stir in additional wine or water 1 tablespoon at a time to prevent burning.)  Stir the sauce and spoon it over the clams. Serve warm. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  In Spain, tapas are "little bites," served on individual plates.  You might also offer these clams in one large bowl and let guests serve themselves.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Recover the pan and continue until all clams are cooked; discard any clams that do not open.  (If the sauce sticks, stir in additional wine or water 1 tablespoon at a time to prevent burning.)  Stir the sauce and spoon it over the clams. Serve warm. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  In Spain, tapas are &quot;little bites,&quot; served on individual plates.  You might also offer these clams in one large bowl and let guests serve themselves.

                           Classic Salsa Fresca

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Salsa
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     ripe tomatoes - (abt 1 lb total) -- cored and chopped
     1/2                yellow onion -- minced
     1/2           cup  coasely-chopped cilantro
                        Juice of 1 lime - (abt 1/4 cup)
     1/2                jalapeÒo or serrano chile -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced
                        Salt -- (optional)

In a large bowl, combine the tomato, onion, cilantro, lime juice and chile.  Toss gently to mix well.  Season to taste with salt, if you like.  Serve at room temperature or chilled. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  Sample this most basic salsa and you'll be hooked for life.  It will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator but is at its best when freshly made.  Omit the jalapeÒo, if you like, for a stingless variation. 
Salt will draw excess moisture from the tomatoes, making the salsa watery as it sits.  The salsa is delicious without it, but if you add salt, do so just before serving.

                      Coconut Shrimp With A Surprise

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  corn oil or other vegetable oil
  2               cups  thinly-sliced leeks or onions
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- coarsely chopped,
                        liquid reserved
  3        tablespoons  undiluted orange juice concentrate
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  minced fresh mint or cilantro
                        (or 2 tbspns dried mint leaves, crushed)
     1/2      teaspoon  Asian chile paste (sambal oelek) -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  coconut milk, preferably reduced-fat
                        (or substitute evaporated skim milk)
  1 1/4         pounds  rock shrimp or 1 1/2 lbs medium shrimp -- peeled and deveined

Seafood Alternatives:  scallops, surimi crab, cubed monkfish, grouper, catfish 
Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat.  Add the leeks and sautÈ until softened, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring.  Add the tomatoes and their juice, orange juice concentrate, lemon juice, dried mint (if using; fresh is added later), chile paste, salt and pepper.  Cook the sauce, uncovered, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
Stir in the coconut milk with the fresh mint, if using, and heat for 2 minutes.  Add the shrimp, cover and cook until they just turn opaque, 2 to 4 minutes; the shrimp will continue to cook on standing, so avoid overcooking.  Spoon the rice into individual bowls and ladle the shrimp and sauce on top. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Delicious rock shrimp are quick and easy because theyre sold already shelled and deveined.  Inspired by James Beards Fresh Tomato Soup, this chunky shrimp sauce uses Beards surprise ingredient -- orange juice concentrate.  Serve shrimp over fluffy, steaming rice with a fennel, orange and snap pea salad and crusty garlic bread.

                     Cod And Winter Vegetable Chowder

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chowder                         Fish (Ocean)
                Seafood                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             slices  bacon -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/4" strips
                        (or 1 1/2 tbspns vegetable oil)
  2                     leeks (abt 1 lb) white part only -- sliced 1/4" thick
                        (or 1 large onion, chopped)
  1              pound  thin-skinned white potatoes -- unpeeled, diced
  2 1/2           cups  water
  2               cups  low-fat milk
  1            package  frozen broccoli - (10 oz) -- thawed
  1 1/2         pounds  cod or halibut -- cut into 1" chunks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook the bacon in a large (5 to 6 quart) pan over medium heat until crisp, 3 to 5 minute.  Transfer the bacon to a paper towel and set aside. 
Add the leeks and potatoes to the drippings (or substitute oil) and sautÈ for 2 minutes.  Add the water and bring to a boil.  Simmer, covered, until the potatoes are almost tender, about 7 minutes. 
Add the milk and broccoli and return to a simmer.  Stir in the cod and simmer until the fish is just opaque through, 6 to 10 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Ladle the chowder into deep bowls, sprinkle with bacon and serve. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Yes, a little bacon can be included in a healthy diet -- just two strips add a big punch to this Boston-style chowder.  You can omit the bacon, though, and use vegetable oil to sautÈ the vegetables.  Choose thick fillets of firm fish for this recipe; delicate, thin fillets will flake into tiny pieces when the chowder is stirred.

          Cod With Radicchio, White Beans And Lemon Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Chef Michael Romano, Union Square Cafe
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LEMON VINAIGRETTE ===
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped lemon zest
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  minced or pressed garlic
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  coarsely-chopped parsley
                        === COD AND BEAN SALAD ===
  2               cups  cooked white beans -- see * Note
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced peeled celery
  2               cups  leek rounds, white/light green parts -- washed
  3        small heads  radicchio -- quartered, cored,
                        and leaves separated
  4                     cod fillet pieces - (6 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  flour

* Note:  For the cooked white beans, first soak the beans (such as cannellini or Great Northern) overnight in cold water.  Drain the beans and put them in a saucepan with cold water to cover by 3 inches.  Add one rib of celery, one carrot split lengthwise, one onion halved and stuck with 2 cloves and 1 bay leaf.  Bring just to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 1 hour.  Add 1 teaspoon salt and continue cooking until the beans are cooked and tender, about 30 minutes longer.  Drain the beans, discard the vegetables and let cool. 
Combine the vinaigrette ingredients in a jar.  Close the lid tightly and shake vigorously.  Set aside. 
In a small saucepan, bring the cooked beans to a simmer.  Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the celery and leeks and stir with a wooden spoon until the vegetables are softened but not colored, 4 to 5 minutes. 
Raise the heat to high and toss in the radicchio leaves.  Cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes, stirring constantly, to wilt the leaves. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Transfer the cooked vegetables to a large bowl and, while still warm, toss with the beans and 1 cup of the lemon vinaigrette.  Set aside. 
Season the cod fillets with salt and pepper.  Lightly dredge both sides of the fish in the flour.  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over high heat in a large skillet.  Saute the cod until golden, 4 to 5 minutes per side.  Arrange the cod fillets on a platter around the radicchio and white bean salad.  Spoon the remaining vinaigrette over the cod and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Since cod is so flaky, try these tips to prevent the fish from breaking apart as you cook it.  Make sure the oil is quite hot before putting the fish in the pan.  After a few seconds, give the pan a gentle shake to see if the fish has stuck to the bottom.  Use a wide spatula to scrape any stuck parts and to support the fish while you turn it over.  This recipe is from The Union Square Cafe Cookbook (HarperCollins, 1994).

</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small saucepan, bring the cooked beans to a simmer.  Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the celery and leeks and stir with a wooden spoon until the vegetables are softened but not colored, 4 to 5 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Raise the heat to high and toss in the radicchio leaves.  Cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes, stirring constantly, to wilt the leaves. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the cooked vegetables to a large bowl and, while still warm, toss with the beans and 1 cup of the lemon vinaigrette.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the cod fillets with salt and pepper.  Lightly dredge both sides of the fish in the flour.  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over high heat in a large skillet.  Saute the cod until golden, 4 to 5 minutes per side.  Arrange the cod fillets on a platter around the radicchio and white bean salad.  Spoon the remaining vinaigrette over the cod and serve. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Since cod is so flaky, try these tips to prevent the fish from breaking apart as you cook it.  Make sure the oil is quite hot before putting the fish in the pan.  After a few seconds, give the pan a gentle shake to see if the fish has stuck to the bottom.  Use a wide spatula to scrape any stuck parts and to support the fish while you turn it over.  This recipe is from The Union Square Cafe Cookbook (HarperCollins, 1994).

                          Corn And Avocado Salsa

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Salsa
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  corn kernels -- blanched fresh,
                        or thawed frozen
     1/2           cup  diced jicama or red radishes
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
  1                     ripe but firm avocado -- peeled, pitted,
                        and diced
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh oregano
                        (or 1/4 tspn dried oregano)
     1/8      teaspoon  Tabasco sauce -- or to taste

Combine the corn, jicama and green onion in a medium bowl.  In another bowl, combine the avocado and lime juice and stir to thoroughly coat. 
In a small jar with tight-fitting lid, combine the vinegar, oil, cumin, oregano and Tabasco.  Shake the dressing well, pour it over the corn mixture and stir.  Add the avocado mixture and stir gently.  Refrigerate until 30 minutes before serving. 
The salsa can be made up to 24 hours ahead; stir before serving.  Goes well with "Poached Whole Salmon With Two Sauces." 
This recipe yields about 3 cups. 
Comments:  This colorful salsa is perfectly paired with Poached Whole Salmon, but would be delicious with a variety of other seafoods as well. 
Jicama is a large, round root vegetable with mildly-flavored and very crunchy white flesh.  Just peel away the brown skin, and jicama is ready to use.  If you cannot find it available, radishes are a good substitute here; they will add a slightly peppery flavor to the salsa.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  shredded Jack cheese - (6 oz)
     3/4         pound  crabmeat or surimi crab - (to 1 lb) -- chopped or flaked
  1            package  frozen corn - (10 oz) -- thawed
  1                can  sliced ripe black olives - (2 1/4 oz) -- drained
  1                can  diced green chiles - (4 oz)
  9                     corn tortillas - (6" dia)
                        === ENCHILADA SAUCE ===
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                can  prepared enchilada sauce - (10 oz)

Make the enchilada sauce:  In a medium microwave safe bowl, stir the onion with olive oil, cumin, chili powder and cinnamon.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and microwave on High (100% power) until the onion is tender, 2 minutes. 
Stir in the tomatoes with their juice and the enchilada sauce; set aside 1 cup of the sauce.  To the remaining sauce add 1 cup of the cheese and all the crabmeat, corn, olives and chilies. 
Lay 3 tortillas in the bottom of a 2- to 2 1/2-quart shallow casserole, cutting tortillas to fit.  Top with half the crabmeat mixture.  Repeat with another layer of tortillas and the remaining crabmeat mixture.  Top with the remaining tortillas, sauce and cheese. 
Cover casserole with a lid or plastic wrap.  If storing to cook later, wrap entire casserole in foil and freeze up to 3 months. 
To cook, remove the foil and loosen or puncture the plastic wrap.  Microwave on High (100% power) until hot throughout, about 15 minutes if cooking right away, 30 minutes if cooking frozen, rotating the casserole 1/4 turn every 5 minutes.  Let stand at least 5 minutes before serving. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 
Comments:  Filled with exciting south-of-the-border flavor, this delicious mix of crabmeat or surimi crab, corn and tomatoes makes a spicy one-course meal your family will sit down and cheer about.

                   Crab Saute In Asian Black Bean Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  fermented black beans -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  sake, dry sherry or white wine
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2              whole  dried red chiles
  1                     red or green bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and sliced
  4             ounces  snow peas or slender green beans -- trimmed
     1/2           cup  sliced green onions
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  minced or pressed garlic
  2             pounds  cooked crab in the shell -- see * Note
  2           teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/2           cup  fish stock, chicken broth or water
     1/4           cup  soy sauce, preferably reduced-sodium
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes -- or to taste

* Note:  You can use virtually any form of crab for this recipe: whole cleaned Dungeness cut in pieces, sections of snow or king crab legs, sections of blue crab.  Be sure to first lightly crack or split leg portions before adding, to make it easier for diners to dig in later.  The recipe could even be adapted for soft-shell crabs by first sautÈing them separately, then adding them to the stir-fry mixture as you would cooked crab sections. 
Combine the black beans and sake in a small bowl and let sit for at least 30 minutes. 
Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over moderately-high heat.  Add the chiles and cook, stirring, until fragrant and well browned.  Remove the chiles and discard them.  Add the bell pepper, snow peas, green onions, ginger and garlic to the skillet and stir-fry over high heat until the vegetables are slightly tender, about 3 minutes.  Add the crab pieces and toss until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. 
Add the cornstarch to the black beans and sake and stir just to mix.  Add this mixture to the wok with the fish stock and soy sauce and stir until the sauce is thickened and evenly coats the crab.  Sprinkle with the dried red pepper flakes and taste the sauce for seasoning.  Scoop the crab and sauce onto individual plates and serve. 
This recipe yields 2 servings. 
Comments:  This stir-fry-style recipe uses pieces of crab still in the shell, which helps keep the crab moist and in whole segments.  It's messy eating, but so delicious you won't mind! 
Fermented black beans are available in Asian markets and specialty food shops.  You can use regular cooked black beans in their place, but they lack the distinctive flavor of fermented black beans.

* Note:  You can use virtually any form of crab for this recipe: whole cleaned Dungeness cut in pieces, sections of snow or king crab legs, sections of blue crab.  Be sure to first lightly crack or split leg portions before adding, to make it easier for diners to dig in later.  The recipe could even be adapted for soft-shell crabs by first sautÈing them separately, then adding them to the stir-fry mixture as you would cooked crab sections. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the black beans and sake in a small bowl and let sit for at least 30 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over moderately-high heat.  Add the chiles and cook, stirring, until fragrant and well browned.  Remove the chiles and discard them.  Add the bell pepper, snow peas, green onions, ginger and garlic to the skillet and stir-fry over high heat until the vegetables are slightly tender, about 3 minutes.  Add the crab pieces and toss until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the cornstarch to the black beans and sake and stir just to mix.  Add this mixture to the wok with the fish stock and soy sauce and stir until the sauce is thickened and evenly coats the crab.  Sprinkle with the dried red pepper flakes and taste the sauce for seasoning.  Scoop the crab and sauce onto individual plates and serve. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This stir-fry-style recipe uses pieces of crab still in the shell, which helps keep the crab moist and in whole segments.  It&apos;s messy eating, but so delicious you won&apos;t mind! 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fermented black beans are available in Asian markets and specialty food shops.  You can use regular cooked black beans in their place, but they lack the distinctive flavor of fermented black beans.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             carton  lowfat sour cream - (8 oz)
     1/4           cup  reduced-calorie mayonnaise
                        (or plain low-fat yogurt)
     1/4           cup  fresh parsley sprigs - (firmly packed)
  1         tablespoon  fresh minced dill
                        (or 2 tspn dried dill)
  1           teaspoon  fresh minced tarragon
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried tarragon)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  capers -- drained

Place all the ingredients, except the capers, in the work bowl of  a food processor.  Process until smooth.  Stir in the capers and transfer to a serving bowl.  Cover and chill for up to 2 days. 
This recipe yields about 1 1/4 cups. 
Comments:  This sauce -- designed with "Poached Whole Salmon" in mind -- has the creaminess of sour cream and mayonnaise, but in a lower fat version that isn't any less tasty.  Use whatever fresh herbs you prefer, altering the list here to fit your tastes and what you have on hand.  Serve with Poached Whole Salmon or other simply cooked seafood.

Comments:  This zesty sauce is a perfect accompaniment for the "Southern Style Clambake", but will also be delicious with your favorite grilled fish.  Or, simmer some shrimp in the sauce and pour it over pasta or rice.

                   Crisp-Sided Trout With Ginger Sauce

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  skin-on trout fillets - (4 fillets)
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1              bunch  green onions -- trimmed, and
                        thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  grated fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  sake or white wine
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes

Cut 3 shallow diagonal slashes in the skin side of each trout fillet.  Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan and add the fillets skin-side down (2 at a time if your pan is not large enough).  Add the lid and cook over medium-high heat until the tops of the fillets are opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. 
Remove the lid and continue cooking until the skin is crisp and brown and the flesh is opaque through the thickest part, 2 to 3 minutes longer. 
Flip the fillets skin-side up onto 4 warmed dinner plates.  Add the green onions and ginger to the frying pan and cook over medium heat, stirring, until soft, about 1 minute.  Add the soy sauce, sake and red pepper flakes, stir and cook until hot, about 30 seconds longer. 
Pour the sauce over the trout fillets and serve immediately, with steamed white rice alongside. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The skin of trout is not only edible, but also a tasty contrast to the tender flesh.  Here the skin cooks to delicate crispiness in a one-sided cooking method.  A nonstick pan makes frying tidy, but a standard frying pan can also be used.

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  Dijon-style mustard
  2        tablespoons  milk or water
     1/2           cup  fresh or dried breadcrumbs
  3        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  melted butter or olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
  2                     catfish fillets - (12 14 oz ea)

Seafood Alternatives:  halibut, shark 
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Stir the mustard and milk together in a pie plate or shallow dish.  In another pie plate, mix the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, butter, pepper and paprika with a fork or your fingers until evenly combined. 
Trim the white or grayish fat from the catfish fillets and cut each in half; rinse in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Dip the rounded side of the pieces evenly in the mustard mixture, then dredge the mustard-coated side of each fillet in the breadcrumb mixture. 
Lay the fillets, crumbs up, on a lightly-oiled baking sheet and sprinkle with any remaining crumbs.  Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the fish is tender when pierced in the thickest part with a fork or skewer, 15 to 18 minutes. 
Transfer to dinner plates and serve with steamed broccoli and salad. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The texture of catfish is similar to that of chicken breast, and it needs longer cooking than other fillets.  This extra baking time allows a golden light crust to develop.  While the fish bakes, steam some broccoli and make a salad -- many groceries now offer Caesar salad packages ready-to-go.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  navel orange
  1                     cucumber -- peeled, halved,
                        seeded and thinly sliced
  1                     fennel bulb -- trimmed, cored,
                        quartered, thinly sliced, green fronds
                        reserved
     1/2        medium  red onion -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced

Grate 1 tablespoon of zest from the orange and set aside.  Cut both ends from the orange, just to the flesh.  Set it upright on a chopping board and cut away the pith and skin, following the curve of the fruit. 
Working over a large bowl, hold the orange in your hand and slide the knife blade down one side of a section, cutting away from the membrane.  Cut down the other side of the section and let it fall into the bowl.  Continue for the remaining sections, turning back flaps of membrane as you would the pages of a book.  Squeeze any remaining juice from the membranes and discard them. 
Add the cucumber, fennel bulb, onion and orange zest to the bowl.  Mince enough of the fennel fronds to make 2 tablespoons and add it to the bowl.  Toss to mix well; chill until ready to serve. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  Crunchy and refreshing, this salsa gets added color and flavor from orange, along with specks of green from fennel fronds.  It is an extra-chunky variation.

                       Cumin Shrimp And Carrot Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1 1/2         pounds  carrots -- sliced
  4               cups  reduced-salt chicken or vegetable broth
  1                cup  half-and-half
                        Ground cumin -- for sprinkling

Seafood Alternatives:  salmon, scallops 
Rinse the shrimp and pat dry with paper towels.  Thread the shrimp on skewers, lightly brush them with oil and set on a large plate.  Sprinkle both sides of the shrimp with about half the cumin, salt and pepper.  Set aside. 
Preheat the charcoal grill or broiler and cook the shrimp until opaque through the thickest part, about 3 minutes on each side.  Let cool, then chill until needed. 
Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in a large skillet, add the onion and carrots and cook until the carrots are beginning to soften, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Sprinkle the remaining cumin, salt and pepper over the vegetables and cook for 1 minute, stirring to coat with the spices.  Add the broth and half-and-half, bring to a boil and simmer until the carrots are soft, 15 to 20 minutes.  Let cool for about 15 minutes. 
Carefully ladle about half of the soup into a food processor and purÈe until smooth.  Transfer to a large bowl and repeat with the remaining carrot mixture.  If using a blender, purÈe the soup in 4 to 5 batches.  Taste the soup for seasoning and chill for at least 1 hour. 
Spoon the chilled carrot soup into soup bowls, arrange the spiced shrimp over the top and sprinkle the top of the soup with more ground cumin. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This rich and flavorful soup carefully balances the sweetness of shrimp and summer carrots with the spice of cumin.  If using bamboo skewers, soak them in a bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes before using.

                          Curried Island Shrimp

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  unsweetened shredded coconut
  4          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  finely-minced onion
  4          teaspoons  minced or pressed garlic
  4          teaspoons  freshly-grated or minced ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes -- or more to taste
                        (or minced fresh chile peppers)
  2        tablespoons  tamarind purÈe or lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  coconut milk preferably reduced-fat
  1              pound  medium shrimp - (to 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, deveined
  3               cups  cooked long-grain rice - (to 4 cups)
     1/4           cup  minced cilantro
                        === ISLAND CURRY POWDER ===
  2          teaspoons  black mustard seed
  2          teaspoons  cumin seeds
  2          teaspoons  black peppercorns
  2          teaspoons  anise seeds
  2          teaspoons  fenugreek seeds
  3          teaspoons  coriander seeds
  4          teaspoons  ground turmeric
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

Seafood Alternatives:  crabmeat, tuna, snapper, grouper, surimi seafood 
To make your own curry powder, you will need a small spice grinder, clean coffee grinder or mortar and pestle.  Heat a medium frying pan over medium-low heat and add the mustard seeds, cumin, peppercorns, anise, fenugreek and coriander.  Shaking the pan, dry roast the spices until the mustard seeds turn gray and the spices become fragrant, about 5 minutes. 
Let cool, then grind to a fine powder.  Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the turmeric and cinnamon.  Measure 2 tablespoons for this recipe; store the remaining powder tightly sealed in a dark place.  It will keep up to 6 months and can be used as you would other curry powders. 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Scatter the shredded coconut evenly in a cake pan or pie tin and toast in the oven until browned and aromatic, 5 to 7 minutes, tossing occasionally so the coconut browns evenly.  Set aside. 
In a frying pan, heat the oil over medium-low heat and sautÈ the onion, garlic and ginger, partly covered, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes, stirring.  Reduce heat to low; stir in the 2 tablespoons curry powder with the red pepper flakes.  Cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes, stirring. 
Stir in the tamarind purÈe, salt and coconut milk; warm through, about 2 minutes.  Taste the sauce for seasoning, then add shrimp and cook until curled and pink, 3 to 4 minutes.  Do not over-cook.  Serve over fluffy rice and sprinkle with toasted coconut and cilantro. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This golden curry bursts with piquant East Indian spices and is guaranteed to banish winters frosty chill.  Don't panic at the long list of curry powder spices -- you can easily substitute commercial curry powder.  This curry powder recipe makes about 1/2 cup more than you need, but the rest keeps well in an airtight jar.  Serve shrimp over fluffy long-grain rice.

         Curried Leek Soup With Toasted Walnuts And Smoked Trout

Recipe By     :Susan Volland
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  leeks
  2          teaspoons  vegetable or olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
     1/4           cup  chopped celery
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
  1                cup  diced peeled potato
  2               cups  clam juice
  2               cups  water or vegetable broth
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  toasted walnut pieces
  1                cup  flaked smoked trout - (abt 6 oz)
  1                     green onion -- sliced

Seafood Alternatives:  smoked salmon, smoked scallops, smoked mussels 
Prepare the leeks by removing the tough green tops and outer leaves.  Cut each leek in half lengthwise and rinse well to remove any grit or dirt.  Thinly slice the leeks crosswise. 
In a large pot, heat the oil and sautÈ the leeks, onion and celery over medium-low heat to soften without browning, 6 to 7 minutes.  Add the curry powder and continue to cook 20 seconds more.  Add the diced potato, clam juice and water and cook, covered, for 35 minutes. 
Working in batches, purÈe the soup in a blender or food processor and return it to the pot.  Season with salt and pepper, remembering that the smoked trout will be salty.  Warm the soup and gently fold in the walnuts and smoked trout.  Serve garnished with sliced green onions. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This is a very elegant soup with silky texture and plenty of aromatic flavor.  The trout and walnuts are folded in at the end to keep the fish moist and mild and the nuts crisp.  For extra richness, you can stir in some half-and-half or cream just before serving.

                     Curried Mahi-Mahi Kebabs Belize

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  mahi-mahi fillet
  1              large  not-too-ripe papaya
  1              large  plantain or underripe banana
                        Vegetable oil -- for the grill
                        Cilantro sprigs -- for garnish
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  white wine
     1/4           cup  minced onion
  3        tablespoons  minced cilantro
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Seafood Alternatives:  swordfish, shark, halibut 
Rinse the mahi-mahi and pat dry with paper towels.  Cut the fish into 1-inch cubes.  In a shallow dish, combine the marinade ingredients and mix well.  Add the cubes of mahi-mahi and toss to thoroughly coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.  If using bamboo skewers, soak them in a bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes before grilling. 
Meanwhile, halve the papaya and scoop out and discard the seeds.  Peel away the skin with a small knife or vegetable peeler.  Cut the papaya into 1-inch cubes.  Peel the plantain and cut across into 1-inch pieces.  Preheat the grill to high, or heat coals until they glow red, with white ash around the edges. 
Take the mahi-mahi cubes from the marinade, allowing excess to drip off; reserve the marinade.  Thread the mahi-mahi onto the skewers, alternating with pieces of papaya and plantain.  Do not crowd ingredients on the kebabs, but leave a little space between so they will cook evenly. 
Rub a lightly oiled towel or cloth over the grill and cook until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes.  Brush a little marinade over the kebabs, then turn and continue cooking until the fish is opaque through, about 5 minutes longer. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The combination of fruit and fish is an exotic alternative to the traditional "meat and vegetable" kebab.  A dash of curry adds a golden hue and delightful flavor.  Choose fruit that is still somewhat firm, without being rock solid, to ensure that it will hold up in cooking.

                         Curried Rice With Shrimp

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
     1/4           cup  minced onion
  1                cup  long-grain white rice
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  vegetable broth or water
     1/4           cup  slivered blanched almonds
     3/4         pound  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
     1/4           cup  raisins

Seafood Alternatives:  scallops 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, add the onion and cook, stirring, until beginning to soften, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the rice, curry powder, salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until the rice is evenly coated with oil and the curry smells fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. 
Slowly stir in the broth, bring to a boil, cover and simmer the rice over low heat for 10 minutes.  While the rice cooks, scatter the slivered almonds in a pie pan and toast in the heated oven until light brown, 5 to 7 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally so the nuts toast evenly.  Set aside. 
Stir the shrimp into the partially cooked rice, cover and continue to cook over low heat until the rice is tender to the bite and the shrimp are opaque through, 8 to 10 minutes longer, stirring once or twice. 
Taste the rice for seasoning, transfer to individual plates and sprinkle with raisins and toasted almonds.  To serve cold, let the rice mixture chill thoroughly, then stir in the toasted almonds and raisins just before serving. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This dish is equally delicious warm or cold.  For a cold salad, add some diced celery or fresh chopped herbs just before serving.  This is an ideal place to use basmati or jasmine rice, if you like.

                           Curried Salmon Salad

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Salads/Dressings
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  salmon steak or fillet - (to 1 lb)
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  6        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  minced or grated fresh ginger
     3/4      teaspoon  curry powder
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
     1/2                red delicious apple -- cored and diced
     1/4           cup  diced green bell pepper
  3        tablespoons  raisins
  4              large  crisp lettuce leaves

Seafood Alternatives:  tuna, swordfish, cod, mahi-mahi 
Preheat the broiler.  Brush the salmon evenly with 1 teaspoon of the lemon juice and set on a lightly-oiled baking sheet.  Broil 2 to 3 inches from the heat until just opaque through, 7 to 10 minutes, turning steaks once.  When cool enough to handle, remove and discard bones and skin.  Cut the salmon into 3/4-inch pieces. 
In a medium bowl, stir together the remaining lemon juice, mayonnaise, ginger, curry and garlic.  Gently fold in the salmon, apple, bell pepper and raisins. 
Lay the lettuce leaves on individual plates and mound the salmon salad on top. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Leftover grilled seafood is a great substitute for the salmon here, and it cuts preparation time in half.

                           Deep South Fish Fry

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- more if needed
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper -- or more to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  milk
  1               dash  Tabasco sauce -- or more to taste
  1                cup  fine yellow cornmeal -- more if needed
  1 1/2         pounds  catfish or other firm white fish
  12                    oysters -- shucked
                        (or a 10-oz jar medium oysters, drained)
  2             quarts  vegetable oil -- for frying
  1              large  onion -- sliced very thin
                        Dipping Sauce For Fried Fish -- (see recipe)

Combine the flour, cayenne, salt and pepper on a plate and stir to mix.  In a shallow bowl, combine the milk with a dash or two of Tabasco.  Put the cornmeal in a third shallow dish. 
Cut each fish fillet into 2 to 4 even pieces, depending on their size.  Dry the fish and oysters well on paper towels. 
Heat about 2 inches of oil to 375 degrees in a deep-fryer.  Toss the sliced onion in the seasoned flour, separating the rings and mixing to thoroughly coat.  Shake off excess flour and add the onions to the hot fat.  Fry until crisp and brown, 1 to 2 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and keep warm in a low oven. 
Dust the catfish pieces with seasoned flour, shaking off excess.  Dip them in the milk, allowing excess to drip off, then thoroughly coat them in cornmeal.  Shake off excess cornmeal and add the fish to the hot oil.  Fry, turning once or twice, until golden and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and keep warm in the oven.  Repeat with the oysters, frying them 2 to 3 minutes. 
Arrange the fish and oysters on a large platter, pile the onions on top in the center and pass the dipping sauce separately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Cornmeal adds distinctive crunch to this fried fish recipe, with a touch of Cajun character coming from a pinch of cayenne and a dash of Tabasco sauce (more for the locals, of course).  A southern-style accompaniment is French-fried onions.  Watch out -- they're addictive!

                            Deviled Crab Legs

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : First Course                    Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  snow or king crab legs
     1/2           cup  fresh or dry bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  Dijon-style mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

If necessary, cut the crab legs crosswise into 4 to 6 inch sections.  Split the crab legs, leaving the meat in the shells, and arrange them in a shallow pan. 
Preheat the broiler.  Combine the remaining ingredients in a small bowl and stir to thoroughly combine.  Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the crab legs.  Broil until the topping is lightly browned and the crab is warmed through, 5 to 7 minutes. 
To make a light main course, serve with pasta tossed in butter on the side. 
This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings. 
Comments:  Here's a fun way to cook snow or king crab legs, topping the crab meat with a zesty, quick mix of herbs and spices.  Rich and flavorful, they make a delightful first course; or, serve with fresh pasta to make a light main course.

  3        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped onion

                    Dynamite Seafood And Ravioli Soup

Recipe By     :Leslie Beal Bloom
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  fresh or frozen cheese ravioli -- (8 to 10 oz)
                        (or substitute 6 oz dried curly pasta)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  minced green onion
  1         tablespoon  minced or pressed garlic -- (to 2 tbspns)
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
  2               cans  reduced-sodium chicken broth -- (14 1/2 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  dried basil
  1              pinch  cayenne
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/4         pounds  Chilean sea bass -- skinned, boned,
                        and cut in 1" cubes
     1/2           cup  sweet vermouth or red wine
                        (or use 2 tbspns balsamic vinegar)

Seafood Alternatives:  monkfish, tilapia, grouper, catfish, halibut, scallops, shrimp 
Cook the ravioli in boiling salted water according to package directions.  Drain well, then put the ravioli back in the pot and toss with 1 teaspoon of the oil to prevent sticking. 
In a 10-inch pot, heat the remaining oil over medium heat.  Add the green onion and garlic; cook until tender, about 4 minutes, stirring.  Stir in the tomato paste until blended; add the crushed tomatoes, broth, basil, cayenne, salt and pepper; cover and bring to a boil. 
Add the ravioli, sea bass and vermouth.  Cover and simmer until the seafood is opaque, 3 to 4 minutes.  Do not overcook; the seafood will continue to cook sitting in the hot liquid. 
Using a slotted spoon, divide the sea bass and ravioli evenly among bowls, then ladle the soup liquid over. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Chilly winter evenings call for a satisfying seafood soup, and pasta and seafood are perfect partners.  Today, you often can find ready-to-cook fresh or frozen ravioli in the supermarket.  If you prefer dried pasta, it works equally well.  Serve with crusty garlic bread and a crisp green salad.

                            Easy Crab Cioppino

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood
                Shellfish                       Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cans  ready-cut tomatoes - (28 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  dried basil
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
  1              large  or 2 small Dungeness crabs - (abt 3 lbs) -- cleaned, cracked
                        (or 2 lbs snow or king crab legs, cut 4"
                        lengths and cracked, or 3 lbs blue crab)
  1 1/4         pounds  medium or firm-flesh fish -- cut 2" chunks
                        (such as rockfish, red snapper, halibut,
                        monkfish or cod)
  1              pound  live clams -- scrubbed
                        (or two 6-oz cans chopped clams)

Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and garlic and sautÈ until soft but not brown, about 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and their liquid, wine, basil and pepper.  Simmer 20 to 25 minutes. 
Add the seafood and simmer until the fish is just opaque though, the crab is heated through and the clams are open, 10 to 15 minutes longer.  Discard any clams that do not open.  Be careful not to overcook. 
Ladle the seafood and sauce into bowls and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 
Comments:  This cioppino is fast and simple, allowing the flavor of the fresh seafood to stand out.  The light, flavorful sauce is based on ingredients which are usually on hand: garlic, onions, dried herbs, canned ready-cut tomatoes, dry white wine, and -- in a pinch -- canned clams.

<DirT>
Comments:  This cioppino is fast and simple, allowing the flavor of the fresh seafood to stand out.  The light, flavorful sauce is based on ingredients which are usually on hand: garlic, onions, dried herbs, canned ready-cut tomatoes, dry white wine, and -- in a pinch -- canned clams.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  crab or shrimp boil seasonings
                        (2 individual packets)
  1 1/2         pounds  small red-skinned potatoes - (to 2 lbs) -- scrubbed
  1            package  frozen corn on the cob - (4 ears)
  4              whole  cooked Dungeness crabs -- (abt 1 1/4 lbs ea)
                        (or about 3 lbs snow crab legs or king
                        crab legs, broken into pieces,
                        or abt 4 lbs shrimp)
                        Melted butter -- (optional)

Put 6 to 8 inches water into a large kettle (a small stock pot or canning kettle works well).  Add the contents of the seasoning packets and the potatoes and bring the water to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer, cover the pan loosely and cook until the potatoes are tender when pierced, 15 to 20 minutes. 
Transfer the potatoes to a bowl and cover to keep warm.  Add the corn to the simmering water and cook until the kernels are tender, about 5 minutes.  Transfer the corn to a bowl and cover to keep warm. 
Add the crab (you may need to cook 1 at a time, depending upon size of pan) and simmer until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Drain well. 
Arrange the crab, potatoes and corn on a large serving platter and serve, passing melted butter separately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Look for crab and shrimp boil seasoning packets at the seafood counter.  Full of peppers and spices, these packets flavor vegetables as well as seafood.

                        Ecuadorian Shrimp Ceviche

Recipe By     :Chef Douglas Rodriguez, Patria
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1              large  tomato -- roasted, peeled,
                        and seeded
  2                     jalapeÒo peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        and seeded
  2                     red bell peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        and seeded
     1/2        medium  onion -- roasted
     3/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
     1/4           cup  tomato juice
                        Tabasco sauce -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  1              small  red onion -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions
                        Several whole leaves of cilantro
  1              large  tomato -- chopped
  1                cup  plain popped popcorn
     1/2           cup  plain corn nuts

Note:  Roasting the vegetables not only cooks them, but develops their flavor before purÈeing for the sauce.  Set the whole tomato, jalapeÒos and bell peppers on a baking sheet.  Trim the onion half and set it cut-side up on the baking sheet.  Set the sheet 3 to 4 inches under the broiler.  Turn the vegetables every few minutes so they toast evenly.  When the tomato skin cracks and chars (about 5 minutes), remove it and let cool. 
Continue cooking the peppers untill the skin is evenly charred and blistered, about 3 minutes longer.  The onion should be roasted, turned occasionally, until evenly browned and soft through, about 5 minutes longer.  (Roasting times will vary, depending on the heat of your broiler.)  Let the vegetables cool; peel, seed and core the tomato and peppers. 
Bring a medium pan of water to a boil, add the shrimp and cook until just opaque through, about 2 minutes.  Drain the shrimp and put them in a bowl of ice water.  (This stops the cooking immediately, so the shrimp don't become overcooked and tough.)  Once cold, drain the shrimp well and put them in a bowl. 
Put the tomato, peppers, onions, lime juice, orange juice, tomato juice, Tabasco, sugar and salt in a blender and purÈe until smooth.  Pour this mixture over the shrimp, stir to mix and chill. 
Just before serving, add the garnish ingredients -- except the popcorn and corn nuts -- and toss to mix.  Spoon the ceviche onto individual plates and randomly sprinkle the popcorn and corn nuts around. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This is a tasty sample of Chef Rodriguez's tantalizing appetizer menu.  In Ecuador, corn is the staple and it shows up in their foods in many ways.  Locals enjoying a cool, refreshing ceviche will likely have a bowl of popcorn and corn nuts alongside, alternating bites of the zesty seafood with the crunchy, nutty corn.  The combination sounds unusual, but you'll be amazed at how delicious it is. 
The ceviche is best made shortly before serving and the popcorn and corn nuts should be added at the very last minute.  At Patria, ceviches are made not just once at the beginning of the evening, but all through the evening so the flavors will be fresh and at their best.  This isn't a dish that benefits from sitting.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  baking potatoes
  2             pounds  firm white fish fillets
                        (such as haddock or cod)
  2             quarts  vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Lemon wedges -- and/or
                        Malt vinegar -- for serving
                        Tartar Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        === BATTER ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     eggs -- separated
  1                cup  beer (not dark)

Scrub the potatoes under cold water and dry well, leaving on the skin.  With a chefs knife or slicer, cut the potatoes into 1/4-inch slices, then across into 1/4-inch sticks.  Immediately put the cut potatoes into a large bowl of cold water to prevent discoloration and wash away the starch; let sit in the water for 15 to 20 minutes.  If necessary, trim the fish fillets to uniform size. 
Heat about 2 inches of oil to 375 degrees in a deep-fryer.  Drain the potatoes and dry them thoroughly on paper towels.  Add about one-quarter of the potatoes to the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and keep warm in a low oven.  Fry the remaining potatoes in the same way. 
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt and pepper.  Add the egg yolks and beer and stir to combine.  Beat the egg whites to moderately stiff peaks and fold into the batter. 
Dip the fish into the batter, coating them well and allowing the excess to drip off.  Add 1 to 2 pieces of fish to the hot fat and fry until crisp and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes, turning the pieces once or twice as they cook.  Drain on paper towels and fry the remaining fish in the same way. 
Arrange the fish and chips on a large platter or individual plates, passing the lemon wedges, malt vinegar and Tartar Sauce alongside. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Not only is beer the beverage of choice to accompany fish and chips, but its effervescence adds zip and lightness to the batter.  Use your imagination with the chips... anything from shoestring to steak chips will do, with appropriate alteration in the cooking time.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Season the fillets with salt and pepper and arrange them on a baking pan.  Pour the wine over and dot with the butter. 
Bake, uncovered, until the fish is just opaque through the thickest part, 6 to 10 minutes, depending on thickness of the fish.  Transfer the fillets to warm plates and cover with foil. 
Pour the pan juices into a saucepan and boil, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced to about 2 tablespoons.  Add the shrimp and parsley to the sauce and simmer until hot, about 1 minute longer.  Taste the sauce for seasoning and spoon it over the fish. 
This recipe yields 2 servings. 
Comments:  A year-round treat: fish fillets plus a few ounces of sweet cooked and peeled shrimp for the sauce.  Talk about convenience food!

                   Fish Roll Ups In Tomato Fennel Sauce

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1             medium  fennel bulb -- quartered, thinly
                        sliced, with some feathery leaves
                        reserved for garnish
  1             medium  onion -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz) -- chopped with juice
  1                can  sliced ripe olives - (2 1/4 oz) -- drained
     1/4      teaspoon  fennel seed -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     sole or flounder fillets - (abt 5 oz ea) -- skinned
                        (or 1 1/3 lbs smaller fillets)

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the fennel and onion and sautÈ for 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and their juice, olives, fennel seed, salt and pepper.  Simmer, uncovered, until thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. 
Roll up larger fish fillets, starting with the thick end.  Smaller fillets should be doubled up, slightly overlapping, before rolling.  Put the rolls, seam-side down, in the hot tomato-fennel sauce.  Cover and cook over medium heat until the fish rolls are just opaque through the center, 10 to 15 minutes. 
Taste the sauce for seasoning, adding more salt or pepper if necessary.  Serve the fish and sauce with rice, if desired, and garnish with the reserved fennel sprigs. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Thin fish fillets, such as sole or flounder, are rolled up and nestled in a simmering sauce of fennel, tomato, onion and olives.  Save a few of the delicate fennel fronds for garnish.

                      Fish Tacos With Chipotle Sauce

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  grouper fillet -- skin and bones
                        removed
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  cornmeal or crushed cornflakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- more if needed
  8                     fresh corn tortillas - (6" to 7" dia)
                        (or 8 baked, folded tortillas)
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
  2               cups  finely-shredded red leaf lettuce -- (to 3 cups)
  1              large  ripe avocado -- pitted, peeled,
                        and sliced
                        === CHIPOTLE SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  sour cream, preferably reduced-fat
  3        tablespoons  mayonnaise, preferably reduced-fat
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  1         tablespoon  canned chipotle chiles - (abt 1 chile)
  2                     garlic cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder

Seafood Alternatives:  halibut, cod, surimi crabmeat, shrimp, scallops, crabmeat, softshell crab 
Combine all the chipotle sauce ingredients in a blender or small food processor and process until smooth.  The sauce will thicken slightly as it stands and will keep for 2 to 3 weeks in the refrigerator.  If the sauce is too hot for some tastes, offer additional sour cream on the side.  Let stand at room temperature while preparing remaining ingredients. 
Cut the fish into strips about 1-inch thick.  In a shallow pan stir together the flour and cornmeal with a pinch of salt and pepper; set aside. 
If using fresh tortillas, heat a large frying pan over medium heat.  Brush lightly with some of the oil.  Briefly dip one tortilla in a bowl of water and shake off excess water.  Lay the tortilla in the heated frying pan and cook until barely tinged with brown, 5 to 15 seconds. 
Turn and cook until limp, 5 to 15 seconds longer.  (Use the spatula or your fingers to spin the tortilla while cooking to prevent it from sticking to the pan.)  Repeat to cook the remaining tortillas.  Stack them on a plate, cover and keep warm in a 200 degrees oven.  Wipe the frying pan clean. 
Dredge the fish pieces in the flour mixture, shaking off excess.  Melt the butter with the oil in the frying pan over medium heat.  Lay 3 to 4 fish pieces, without crowding, in the pan and cook until browned, about 4 minutes on each side.  Transfer the fish to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven.  Repeat to cook the remaining fish, adding more oil as needed. 
To serve, arrange the fish, lettuce, avocado and tortillas with a bowl of chipotle sauce on a large platter.  For each taco, spoon some of the chipotle sauce down the center of the tortilla, top with some lettuce and avocado and 1 to 2 pieces of fish.  Fold up and eat out of hand. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  In addition to the zesty chipotle sauce, you might want to serve a salsa alongside as another option for these do-it-yourself tacos. 
You can also add a slice of mango or papaya, which counteracts the earthy, smoky flavor of the chipotle chiles.

                   Fish Tacos With Tropical Fruit Salad

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     ripe papaya -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  1              small  banana -- diced
  2                     green onions -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro or mint -- (to 3 tbspns)
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded and minced
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1              pound  skinless snapper fillet
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
  8                     fresh corn tortillas
  2               cups  finely-shredded red cabbage
                        or crisp lettuce
     1/2           cup  crumbled feta cheese
                        and/or shredded Jack cheese

Seafood Alternatives:  halibut, cod, rockfish, grouper 
Preheat the broiler.  In a medium bowl, combine the papaya, banana, onions, cilantro, jalapeÒo and 2 tablespoons of the lime juice. 
Rinse the fish and pat dry; lay on an oiled baking sheet.  Rub the fish with the remaining lime juice, garlic and cumin.  Broil 2 to 3 inches from heat until just opaque through the center, about 8 minutes (or grill over hot coals).  Break into large pieces and discard bones; arrange the fish on a serving plate. 
Meanwhile, coat an 8- to 10-inch frying pan with nonstick cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat.  Dip 1 tortilla quickly in a bowl of water, shake off excess, then lay in the heated pan.  Cook about 10 seconds on each side, or until the tortilla is limp.  Repeat with the remaining tortillas, stacking them on a plate when done.  Cover to keep warm. 
Fill the hot tortillas with fish, fruit salsa, cabbage and cheese. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Arrange bowls of salsa, cabbage and cheese around a platter of fish and tortillas, then let everyone assemble his or her own tacos.  In place of the papaya, you can use an 8-ounce can of pineapple tidbits, drained.

                      Fish With Curried Yogurt Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  firm white fish, such as
                        halibut or cod
  2               cups  plain yogurt
  1           teaspoon  cardamom pods -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds -- crushed
                        (or use ground cumin)
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2             quarts  vegetable oil -- for frying
     3/4           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  milk
     3/4           cup  fresh or dried breadcrumbs
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  plain yogurt
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients and stir to mix.  Taste for seasoning and refrigerate until needed. 
Rinse the fish fillets in cold water and dry thoroughly with paper towels.  Cut the fillets into 1/2-inch strips. 
In a shallow dish, combine the yogurt, cardamon, ginger, cumin, pepper and salt.  Add the fish strips to the yogurt mixture and stir to thoroughly coat.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 and up to 4 hours. 
Heat about 2 inches of oil to 375 degrees in a deep-fryer.  Put the flour in one shallow dish and season it with salt and pepper.  Put the milk in a second shallow dish and the breadcrumbs in a third. 
Take a strip of fish from the yogurt mixture and scrape the yogurt off with your fingers.  Put the fish in the flour and turn with two forks to thoroughly coat.  Shake off the excess. Dip in the milk and allow the excess milk to drip off, then coat the piece of fish with the breadcrumbs. 
Fry the fish a few pieces at a time until well browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  Transfer to paper towels to drain and keep warm in a low oven while you finish frying the fish. 
Serve immediately with the curry sauce alongside. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POTATO TOPPING ===
  3              large  russet potatoes -- peeled
     3/4           cup  milk -- more if needed
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  grated cheddar cheese - (abt 5 oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2         pounds  live mussels -- scrubbed, de-bearded
     3/4           cup  white wine
  1 1/2         pounds  cod or red snapper fillets -- skin and bones
                        removed
  1                cup  milk -- more if needed
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2                     celery stalks -- finely chopped
     1/2         large  onion -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- coarsely chopped

Cut the peeled potatoes into large chunks and put them in a pan of cold water.  Bring to a boil and simmer until the potatoes are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain well, then return the potatoes to the pan. 
Using a potato masher or large stiff whisk, coarsely mash the potatoes.  Add the milk and butter and continue mixing until smooth and fluffy; if necessary, add a few more tablespoons of milk.  Stir in the cheddar cheese and season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside. 
Put the mussels and white wine in a large pan and cook, covered, over medium-high heat, shaking the pan occasionally, until the mussels begin to open, 3 to 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the opened mussels to a bowl and let cool.  Discard any mussels that do not open. 
Pour the cooking liquids through a fine strainer into a small bowl.  Save the cooking liquids for making the sauce.  When the mussels are cool enough to handle, remove the meats from the shells and set aside; add any accumulated juices to the small bowl. 
Cut the fish fillets into 1 1/2-inch cubes.  Bring a large pan half-filled with water to a boil, add the fish cubes and simmer just until the pieces are opaque through (cut into one to test), about 5 minutes.  Gently pour the fish into a colander and drain well.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
Add enough milk to the mussel cooking liquid to make 2 cups.  In a medium saucepan, heat the butter, then add the celery and onion and cook over medium heat until beginning to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the flour and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring so the flour evenly coats the vegetables.  Add milk mixture and bring the sauce to a boil, stirring often, and cook until the sauce is thickened, about 3 minutes. 
Take the sauce from the heat, add the chopped mushrooms, mussels and fish and gently stir to mix well.  Taste the sauce for seasoning and pour it into a 2-quart baking dish (preferably oblong or oval).  Spoon the mashed potatoes over the fish mixture and spread evenly over.  Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are golden brown, about 30 minutes. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  Shepherd's Pie is a classic homestyle dish of meat and vegetable in gravy, topped with mashed potatoes.  Moving to the seashore, we combine mussels and fish in a tasty sauce under the blanket of potatoes mixed with cheese.  Any combination of cooked fish or shellfish work well here, a perfect use for leftovers.  In case of small drips while baking, make sure you put a piece of foil on the shelf below the dish to make clean-up easy.

  2        tablespoons  chopped onion
  1                     garlic clove -- minced or pressed
     1/2         pound  cod or other firm mild fish -- cut bite size
  1                can  garbanzo beans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed,
                        and drained again
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Seafood Alternatives:  halibut, orange roughy 
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and garlic and sautÈ until the onion is soft.  Add the fish and sautÈ until cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Transfer the fish and onion mixture to a large bowl and add the drained garbanzo beans and half the parsley. 
Combine the remaining olive oil, vinegar, cumin, salt and pepper in a jar with a tight-fitting lid, shake well and taste for seasoning.  Pour the dressing over the fish mixture and stir to mix.  Cover and chill, stirring occasionally, for up to 24 hours. 
Stir in the remaining parsley just before serving, taste for seasoning and serve at room temperature or slightly chilled. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3         pounds  lingcod fillets
  2        tablespoons  chopped peeled seeded cucumber
  1                cup  chopped peeled seeded tomato
  2        tablespoons  chopped red onion
  2        tablespoons  chopped green bell pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley or cilantro
     1/8      teaspoon  dry dill weed -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  lime juice -- plus
  2          teaspoons  lime juice
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil

Seafood Alternatives:  grouper, monkfish, swordfish 
Rinse the fish in cold water; pat dry with paper towels. Set aside. 
Combine the cucumber, tomato, red onion, green pepper, garlic, parsley, dill weed, olive oil and 2 teaspoons lime juice.  Mix well and chill for 30 minutes to blend flavors. 
Meanwhile, combine 3 tablespoons lime juice, pepper, hot pepper sauce and oil.  Marinate the fish in the mixture for 10 minutes.  Drain the fish, reserving the marinade. 
Grill the fish for 4 to 5 minutes.  Baste the uncooked side with reserved marinade.  Turn fish and continue to cook until the fish is opaque through the thickest part, 3 to 5 minutes longer. 
Serve with the chilled gazpacho topping. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Gazpacho, traditionally served as a soup, has been modified to make a refreshing and lowfat topping.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Condiments
                Salsa                           Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  dried cranberries -- (optional)
  2        tablespoons  seasoned rice vinegar
                        or white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  minced crystallized ginger
  1                     papaya -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  1                     pear -- halved, cored,
                        and diced
  6             ounces  strawberries -- stemmed and sliced

In a medium bowl, stir together the wine, cranberries, vinegar and fresh and crystallized ginger.  Let sit for 15 minutes, then add the papaya, pear and strawberries.  Toss to mix well and serve. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  Crystallized ginger is ginger that has been cooked in a sugar syrup and dried; its slightly sweet, peppery flavor is a delicious complement to the fruits in this salsa.  If you cannot find crystallized ginger, just use more of the fresh ginger.

                        Gingered Salmon In Phyllo

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  minced or grated ginger
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/4           cup  butter -- melted
  4             sheets  phyllo dough
  4                     salmon fillet pieces - (6 oz ea) -- skin and
                        bones removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
In a small bowl, stir together the ginger, lemon juice and lemon zest.  Add 1 tablespoon of the melted butter and set aside. 
Lay the phyllo sheets out flat and lift off one sheet, covering the rest with a dish towel to keep from drying out.  Lightly brush the phyllo sheet with melted butter and fold it in half crosswise.  Lightly brush the dough again. 
Place one of the salmon fillet pieces a few inches from the bottom of the dough.  Season the salmon with a little salt and pepper and drizzle with some of the ginger mixture. 
Fold the bottom portion of the dough up to partly cover the salmon.  Fold both edges in toward the center, then roll the fish upward to completely wrap it in the phyllo dough.  Lightly brush the top with some melted butter and set seam-side down on a baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients. 
Bake the salmon until the dough is nicely browned and crisp, 12 to 15 minutes. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Peppery ginger and tangy lemon marry well with rich salmon.  Choose fillet pieces of equal size, about 3 inches by 4 inches, so they will form evenly sized packets when wrapped in phyllo dough. 
Phyllo dough is usually in the freezer section near other frozen pastries.  Gingered Fruit Salsa would be wonderful alongside.

                 Gravlax (Fresh Salmon Marinated In Dill)

Recipe By     :Kathleen Stang

Categories    : Appetizers                      Fish (Ocean)
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     skin-on salmon fillets - (abt 2 lbs ea)
     1/4           cup  coarse (kosher) or regular salt
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  white or black peppercorns -- crushed or
                        coarsely ground
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh dill
                        Rye or dark cocktail bread slices -- (optional)
                        === MUSTARD DILL SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  stone-ground sweet mustard, sweet-hot
                        mustard, or country-style Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  sugar - (3 to 4 tspns if
                        using Dijon mustard)
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh dill weed
                        (or 1 1/2 tspns dry dill weed)

For the sauce, mix the mustard, vinegar and sugar in a small bowl.  Gradually whisk in the oil.  Stir in the dill.  Refrigerate, tightly covered, up to three days.  Whisk again before using.  Serve slightly chilled. 
Run your fingers down the flesh side of each fillet to locate the small pin bones and remove them with tweezers or needle-nose pliers.  Wipe the flesh with a damp paper towel.  Combine the salt, sugar and peppercorns in a small bowl.  Rub the mixture onto the flesh side of both fillets. 
Sprinkle the dill evenly over 1 fillet and lay the other fillet flesh-side down on top, placing the thin end of one over the thick end of the other.  Place the salmon in a large plastic bag, press out the air and seal tightly. 
Put the salmon on a platter and lay a cutting board or baking sheet on top and weight it down with three 1- to 2-pound cans of food.  Refrigerate 36 to 48 hours, turning the bag of fillets over every 12 hours. 
Lift fillets from the bag and discard the bag and accumulated liquid.  Scrape the seasonings off the fish and pat dry.  (Fillets can be wrapped in plastic and stored in the refrigerator up to 10 days before serving -- see note below.) 
Place one fillet, skin side down, on a large serving platter (with head end to the left for right-handed people).  Hold the knife blade tilted so you'll be slicing down through the fillet at a 45-degree angle (rather than straight up and down). 
Begin slicing at the head end, making a 1/8-inch-thick slice.  At the bottom of slice, turn the knife blade gently to separate the slice from the skin.  Using the knife, turn the slice over to the left as if turning the page of a book.  Continue cutting 1/8-inch slices on the angle, separating each from the skin and turning each slice over to partially overlap the previous one.  Repeat with remaining fillet. 
Garnish with fresh dill and serve with Mustard Dill Sauce and rye or dark bread. 
NOTE:  You can keep gravlax in the refrigerator up to 10 days after curing, serving it anytime withing that span.  Wrap sliced or unsliced gravlax in plastic and store in the coldest part of your refrigerator. 
This recipe yields 72 slices. 
Comments:  This traditional Scandanavian recipe often appears on Christmas Eve smorgasbords.  You can easily halve the recipe to serve a small gathering, too.  Buy one fillet and cut it in half cross-wise or select 2 equal-size pieces of center-cut fillet weighing 1 1/2 to 2 pounds total. 
Use previously frozen salmon or freeze fish at 0 degrees for 48 hours to kill any parasites that may be present.

                        Greek Phyllo Seafood Rolls

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- thawed
     3/4           cup  part-skim ricotta cheese
     1/3           cup  crumbled feta cheese
  1              large  lemon
  1           teaspoon  dried dill weed
                        (or 1 tbspn minced fresh dill weed)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1                cup  diced onion
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  6             ounces  cooked shrimp -- chopped if large
                        (or 3 oz ea cooked shrimp and crabmeat)
  16            sheets  phyllo dough -- thawed
     1/4           cup  melted butter -- more if needed

Squeeze the spinach with your hands to remove excess liquid.  Put the spinach in a large bowl with ricotta, feta, lemon zest, dill weed and pepper.  Stir to mix well. 
Heat the olive oil in a medium frying pan over medium heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is tender, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and stir 20 to 30 seconds.  Add the onion-garlic mixture to the bowl with the spinach and stir until well mixed.  Stir in the shrimp and set aside. 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Separate 1 sheet of the phyllo dough and lay it on the work surface with the long side toward you.  (Keep the stack of remaining dough covered with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying.)  Lightly brush the sheet with a little of the melted butter and lay another sheet evenly on top.  Lightly brush half of the top sheet with more butter and fold the other half over to make a rectangle 8 by 11 inches.  Lightly brush with a little more melted butter. 
Spoon a generous 1/4 cup of the filling along the bottom edge, leaving 1 inch of phyllo clear on all sides.  Lift the bottom end of the sheet and fold it over the filling.  Fold the sides over and press lightly; gently roll up.  Set the roll seam-side down on a lightly greased baking sheet (you will need 2 baking sheets).  Repeat to use the remaining filling and phyllo. 
Brush the tops of the rolls with melted butter and bake until golden, 25 to 30 minutes.  Serve hot or warm. 
This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  From spanakopita to baklava, the Greeks know how to use phyllo!  Here the flaky dough encloses a mixture of spinach, cheese and shrimp, lightly seasoned with lemon.  The rolls are easy to make and delicious to eat, particularly with a Greek salad of tomatoes, feta, olives and bell peppers alongside.

                    Greek Salad And Salmon Muffuletta

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Sandwiches                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  salmon fillet
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1           teaspoon  Dijon-style mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
  1             medium  tomato -- cored and sliced
     1/2           cup  crumbled feta cheese - (2 oz)
  12                    kalamata olives -- pitted and chopped
     1/4         small  red onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     regular or 10"-round loaf French bread -- (abt 1 lb)

Seafood Alternatives:  cooked shrimp, crabmeat, lobster meat, squid rings, catfish 
Preheat the broiler.  With tweezers or needlenose pliers, remove the bones from the salmon.  Lay the salmon skin-side down on a lightly oiled broiler pan.  Combine the oil, lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, mustard, thyme and oregano in a large bowl.  Brush the salmon with 1 tablespoon of the dressing. 
Broil, without turning, 2 to 3 inches from the heat until the salmon is just opaque through the center, about 8 minutes.  Take the fish from the pan; remove and discard the skin. 
While the salmon cooks, add the tomato, cheese, olives and onion to the remaining dressing and gently toss.  Cut the loaf of bread in half crosswise.  Hollow out the bottom half by picking out about 1/2 inch of the soft bread. 
Spread the vegetable mixture in the hollow and press down gently.  Top with with the salmon, cutting to fit the shape of the bread.  Drizzle the remaining dressing over the cut side of the bread top and press it over the salmon. 
Cut into wedges to serve, or wrap snugly in plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 1 day. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  Broiled salmon and Greek salad ingredients put a different spin on the popular Cajun sandwich traditionally filled with olives, cheeses and thinly sliced meats.  This is an easy sandwich to pack along on a picnic.

                          Greek Salad With Squid

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  cucumber
  2             medium  tomatoes
  1              large  green pepper
     1/2        medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  Greek or common black olives
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh oregano
                        (or 1 tspn dried oregano)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  squid tubes -- cut into 1/2" rings
  4             ounces  feta cheese -- crumbled

Cut the cucumber in half lengthwise, then again into quarters and finally crosswise into small chunks.  Core the tomatoes, then cut each into quarters, then across into small chunks.  Cut the core from the green pepper, and remove and discard the seeds and ribs inside.  Cut the pepper lengthwise into 1-inch strips, then across into chunks.  Put the cucumber, tomato, green pepper, onion and olives in a large bowl and set aside. 
In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, oil, oregano, a small pinch of salt and a generous pinch of pepper.  Stir vigorously with a fork and taste the dressing for seasoning.   Set aside. 
Bring a medium pan of salted water to a boil, add the squid rings and cook for 30 seconds.  Drain immediately, rinse with cold water and drain again thoroughly. 
Add the squid rings to the bowl of vegetables and pour over the dressing.  Stir gently to coat all the ingredients evenly with dressing; when squid is slightly warm it absorbs more flavors from the dressing. 
Sprinkle with the feta and set aside for about 1 hour, or let cool completely and pack into airtight containers for your picnic. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  A Greek-style salad is ideal for a picnic; with no lettuce to wilt, it holds up well for many hours.  The addition of tender rings of squid makes it a little more substantial...and nutritious.  In Greece, the salad would be accented with plenty of garlic, so feel free to add a minced clove or two if you like.

                          Greek Swordfish Salad

Recipe By     :Susan Volland
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Salads/Dressings                Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  sturdy rosemary branches -- about 8" long
  1                     lemon
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  chopped oregano
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  swordfish -- cut into 1" cubes
  8                     lettuce leaves
  2                     vine-riped tomatoes -- cut into wedges
  1                     English cucumber -- sliced
     1/2                red onion -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  feta cheese -- cut into 4 slices
     1/2           cup  kalamata olives
                        === DRESSING ===
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Juice of 1 lemon - (abt 3 tbspns)
  1           teaspoon  minced oregano or marjoram
  1           teaspoon  minced mint

Seafood Alternatives:  mahi-mahi, tuna 
Strip the leaves from the rosemary branches and mince enough to make 1 teaspoon; reserve the branches. 
Squeeze the juice from the lemon and cut the rind into chunks.  Put the juice and rind in a large bowl, add the olive oil, garlic, rosemary and oregano with a pinch of salt and pepper.  Add the swordfish cubes and stir to coat evenly; cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. 
For the salad dressing, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, oregano and mint in a small bowl and mix well.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside. 
Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat. 
Take the fish from the marinade and skewer the cubes on the stripped rosemary branches, about 5 per branch.  Grill the skewers until just cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. 
Meanwhile, assemble the salad.  Put 2 lettuce leaves on each plate, then top with tomato wedges, cucumber slices, onions, feta cheese and olives.  Drizzle the dressing over and set a swordfish skewer on each salad.  Serve right away, with warm pita bread alongside. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  A perfect quick-to-fix summer dinner:  swordfish is skewered on rosemary branches, grilled and served with vine-ripened tomatoes, onions and cucumbers fresh from the garden.

                       Green And Nutty Snapper Soup

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Seafood
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  red snapper fillet
  2              large  cucumbers
  4                     green onions -- cut 1" pieces
  4               cups  plain nonfat yogurt
  1                cup  packed mixed fresh herb leaves
                        (parsley, basil, cilantro, arugula,
                        chives)
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped walnuts
                        Herb sprigs -- (for garnish)

Seafood Alternatives:  halibut, cod, sea bass 
Rinse the red snapper fillet and pat dry with paper towels.  Preheat the charcoal grill or broiler and cook the fillet until opaque through the thickest part, 4 to 5 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness of the fillet.  Let cool. 
Halve the cucumbers, then scoop out and discard the seeds; cut into roughly 1-inch pieces.  Put half the cucumber with the green onions in the work bowl of a food processor.  Use the pulse button to coarsely chop; transfer to a large bowl.  Add the remaining cucumber, yogurt and herb leaves and process until smooth and frothy, 1 to 2 minutes longer. 
Alternatively, you can grate the cucumbers, finely mince the green onion and herbs and stir them together with the yogurt in a large bowl. 
Stir the lime juice into the soup with salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 and up to 8 hours; the longer it sits, the more the flavors will mellow. 
Meanwhile, break the cooled red snapper fillet into large chunks, discarding skin and bones.  Ladle the chilled soup into shallow bowls and add the red snapper.  Sprinkle the chopped walnuts over the soup, garnish with herbs and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Cucumbers add a naturally cool and refreshing element to this yogurt-based soup with chunks of cooked snapper.  Plenty of herbs, some lime juice and a sprinkling of chopped walnuts round out this delicious thick summer soup.

                    Green Goddess Grilled Salmon Salad

Recipe By     :Kathy Casey
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Salads/Dressings                Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  cut-up romaine and iceberg lettuce mix -- washed, well-dried
     1/2           cup  finely-shredded red cabbage
     1/4           cup  coarsely-grated carrot
  12            slices  cucumber
  12                    tomato wedges
  12                    pitted ripe black olives
  1              pound  skinless boneless salmon fillet -- cut 4 pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     lemon wedges
                        === GREEN GODDESS SALAD DRESSING ===
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  dry tarragon leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  minced or pressed garlic
  2        tablespoons  minced white onion
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
  2          teaspoons  minced anchovy fillets - (to 3 tspns)
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  sour cream

To make the dressing:  In a blender combine all the ingredients except the mayonnaise and sour cream.  Blend until the parsley is purÈed and the mixture is smooth.  Spoon the parsley mixture into a medium bowl and whisk in the mayonnaise and sour cream until smooth.  Refrigerate until needed. 
Heat the barbecue grill until the coals glow red with white ash around the edge. 
In a large bowl toss the lettuce with the red cabbage and carrot.  Divide the salad among 4 chilled dinner plates.  Arrange the cucumber, tomato and olives around the lettuce. 
Put the salmon pieces on the heated grill and season with salt and pepper as desired.  Cook the salmon until well marked, about 2 minutes, then turn and continue cooking until the fish is just cooked and still moist, 2 to 3 minutes longer.  Cooking time will vary with the thickness of the fillet. 
Put the grilled salmon on top of the salads and top each piece with 1 tablespoon of the Green Goddess dressing.  Garnish each plate with a lemon wedge and pass extra dressing alongside. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Green goddess is a classic American dressing created in the 1920s to honor an actor who was at the time performing in a play called, what else, "Green Goddess."  Here the dressing is brought back to life in an elegantly simple salad with grilled salmon.

To make the dressing:  In a blender combine all the ingredients except the mayonnaise and sour cream.  Blend until the parsley is purÈed and the mixture is smooth.  Spoon the parsley mixture into a medium bowl and whisk in the mayonnaise and sour cream until smooth.  Refrigerate until needed. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the barbecue grill until the coals glow red with white ash around the edge. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl toss the lettuce with the red cabbage and carrot.  Divide the salad among 4 chilled dinner plates.  Arrange the cucumber, tomato and olives around the lettuce. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the salmon pieces on the heated grill and season with salt and pepper as desired.  Cook the salmon until well marked, about 2 minutes, then turn and continue cooking until the fish is just cooked and still moist, 2 to 3 minutes longer.  Cooking time will vary with the thickness of the fillet. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the grilled salmon on top of the salads and top each piece with 1 tablespoon of the Green Goddess dressing.  Garnish each plate with a lemon wedge and pass extra dressing alongside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Green goddess is a classic American dressing created in the 1920s to honor an actor who was at the time performing in a play called, what else, &quot;Green Goddess.&quot;  Here the dressing is brought back to life in an elegantly simple salad with grilled salmon.

        Italian Clam And Vegetable Bowl With Toasted Garlic Bread

Recipe By     :Pamela Eimers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  red-skinned potatoes - (1 lb) -- scrubbed, and
                        cut into 3/4" cubes
  2             pounds  live small hard-shell clams -- (1" to 1 1/2" across)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- pressed or minced
  1              small  onion -- halved, and
                        thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  dried basil leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  dried rosemary
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed fennel seeds
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz)
  1              small  green zucchini -- sliced 1/2"-thick
  1              small  yellow zucchini or crookneck squash -- sliced 1/2"-thick
     1/4         pound  fresh green beans or edible pod peas -- trimmed

Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan and add cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife, about 15 minutes.  Drain the potatoes and cover to keep warm. 
Meanwhile, scrub the clams and discard any that are not tightly closed or that do not close when shells are pressed together.  Drain. 
In a large pan, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the garlic, onion, basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary and fennel seeds and stir until the onion is tender, about 6 minutes.  Quarter the tomatoes, reserving their juice.  Add the tomatoes and juice to the pan, cover and bring to a boil. 
Add the cooked potatoes, zucchini and beans.  Stir in the clams, cover and simmer until the shells open, 5 to 6 minutes.  Discard any clams that do not open. 
Divide the clams, vegetables and broth among 4 large bowls and serve immediately.  Pass toasted garlic bread separately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This chunky dish -- almost a soup but eaten partly by hand -- is full of clams, fresh vegetables and Italian herbs.  If you have herbs growing in your yard or on your windowsill, don't hesitate to use them here in place of the dried herbs, using roughly double what is called for.  Serve with toasted garlic bread for dunking in the flavorful broth.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  large carrots
  2           packages  chopped spinach - (10 oz ea) -- thawed
  4               cups  ricotta cheese
  2                     eggs
     1/3           cup  minced green onion
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  cooked fish (salmon, snapper, sea bass
                        and/or cod) -- flaked, skin and
                        bones removed
                        === SAVORY PIE DOUGH ===
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     2/3           cup  butter or shortening
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  water -- more if needed

To make the pie dough, put the flour, butter and salt in the work bowl of a food processor and pulse until the mixture has a sandy consistency.  Add the water and continue pulsing the food processor until the dough forms a ball, adding more water by the teaspoon as necessary. 
Alternatively, cut the butter into the flour with a pastry cutter, add the salt and sprinkle with water, stirring in just enough to form a ball. 
When the dough has formed a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 
Cut the carrots lengthwise in quarters, then across into about 1/4-inch dice.  Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil, add the carrots and cook until just crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain well and let cool.  Squeeze the spinach in your hands in batches to remove as much excess water as possible. 
Put the ricotta cheese in a large bowl and stir to soften slightly.  Add the eggs, green onions, salt and pepper and stir until evenly mixed and fluffy. 
Lightly oil a 10-inch springform pan or a 2-quart baking dish.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
Unwrap the chilled dough and set it on a lightly floured work surface; cut off about one third of the dough and set aside.  Roll out the dough to a roughly 18-inch circle. 
Transfer the dough to the springform pan, pressing the dough well into the corners, with the extra hanging over the edges, trimming them to about 1 inch. 
Scatter the well-dried spinach evenly over the bottom of the dough.  Top with half of the ricotta mixture, spreading evenly.  Scatter the fish over the ricotta and top with the remaining ricotta, spreading evenly.  Scatter the carrots over the ricotta, pressing down gently to help eliminate pockets. 
Roll out the remaining dough to a circle just large enough to cover the filling, trimming the dough if necessary.  Lay the circle over the filling and lightly brush the top and press to seal.  (If you like, you can use pieces of excess dough to decorate the top.) 
Bake the pie in the preheated oven until the dough is well browned, about 1 hour.  Let sit for 10 minutes before removing the sides of the springform pan.  If using another type of pan, carefully invert onto a cake rack, set a serving plate upside down on the upturned pie, and invert once again so it sits upright on the serving plate. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  This is a variation on the torta rustica recipes that are common throughout Italy.  Although they may have different fillings and crusts, all are generally thick pies layering cheeses and vegetables, fully enclosed in a rich pastry.  Here we add some fish to this hearty country pie.  If you have a springform pan, this is the time to use it. If you don't, you can use another dish at least 4 inches deep, but serving the pie will be more difficult.

<DirT>
To make the pie dough, put the flour, butter and salt in the work bowl of a food processor and pulse until the mixture has a sandy consistency.  Add the water and continue pulsing the food processor until the dough forms a ball, adding more water by the teaspoon as necessary. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Alternatively, cut the butter into the flour with a pastry cutter, add the salt and sprinkle with water, stirring in just enough to form a ball. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the dough has formed a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut the carrots lengthwise in quarters, then across into about 1/4-inch dice.  Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil, add the carrots and cook until just crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain well and let cool.  Squeeze the spinach in your hands in batches to remove as much excess water as possible. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the ricotta cheese in a large bowl and stir to soften slightly.  Add the eggs, green onions, salt and pepper and stir until evenly mixed and fluffy. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly oil a 10-inch springform pan or a 2-quart baking dish.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Unwrap the chilled dough and set it on a lightly floured work surface; cut off about one third of the dough and set aside.  Roll out the dough to a roughly 18-inch circle. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the dough to the springform pan, pressing the dough well into the corners, with the extra hanging over the edges, trimming them to about 1 inch. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Scatter the well-dried spinach evenly over the bottom of the dough.  Top with half of the ricotta mixture, spreading evenly.  Scatter the fish over the ricotta and top with the remaining ricotta, spreading evenly.  Scatter the carrots over the ricotta, pressing down gently to help eliminate pockets. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out the remaining dough to a circle just large enough to cover the filling, trimming the dough if necessary.  Lay the circle over the filling and lightly brush the top and press to seal.  (If you like, you can use pieces of excess dough to decorate the top.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the pie in the preheated oven until the dough is well browned, about 1 hour.  Let sit for 10 minutes before removing the sides of the springform pan.  If using another type of pan, carefully invert onto a cake rack, set a serving plate upside down on the upturned pie, and invert once again so it sits upright on the serving plate. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This is a variation on the torta rustica recipes that are common throughout Italy.  Although they may have different fillings and crusts, all are generally thick pies layering cheeses and vegetables, fully enclosed in a rich pastry.  Here we add some fish to this hearty country pie.  If you have a springform pan, this is the time to use it. If you don&apos;t, you can use another dish at least 4 inches deep, but serving the pie will be more difficult.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1            package  dry yeast - (abt 1 tbspn)
     1/3           cup  warm water -- (90 degrees)
  2                     eggs
  2          teaspoons  finely-minced fresh dill
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried dill weed)
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon zest
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  poppy seeds

In a small saucepan, bring the milk just up to a simmer, remove from heat and stir in the butter, sugar, and salt.  Let cool to lukewarm, stirring occasionally to dissolve the ingredients.  Pour into a large mixing bowl. 
Dissolve the yeast in the warm water, then stir it into the milk mixuture.  Whisk one of the eggs and stir it in along with the dill, lemon zest and garlic.  Mix in as much flour as needed to make a smooth, moist dough.  Knead until smooth.  Place in a large oiled bowl, turn the dough so both sides are oiled, cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. 
Punch down the dough and divide it into 6 pieces.  Roll into balls and let rest 10 minutes, covered with a towel.  With a well-floured rolling pin, roll the balls into 3 1/2-inch rounds.  Place on a greased baking sheet.  Cover lightly with a towel and let rise until almost doubled. 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a small bowl, whisk the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water.  Brush the tops of the buns lightly with egg wash, sprinkle with poppy seeds and put in the heated oven.  Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. 
Transfer to a cake rack to cool.  Extra buns may be wrapped when cool and frozen for later use. 
This recipe yields 6 buns.

                Condiments                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  butter - (1/2 cup)
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice -- plus
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1 1/2      teaspoons  grated lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  Tabasco sauce
  2          teaspoons  finely-minced parsley

In a mixer or food processor, whip all the ingredients except the parsley until smooth and emulsified.  (The butter will look broken at first, but keep whipping; it will come together and become smooth.)  Transfer to a bowl and stir in the parsley. 
Lemon Sour Cream Butter will keep for up to a week in the refrigerator, or it can be frozen.  If frozen, the butter should be re-whipped once thawed. 
This recipe yields about 1 cup for 16 servings. 
Comments:  A rich and creamy spread for topping grilled fish, basting seafood kebabs or spreading on grilled bread for a sandwich.  It's a perfect match for the "Barbecued Salmon Burgers On Lemon Dill Buns."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  seaweed -- (optional)
  6              small  sweet potatoes or yams - (abt 5 oz ea) -- scrubbed
  6                     corn ears -- shucked, husks
                        reserved, silk discarded
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt (if not using seaweed)
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried thyme)
  4                     live lobsters - (abt 1 1/4 lb ea)
  3             pounds  live clams
  3               cups  beer - (2 12-oz bottles)
                        (or 3 cups dry white wine)
                        Lemon wedges
                        Green Mayonnaise -- (see recipe)
                        Lemon Butter -- (see recipe)

Preheat an outdoor grill. 
Place a metal steamer rack in the bottom of a 16-quart pot at least 10 inches in diameter.  If using seaweed, place half of it on and under the steamer rack.  Add sweet potatoes (reserving 1 for the top as a "tester") and onions.  Stand corn along edge of pot, stem end down.  Sprinkle with pepper, salt (if using) and thyme. 
Add the lobsters.  Place the clams, tied loosley in cheesecloth, over the lobsters and the "tester" potato on top.  Pour beer or wine over.  Place a layer of seaweed and/or corn husks on the top and cover with the lid. 
Place the pot on fire grate over a white-hot fire (adding more briquettes first if necessary) or on a stove over high heat.  Cook until a strong gush of steam escapes (about 12 minutes on the stove, about 35 minutes on the grill). 
Reduce the stove heat to medium-high (leave the outdoor fire as is) and start timing.  Steam-cook for about 15 minutes or until the "tester" potato is tender and the lobsters are bright red. 
Discard the seaweed or corn husks.  Arrange the lobsters and other ingredients on a large serving platter.  Serve with Green Mayonnaise and/or Lemon Butter and lemon wedges. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Live oysters in the shell
                        Lemon and/or lime wedges
                        Citrus Splash -- (see recipe)
                        Pacific Rim Splash -- (see recipe)
                        Pink Peppercorn Mignonette -- (see recipe)

Rinse the oysters and scrub the shells with a vegetable brush to remove any debris.  Refrigerate until ready to shuck. 
Right before serving, shuck the oysters, discarding the top shell and inspecting the oysters for any bits of broken shell, picking them out carefully. 
Set the oysters on a platter spread with crushed ice and pine or spruce boughs, if using.  Pass the splashes separately, served very cold.  Guests can spoon a little over the just-shucked oysters, sampling the different types.  Serve the lemon or lime wedges on the side. 
This recipe yields ?? servings. 
Comments:  When serving freshly shucked oysters on a buffet, lay them on pine or spruce boughs for a stunning presentation.  Depending on the type of buffet and your guests tastes, count from 3 to 4 oysters per person.  The splashes can be made 2 days in advance and refrigerated.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  rice wine vinegar
  2 1/2    tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced shallot or red onion
  1         tablespoon  sake wine
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced English or regular cucumber
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced celery
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced red bell pepper
  1         tablespoon  very thinly-sliced green onion
  1           teaspoon  black sesame seeds -- (optional)

Combine the vinegar, honey, shallot, sake, black pepper, red pepper flakes and salt in a small non-corrosive saucepan.  Over high heat, bring the mixture just to a quick boil and then take the pan from the heat.  Let cool to room temperature and refrigerate until well chilled.  When the mixture is thoroughly chilled, add the remaining ingredients and refrigerate. 
This recipe yields 1 generous cup. 
Comments:  This is a tart and tangy twist on the mignonette traditionally served with raw oysters.  Diced vegetables add a refreshing crunch.

         Pink Peppercorn Mignonette For Oysters On The Half Shell

Categories    : Accompaniment                   Condiments
                Sauces                          Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  shallot -- finely minced
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  pink peppercorns -- crushed
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
     1/2           cup  raspberry vinegar or red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  honey

Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.  Take from the heat, let cool, then refrigerate until needed. 
This recipe yields 1 1/2 cups. 
Comments:  Yes, it's made with red wine!  A new twist on a traditional mignonette combination of red wine vinegar, pepper and shallot.  To crush whole peppercorns, set them on a chopping board, lay a heavy-bottomed pan on them and press down firmly.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  skinned salmon fillet
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  Asian chile sauce (sambal oelek) -- or more to taste
                        (or 1 tspn dried hot red pepper flakes)
  4               cups  cooked couscous or rice
     1/2         bunch  watercress -- rinsed, separated
                        (or 2 tightly-packed cups washed, torn
                        fresh spinach)
  18                    cherry tomatoes -- halved
  1                cup  minced fresh cilantro or Italian parsley
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped green onions

Seafood Alternatives:  catfish, snapper, halibut, mahimahi, swordfish 
Rub each side of the salmon with 1/2 teaspoon of the olive oil.  Grill the salmon over a medium-hot fire for 2 minutes per side to sear the outside.  Continue grilling over moderate fire toward the edge of the grill until opaque through but still moist, 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Alternatively, broil the salmon in the oven. 
Stir together the lemon juice, salt, chile sauce and remaining 1 tablespoon oil for the dressing.  In a large bowl, toss the couscous, watercress, tomatoes, cilantro and green onions. 
Pour the dressing over the couscous mixture and toss well to coat.  Break the salmon into large chunks, discarding any bone, and add it to the salad.  Gently toss and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Spiked with chile sauce and citrusy cilantro, quick cooking couscous and salmon are the perfect foils for these fiery flavors of the East.  Serve with warm, crusty bread.
