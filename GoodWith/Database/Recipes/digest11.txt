Categories    : Cheesecake                      Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  28                    vanilla wafers -- crumbled
  1                     egg white -- lightly beaten
  8             ounces  lowfat cream cheese
  16            ounces  Yogurt Cheese -- (see recipe)
                        = (or nonfat sour cream)
     1/2           cup  superfine sugar
  1                     egg
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
  2        tablespoons  amaretto liqueur
                        = (or 1 additional tspn almond extract)
     1/2           cup  nonfat sour cream
  5                     strawberry halves

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Coat an 8-inch springform pan with 3-inch sides with nonstick cooking spray.

In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine the wafer crumbs and egg white and pulse just to blend.  Transfer the crumb mixture to the prepared pan and press onto the bottom of the pan.

In a bowl, using an electric mixer set on medium speed, beat together the cream cheese, Yogurt Cheese or sour cream, and sugar until creamy, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the egg, flour, almond extract, and amaretto, if using, and beat to mix completely, 1 minute longer.

Spread the filling onto the prepared crust and smooth the top with a rubber spatula.  Bake until the center is set, about 1 hour.  Turn off the oven and, with the oven door slightly open, cool the cake completely in the oven, about 1 hour longer.  Cover the cooled cake and refrigerate until chilled, 2 to 3 hours.

To serve, remove the pan sides.  Carefully transfer to a serving plate.  Using a spatula, spread the sour cream over the top.  Garnish with the strawberry halves.  Cut into wedges.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  Lowfat and nonfat dairy products replace their richer counterparts in this version of a classic cheesecake.  Slow baking and cooling in the oven help prevent the surface from cracking.  The finished cheesecake, with topping, will be 1 inch high.

                     Black Olive And Tomato Tapenade

Recipe By     :Ford Rogers
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  pitted California ripe olives -- drained
  2        tablespoons  capers -- rinsed, drained
  2                     anchovy fillets -- rinsed, patted dry
  2                     garlic cloves -- whacked and peeled
  2        tablespoons  chopped onion
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh oregano leaves
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried oregano)
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh coriander or
                        parsley leaves -- (optional)

Combine all ingredients, except the tomato and coriander, in a blender or food processor.  Process, pulsing on and off and scraping down the sides of the container as needed, until smooth and well combined.  By hand, stir in the tomato.

If making ahead, refrigerate covered, then return to room temperature.  Serve garnished with coriander or parsley, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Tapenades are very rich pastes of olives, capers, anchovies, and olive oil.  Anchovy haters needn't worry, though, because the anchovy taste here becomes a part of the whole.  You can use any black olives you want --  Nyons and Kalamatas are very good.  This tapenade is also one of the best ways to spice up relatively bland, canned California ripe olives, and they're already pitted!  Use the tapenade on bruschetta or crackers, or as you would salsa or a crudite dip.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     eggplants -- cut 1/2" dice
                        Salt -- to taste
  2             ounces  anchovy fillets
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     celery sticks -- diced
     2/3           cup  passata (sieved tomatoes)
  3        tablespoons  wine vinegar
  1                     sweet yellow pepper -- seeded, and
                        thinly sliced
  1                     sweet red pepper -- seeded, and
                        thinly sliced
  2             ounces  capers -- roughly chopped
  2             ounces  ripe olives -- sliced
  2             ounces  green olives -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley

Put the diced eggplant in a colander, sprinkle with salt, and leave drain for 15 to 20 minutes to extract their bitter juices.  Rinse under running cold water to remove any sand and pat dry with paper towels.

Soak the anchovies in a little warm water in a bowl to remove some of its saltiness.  Remove, dry, and cut the anchovies into thin strips.  Set aside.

SautÈ the onion in the olive oil until soft and golden.  Add the celery and cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the eggplant and cook gently for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden.  Add the passata and cook gently until it has been absorbed by the eggplant.  Add the wine vinegar and cook for 1 minute.  Add the sweet peppers, anchovies, capers, and olives and cook for 3 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to an ovenproof dish and bake, covered, in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for about 1 hour.  After 40 minutes, stir in the pine nuts and return to the oven for the remaining 20 minutes.

Serve lukewarm or cold sprinkled with chopped parsley.  Flavors improve if made a day in advance.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        Coarse salt -- as needed
                        === UTENSILS YOU WILL NEED ===
                        Cookie sheet
                        Pastry brush
                        A medium bowl
                        Fork
                        Dry-Ingredient measuring cups
                        Liquid measuring cup
                        Measuring spoons
                        Rolling pin
                        A small bowl
                        Pot holders
                        Spatula
                        Wire cooling rack

Heat oven to 400 degrees.  Generously grease cookie sheet with shortening.

Mix all other ingredients in medium bowl with fork to make a dough.

Sprinkle a clean surface (such a kitchen counter or breadboard with flour.  Put dough on surface.  Roll ball of dough around 3 or 4 times.  Knead dough quickly and lightly by folding, pressing, and turning.  Repeat 10 times.

Divide dough in half.  Roll or pat half of the dough into 12- by 8-inch rectangle.

Adult help:  Cut dough lengthwise into eight 1-inch-wide strips.  Fold each strip lengthwise in half to make it more narrow.  Pinch the edges to seal.

Twist each strip into a pretzel shape.  Put pretzels, seam sides down, on cookie sheet.

Beat one large egg in small bowl with fork.

Brush pretzels with the beaten egg, then sprinkle lightly with coarse salt.

Bake 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove pretzels from cookie sheet with spatula to wire rack.  Cool.  Repeat making pretzels with the rest of the dough

Here's another idea...Make Peanutty Pretzels:  Leave out the cheese.  Use 2 tablespoons crunchy peanut butter in place of the margarine.  Use 2 tablespoons chopped salted peanuts in place of the coarse salt.

This recipe yields 16 pretzels.

                        use drumstlcks
  3              small  tomatoes -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Juice of 1/2 lime
                        A few curry leaves -- (optional)
     1/3           cup  cilantro leaves -- chopped

On a griddle or in a crÍpe pan toast the poppy seeds for a few minutes until light brown.  Crush with rolling pin, then soak in a little water for 15 minutes.

Grind the coconut with the poppy and fennel seeds, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, turmeric, and garam masala to make a fine paste.

Heat the oil in a large shallow cooking pot and sautÈ the onion until lightly colored.  Add the ginger and garlic, then 2 minutes later add the star anise, cayenne pepper, and the spice paste.  SautÈ for 5 minutes.

Add the chicken and sautÈ for 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes.  When the chicken has absorbed the tomato juice, add 2 cups water and salt to taste and mix well.  When almost done, add the lime juice and curry leaves.  Just before serving, sprinkle with the cilantro leaves.

This recipe yields 5 servings.

Comments:  Chettinad is the region in Southern Tamil from where the Chettiars, the trader and mercantile community of the region, originate.  Chettinad cuisine is hot.  The chicken, is always cut in very small pieces on the bone.  Since it is dryish, this dish can be eaten with a flavored rice like lemon or tomato rice.

  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  crushed garlic
     3/4           cup  chopped onions
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped carrots
  1                cup  sliced mushrooms
  1                cup  diced sweet potatoes
  5               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  canned red kidney beans or chick peas -- drained
  6             ounces  boneless skinless chicken breast -- diced
  1                cup  chopped broccoli
     1/3           cup  small shell pasta
                        = (or broken linguine)
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley

In large nonstick saucepan, heat oil; sautÈ garlic, onions, and carrots until tender, approximately 7 minutes.  Add mushrooms and sautÈ for 4 minutes.

Add sweet potatoes, stock, and beans.   Cover and simmer on low heat for 12 minutes or until sweet potatoes are just tender.

Add chicken, broccoli, and pasta; simmer for 7 minutes or until pasta and chicken are cooked.  Sprinkle with parsley.

                    Coffee Cream With Bitter Chocolate

Recipe By     :Malcom Hillier
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  strong black espresso coffee -- freshly made
  3 1/2         ounces  semisweet chocolate -- broken small pieces
  1 1/3           cups  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  dark rum
  4                     Amaretti cookies -- broken up

Add the sugar to the freshly made coffee and stir until dissolved.  Leave it to cool.

Melt the chocolate pieces in a glass bowl over a pan of simmering water, or in a double boiler.  Alternatively, melt the chocolate in a bowl in the microwave on medium, taking care not to overheat it.

Pour the chocolate on a piece of waxed paper and spread it out with a spatula until it is 1/8-inch thick.  Place the paper in the freezer for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, beat the cream until it begins to thicken; then slowly add the cooled coffee together with the rum.  Continue to beat until the coffee cream holds stiff peaks.

Fold the Amaretti cookies into the cream mixture.  Spoon the cream into glasses.

Remove the chocolate from the freezer and cut into rough shards or triangles.  Decorate the coffee creams with the chocolate shards, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The flavors of coffee and chocolate seem to be made to go together.  Here they are used to create a dramatic confection that is actually very easy to make.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  couscous
     1/3           cup  roasted peppers - (abt 1/2 jar) -- diced small
  1                cup  frozen peas
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  2                     scallions -- sliced thin
  1         tablespoon  oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon JuIce
  1              pinch  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper

Place the couscous in a bowl and add the peppers.

Rinse the peas in hot water for a minute or microwave them for 1 minute, then add them to the couscous.

Pour the water over the couscous.  Cover and set aside for 15 minutes.

Add the rest of the ingredients and toss.  Serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Most of the couscous on the market is of the instant variety.  All it requires is 1 1/2 cups water or other liquid per 1 cup couscous.  The water should be warm; tap water is just fine.  Pour it over the couscous and set the couscous aside, covered, for about 15 minutes.  Voila!  Couscous.  It doesn't get any easier.  You don't even have to know how to boil water for this one.

        Crispy Twice-Cooked New Potatoes With Mixed Sauteed Greens

Recipe By     :Georgeanne Brennan
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             medium  fine-fleshed boiling potatoes - (to 6)
                        = (such as Yukon Gold, Yellow Finn, or
                        White Rose)
                        Salt -- to taste, plus
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  Rosemary-Infused Olive Oil -- (see recipe)
                        = (or olive oil)
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/2                yellow onion -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh chives
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  4               cups  assorted sturdy young greens -- coarsely chopped
                        = (such as kale, red and green chard,
                        beet tops, escarole, and spinach, in any
                        combination)
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Peel the potatoes (or leave unpeeled, if you prefer) and cut them into 1-inch cubes.  Place the potatoes in a saucepan with water to cover and add salt to taste.  Bring to a boll and cook, uncovered, until tender and easily pierced with the tip of a knife, about 20 minutes.  Drain and set aside.  (This step can be done well in advance of the second cooking.)

For the second cooking, combine 3 tablespoons of the oil and 3 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet and place over medium heat.  When they begin to foam, add the onion and garlic and sautÈ until translucent, 3 or 4 minutes.  Add the potatoes and sprinkle them with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.  Cook until they are crisp and golden on one side, 7 or 8 minutes.

Turn the potatoes with a spatula and fry until golden, 6 or 7 minutes longer.  Sprinkle them with the chives and parsley.

To sautÈ the greens, put the remaining 1 tablespoon each butter and olive oil in a large skillet over low heat.  When the butter and oil begin to foam, add the greens, cover, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.  Uncover and stir the greens.  They should be wilted but still retain their bright color.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and the pepper.

Spoon the potatoes onto a warmed serving plate and arrange the greens alongside.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The second cooking seals the potatoes and forms a crunchy outer crust, leaving the inside moist and succulent.  When combined with the lively flavors of mixed sautÈed greens, the potatoes become a very satisfying dish.

                            Deluxe Pound Cake

Recipe By     :Linda Hegman and Barbara Hayford
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  room temperature butter -- cut into tablespoons
  3               cups  granulated sugar
  6              large  eggs
  3               cups  sifted all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  heavy or whipping cream

Generously grease a 12-cup Bundt pan or 10-inch tube pan.

In a large bowl and with an electric mixer set on medium speed, cream together butter and sugar for 10 minutes.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stop mixer and scrape down bottom and sides of bowl as necessary.

Set mixer on low speed.  Gradually add flour, beating until just incorporated.  Beat in vanilla.  Add cream and beat until blended.

Spread batter evenly into prepared pan.

Place in the middle of a cold oven.  Set oven temperature at 325 degrees and bake for 1 hour and 25 minutes or until cake tester inserted in center comes out clean.

Remove from oven onto a wire rack and cool completely, 2 hours.  To remove from pan, run a sharp knife along outside and inside edges of cake.  Carefully invert onto a serving plate.

Cut into slices.  Serve at room temperature with a cup of coffee.  Cover remaining cake.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  This homemade pound cake is hard to beat.  Serve it plain or dressed, with fresh fruit or cream, iced or whipped.  Sober or sauced, it has as many uses as the basic black dress.

Place in the middle of a cold oven.  Set oven temperature at 325 degrees and bake for 1 hour and 25 minutes or until cake tester inserted in center comes out clean.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from oven onto a wire rack and cool completely, 2 hours.  To remove from pan, run a sharp knife along outside and inside edges of cake.  Carefully invert onto a serving plate.

<DirT>
Cut into slices.  Serve at room temperature with a cup of coffee.  Cover remaining cake.

Comments:  This homemade pound cake is hard to beat.  Serve it plain or dressed, with fresh fruit or cream, iced or whipped.  Sober or sauced, it has as many uses as the basic black dress.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    chicken drumsticks
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
                        === SPICY COATING ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar
  2        tablespoons  ketchup
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1              small  onion -- quartered
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  1              large  garlic clove -- coarsely crushed
     1/4      teaspoon  chili powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Make the Spicy Coating:  PurÈe the oil, vinegar, ketchup, mustard, onion, sugar, garlic, chili powder, and salt and pepper to taste in a food processor until fairly smooth.

Make 3 deep cuts in each chicken drumstick, arrange in a single layer in a shallow ovenproof dish, and spoon the spicy coating over them.  Sprinkle with half of the sesame seeds.

Bake in a 375 degree oven, basting, for 30 minutes, until the drumsticks are cooked.  Turn halfway through cooking and sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds.

This recipe yields 12 drumsticks.

Red Chili Variation:  Omit the spicy coating.  Combine 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 4 crushed garlic cloves, 1 1/2 tablespoons paprika, 1 tablespoon mild chili powder, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, and 1/4 teaspoon oregano.  Coat the drumsticks; wrap each one in a slice of bacon.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.  Bake in a 375 degree oven for 30 minutes or until the drumsticks are cooked through.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     white fish steaks - (5 oz ea)
                        = (e.g. striped bass, halibut or
                        angler fish)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === MARINADE ===
  5        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
                        === TOMATO SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2         pounds  tomatoes -- skinned, chopped
  4                     anchovy fillets -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped oregano

Wash the fish steaks under running cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Put all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and mix well together.

Add the white fish steaks to the marinade, turning them until they are thoroughly coated and glistening with oil.  Cover the bowl and leave in a cool place for at least 1 hour.

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet.  Remove the fish steaks from marinade and fry gently until they are cooked and golden brown on both sides, turning the fish once during cooking.  Remove the steaks from the skillet and keep them warm.

While the fish steaks are cooking make the tomato sauce.  Heat the olive oil and sautÈ the garlic until just golden.  Add the tomatoes and chopped anchovies, and cook over medium heat until the tomatoes are reduced to a thick pulpy consistency.  Season to taste with salt a pepper.  Pour the sauce over the fish and serve sprinkled with oregano.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  chicken pieces
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1              slice  smoked bacon, 1/4" thick
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  crumbled dried tarragon
  1                can  stewed tomatoes - (8 oz)
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                     chicken bouillon cube -- broken into pieces
  1            package  frozen green peas - (8 oz) -- thawed
  3             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" rounds
  12                    tiny red new potatoes
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Salt -- to taste

Salt the chicken. pieces and dredge them lightly in the flour, brushing off and saving the excess.

Trim off and discard the bacon rind.  Slice the bacon across the width into 1/4-inch pieces.

Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed kettle and brown the bacon lightly.  Remove and set aside.  Brown the chicken pieces in batches, removing them as they finish browning.

Remove and discard all but 3 tablespoons of the frying fat.  Add the onion, pepper, tarragon, and the remaining flour.  Scrape these back and forth in the hot fat until the onion is transparent.

Add the tomatoes and their juice and continue the scraping action until most of the juice has evaporated.  Then add 1 1/2 cups of water, the wine, and the crumbled bouillon cube.

Add the bacon, chicken, peas, and carrots.  Cover and simmer gently for 30 minutes.

Scrub the new potatoes under cold running water and pare off a 1-inch strip around the middle of each one, leaving the peel on the ends.  Add them to the stew and simmer for 20 minutes.

Stir in the parsley.  Salt to taste, and serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Make this stew once, and you'll be persuaded that it's well worth making again and again.

                                Garlic Dip

Recipe By     :Anissa Helou

Categories    : Accompaniment                   Condiments
                Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  garlic cloves
     1/4      teaspoon  sea salt
  1                     egg yolk -- (optional)
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon -- or to taste
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  strained yogurt

Peel the garlic and chop it in small pieces before putting it in a mortar.  Add the salt and pound the garlic with a pestle until you have smooth paste.

Whisk the egg in a mixing bow and add the garlic paste.  Stir in the lemon juice, then slowly whisk in the olive oil to achieve a creamy aioli; if the dip is not thick enough, add more olive oil, and, if you find the taste too strong, add a table≠spoon (or more) strained yogurt.

It would be easier to prepare this dip in the blender or food processor, but you will need a larger quantity of garlic for the size of the blender's bowl; double or triple the quantities but keep to 1 egg yolk (if you are using it).

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This is an essential accompaniment to grilled chicken or quail.  It is particularly tasty except that it will turn you into a social leper for a good 24 hours after you eat it.  Still garlic is reputed to be very health and as long as you share this dip with the people you will spend time with afterwards, you don't need to worry.  The traditional garlic dip is made with only garlic, lemon juice and olive oil but it does not rise as well as when you add an egg yolk, so you have the choice to make a proper aioli with an egg yolk.

                        Garlicky Beans And Greens

Recipe By     :Susan Wyler
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     large bunch kale (abt 2 lbs)
  1                     large bunch collards (1 1/2 lbs)
  6                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                can  reduced-sodium chicken broth - (12 3/4 oz) -- diluted with
  2               cups  water
  1                     chipotle chile
                        = (or other small dried hot pepper)
  2               cans  Great Northern white beans - (15 oz ea) -- rinsed, drained
  1 1/2    tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Rinse the greens well and remove any very tough stems.  Tear the leaves into bite-size pieces.  There will be about 1 1/2 pounds (4 to 6 cups packed).

In a large flameproof casserole, cook the garlic in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the slices just begin to turn golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Immediately pour in the stock and add the dried pepper.

Raise the heat to moderately-high and add the greens gradually, stirring them in until they are wilted. over the pot, reduce the heat to moderately-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the greens are tender, about 4 minutes.

Stir in the beans.  Add the lemon juice and vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a good vegetarian dish all by itself or you could serve it over pasta, in which case it would be enough for 6 to 8 servings.  While it looks like there is a mountain of the raw greens, once they are trimmed and cooked, they reduce in volume substantially.

This dish is best freshly prepared.  It can be reheated after up to 2 days in the refrigerator.  Not recommended for freezing.

                       Garlicky Steamed Artichokes

Recipe By     :Pat Baird
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  artichokes - (abt 6 oz ea)
  5              large  garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped parsley -- divided
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Cut off stems of the artichokes to be flush with the bottoms.  Slice off about 1 inch from the top of the globe.  Remove and discard any coarse outer leaves if necessary.  Using kitchen shears, snip off any thorny tips, about 1/4 inch from the top of the remaining leaves.

Place the artichokes in a 10-inch round microwavable baking dish or glass pie plate.  Spread open the leaves of each artichoke and insert a little of the chopped garlic between each leaf until all the garlic is used up.  Sprinkle with pepper and half of the chopped parsley.  Drizzle oil over the artichokes.  Pour in 1/4 cup water and add salt. Cover tightly with vented plastic wrap.  Microwave on high for 12 to 16 minutes, or until the bottoms pierce easily with a knife.  Rotate the dish every 4 minutes.  Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.

(At this point, the artichoke may be refrigerated and served at a later time, either reheated or at room temperature.)  Before serving, drain well, sprinkle with remaining parsley and additional pepper, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Artichokes are so delicious when steamed simply with garlic and parsley that a sauce is unnecessary.  Garlic fans will be in their glory with this version, those more timid might prefer to use fewer cloves.  Cilantro, oregano, capers, Parmesan cheese, and even a touch of grated ginger can make nice flavor variations.  Add your favorites when spreading the leaves and inserting the garlic.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  onion -- cut small dice
  6             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3/4" pieces
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2               cups  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  Vanilla Vinegar (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large, heavy-bottomed sautÈ pan, sautÈ the onion and carrots in the butter over high heat for 3 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add the wine and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to moderately-low and cook for 20 minutes or until the carrots are tender and the wine has evaporated.  Add the vanilla extract, brown sugar, and vanilla vinegar.  Cook over moderate heat for 3 to 4 minutes or until the carrots are coated with a medium-brown glaze.  Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  These sweet-savory carrots are particularly good with smoked ham or turkey,  but they would also be delicious with roast chicken or pork tenderloin.

         Gratin Of Cherry Tomatoes With Ricotta And Basil Topping

Recipe By     :Georgeanne Brennan
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             pounds  cherry tomatoes
                        = (preferably a mixture of red and yellow)
     1/4           cup  fine dried bread crumbs
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh basil
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  ricotta cheese
  2                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  heavy cream

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Choose a shallow baking dish that is just large enough to hold the tomatoes snugly packed in a single layer.  Using 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, grease the bottom and sides of the dish.  Add the tomatoes, rolling them around to coat them with the oil.

In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, garlic, 5 tablespoons of the basil, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper.  Sprinkle half of the mixture over the oiled tomatoes.

In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, the remaining 3 tablespoons basil and 1/2 teaspoon salt, the eggs, flour, and cream.  Stir until well blended and creamy.  Pour this mixture over the crumb-topped tomatoes.  Sprinkle with the remaining bread crumb mixture and drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.

Place in the oven and bake until the cheese is slightly browned and the tomatoes have not yet burst, about 15 minutes.  Serve hot or at room temperature, spooned onto individual plates.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  The tomatoes, bound together and scantily covered with the custardy ricotta mixture, come out of the oven piping hot, their plump rounds still intact and waiting for the fork.

             Greek Salad With Feta Cheese And Kalamata Olives

Recipe By     :Ford Rogers
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  torn mixed greens
  1              small  cucumber -- thinly sliced
  1             medium  tomato -- cut thin wedges
  1              small  green bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        thinly sliced
  8                     red radishes -- thinly sliced
  8                     pepperoncini - (to 12) -- optional
  24                    unpitted Kalamatas
  8                     dolmati - (to 12) -- optional
                        = (stuffed grape leaves)
  6             ounces  Feta cheese
  4          teaspoons  finely-chopped oregano leaves
                        = (or 1 1/2 tspns dried oregano)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4        tablespoons  red wine vinegar - (to 6)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Divide the greens among four plates, or spread in a wide, shallow serving bowl.  Scatter the cucumber, tomato, bell pepper, and radish slices over them.  Divide up the pepperoncini, Kalamatas, and dolmati among the plates, or spread out around the serving bowl.  Crumble Feta in the center, sprinkle with oregano, and drizzle with oil, then vinegar.

Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.  Pass the oil and vinegar to anyone who wants more.  (You may choose to allow each person to add their own oil and vinegar at the table, rather than putting it onyourself.)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This salad can be made large enough to be a whole meal or small enough to be a course in a large repast.  You'll need to serve something else with it, but not four or five courses.  Feel free to adjust the size.  Some of the ingredients may be unfamiliar to you.  Pepperoncini are small, pale green mild peppers, available in most markets bottled in brine.  Dolmati are grape leaves, stuffed with rice, spices, and sometimes, lamb.  They are best fresh, but are also available in cans and jars.  Kalamata olives are traditional, but you may substitute Greek black, Gaeta, Naphlion, NiÁoise or Royal Victoria.

                             Grilled Chicken

Recipe By     :Anissa Helou
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              small  chickens, free-range if available
                        === GARLIC MARINADE ===
  8              large  garlic cloves -- peeled and crushed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Juice of 1 lemon -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Garlic Dip -- (see recipe)

Cut the chickens in half, rinse un≠der cold water, and pat dry with pa≠per towels.  Mix the marinade well and rub the chicken halves all over with it, keeping any excess to baste the chicken with.

By far the best grilling method is over an open charcoal fire, weather and availability permitting.  Other≠wise use a hot grill, keeping the rack further away than you would with flatter pieces of meat.  This will allow you to cook the chicken thoroughly without burning the skin.  Cook for 30 minutes on one side, then turn over the chicken and cook for an≠other 30 minutes or until done.

You can also roast the chicken in a preheated 400 degree hot oven, putting the halves on a rack.  Cook for 1 hour, basting with the marinade and a little water during cooking.  Serve hot with the Garlic Dip.

You can prepare and grill quails the same way.  Instead of cutting them in half, flatten them out by cutting them open at the spine, force the birds open so that the breasts are flat.  Grill for about 15 to 20 minutes on each side.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  In Lebanon, very small chickens, more like poussins, are used for grilling.

                          Ham With Cherry Sauce

Recipe By     :Malcom Hillier
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham                             Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  sour cherry jam
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed, left whole
  4        tablespoons  red wine
  4        tablespoons  chicken stock
                        = (made with a bouillon cube)
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1              pinch  ground mace
  8             slices  smoked ham - (abt 1 lb)
                        Parsley sprigs -- to garnish

Place the jam, garlic, wine, stock, butter, and mace in a skillet.  Heat gently, stirring, until the jam and butter have melted.

Add the slices of ham to the skillet and simmer over medium heat for about 4 minutes, until the sauce has reduced by half and the ham is hot.

Remove the garlic clove.  Serve the ham with the sauce and garnish with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variation:  There are several simple variations on this recipe -- all work equally well.  If sour cherry jam is unavailable, use black cherry jam and add the juice of half a lemon.  Try making the sauce with red currant jelly, and substitute slices of tongue, corned beef, turkey, pastrami, or smoked loin of pork for the ham.

Comments:  This makes a great lunch or supper treat that is simplicity itself to prepare.

                     Irene's Mustard-Glazed Ham Loaf

Recipe By     :Janet Hazen
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham                             Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  3        tablespoons  Coleman's dry mustard
  3        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
  1              pound  finely-ground boneless smoked ham
  1              pound  finely-ground fresh lean pork shoulder
  1                cup  finely-ground Ritz crackers
  3        tablespoons  whole yellow mustard seeds
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     3/4           cup  whole milk

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease an 8 1/2- by 4 1/2-inch loaf pan.

To make the glaze, in a small bowl combine the brown sugar, dry mustard, and vinegar to form a smooth mixture.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, place the ham, pork, crackers, mustard seeds, pepper, eggs, and milk.  Using your fingers, gently mix the ingredients until just combined.  Do not overmix.

Transfer the mixture to the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top.  Using a sharp fork, poke holes into the entire surface of the ham loaf.  Bake on the lower shelf of the oven for 35 minutes.

Remove the ham loaf from the oven and carefully pour the glaze over the top, making sure it goes into the meat rather than over the sides of the pan!  Return to the oven and bake on the top shelf 10 to 12 minutes, or until the glaze is hot and several shades darker.  Let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

          Lasagna With Turkey Sausage, Green Peppers, And Onions

Recipe By     :Jack Bishop
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     onions -- peeled, and
                        chopped coarse
  1              pound  low-fat turkey sausage
  2                     green bell peppers -- chopped
  1             recipe  Quick Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  18                    dried lasagna noodles
  1              pound  mozzarella cheese -- shredded

Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet.  Add onions and cook over medium heat until very soft and translucent, about 10 minutes.  Squeeze sausage from casings directly into the skillet and use a fork to crumble meat.

When sausage has browned, about 5 minutes, add green peppers.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until peppers have softened slightly but are not mushy, about 5 minutes more.  Stir in tomato sauce and season with salt and pepper.  Simmer for 5 minutes to blend flavors and set aside.

Cook and drain pasta.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Grease a 13- by 9-inch lasagna pan.  Smear several tablespoons of sauce (without large chunks of vegetables or meat) across bottom.  Line bottom with a layer of pasta, making sure noodles touch but do not overlap.  Spread about 1 cup sauce over pasta and sprinkle with 2/3 cup cheese.  Repeat layering of pasta, sauce, and cheese four more times.  For the sixth layer, cover pasta with remaining 1/2 cup sauce and sprinkle generously with remaining 1 cup cheese.

Bake lasagna until cheese turns golden brown in spots and sauce is bubbling, about 20 minutes.  Remove pan from oven, let lasagna settle for 5 minutes, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Cook's Note:  To save even more calories, omit the olive oil and coat the skillet with a thin film of vegetable spray before sautÈing the onions.

Comments:  This surprisingly quick recipe combines sausage, peppers, and onions in a light, flavorful tomato sauce.  Best of all, it is quite lean but sacrifices nothing in flavor.

               Lentil And Swiss Chard Soup With Lemon Juice

Recipe By     :Anissa Helou
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  large green lentils
  14            ounces  Swiss chard
  6 3/4           cups  water
  10                    garlic cloves -- peeled and crushed
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Juice of 2 lemons -- or to taste
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Spread the lentils on a platter and pick them clean of any impurities.

Wash the Swiss chard, trim the dirty bottom ends of the stalks, if any, and chop into thin strips about 1/2-inch wide.

Put the lentils and water in a large saucepan and place over a high heat.  Bring to the boil, add the chopped chard, reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan, and boil gently for 15 minutes.  Mix the softened chard and the lentils well and cook covered for another 45 minutes or until the lentils are tender.

In the meantime peel the garlic cloves, chop them coarsely, and put them in a mortar.  Add a generous pinch of salt to absorb the juices released from the crushed garlic and pound with a pestle until you have a smooth paste.  You could squeeze the garlic with a garlic crusher but the texture and taste of pounded garlic is finer.

Slowly incorporate the lemon juice into the garlic paste, then the olive oil.  When the lentils and chard an done, stir the garlic mixture into the soup.  Season with salt to taste and simmer uncovered for 5 minutes.

Taste, adjust seasoning if necessary and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Serve this cold summer soup as a light vegetarian brunch.

                       London Broil Stewed In Stout

Recipe By     :Jacques Burdick
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  London broil, cut at least 1" thick
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4                strip breakfast bacon -- cut 1/4" pieces
  1                     plump garlic clove -- peeled, and
                        cut lengthwise into small spikes
  1                     bay leaf
  1              large  onion -- sliced 1/4" thick
  1                cup  stout or dark ale
  1         tablespoon  honey
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.

To prevent the meat from curling, trim off and discard the integument that surrounds it.

Pat the meat dry with paper towels and sprinkle it all over with half the salt and pepper.  Dredge with the cornstarch, patting it well into the meat.

Pierce the beef through in half a dozen places.  Press the thyme leaves into the bacon pieces and force a piece of bacon and a garlic spike into each of the holes in the meat.

Lightly oil a heavy-bottomed braising pan.  Place the bay leaf in the center of the pan and the meat on top of it.  Pile the onion slices on top of the meat.

Mix the stout, honey, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce and pour over the onions.  Sprinkle on the rest of the salt and pepper.

Cover the mound of meat and onions with a sheet of waxed paper.  Seal the pot with two thicknesses of foil and press the lid down firmly.

Put the pot in the oven and bake, undisturbed, for 3 hours.

Serve the beef hot, with the thin sauce poured over it.  Carve it at the table.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  The natural sauce from the beef will be full-bodied but thin.  You can "finish" it by adding 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce and a thickening of 3 tablespoons of cornstarch dissolved in 3 tablespoons of cold water.  When the sauce has cooked and thickened sufficiently, salt it to taste and pour it over the meat.  Jane Grigson suggested that the best accompaniment to this dish is creamy mashed potatoes.  Other fine complements are purÈed turnips and buttered noodles.

London broil is a good, economical cut of beef that is usually grilled, sliced, and served au jus.  The cut can be prepared many ways, however; it is really fine pot-roasted, braised, or "swissed" (floured, browned, and braised until tender).  Here is a simple way of pot-roasting it suggested by those incomparable English cooks, the late Elizabeth David and Jane Grigson.  Aside from transforming the sometimes tough, intractable London broil into a perfectly tender, daubelike dish, this way of preparing it is very easy.  Once sealed up and put in the oven, the dish requires no attention for 3 hours, and it produces plenty of natural rich gravy.

        Macaroni And Cheddar Cheese Gratin With Tangy Beet Relish

Recipe By     :Marlena Spiel
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  pasta such as farfalle, pennine (small
                        quills), elbows, etc.
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  hot milk
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             ounces  fresh and blanched -- or frozen, peas
  14            ounces  Cheddar cheese -- grated
  1                     onion -- chopped
  4                     beets -- cooked and diced
  1              pinch  sugar or a little honey -- (optional)
  3          teaspoons  red or white wine vinegar

Cook the pasta until al dente; drain.

Melt the butter in a saucepan, sprinkle with the flour and cook for a few minutes, then remove from the heat and stir in the milk.  Return the saucepan to the heat, and cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens.  Season with the garlic, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.

Combine the pasta with the sauce, the peas, and three-quarters of the cheese.  Spoon into a baking dish and top with the remaining cheese.  Bake in the oven at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes, until the cheese topping is crusty and golden.

Meanwhile, prepare the relish:  Combine the onion, beets, sugar or honey (if using), and vinegar.  Serve each portion of hot baked pasta with a spoonful of the cool tangy relish alongside.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  The relish keeps this dish from being ordinary, and its tanginess lifts the heavier nature of the baked pasta.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  Cheddar cheese
  1              small  zucchini
  1              small  carrot
  8             ounces  elbow macaroni
     3/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  plain lowfat yogurt
     1/4           cup  prepared Italian dressing
                        Salt -- to taste

                        Carrot curls -- (optional)

In a large saucepan, bring 3 quarts water to a boil over high heat.  Meanwhile, using a hand grater or food processor, coarsely grate cheese, zucchini, and carrot into a large bowl; set aside.

Add macaroni to the boiling water and cook according to package directions or until it is tender but still firm to the bite.  Stir mayonnaise, yogurt, and Italian dressing into the cheese and vegetables.

Drain the macaroni in a colander and rinse with cold water until the macaroni is cold, 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir the well-drained macaroni into the cheese mixture.  Season with salt and pepper.

Transfer the macaroni salad to a serving bowl and garnish with carrot curls, if desired.  Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

       Marinated Beets And Onions With Shallot-Poppy Seed Dressing

Recipe By     :Linda & Fred Griffith
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil - (to 2)
  1 1/2         pounds  trimmed beets - (to 2)
                        = (2 to 2 1/2 lbs untrimmed)
     1/3           cup  peach, pear, or berry vinegar
                        = (or white-wine vinegar mixed
                        with 1 tbspn fruit juice)
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  2                     shallots -- finely minced
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  poppy seeds
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh chives
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh lemon verbena or lemon balm
                        = (or 1 tspn grated lemon zest)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
                        Salad greens for lining serving planer
                        Minced chives and/or chive blossom petals -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Coat a large baking dish with olive oil and rub excess oil on beets.  Add enough water just to cover the bottom of the dish.  Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven until beets are tender when pierced with a knife, about 1 hour for large beets.  Remove from the oven, uncover, and let beets cool.

In a large mixing bowl, mix together vinegar, honey, mustard, and shallots.  Slowly whisk in olive oil to make a thick emulsion.  Whisk in poppy seeds, chives, lemon verbena or lemon balm or zest, and salt and white pepper to taste.  Add onion and toss thoroughly.  Let dressing stand until beets are cool.

Carefully peel beets; cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Gently toss beets with onions.  Cover the bowl with plastic and chill at least 2 hours before serving.

To serve, line a shallow serving bowl with salad greens.  Adjust seasonings in beet salad.  Spoon salad in the center of the prepared serving dish.  Sprinkle with minced chives and chive flower petals and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This sweet-and-sour beet salad is outstanding made with golden beets, but be sure to experiment with varieties of beets and onions.  When baking your beets, remember that small ones will cook more rapidly than large ones.  Finally, find a good source for fruit vinegars; they are splendid additions to a salad repertoire.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MUSTARD SAUCE ===
  1                     shallot
  1           teaspoon  buffer
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                can  low-sodium chicken broth - (10 1/2 oz)
                        = (preferably Campbell's)
  2        tablespoons  dry mustard
  1                cup  sour cream
                        = (nonfat sour cream is fine)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === PORK MEDALLIONS ===
  6                     pork medallions
  2                     shallots -- chopped
                        Olive oil
                        Few drops of balsamic vinegar
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For The Mustard Sauce:  Chop the shallot coarsely and sautÈ it in the butter until it's brown around the edges.  Add the wine and the broth, and bring to a boil; continue boiling for about 10 to 15 minutes, until the broth is reduced to about 3/4 cup, give or take.  Strain it, and throw away the shallot.  Whisk in the mustard and sour cream until they're blended, and grind in the pepper to taste.  (It probably won't need salt at all.)  If it happens to be ready early, you can reheat it gently.

For The Pork Medallions:  Have the butcher cut six slices off a loin of pork and pound them flat, or do it yourself, with the flat end of a meat pounder between layers of wax paper.

In a big fry pan, sautÈ the shallots until they're wilted in enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the pan, then add the medallions, as many as will fit without crowding the pan; you may have to do it in two batches. SautÈ over medium heat for about 3 minutes. Just before turning the medallions over, put a few drops of balsamic vinegar into the pan, pouring directly onto the oil, not onto the medallions. (The vinegar will give the medallions a nice glazed look.) Swirl the oil around the pan to distribute it. Flip the medallions, and cut into the center of one after 3 more minutes to see if they're just cooked all the way through. When they are, sprinkle some pepper over them.

They should be lightly browned on the outside, and glazed.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              small  zucchini -- juilenned
     1/2           cup  bulgur
  4               cups  canned reduced-sodium chicken broth
  2          teaspoons  dried mint -- crumbled
  2              large  ripe tomatoes - (abt 1 lb) -- skinned, chopped
                        = (or 16-oz can chopped tomatoes, drained)
  1                     green onion -- julienned
  2                     pita breads -- toasted, and
                        cut into 6 triangles each

In a medium-size saucepan, heat oil over moderate heat.  Add zucchini and sautÈ for 2 minutes.  Add bulgur and stir to coat with oil.  Add broth and mint; bring the mixture to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.

Stir chopped tomatoes into the bulgur mixture.  Cover the pan and simmer the mixture 5 more minutes.  Serve the soup garnished with onion, and with toasted pita triangles on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:   Be sure to use bulgur, not uncooked cracked wheat, to make this easy soup, since bulgur cooks relatively quickly.  Mixed greens and toasted pita bread make natural accompaniments.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Cheesecake Crust -- (see recipe)
                        === FILLING ===
  32            ounces  cream cheese
  1                cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  lemon Juice
  4                     eggs

Butter the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan; line with a round of parchment.

Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

Prepare the dough and place it in the prepared pan.  Pat the dough down evenly and firmly to cover the pan bottom.  Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is golden and baked through.  Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees.

To make the filling, use your mixer's lowest speed.  Using a paddle attachment, if your mixer has one, beat the cream cheese smooth, no more than 30 seconds.  Stop the mixer and scrape the bowl and beater (or paddle).  Add the sugar in a stream, mixing for no more than 30 seconds.  Stop and scrape.  Add the vanilla, lemon juice, and 1 egg; mix only until absorbed, no more than 30 seconds.  Stop and scrape.  Add the remaining eggs, one at a time, mixing only until each is absorbed.  Stop and scrape after each addition.

Wrap aluminum foil around the bottom of the springform pan so it comes at least 1 inch up the sides.  Pour the filling into the pan over the crust.  Place the pan in a jelly-roll or roasting pan and pour warm water into the pan to a depth of 1/2 inch.

Bake the cheesecake for about 60 minutes, or until lightly colored and firm except for the very center.  Remove from the pan of hot water.

Remove the foil and cool completely on a rack.  Wrap the cheesecake in plastic or foil and chill overnight before unmolding.

SERVING:  Serve a few sliced, sugared strawberries or some raspberries with the cheesecake, if you wish, though it is rich and complex enough to need no accompaniment.

This recipe yields one 9-inch cake, about 12 servings.

Comments:  This is the simplest and, perhaps, the best cheesecake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2          teaspoons  chopped green onion
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  vegetable broth
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  black vinegar or balsamic vinegar
  2          teaspoons  chili garlic sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  sugar
                        === TO FINISH ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cooking oil

Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     egg
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  self-rising flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Grated zest of 1 large orange
     1/2           cup  shelled walnuts -- toasted, chopped
     1/2           cup  lowfat buttermilk
  2                     ripe bananas - (8 oz ea) -- peeled, well mashed
  2        tablespoons  fresh orange juice
  1                cup  Ricotta Icing -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  Grand Marnier

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Coat the inside of a tube pan 9 inches in diameter with nonstick cooking spray.

In a bowl, using an electric mixer set on medium speed, beat the egg until foamy, about 2 minutes.  Continue to beat, adding the sugar, a few tablespoons at a time, until the mixture is thick and pale yellow, at least 5 minutes.  Add the flour, baking soda, vanilla extract, orange zest, half of the toasted nuts, the buttermilk, bananas, and orange juice, folding in gently.

Spread the batter in the prepared pan.  Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool completely in the pan, about 10 minutes.

Transfer the cooled cake onto a serving plate.  In a small bowl, combine the Ricotta Icing and Grand Marnier.  Frost the cake with the icing and sprinkle the top with the remaining toasted nuts.

To serve, slice into wedges and place on individual plates.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Per Serving:  138 calories;  4g protein;  3g total fat (1g saturated fat);  23g carbohydrate;  16 mg cholesterol;  208mg sodiurn;  1g dietary fiber.

Comments:  Buttermilk imparts tenderness and bananas richness -- plus lots of potassium -- to this cake.  Beat the eggs for the full time, to help tighten the batter.  For a simpler presentation, omit the icing and dust with sifted confectioners' sugar.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Coat the inside of a tube pan 9 inches in diameter with nonstick cooking spray.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl, using an electric mixer set on medium speed, beat the egg until foamy, about 2 minutes.  Continue to beat, adding the sugar, a few tablespoons at a time, until the mixture is thick and pale yellow, at least 5 minutes.  Add the flour, baking soda, vanilla extract, orange zest, half of the toasted nuts, the buttermilk, bananas, and orange juice, folding in gently.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the batter in the prepared pan.  Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool completely in the pan, about 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the cooled cake onto a serving plate.  In a small bowl, combine the Ricotta Icing and Grand Marnier.  Frost the cake with the icing and sprinkle the top with the remaining toasted nuts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, slice into wedges and place on individual plates.

Comments:  Buttermilk imparts tenderness and bananas richness -- plus lots of potassium -- to this cake.  Beat the eggs for the full time, to help tighten the batter.  For a simpler presentation, omit the icing and dust with sifted confectioners&apos; sugar.

                      Partially Prebaked Tart Shell

Recipe By     :Lydie Marshall
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pastry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  cold water - (to 3) -- depending on weather

Cut the butter into small pieces and place in the freezer for 5 minutes.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, salt, and butter.  Process for 10 seconds, adding 2 tablespoons water in humid weather or 3 tablespoons in dry weather.

Process for another 10 seconds until the mixture looks like corn meal.

Dump the mixture on a table counter and bind a small amount a time with the heel of your hand using a sliding motion to incorporate the butter and flour smoothly.

Gather the dough into a ball a flatten it.  Wrap in wax paper and refrigerate for 15 minutes, just long enough to firm up the butter.

Flour a work surface and rolling pin.  Roll the dough to a 13-inch circle, always making sure there is flour under the dough and on the rolling pin, otherwise the dough will stick to the pastry surface or to the rolling pin.

Line a 10-inch tart pan with the dough.  Trim the excess (keep it frozen until you have enough scraps to make another tart shell).  Prick the bottom and refrigerate the unbaked tart shell for 2 hours or freeze it until ready to bake.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Line the tart shell with aluminum foil and fill it with dry beans.  Place the tart shell in the middle of the oven and bake for 15 minutes.  Remove the beans and foil.  Bake 5 to 10 minutes to dry out the bottom without coloring.

This recipe yields 10 ounces of dough, enough for one 10-inch tart shell plus trimmings.

Comments:  If you are a novice, wait for cool weather to learn how to make pastry dough; it will be easier to handle the dough.  Keep flour in the freezer during the summer months.

A partially pre≠baked tart shell is used when the tart will be filled and then baked again.  Fully prebake the tart shell if it is to be used when the contents of the tart are fresh (as in the case of a fresh fruit tart) and will not be baked after filling.

  2                     yellow sweet peppers -- diced
  2                     red sweet peppers -- diced

  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 4)
  4                     ripe tomatoes - (to 6) -- diced,
                        = (or 4 to 6 oz diced canned tomatoes)
  10                    black olives - (to 15) -- pItted and halved
                        = (kalamata or oIl-cured)
                        Finely-chopped fresh thyme, marjoram,
                        basil, or other herb -- to serve
  1               dash  balsamic vinegar
  1              pound  pasta of choice
                        = (either long strands such as fettuccine
                        or chunky shapes such as seashells)
                        Coarsely-grated or shaved Parmesan cheese -- to serve

Place the sweet peppers and garlic in a flat earthenware dish, then toss with the salt, pepper, and olive oil.  Bake in the oven, uncovered, at 400 degrees for 1 1/2 hours, tossing once or twice during this time.  Add the tomatoes and return to the oven for another 30 minutes.

Cook the pasta until at dente, then drain.  Toss with the sweet pepper mixture, adding more herbs if you like.  Serve sprinkled with the Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Slow-baked sweet peppers, mixed with black olives and a splash of tomato and tossed with thin spaghettini or cappelini, are delicious.  Add a dash of balsamic vinegar at the end for a tangy accent and to help round out the flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTA FROLLA ===
  3               cups  bleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  12       tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
  3              large  eggs
                        === FILLING ===
  2             pounds  whole-milk or part-skim-milk ricotta
  6              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  grated Pecorino Romano cheese
  1              pound  mozzarella -- coarsely grated
     1/2         pound  sweet dried sausage -- peeled and diced
     1/2         pound  prosciutto -- shredded
     1/2           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        === Egg wash ===
  1                     egg -- well beaten with
  1              pinch  salt

Butter a 12-inch-diameter by 2-inch-deep cake pan, or an 11- by 17-inch jelly-roll pan.

To make the dough, combine the dry ingredients in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade and pulse several times to mix.  Cut the butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and distribute evenly over the dry ingredients in the work bowl.  Pulse until very finely powdered.  Add the eggs and continue to pulse until the dough forms a ball on the blade.

To mix the dough by hand, combine the the ingredients in a mixing bowl.  Add the butter and rub in finely by hand or with a pastry blender.  Stir in the eggs with a fork and continue stirring until the dough holds together.

Remove the dough and divide into 2 pieces, one of which is two-thirds of the dough and the other one-third.  Press the larger piece into a circle and wrap in plastic.  Press the smaller piece into a square and wrap it too.  Refrigerate both while preparing the filling.

To make the filling, place the ricotta in the work bowl of the food processor and pulse to purÈe smoothly.  Transfer the ricotta to a mixing bowl and stir in the eggs, one at a time; stir in the remaining filling ingredients in the order listed.

Set a rack at the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

Lightly flour a work surface and the larger piece of dough and roll the dough out into a 17-inch circle.  Fold the dough into quarters and place in the prepared pan.  Unfold the dough and press into the pan, allowing any excess dough to hang over the sides.  Pour in the filling (it will come to about 3/4-inch below the top of the pan) and smooth the top.

Roll the remaining dough into a 10-inch square and cut into 1-inch strips.  Paint the dough strips with the egg wash.  Arrange 5 strips over the filling.  Arrange the remaining strips at a 45-degree angle across the first ones.  Press the strips against the rim of the pan to make them stick and trim away excess dough -- only from the strips --  around the top of the pan.  Use a small knife to loosen the bottom crust dough around the rim of the pan and fold it over to form an edge for the top crust.

Bake the pizza for about 45 minutes, until the filling is set and the dough is baked through.  Cool in the pan on a rack.

To unmold, place a platter over the pizza and invert it, then remove the pan.  Replace the pan with another platter and invert the pizza again.  Remove the top platter.

Serving:  Serve in wedges as an appetizer, or as part of a buffet.  Pizza rustica is a perfect brunch dish.

Storage:  Keep the pizza rustica at room temperature on the day it is baked.  For longer storage, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to several days.  Bring to room temperature before serving.

Hint For Success:  Don't overbake the pizza rustica or the filling will become watery and soak through the bottom crust.

This recipe yields 1 large pie, about 20 servings.

Comments:  In Italy, this typical savory pie is served at Carnevale (the day before Ash Wednesday) and then again at Easter.  Though many recipes for pizza rustica specify that the dried sausage, mozzarella and other filling ingredients be layered, in this Neapolitan version they are diced and added to the ricotta filling, which makes the pizza easier to cut into wedges.  The dough used here is a pasta frolla, a sweet, tender, and typical Italian pastry dough.  The combination of a sweet dough and a savory filling may seem bizarre, but it yields a good contrast -- the sweetness of the dough tempers the rather salty filling.  If the combination does not appeal to you, leave out the sugar; add a tablespoon or two of water to make the dough form a ball.

<DirT>
Butter a 12-inch-diameter by 2-inch-deep cake pan, or an 11- by 17-inch jelly-roll pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the dough, combine the dry ingredients in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade and pulse several times to mix.  Cut the butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and distribute evenly over the dry ingredients in the work bowl.  Pulse until very finely powdered.  Add the eggs and continue to pulse until the dough forms a ball on the blade.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To mix the dough by hand, combine the the ingredients in a mixing bowl.  Add the butter and rub in finely by hand or with a pastry blender.  Stir in the eggs with a fork and continue stirring until the dough holds together.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the dough and divide into 2 pieces, one of which is two-thirds of the dough and the other one-third.  Press the larger piece into a circle and wrap in plastic.  Press the smaller piece into a square and wrap it too.  Refrigerate both while preparing the filling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the filling, place the ricotta in the work bowl of the food processor and pulse to purÈe smoothly.  Transfer the ricotta to a mixing bowl and stir in the eggs, one at a time; stir in the remaining filling ingredients in the order listed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set a rack at the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly flour a work surface and the larger piece of dough and roll the dough out into a 17-inch circle.  Fold the dough into quarters and place in the prepared pan.  Unfold the dough and press into the pan, allowing any excess dough to hang over the sides.  Pour in the filling (it will come to about 3/4-inch below the top of the pan) and smooth the top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll the remaining dough into a 10-inch square and cut into 1-inch strips.  Paint the dough strips with the egg wash.  Arrange 5 strips over the filling.  Arrange the remaining strips at a 45-degree angle across the first ones.  Press the strips against the rim of the pan to make them stick and trim away excess dough -- only from the strips --  around the top of the pan.  Use a small knife to loosen the bottom crust dough around the rim of the pan and fold it over to form an edge for the top crust.

Recipe By     :Anne Bianchi
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     fresh sage leaves
  3                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  2             pounds  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into large chunks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the oil in a large skillet; add the sage and garlic and cook over medium heat until the garlic is lightly roasted.

Add the tomato paste, dissolve thoroughly, cover, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes until well blended.

Run the potato chunks under cold water and place them in the skillet still dripping; toss well to coat the potatoes with the oil-and-sage mixture.  Add the salt and pepper.

Lower the heat, cover, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until the potatoes are very soft.  Remove the sage and discard.

Serve hot with a mixed salad and slices of thick, crusty bread to soak up the sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  In the Signora's mental file of favorite foods are many recipes left over from wartime, when, as she says, mouths were many and resources few.  This is one of them, a wonderful potato dish as simple to prepare as it is delectable to consume.

Recipe By     :Jack Bishop
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced fine
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley or basil leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
                        Several grindings of fresh black pepper

Heat oil in a medium-size saucepan.  Add garlic and sautÈ over medium heat until pale yellow in color, about 1 minute.

Add tomatoes, herbs, salt, and pepper and bring sauce to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer gently until sauce thickens slightly, about 10 minutes.  Adjust salt and pepper as needed.

This recipe yields 3 cups.

Comments:  Taste the sauce before adding salt.  Some canned tomatoes are much saltier than others and may require very little extra seasoning.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2           cups  unbleached flour -- more or less
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     3/4           cup  minced red onion
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh dill
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly oil a baking sheet.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine 4 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt (if mixing by hand, use a wooden spoon).  Add onion and dill and mix on low speed for 1 minute.  Add egg and oil.  With motor running on low speed, gradually add buttermilk.  Mix until thoroughly blended.

Sprinkle some of remaining 1/2 cup flour on a work surface and knead dough, adding flour as necessary, until only slightly sticky.  Form into a round loaf, place on the prepared bakng sheet, and cut a deep X into top of loaf.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

Comments:  In combination with onion, dill creates a perfect bread for a wintertime hearty soup or summertime salad supper.  Feel free to experiment with different onions and different herbs.

Recipe By     :Cynthia Hizer
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  lowfat ricotta cheese
     1/4           cup  lowfat plain yogurt
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg

In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine the ricotta cheese, yogurt, vanilla and almond extracts, and nutmeg and process until well combined, about 30 seconds.  Cover and chill for 15 minutes before using.

This recipe yields 1 cup.

Comments:  Although there is no butter in this delicious lowfat icing, it has a buttery quality that makes it wonderful for spreading on cakes or cookies.  It takes less than 20 minutes to make and can be stored in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.  Do not attempt to freeze the icing, however, as it separates when frozen.

         Roast Leg Of Lamb With Braised Garlic, Sherry And Thyme

Recipe By     :Chuck Williams and Joyce Goldstein
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     leg of lamb - (abt 6 lbs)
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- cut into slivers
  12             small  fresh 1/2"-long thyme sprigs - (to 14)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE BRAISED GARLIC ===
  3                     garlic heads -- cloves separated,
                        and peeled
                        Beef stock -- to cover
  3                     fresh thyme sprigs
  1                     bay leaf
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
                        Beef stock -- as needed
  1                cup  dry sherry
  4          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cut 12 to 14 small, shallow silts into the surface of the lamb.  Insert a sliver of garlic and a thyme sprig into each slit.  Cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day.

Preheat an oven to 400 degrees.  Sprinkle the lamb with salt and pepper and place in a roasting pan.

Roast for about 1 1/4 hours for rare with the bone in, or until a meat thermometer registers 130 degrees.  A boneless leg will take about 1 hour.

While the lamb is roasting, prepare the braised garlic.  In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the garlic cloves, stock to cover barely, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf.  Cover, bring to a simmer, and continue to simmer over medium heat until the garlic is tender when pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes.  Remove from the heat and, using a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic to a small bowl.  Strain the cooking liquid into a 2-cup measuring cup.

To make the sauce, add stock to the strained liquid to measure 2 .cups and transfer to a saucepan.  Add the sherry and bring to a boil.  Boil, uncovered, over high heat until reduced by one-third.  Add the chopped thyme and reserved braised garlic cloves.  Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper and keep warm.

When the lamb is done, remove from the oven and cover loosely with aluminum foil.  Let rest for 10 minutes.  Carve the lamb and divide evenly among individual plates.  Spoon some of the sauce, including the garlic cloves, over each serving of the lamb.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  The lamb can be roasted with the bone in, or you can ask the butcher to bone the leg and tie it for easier carving and more uniform slices.  It is best to insert the garlic and thyme sprigs into the leg the day before roasting to flavor the meat more intensely, but this step can also be done just before the leg goes into the oven.  Be sure to remove the lamb from the refrigerator about an hour before putting it in the oven.

When the lamb is done, remove from the oven and cover loosely with aluminum foil.  Let rest for 10 minutes.  Carve the lamb and divide evenly among individual plates.  Spoon some of the sauce, including the garlic cloves, over each serving of the lamb.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  The lamb can be roasted with the bone in, or you can ask the butcher to bone the leg and tie it for easier carving and more uniform slices.  It is best to insert the garlic and thyme sprigs into the leg the day before roasting to flavor the meat more intensely, but this step can also be done just before the leg goes into the oven.  Be sure to remove the lamb from the refrigerator about an hour before putting it in the oven.

                        Rosemary-Infused Olive Oil

Recipe By     :Georgeanne Brennan
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  fresh rosemary sprigs -- snipped 1" lengths
  2 1/2           cups  olive oil
  1                     fresh rosemary sprig -- for the decanted oil

Crush the snipped rosemary slightly and put it in a clean, dry, wide-mouthed glass jar with a lid.  Add the olive oil to cover the rosemary completely and then cover with the lid.  Put the jar inside in a sunny window or outside in a sunny location.  Let stand for about 10 days.

Taste the oil occasionally by pouring a little of it on a piece of bread.  When the oil is sufficiently flavored -- 3 weeks is not unusual -- remove the pieces of rosemary and discard them or use them for cooking.  Strain the oil through a sieve lined with several layers of cheesecloth and decant it into a clean jar or bottle.  Add a decorative sprig of fresh rosemary and seal with a cork or lid.

This recipe yields about 2 cups.

Comments:  Pungent and resinous, rosemary readily infuses olive oil to produce an excellent marinade and basting sauce for grilled vegetables, including winter squash, parsnips, radicchio, and the traditional Mediterranean trio of summer squash, eggplant, and sweet peppers.  Drizzle it over pizzas or breads and use it in cooking whenever you want a subtle rosemary flavor.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Biscuits                        Breads/Rolls

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  unbleached white flour
     1/4           cup  whole wheat flour
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  cold unsalted butler -- cut small chunks
     1/2           cup  heavy cream or milk
                        === OPTIONAL ===
  2        tablespoons  Spicy Sesame Seed Topper -- (see recipe)
                        = (or toasted sesame seeds)

In a medium bowl, combine the white and whole wheat flours, Parmesan cheese, baking powder, and salt.  With a pastry blender or two knives, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

Stir in the heavy cream or milk just until a soft dough is formed.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface.  Gently knead for about 1 minute.  Roll the dough out about 1/2 inch thick.  With a 2 1/2-inch cutter, cut the dough into 8 rounds.

Arrange the biscuits in a circle around the outside of a 12-inch round glass plate.  Sprinkle with sesame topping or seeds.  Place the plate onto an inverted microwave dish with sides.  Microwave on medium for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the biscuits are puffed, rotating and rearranging twice during cooking.  Place on a wire rack and let stand for 3 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 biscuits.

Comments:  Warm biscuits are always a pleasure to serve.  These are lightly flavored with Parmesan cheese for extra enjoyment.  They don't brown like traditional biscuits, but they're delicious nonetheless.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallot
  2        tablespoons  diced country ham
  1              pound  medium-large shrimp - (21/26 ct) -- peeled, deveined
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1                     kiwifruit -- peeled, diced
                        Cooked grits or pasta

Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the shallot and ham and sautÈ for 1 minutes.  Add the shrimp, toss, then add the wine.  Cook until the wine is almost completely evaporated, removing the shrimp as soon as they are cooked (just a few minutes).

Add the cream and the kiwifruit to the pan and cook until the sauce is thickened.  Remove from the heat and stir in the shrimp, then serve immediately over pasta or creamy grits.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer or 2 main course servings.

Comments:  Chef Fran Freeberg has worked for the Smithsonian and as head chef for the Central Intelligence Agency in Bethesda, Maryland, near where she grew up.  For several years she also worked in Charleston.  Her recipe here is a variation on the Charleston classic of shrimp and grits, which we might eat for lunch or supper as well as breakfast.

Awendaw refers to the creamy whole-grain cooked grits so often used in the cooking of the Lowcountry, as the Carolina coastal plain is called.  It is also the name of a fishing village about 10 miles north of Charleston, where kiwifruit are now grown.  This recipe, to be served over creamy grits (or pasta), shows Fran's signature on a Lowcountry classic.

               Spiced Ginger Cake With Candied Ginger Cream

Recipe By     :Janet Hazen
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SPICED GINGER CAKE ===
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable oil
  4                     eggs -- lightly beaten
  1 1/2           cups  finely-grated carrots
  1 1/2           cups  minced peeled fresh ginger
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2 1/2    tablespoons  ground ginger powder
  2 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  2 1/2      teaspoons  mace
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped toasted walnuts
                        === CANDIED GINGER CREAM ===
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/3           cup  sifted powdered sugar
  1         tablespoon  ginger liqueur or light rum
  1                cup  finely-chopped candied ginger
                        Mint sprigs -- for garnish
                        Thinly-sliced candied ginger -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Generously grease and lightly flour a 10- by 13-inch baking pan.

To make the Cake:  In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the sugar and vegetable oil together until pale and smooth, about 3 or 4 minutes.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add the carrots and ginger and mix well.

Combine the dry ingredients, including the nuts, in a medium bowl; mix well.  Add to the egg mixture and mix just until combined.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake on the lower rack of the oven for 30 minutes.  Rotate to the upper shelf and bake 20 to 25 minutes longer, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.  Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature.  Run a dull knife around the edges of the cake and cut into serving pieces.

To make the Candied Ginger Cream:  Place the cream in a medium bowl.  Using an electric mixer, beat on high speed until soft peaks form.  Add the sugar and liqueur and beat until firm enough to hold its shape but not stiff.  Add the finely chopped candied ginger and mix gently.

Spread the top of each piece with some of the Candied Ginger Cream and serve garnished with the sliced candied ginger and mint sprigs.

This recipe yields 9 to 12 servings.

Recipe By     :Pat Baird
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sesame seeds
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

In a 1-quart microwavable casserole, combine the sesame seeds and oil.  Stir in the curry powder, garlic powder, and salt.  Microwave on high for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the seeds are golden, stirring twice during cooking.  Cool.  Store in the refrigerator in a jar or tightly covered container.

This recipe yields 1 cup.

Comments:  Just about any kind of seed -- sunflower, pumpkin, as well as sesame -- will provide a nice crunch in this topping.  Toasting the seeds gives the mixture a richer flavor.  Use this on biscuits or in a cold pasta salad.

                     Spinach Soup With Madeira Cream

Recipe By     :Chuck Williams and Joyce Goldstein
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  2               cups  diced yellow onion
  1                     baking potato - (abt 8 oz) -- peeled, sliced thin
  2               cups  chicken stock -- plus
                        chicken stock as needed for thinning soup
  1 1/2         pounds  spinach - (to 2) -- stems removed,
                        carefully washed and drained
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  Madeira or dry sherry
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large, wide saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.  Add the onion and sautÈ, stirring, until tender and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes.  Add the potato and the 2 cups chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the potato is soft, 8 to 10 minutes.

Raise the heat to high and start adding the spinach leaves by the handful, pushing them down into the hot stock with a spoon.  When all of the spinach has been immersed in the stock, cook until it is barely wilted, 1 to 2 minutes.

Working in batches and using a slotted spoon, transfer the soup solids to a blender or food processor fitted with the metal blade and blend or process until smooth; it will be very thick.  Pour the purÈe into a clean saucepan and add the liquid from the original pan.

Stir in the cream and Madeira or sherry and reheat gently, thinning with additional stock if necessary; do not allow to boil.  Season with the nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste.  Serve in warmed bowls.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  To ensure this soup keeps its bright green color, add the spinach at the last minute and barely wilt it in the stock.  Then purÈe the soup and reheat gently with the cream and wine.  The soup can be made up to 8 hours in advance to the point where it is purÈed.  Finish it just before serving.  As an alternative to stirring the cream directly into the soup, whip the cream until soft peaks form, beat the Madeira into it, and top each serving with a dollop of the cream.

  4                     chicken breasts -- skinned and boned
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4              small  thin slices Parma ham (prosciutto crudo)
  4                     thin slices Bel Paese cheese
  4                     cooked or canned asparagus stalks
                        Flour -- for dusting
     1/4           cup  butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  6        tablespoons  Marsala or dry white wine

Add the Marsala or wine, chicken stock, and the remaining butter to the juices in the skillet.  Bring to the boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes, scraping the base of the skillet with a wooden spoon.  Spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve garnished with asparagus stalks.

                       Sweet Corn And, Shrimp Cakes

Recipe By     :Paula Hamilton
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  corn kernels
                        = (fresh or thawed frozen)
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1                     egg
     1/4           cup  heavy cream or milk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  cooked shelled baby shrimp

PurÈe 2 cups of the corn in a food processor.  Add the flour, egg, cream, and salt and pulse several times to combine.  Stir in the rest of the corn and the shrimp.

Heat a nonstick or lightly oiled griddle.  Make corn cakes using 1 tablespoon of batter for each.  Cook in batches over medium-high heat until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 2 minutes.  Turn over and cook the other sides until lightly browned, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes longer.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

Comments:  Serve these plain or, if you like, garnish with a dollop of tart green salsa made from tomatillos.  Thawed frozen corn works well in this recipe.

                   Sweet Ricotta And Fresh Fruit Toasts

Recipe By     :Ken Haedrich
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ricotta cheese
     1/4           cup  mild honey
                        = (like orange blossom or clover)
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Grated zest of 1/2 lemon
                        A drop or 2 of vanilla extract
  1                     long loaf French bread (baguette)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
                        Sugar -- as needed
                        Assorted fresh summer fruit
                        = (including ripe raspberries,
                        strawberries, peaches, and nectarines)

In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, honey, lemon juice and zest, and vanilla.  Stir to blend, then cover and refrigerate.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Cut the bread on the diagonal into 10 to 12 full slices, each about 1-inch thick.  Butter both sides with the soft butter, then lay them on a large baking sheet.  Sprinkle the tops with a little sugar, then toast in the oven for 15 minutes or so, until golden brown.

While the bread toasts, clean and/or slice the fruit and arrange it in bowls or on a platter.  Peel peaches and nectarines, but don't slice them until the last minute.  Rinse strawberries, slicing them if necessary.  Don't run water over raspberries or they'll get soggy.

To serve, bring everything to the table and let each person assemble their own.  Spread the sweetened ricotta thickly over the bread, and arrange the fruit on top.  If the fruit isn't perfectly ripe, provide a bit of sugar on the side to sprinkle on and lemon slices to squeeze on the fruit as well.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  There's something quite fun and friendly about this, a big tray of fresh sweet toasts, honey-sweetened ricotta cheese, and fresh summer fruit.  You just bring everything to the table on separate plates and let everyone assemble their own open-face fruit sandwiches -- which is essentially what these are.  This is a dessert to be savored in July or August, when the fruit is at its peak and the setting is casual.  Serve with glasses of port.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
                        = (abt 2 cups)
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2 1/2         pounds  fresh tomatoes -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped - (5 cups)
                        = (or two 35-oz cans Italian plum
                        tomatoes, chopped and drained, saving the
                        juice for a soup)
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        = (less if you use canned tomatoes)
     1/4           cup  fresh basil leaves
  1              pinch  cayenne
  1                cup  crustless bread cubes
  2                     egg whites
  1                     ten-inch Partially Prebaked Tart Shell -- (see recipe)

In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat.  Stir in the onion and garlic and cook for 5 minutes, stirring often to avoid burning the garlic.

Add the tomatoes, sugar, salt, basil, and cayenne.  Cover and cook for 15 minutes.  Uncover and mash the bread into the tomatoes with a fork until thoroughly mixed.  Cook until the tomatoes have the consistency of a thick relish, about 15 minutes, depending on how watery the tomatoes are.  Taste and add more salt if necessary.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Beat the egg whites until firm.  Fold the egg whites into the tomato mixture and pour into the prebaked tart shell.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the top is lightly golden.

Serve hot or at room temperature, cut into 6 or 8 wedges.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Variation - Individual Tomato Souffles:  For a dinner party, make this soufflÈ in individual molds.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Oil ten 1/2-cup ramekins or baba molds.  Fill the molds with the tomato-egg white mixture and place in a water bath.  Bake for 1/2 hour or until top is golden brown.

Unmold the souffles around roasted leg of lamb or other roast.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  champagne or white wine vinegar
  1                     vanilla pod -- spilt lengthwise,
                        and beans removed

Place the vinegar in a wide-mouth, nonreactive container.  Add the vanilla beans and pods; mix well.  Cover tightly and store at room temperature for at least 2 weeks before using.

Remove the beans and transfer to a dark, glass bottle with a tight-fitting lid.  The vinegar will keep indefinitely if stored in a cool, dark place.  Use as you would any other vinegar.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

Comments:  Use this delightful mixture when you want to soften the vinegar flavor in dressings or vinaigrettes.  Or add a splash to soups, stews, pasta dishes, or recipes made with cream when a slightly acidic character is desired, or if you wish to brighten the flavors.
