  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POTATO SALAD WITH SWEET PEPPERS ===
  16                    new red potatoes
                        Coarse salt -- for boiling water
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
     1/2                red onion -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh mint
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  extra virgin olive oil
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === 3 BEAN SALAD ===
     1/2         pound  fresh green beans -- washed, and
                        cut into thirds
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard - (rounded)
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                can  red kidney beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  1                can  garbanzo beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place red potatoes in a pot and cover with water.  Place pot on stove, cover and bring to a boil.  Liberally salt water with coarse salt.  Place a colander over boiling pot.

Take your first ingredient from the bean salad, 1/2 pound cut fresh green beans, and place them in the colander.  Cover the colander with pot lid.  Steam beans 5 minutes while potatoes boil below.  Remove beans and cold shock under running water.  Drain green beans and set aside.

When the potatoes are just tender, about 12 minutes, remove from heat, turn off burner, drain potatoes and cold shock them under running water until just cool enough to handle.  Coarsely chop potatoes and return them to the warm pot.

Add peppers, onions, mint, parsley and vinegar to the pot.  Toss to allow the vinegar to absorb into the potatoes.  Add oil and stir the potatoes until they mash up a bit and salad has a spoonable consistency.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and transfer to a serving bowl.

In a bowl, combine mustard, sugar and vinegar.  Whisk in oil.  Add kidney beans, garbanzo beans, green beans and parsley to the bowl and toss to coat bean salad evenly with dressing.  Season salad with salt and pepper, to taste, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings of each salad.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  shredded Swiss cheese
  1                     bag baby spinach - (12 oz)
  1              small  red apple -- cored, and
                        thinly sliced
  1                     lemon wedge
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme - (to 4) -- leaves stripped
                        from stems and chopped
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard - (rounded)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  red wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add shredded Swiss in small, 2-inch piles to the hot skillet.  When the cheese fries to a light golden color at the edges, about 1 minute, and can be moved with a thin spatula, turn the cheese rounds, cook another 15 seconds, then remove rounds from the skillet and transfer rounds to a work surface to cool.

The cheese crisps will cool within a minute or so.  Repeat to form 12 to 16 crisps, 3 or 4 per salad.  Crisps may also be flavored with cracked black pepper and chopped thyme or other herbs.

Place spinach in a bowl.  After slicing your apple, squeeze a wedge of lemon over the slices to keep them from browning.  Toss apples with spinach.

For dressing, combine thyme, Dijon mustard and vinegar with a whisk.  Stream in olive oil while continuing to whisk dressing.  Pour dressing over the salad and toss to coat greens and apple evenly.  Pile salad onto cheese rounds and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil or olive oil
     1/2                red bell pepper -- chopped fine
  2                     celery stalks from the heart -- chopped fine
  6                     water chestnuts -- chopped fine
     1/2         small  onion -- chopped fine
     1/4           cup  fresh bean sprouts -- chopped
  2               cans  lump crab meat - (6 oz ea) -- drained, flaked
  2        tablespoons  dark soy, such as Tamari
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
  4                     sheets frozen phyllo dough - (13" by 17") -- defrosted
  3        tablespoons  melted butter

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Add oil to a preheated skillet over medium to medium-high heat.  Saute pepper, celery, water chestnuts, onion 2 to 3 minutes.  Veggies should still have a little crunch.  Transfer to a bowl.  Add bean spouts, crab, soy and thyme.  Combine well with a spoon.

Paint half of a sheet of phyllo dough with melted butter and fold sheet in half.  Pile a few spoonfuls of filling 2 inches from the bottom of sheet and leaving 2 inches at either side of sheet.  Fold bottom flap up and side edges in, then roll up and over until you reach the top of the sheet.  Your crab pastry will look like a spring roll.  Touch the edges and sides of your roll with melted butter and place roll seam-side down on a pastry sheet.

Bake rolls 15 minutes or until lightly golden all over in the center of the oven.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar

Coat chicken with balsamic, oil, seasoning and rosemary and set aside.  In a skillet, add chopped bacon, work in 2 batches if preparing salad for 4.  Brown bacon over medium-high heat, then transfer the bits to a paper towel lined plate to drain.  Using center cut bacon will cut down on the pan drippings that spatter.

Coarsely chop spinach leaves and add to salad bowl.  Top with mushrooms, radishes, scallions.  Season salad with salt and pepper.

Wipe out the bacon pan and return to stove turning heat back to medium-low.  Add 1 tablespoon oil for your dressing and shallots and reduce heat to medium.  Saute shallots for 3 minutes.  Remove oil and shallots from heat.

In a bowl, combine mustard and balsamic vinegar.  Stream in 2/3 cup oil slowly while whisking the dressing to emulsify it.  Add warm shallots and toss with spinach salad to coat evenly.  Add cooked bacon and toss again.

Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook chicken cutlets, 4 minutes on each side, in a single layer.  Slice breasts on an angle on your cutting board once they are all out of the pan.  Pile spinach salad on to dinner plate/plates.  Top each salad with 2 sliced chicken cutlet pieces.  For individual portion follow the above method.

This recipe yields 1 to 4 super salad suppers.

  1                     red bell pepper -- finely chopped
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, chopped
  3        tablespoons  dark chili powder
  1         tablespoon  cumin
  1                cup  beef stock or broth
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                can  tomato sauce or tomato puree - (8 oz)
  2               cans  black beans - (15 oz ea) -- drained
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro -- (optional)
  2           packages  corn muffin mix - (8 1/2 oz ea)
  1                cup  milk
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  vegetable or corn oil
  3                     scallions -- thinly sliced
                        Butter -- for greasing griddle

In a large deep skillet or pot, brown ground beef in oil over high heat.  Season meat with salt and pepper, then add Worcestershire sauce.

Reduce heat to medium-high when the meat is browned and crumbled, then add onion, garlic, red peppers, jalapeÒo.  Season veggies and meat with chili powder and cumin.  Cook veggies and meat together 5 minutes.

Stir in broth and scrape up pan drippings.  Stir in diced and pureed tomatoes and black beans.  When the mixture comes to a bubble, reduce heat to simmer and stir in cilantro, optional.

Mix together 2 packages of corn muffin mix with 1 cup milk, 2 beaten eggs, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and sliced scallions.  Batter should be thick.

Heat a nonstick skillet or griddle pan over moderate heat.  Nest a pat of butter into folded paper towel and wipe hot pan surface with it to lightly grease.  Pour corn cake batter into the hot griddle pan or skillet in 3- or 4-inch rounds.  Cook 2 or 3 minutes on each side, until golden.  Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining batter.

To serve, top bowls of beef and black bean chili with green onion corn cake toppers.  Eat the chili and corn toppers as you would a pot pie, grabbing some of the corn cake with each spoonful of chili.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Bring 1 quart chicken stock to a boil in a wide, deep skillet with lid.  Add chicken breasts.  Return broth to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and poach the chicken 8 minutes.  Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside.  Reserve the broth for the sauce.

In a skillet, saute shallots in oil and butter for 2 minutes.  Sprinkle in 3 tablespoons flour and cook 1 minute.  Whisk in 1 cup wine and reduce by half, 1 minute.  Ladle in chicken broth, whisking sauce as you do.  Stir in 1/2 cup heavy cream.  Season sauce with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.  Bring to a bubble and reduce heat to low.

Slice the chicken into 1/2-inch strips and add to the pan.  Coat chicken in sauce.  At this stage, in order to have enough for 2 meals, remove half of the chicken in sauce and transfer to a container with a tight fitting lid.  Cool the chicken, cover, and freeze for the tetrazzini, recipe follows.

To assemble Divine Divan:  Simmer broccoli spears in 1-inch water, covered, for 5 minutes.  Drain and transfer to a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.  Top with half the grated Gruyere and half of the base chicken recipe.  Top chicken with remaining Gruyere and brown until bubbling and golden under preheated broiler, about 2 minutes.  Serve with dressed salad greens and bread.

To assemble Tetrazzini:  Reheat defrosted base chicken recipe in microwave oven.  Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a small pan.  Saute mushrooms 5 minutes, until tender.  Toss drained hot egg noodles with chicken and mushrooms.  Transfer mixture to a baking dish and top with bread crumbs, cheese, and almonds.  Brown under preheated broiler until topping is even golden brown.  Place pan 6 inches from heat source.  Topping will brown in 2 to 3 minutes.

Serve with salad and bread.  Place greens in a bowl.  Using a vegetable peeler, peel strips of zucchini or cucumber into the salad bowl.  Repeat with carrot.  The vegetables will look like party streamers.  Finely chop pepper, scallions, and fresh herbs to make colorful confetti.  Sprinkle chopped vegetables into bowl.  Toss salad at the table with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, to your taste.  Serve with bread and butter.

This recipe yields 4 servings of each.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  Russet potatoes -- cleaned, and
                        pricked with a fork several times each
                        Drizzle olive oil or vegetable oil
  2             slices  center-cut bacon -- chopped 1/2" pieces
  2                     scallions -- chopped
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  1                cup  shredded Cheddar cheese
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat a small nonstick pan over medium-high heat.  Rub potatoes with a drizzle of oil.  Place potatoes on a microwave safe plate and microwave on high for 12 minutes, rotating once.

While potatoes cook, add chopped bacon to hot skillet and brown until bits are crisp.  Add scallions and cook scallions together with bacon 1 minute more.  Transfer bacon bits and green onions to a paper towel lined plate to drain.

Allow potatoes to cool enough to be handled, 5 minutes.  Preheat broiler to high.

Cut potatoes in half and scoop out the flesh into a small bowl.  Smash potato flesh together with sour cream until combined using a potato masher.  Stir in cheddar cheese, bacon and scallions and season with salt and pepper, to your taste.

Scoop filling back into potato skins and place on a cookie sheet.  Place potatoes in oven and brown under broiler, 6 inches from heat 5 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        A drizzle extra-virgin olive oil -- to coat baking dish
     1/4                ripe lemon
  1         tablespoon  butter
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  6                     flat anchovies fillets
  1                cup  Italian-style bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Turn drained artichokes upside down to get all the liquid out.  Halve artichoke hearts, lengthwise.

Drizzle a small casserole dish with a little extra-virgin olive oil, and spread it around the dish with a pastry brush.  Arrange the halved artichoke hearts with tops up, bottoms down, in a layered pattern in the dish.  Squeeze the juice of 1/4 lemon over the hearts.

Preheat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add oil and butter to the skillet.  When butter melts into oil, add garlic and anchovies.  Using the back of a wooden spoon, work anchovies into oil as they break up.

When anchovies have dissolved into oil, add bread crumbs to the pan and lightly toast, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Add parsley, cheese and black pepper, stir to combine and remove pan from heat.

Top artichokes with an even layer of bread topping and set in the middle of oven.  Bake 10 minutes until artichokes are warm and topping is deep golden brown in color.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pieces  mahi mahi fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     limes -- juiced
  3        tablespoons  dark tamari soy sauce
  2                     inches fresh ginger root -- grated
  1         tablespoon  vegetable or canola oil
                        === GARNISH ===
  20                    fresh chive blades -- chopped
                        = (or 3 scallions, thinly sliced)
                        === ASPARAGUS ===
  1              pound  thin asparagus spears - (to 1 1/4)
  2                     navel oranges
  1                     inch fresh ginger root
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame seeds

Preheat grill pan to over medium-high to high heat.  Season mahi mahi fillets with salt and pepper.  Combine the lime juice, dark soy, ginger and a little vegetable or canola oil in a shallow dish.  Turn the mahi mahi in the citrus soy marinade and let it hang out for 10 minutes.  Grill on hot grill pan for 6 minutes per side for a 1-inch fillet or until fish is firm and opaque.

Take 1 spear of asparagus and hold it at each and.  Bend the asparagus until it snaps and breaks.  Use this spear as your guide on where to trim the ends of your bundle of spears.

Using a peeler, make thin long strips of orange zest from both oranges.  Cut the ends off the zested oranges and stand them up right on a cutting board.  Remove the pith in strips using sharp knife and cutting down from the top of the orange.  Discard the pith.  When the oranges are both peeled and trimmed, turn them on their sides and slice into 1/4-inch rounds, cross sectioning the whole.  Set the orange disks aside.

In a skillet with a cover, bring 1-inch water to a boil with the zest of the oranges and grated fresh ginger root.  Allow the orange zest and ginger to simmer for at least 1 minute then add salt and asparagus spears.  Simmer the spears 3 to 5 minutes until just tender.  Drain the asparagus.  Discard the orange zest and ginger.

Assemble a few spears on each dinner plate, layering them back and forth, crisscrossing the spears over orange slices.  Sprinkle sesame seeds over asparagus and oranges and top with 1 portion of grilled mahi mahi.  Garnish assembled fish and asparagus with chopped or thinly sliced chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1 1/2           cups  grated Pepper Jack cheese
  1 1/2           cups  shredded smoked white cheddar
                        = (preferred brand Cabot)

                        === ROASTED SALSA ===
  4                     plum tomatoes
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper
  1              small  onion -- peeled, and
                        cut across into 3 thick slices
  3             sprigs  fresh mint leaves - (to 4)
  1                     handful cilantro leaves
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        === GREEN ONION SOUR CREAM ===
  2               cups  sour cream
  1                     lime -- juiced and zested
  3                     scallions -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  cilantro leaves -- (optional)
                        = (parsley can be substituted)

Heat 2 nonstick skillets over medium high heat.  In the first, add 2 tablespoons oil, jalapeÒo, garlic and onion for black beans.  Saute 2 or 3 minutes, add beans and seasonings and cayenne pepper sauce.  Reduce heat to low and simmer.  In the second skillet, add oil and chicken.  Season chicken with chili powder and salt and lightly brown the meat, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add garlic, red peppers and chorizo and saute 5 to 6 minutes, then reduce heat to low.

For salsa, heat a skillet over high heat.  Add whole tomatoes and a seeded jalapeÒo, skin-side down, and the thick slices of onion.  Allow the tomatoes, pepper and onion to char on all sides.  Add blackened tomatoes, pepper and onions to a food processor.  Pulse grind the salsa with mint and cilantro leaves.  Season salsa with coarse salt.

Char and soften tortillas by holding them over hot burner 15 seconds on each side.  If you do not have gas burners, heat your dry skillet you used for salsa and cook tortillas 1 at a time in the pan 15 seconds on each side.

Pile tortillas near stove and line up your toppings.  Serve fillings out of the pans you cooked them in.

Green Onion Sour Cream:  Combine all ingredients in a food processor and process until the sour cream is pale green and scallions are finely chopped.  Serve with burritos.  (Makes about 2 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Transfer chops to a baking sheet.  Baste again with sauce and transfer to a hot oven to finish cooking them.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes, until your apples are ready to come off the grill pan.

Cover grill pan or indoor tabletop grill with as many pieces of apple as possible.  As the apples get tender, pull them off and replace with more slices.  Apples should cook 3 minutes on each side, you don't want them too soft, just tender.

  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     carrots -- peeled, chopped
  2                     celery ribs -- chopped

  1                     egg -- beaten
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Romano
     1/2           cup  plain bread crumbs
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated or ground nutmeg
  6               cups  chicken stock or broth
  2               cups  water
  1 1/2           cups  dried pasta, rings, broken fettuccini or
                        ditalini
  1              pound  triple-washed fresh spinach -- coarsely chopped
                        Grilled 4 Cheese Sandwiches -- (see recipe)

In a deep pot over medium heat add oil, chopped carrots, celery and onions and bay leaves.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover pot and cook veggies 5 or 6 minutes, stirring occasionally.

While the veggies cook, combine meat, egg, garlic, grated cheese, bread crumbs, salt, pepper, nutmeg.

Uncover your soup pot and add broth and water to the pot.  Increase heat to high and bring soup to a boil.  When soup boils, reduce heat a bit and start to roll meat mixture into small balls, dropping them straight into the pot.  You are making meat dumplings that will cook in the broth.  When you are done rolling the meat, add pasta to the soup and stir.  Cover and simmer soup 10 minutes.

When pasta is tender, stir in chopped spinach in batches.  When spinach has wilted into the soup, the soup is done and ready to serve.  Adjust your seasonings.  Serve soup with crusty bread or Grilled 4 Cheese Sandwiches.

This recipe yields 4 big servings.

  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  chicken breast tenders -- diced
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken thighs -- diced
                        = (or double the amount of white meat)

  2          teaspoons  poultry seasoning
  1 1/2         pounds  andouille sausage -- casings removed,
                        and diced
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4                     celery ribs from heart of bunch -- chopped
  2                     green bell peppers -- seeded, diced
  1              large  onion -- peeled, chopped
  2                     fresh or dried bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  hot cayenne pepper sauce - (to 1/4 cup)
                        = (for mild to moderate heat)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1              quart  chicken stock or broth
  3               cups  chopped fresh or defrosted frozen okra
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 oz) -- in puree
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  8                     scallions -- thinly sliced
                        on an angle
  2 1/2           cups  white enriched rice -- prepared to
  1            package  directions

Preheat a large heavy bottomed pot over medium-high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon oil, 1 turn of the pan, and 1 pound of the diced chicken.  Season with salt and pepper and a sprinkle of poultry seasoning.  Brown on all sides, about 2 or 3 minutes.

Chop your veggies while it's working.  Add half the andouille to the pan and cook another 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer chicken and sausage to a dish and repeat with remaining chicken and sausage, remembering to season the diced chicken as you go.

Return pan to heat and add butter.  When the butter melts, add chopped celery, peppers, onion and bay.  Season with salt, pepper and hot sauce.  Cook 3 to 5 minutes to begin to soften veggies.  Add flour and cook for 2 minutes.  Slowly stir in the broth and bring liquid up to a boil.

Add okra, chicken and sausage to the boiling broth, then stir in your tomatoes and half of your fresh thyme.  Bring back up to a bubble, reduce to simmer.  Simmer for 5 minutes to combine flavors and adjust your seasonings.

Serve gumbo with chopped thyme and scallions to garnish.  Scoop cooked white rice into the center of bowlfuls of gumbo using an ice cream scoop.  Enjoy!

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  spinach -- washed, dried,
                        stems removed
  1               pint  grape or cherry tomatoes -- halved
  2                     lemons -- zested
  1 1/2           cups  orzo -- cooked al dente
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  24                    basil leaves -- torn, or
                        thinly sliced
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Pile spinach leaves in stacks 1 on top of the other.  Thinly slice stacks of leaves to make spinach confetti.  Pile shredded spinach into the bottom of a medium-sized mixing bowl.

Halve grape or cherry tomatoes with a paring knife and add them to the mixing bowl.  Add the zest of 2 lemons to the bowl and save the lemons in the refrigerator to juice for another recipe.

Add hot cooked and drained orzo pasta to the mixing bowl.  The heat of the pasta will wilt the spinach and warm the tomatoes at the bottom of the bowl and get the juices flowing from veggies.  The heat of the pasta will also release the flavor and oils in the lemon zest.

Drizzle 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil over the pasta and toss to combine the veggies and orzo.  Add basil and salt and pepper and toss to combine.  Taste your orzo to adjust seasonings and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper.  Add olive oil to skillet to coat the pan, then add chicken breasts.  Brown chicken breasts 3 to 4 minutes on each side, then transfer to a plate.

Add a little more oil to the pan, then pour in leeks.  Saute leeks 5 minutes, until soft and translucent.  Add 1 cup wine to the pan and nestle chicken breasts down into leeks.  Reduce heat to simmer and cook chicken 5 to 7 minutes longer.

To serve, remove chicken from pan and slice on an angle.  Fan and arrange sliced chicken breasts over a bed of Sauteed leeks on each dinner plate or a warm serving platter.  Serve with rice and salad.

Pilaf:  Heat a medium saucepan or pot over moderate heat.  Add oil and butter and shallots to the pan.  Saute shallots 2 minutes, then add 1 1/2 cups rice.  Lightly brown rice 3 to 5 minutes.  Add wine and allow it to evaporate entirely, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add thyme and chicken broth to the rice.  Fill broth can half-again with water or, measure 1 cup water and add to pot.  Bring liquid to a boil.  Cover rice and reduce heat.  Cook rice 20 minutes, until tender.

Stir the zest of 1 lemon and parsley into rice.  Transfer lemon rice to dinner plates or warm serving dish and garnish with toasted slivered almonds.

Salad:  Heat 3-inches of water in a deep skillet and heat to a boil.  Add trimmed wax and green beans and julienne sliced yellow squash to the pot.  Simmering vegetables in water for 2 minutes, add red peppers and simmer 1 minute longer.  You want the vegetables to remain full of color and bite.  Drain vegetables and cold-shock under running water in your colander.

Place drained vegetables in a serving dish and combine with sliced scallions and shredded dark garden greens, such as spinach or arugula.

Whisk together mustard, vinegar, and lemon juice.  Add olive oil in a slow stream while whisking to get a nice emulsion of your dressing.  Add herbs and pour dressing over the salad.  Toss salad to combine flavors and coat your vegetables evenly.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Olive oil -- for frying
  1 1/2         pounds  chicken breast tenders

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

                        === BREADING ===
  2               cups  Italian-style bread crumbs
  1                cup  shredded Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme leaves  - (to 3)
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  2                     handfuls chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves
  4                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
                        == TOMATO SAUCE FOR CHICKEN PARMIGIANO ==
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  white onion -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                can  chunky-style crushed tomatoes - (14 oz)
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (28 oz)
  1                cup  chicken broth or stock
                        A handful fresh basil leaves -- torn small pieces
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  shredded provolone
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1              pound  spaghetti -- cooked al dente

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place a nonstick cookie sheet in oven with a tin foil liner.

Heat 1/2-inch oil in a large nonstick skillet or frying pan over medium to medium high heat.

Season chicken tenders with salt and pepper.  Wash hands.  Place flour in a shallow dish.  Beat eggs with water in a second dish along side the flour.  In a third dish, combine the breading ingredients.  Coat chicken in flour, then egg, then bread and cheese mixture.  To keep your hands clean, ask for plastic gloves at the butcher counter.  To ease your clean up, try using disposable tin pie tins for the flour, egg and bread crumbs.

Cook chicken until deeply golden on each side, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer to cookie sheet in preheated oven and finish off for another 5 minutes cooking time.  Cook chicken 5 or 6 tenders at a time in a single layer, adding additional oil if necessary.  If the chicken begins to brown too quickly lower heat slightly.  Serve chicken hot or cold with green salad or, complete as a Parmigiano.

Simple Tomato Sauce for Chicken Parmigiano:  Set water on to boil for pasta and prepare according to package directions for al dente.  Before coating chicken, add oil, onions and garlic to a saucepan to cook medium-low heat.  Stir occasionally for 10 minutes while you are working on the chicken.  Add both cans of tomatoes and a cup of chicken broth and bring sauce to a bubble.  Reduce heat to a simmer until ready to serve.  Stir in torn basil and season sauce with salt, to your taste.

Place a little of the sauce on the chicken tenders, top with the shredded provolone and Parmigiano.  Place in oven or broiler to melt the cheese and then serve.  Coat the hot, cooked pasta lightly with sauce then serve.

Enjoy!

     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- cracked
  12            ounces  arugula -- stems removed
     1/2           cup  walnut pieces -- toasted

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ONIONS ===
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  yellow-skinned onions -- sliced very thin
                        Steak seasoning blend
                        = (or coarse salt and pepper)
                        === MEAT ===
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  lean beef tenderloin or sirloin
                        = (ask butcher to slice very thin)
  1           teaspoon  garlic salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             slices  provolone cheese -- from deli counter
  4                     soft 6" to 8" Italian sandwich hogie rolls -- split lengthwise

Heat a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan.  Add onions and season with salt and pepper or steak seasoning blend.  Cook onions, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes or until onions are soft and caramel in color.

Heat a heavy griddle pan over medium-high to high heat.  Wipe griddle with a drizzle of oil using a paper towel.  Sear and cook thin sliced steaks until brown but not crisp, about 2 minutes on each side.  Cook steaks in single layers in 2 batches and tenderize by cutting into meat with the side of your spatula while they cook.

When the steaks are browned, just before you remove them from heat, sprinkle them with garlic salt and pepper.  When all of the steaks are cooked, line each of your split rolls with 2 slices of provolone cheese.

Pile 1/4 of your meat and onions on to the griddle and mix together with your spatula.  Pile the meat and onions into rolls on top of the cheese.  The heat from the meat and onions will melt the cheese.  Repeat for remaining servings and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Heat a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan.  Add onions and season with salt and pepper or steak seasoning blend.  Cook onions, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes or until onions are soft and caramel in color.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a heavy griddle pan over medium-high to high heat.  Wipe griddle with a drizzle of oil using a paper towel.  Sear and cook thin sliced steaks until brown but not crisp, about 2 minutes on each side.  Cook steaks in single layers in 2 batches and tenderize by cutting into meat with the side of your spatula while they cook.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the steaks are browned, just before you remove them from heat, sprinkle them with garlic salt and pepper.  When all of the steaks are cooked, line each of your split rolls with 2 slices of provolone cheese.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pile 1/4 of your meat and onions on to the griddle and mix together with your spatula.  Pile the meat and onions into rolls on top of the cheese.  The heat from the meat and onions will melt the cheese.  Repeat for remaining servings and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POTATOES ===
  2             pounds  red-skinned small new potatoes
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  butter
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh mint
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        === SALMON ===
  7                     fresh Norwegian salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        = (individually packaged in fish
                        department or market)
  2               cups  dry white wine
  2               cups  water - (to 3)
  1                     fresh or dried bay leaf
                        Bouquet of fresh tarragon, dill and
                        parsley sprigs -- tied with string
                        === GARNISH AND ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
  1              bunch  fresh watercress -- washed, trimmed
     1/2                English or seedless cucumber -- thinly sliced
  4             slices  pumpernickel bread -- quartered
  2               cups  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  prepared Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  chopped herbs
                        = (a few sprigs each tarragon, dill and
                        parsley)

Place potatoes in a pot and cover with water.  Cover pot and bring water to a boil.  Add a generous amount of coarse salt to the water, a few healthy pinches.  Reduce heat to medium and boil covered until tender, about 12 minutes.

Place salmon fillets in a large deep skillet or divide between 2 skillets if you do not have a pan large enough to accommodate all 7 portions.  The additional portions will provide the cooked salmon for salmon cakes on another night.  Pour wine and water into the pan so that just the very top of the salmon is exposed.  Add a bay leaf and a bouquet of a few sprigs each fresh tarragon, dill and parsley to the pan and set it down into the liquid.  Place the pan or pans over high heat and bring the liquid to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and cover the pan.  Poach salmon for 10 minutes or, until fish is firm and opaque.

Drain your potatoes and return them to the hot pot.  Add butter to the pot and turn potatoes to coat them lightly in the butter.  Sprinkle the mint and sugar over the potatoes.

Combine sour cream with Dijon mustard and chopped herbs in a small bowl.

Remove salmon from the cooking liquid with a thin spatula.  Reserve 3 portions of the salmon and place in the refrigerator or freeze for salmon cakes meal.

To serve, place a piece of salmon on a plate and garnish with sauce.  Serve pumpernickel squares, watercress and sliced cucumber along side the fish.  Add minted red potatoes to the plate and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings plus 3 fillets reserved for "Salmon Cakes" (see recipe)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  red bell pepper -- seeded, halved
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2             medium  Russet potatoes -- peeled, halved,
                        then thinly sliced across into half moons
  1              small  onion -- halved, then
                        thinly sliced
  1              small  brown paper sack
  8              large  eggs -- beaten
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat broiler to high.  Place red pepper halves on a cookie or baking sheet.  Place peppers under broiler and allow the skins to blacken all over, about 10 minutes.

While peppers are working, heat about 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add sliced potatoes and fry in oil until they begin to become tender, 5 minutes.  Add onions and cook 5 minutes more.  Remove potatoes and onions to a bowl using slotted spoon.

Wipe out pan, return pan to heat and add remaining oil.  Reduce heat to medium.

Remove peppers from broiler.  Leave broiler on.  Place peppers in a brown paper sack and seal sack tightly.  Allow peppers to stand and cool for a couple of minutes.  Peel away charred skin and slice.

Add peppers to potatoes and onions.  Add beaten eggs to cooked vegetables and season with salt and pepper.  Add mixture to the pan and cook until eggs settle and brown on the bottom.  Transfer pan to broiler and allow the egg pie to brown on top and puff up.

Slide pie out of the pan and on to a serving plate.  Cool slightly, then cut into 8 wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  3                     cooked salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)

  2          teaspoons  Old Bay seasoning blend - (rounded)
     1/2                red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  20                    fresh chives blades -- snipped or chopped
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh dill - (to 3)
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper sauce

Toss salad greens with coarse salt and the juice of the lemon you zested.  Drizzle the greens with a little extra-virgin olive oil and re-toss the salad to coat.

Combine mayonnaise, chili sauce and relish in a small dish.

To serve, place salmon cakes on a bed of baby greens, 2 cakes per person and top with chili mayonnaise sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  chopped onion
  1 1/3         pounds  ground sirloin -- 90 percent lean
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
                        McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning -- to taste
                        = (or coarse salt and pepper)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling plus
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     crusty rolls -- split
  4                     portobello mushrooms -- thinly sliced
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             slices  Swiss cheese
  3        tablespoons  aged Balsamic vinegar
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise or reduced fat mayonnaise
                        Coarse black pepper -- to taste
     1/4         pound  baby spinach
  2                     vine ripe tomatoes -- sliced
  2                     scallions -- chopped
  4                     romaine leaves -- (optional)

Preheat grill pan or large nonstick skillet

Saute onions in a small pan over moderate heat for 3 to 5 minutes until tender.

Combine meat with Worcestershire sauce, sauteed onion and steak seasoning blend or salt and pepper.  Form 4 large patties.  Drizzle patties with a touch of extra-virgin olive oil.

Quick toast your split rolls, then add burgers to grill pan or skillet.  Grill or pan-fry burgers 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium well doneness.

Heat a small to medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add a little oil and mushrooms.  Season mushrooms with a little salt and pepper and saute until just tender, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Pile mushrooms on top of burgers just before you are ready to take them off the grill or out of the pan.  Fold each Swiss cheese slice in half and rest on top of mushrooms.  Place a loose tin foil tent over the burgers and turn heat off under pan or grill.  Allow the cheese to begin to melt down over mushroom and burgers, about 2 to 3 minutes.

Combine balsamic, mayonnaise and coarse cracked black pepper in a small dish.

To assemble, place burgers with mushrooms and Swiss cheese on bun bottom.  Slather tops of buns with balsamic black pepper mayonnaise and baby spinach.  Set burger tops in place and serve with sliced vine ripe tomatoes, drizzled with oil, seasoned with salt and pepper and garnished with scallions.  Pile onion rings and a dollop of dipping sauce along side.  For drinks, try black and white frozen shakes -- yum!

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16                    cremini mushroom caps -- cleaned with a
                        damp towel and finely chopped
  1              small  yellow-skinned onion -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1            package  frozen chopped spinach - (10 oz) -- defrosted, and
                        squeezed dry
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        = (or the equivalent of freshly grated)
  2               cups  part skim ricotta
  8                     curly-edge lasagna noodles -- cooked al dente
  1                cup  fat-free chicken broth
  8             ounces  Gorgonzola -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  shredded mozzarella - (to 1 1/2)
                        === STEAMED ASPARAGUS TIPS ===
  2                     small bundle asparagus - (or 1 large)
                        === ROASTED TOMATOES ===
  4                     vine-ripe tomatoes

In a medium skillet over moderate heat, saute mushrooms, chopped onions, and garlic in oil until mushrooms give off their juices and darken and onions are tender, about 7 or 8 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper; the salt will help draw water out of the vegetables as they cook.

Add dry chopped spinach to the pan and heat through for 1 minute.  Adjust seasonings with salt, pepper, and a little nutmeg.  Add ricotta and stir into mixture to heat cheese through, 1 minute longer.  Remove pan from heat but leave in the warm skillet.

Heat broth in a small pan over moderate heat.  Melt Gorgonzola into broth and bring liquid to a bubble.  Stir in cream and thicken sauce 2 minutes.

Place cooked lasagna noodles on a large work surface or cutting board.  Spread lasagna noodles with a layer of spinach-mushroom filling.  Roll up pasta and arrange the 8 bundles in a shallow casserole dish.  Pour warm sauce over roll-ups and top with mozzarella.  Place casserole under broiler to melt cheese.  Serve with Steamed Asparagus Tips and Roasted Tomatoes.

Steamed Asparagus Tips:  While you boil your lasagna noodles, place fresh asparagus tips in a small colander over the boiling water in the pasta pot.  Place a lid on the colander and steam asparagus while you are cooking your pasta for 4 minutes or until tips are just tender.

Roasted Tomatoes:  Split 4 vine ripe tomatoes across the center and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Broil tomatoes.

Serve along side your completed casserole. Top with any fresh herb you have on hand: basil, thyme, or rosemary.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1            package  pizza dough - (16 oz) -- room temperature
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        === TOPPINGS ===
     1/3         pound  trimmed broccoli
                        = (from trimmed broccoli bin in produce
                        section)
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- cracked
     1/2         pound  chicken breast cut for stir fry
                        = (or chicken tenders)
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  part-skim ricotta cheese
  10                    sun dried tomatoes in oil -- drained, sliced
  1                cup  shredded mozzarella cheese
  12                    fresh basil leaves  - (to 15) -- torn, or stacked
                        and thinly sliced

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.

On a 12-inch nonstick pizza pan, stretch out your dough and form the pizza crust.  Drizzle 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil on crust and spread it with a pastry brush over the dough to the edges.  Sprinkle crust with 2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.

In a small covered saucepan, bring 2 inches water to a boil.  Separate broccoli tops into florets, discarding lower stalks or reserving for soup.  Salt water and add broccoli florets.  Cook covered 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain broccoli and set on cutting board.  Chop broccoli florets into small pieces.

Heat a small nonstick pan over medium-high to high heat.  Add oil, cracked garlic and chicken.  Season with salt and pepper.  Brown chicken breast cut for stir-fry or tenders until lightly golden all over, 3 to 5 minutes.  Chop sauteed chicken and garlic on a cutting board into small pieces.

To assemble pizza, dot crust with chopped broccoli bits and cooked chopped chicken.  Dot crust with spoonfuls of ricotta and spread ricotta gently with the back of your spoon.  Add sliced sun-dried tomatoes, scattering them around the pizza to the edges.  Complete the assembly with a thin layer of shredded mozzarella, about 1 cup.

Place pizza in oven on middle rack and lower heat to 450 degrees.  Bake 12 minutes, until cheese is deep golden in color and crust is brown and crisp at the edges.  Remove pizza from the oven and let stand 5 minutes.  Top with lots of torn or shredded basil.  Cut pizza into 8 slices using pizza wheel and serve.

This recipe yields 8 slices, 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable or canola oil -- for frying
  2              large  sweet Vidalia onions
  2               cans  evaporated milk
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  dried mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  sweet paprika
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
  1                cup  reduced fat sour cream
     1/4           cup  chili sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin

Heat 1 inch of vegetable or canola oil in a large frying pan over medium high heat.

Cut onions across into 1-inch rings and separate.  Discard the outer layer of skin on your rings.

Pour evaporated milk into a small, deep bowl.  Mix flour with seasonings in a pie plate or shallow dish.

Dip individual rings in milk, then coat in flour.  And repeat for a double dip.

Fry in a single layer in hot oil until golden brown.  Remove to brown paper bag or paper towel lined surface to drain.  Salt while hot, to your taste.

For dipping sauce, combine all ingredients in a bowl and stir.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tip:  Refrigerate your onions and canned evaporated milk when you unpack from the grocery store.  The colder the better for making onion rings!

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TUNA STEAKS ===
  4                     tuna steaks, 1 1/2" thk - (6 oz ea)
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- as needed
                        Lemon wedges -- for passing
                        === WHITE BEANS ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
  2               cans  cannellini beans -- rinsed, drained
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1                     roasted red pepper -- diced
                        = (homemade [see below] or store bought)
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary -- leaves stripped,
                        and finely chopped
  1                     handful flat-leaf parsley -- chopped
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BITTER GREENS ===
  1               head  escarole -- cleaned, shredded
  1             medium  radicchio head -- shredded
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- to coat
                        Coarse salt -- to taste

If you are planning to roast your red pepper, rather than use store bought, place your pepper under broiler to blacken.  See red pepper method below.

Preheat a large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Pat tuna steaks dry and season with a little coarse salt.  Drizzle extra virgin olive oil over tuna and lightly coat steaks on both sides.  Coat 1 side of the steaks with a generous amount of coarse ground black pepper.  When the pan is very hot, add steaks, peppered-side down.  Sear and brown steaks 2 minutes, then turn, and immediately reduce heat to medium.  Loosely cover pan with aluminum foil tent and allow steaks to cook 5 minutes for rare, 7 minutes for medium.  Steaks should be firm, but have a little give and some pink should remain at the center.

In a second skillet over moderate heat, coat pan with olive oil, add garlic and onion, and saute 3 minutes to soften onion bits.  Add beans and chopped roasted red pepper to the pan.  Heat beans through, 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in rosemary and parsley and season beans with salt and pepper.

Combine escarole and radicchio in shallow dish.  Coat greens with lemon juice, then a drizzle of oil.  Season salad with coarse salt and toss well.

To serve, pile a serving of beans on a dinner plate and top with tuna steak.  Serve salad greens along side beans and fish.  You can also serve this with sliced bread that has been toasted and then rubbed with half a garlic clove.

To roast red peppers:  Preheat broiler to high.  Split and seed pepper and place skin-side up close to hot broiler.  Blacken skins of pepper.  Transfer pepper to brown paper bag and seal.  Let pepper cool to handle.  Peel charred skins away from pepper flesh.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  veal cutlets for scaloppini
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  flour
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  shallot - (or 2 small) -- chopped
  24                    crimini (baby portobello) mushrooms -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  Marsala
     1/2           cup  beef stock
  1                     box egg fettuccini - (12 to 14 oz) -- cooked al dente
                        Finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley -- for garnish

Season veal with salt and pepper.  Place a large piece of plastic food wrap on a cutting board or work surface.  Arrange veal between cutlets on the plastic wrap.  Cover veal with additional plastic wrap and a sheet of waxed paper.  Gently pound out veal with meat mallet or a small, heavy frying pan.  Fold veal up in its plastic and waxed paper wrapper and set aside.

Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Build an assembly line between the veal and the hot pan: veal, shallow dish with flour, butter and olive oil, pile of shallots and sliced mushrooms, Marsala and beef stock.  Place a large platter over low heat on the burner adjacent to your veal pan.  Warm it, then turn off the heat.

Begin cooking the veal Marsala just before your egg fettucini goes into cooking water; the veal will take 12 minutes, the pasta 7 or 8.  If you are serving the suggested side dishes or a salad, these dishes should be assembled before the veal.

Dredge the veal lightly in flour.  Saute cutlets in a single layer 2 minutes on each side.  For each batch of veal, use 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, and 1 tablespoon butter.  Transfer cooked cutlets to the warm serving platter.  If you have a 12- to 14-inch skillet, you should be able to make just 2 batches.

Add another tablespoon extra-virgin oil and 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet.  Add half of the chopped shallots and all of the sliced mushrooms to the pan and season with salt and pepper.  Saute the shallots and mushrooms for 5 minutes.  Add Marsala to the pan and bring up pan drippings.  Add 1/4 cup beef stock and when it bubbles, add 1 tablespoon butter to the pan to gloss your sauce.  Spoon mushrooms and Marsala down over the veal.

Return the pan to the stove.  Add remaining extra-virgin oil, butter and remaining shallots to the skillet.  Cook shallots 1 to 2 minutes.  Add remaining 1/4 cup beef stock to the shallots and add the egg fettucini to the pan.  Toss fettuccini with broth and butter and season with salt and chopped parsley.  Transfer pasta to a serving dish and serve with warm veal Marsala.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Season veal with salt and pepper.  Place a large piece of plastic food wrap on a cutting board or work surface.  Arrange veal between cutlets on the plastic wrap.  Cover veal with additional plastic wrap and a sheet of waxed paper.  Gently pound out veal with meat mallet or a small, heavy frying pan.  Fold veal up in its plastic and waxed paper wrapper and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Build an assembly line between the veal and the hot pan: veal, shallow dish with flour, butter and olive oil, pile of shallots and sliced mushrooms, Marsala and beef stock.  Place a large platter over low heat on the burner adjacent to your veal pan.  Warm it, then turn off the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Begin cooking the veal Marsala just before your egg fettucini goes into cooking water; the veal will take 12 minutes, the pasta 7 or 8.  If you are serving the suggested side dishes or a salad, these dishes should be assembled before the veal.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dredge the veal lightly in flour.  Saute cutlets in a single layer 2 minutes on each side.  For each batch of veal, use 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan, and 1 tablespoon butter.  Transfer cooked cutlets to the warm serving platter.  If you have a 12- to 14-inch skillet, you should be able to make just 2 batches.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add another tablespoon extra-virgin oil and 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet.  Add half of the chopped shallots and all of the sliced mushrooms to the pan and season with salt and pepper.  Saute the shallots and mushrooms for 5 minutes.  Add Marsala to the pan and bring up pan drippings.  Add 1/4 cup beef stock and when it bubbles, add 1 tablespoon butter to the pan to gloss your sauce.  Spoon mushrooms and Marsala down over the veal.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the pan to the stove.  Add remaining extra-virgin oil, butter and remaining shallots to the skillet.  Cook shallots 1 to 2 minutes.  Add remaining 1/4 cup beef stock to the shallots and add the egg fettucini to the pan.  Toss fettuccini with broth and butter and season with salt and chopped parsley.  Transfer pasta to a serving dish and serve with warm veal Marsala.
