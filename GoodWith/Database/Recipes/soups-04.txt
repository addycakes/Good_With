Add a little water if broth is too thick when re- warmed.  Cut tortillas into thin slivers.  Fry in hot oil intil crisp.  Shred the cooled chicken. 
TO SERVE:  Place a small handful of tortilla strips in bowl.  Put the shredded chicken on top of strips, ladle the hot tomato broth on top, but not enough to completely cover the strips and chicken.  Top with avacado slices and grated cheese.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  This is a wonderful tortilla soup, well worth the time to make it...if you like spicy.

  1                can  pinto beans - (15 oz)
                        (or 2 cups cooked (abt 1 cup dried) pinto
                        beans)
  1                can  red kidney beans - (15 oz)
                        (or 2 cups cooked (abt 1 cup dried) red
                        kidney beans)
  2        tablespoons  chili powder
     1/2           cup  plain nonfat yogurt
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Crushed red pepper flakes -- to taste

In a 4- to 5-quart pan, combine carrots, onion, and water.  Cook over high heat, stirring often, until liquid has evaporated and vegetables begin to brown and stick to pan (about 10 minutes). 
Add tomatoes and their liquid to pan; break tomatoes up with a spoon.  Stir in all beans and their liquid (if using home-cooked beans, add 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth mixed with 1 teaspoon cornstarch).  Add chili powder; stir to scrape browned bits free. 
Bring to a boil; then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until flavors are blended (about 15 minutes).  If chili is too thick, add a little water; if it's too thin, continue to simmer until it's as thick as you like. 
Ladle chili into bowls.  Add yogurt, salt, and red pepper flakes to taste. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  chicken -- see * Note
  14              cups  water
  4               thin  ginger root slices -- peeled
  3              whole  scallions - (to 4)
     1/4           cup  rice wine or pale dry sherry -- (optional)
  1         tablespoon  salt -- or to taste

* Note:  Preferably a young fowl, or equivalent in smaller chickens. 
Chinese chicken is always scalded before being cooked in soup.  To do this, bring water (other than the 14 cups) to a boil in a 7-quart straight-sided stainless steel soup pot.  Blanch the whole chicken in it by boiling for 10 minutes.  Lift chicken out and rinse in cold water.  Discard water and rinse pot. 
Return chicken to pot with about 14 cups of water as needed to cover chicken, ginger, scallions and wine, if you are using them, and half of the salt. 
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer very slowly, partially covered for 3 hours.  Turn chicken once in a while, but do not replenish water unless chicken is more than half uncovered, which should not happen. 
Chicken meat will have no flavor and should be discarded.  Soup should be reduced by about one-quarter.  Strain soup and skim off as much fat as possible.  Cool, uncovered, at room temperature, then covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.  This can be frozen for up to 2 months. 
This recipe yields about 2 1/2 quarts; 5 to 10 servings. 
Variation:  Basic Asian Chicken Soup From Canned Broth.  Simmer 10 cups canned, thoroughly degreased chicken broth (preferably low sodium) and 5 cups of water with the ginger, scallions and wine, as above.  Add chicken trimmings if you have any.  Simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes.  Strain, skim and reserve or serve.  Do not salt until serving.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             pounds  beef bones, including knuckle bones,
                        trimmings, etc., in 3" to 4" pieces
                        Oil -- as needed
  6             quarts  cold water - (to 7 quarts)
  8             ounces  coarsely-chopped onions
  4             ounces  coarsely-chopped carrots
  4             ounces  coarsely-chopped celery
  8             ounces  tomatoes -- quartered
  3             ounces  tomato paste -- thinned with
  2        tablespoons  water
  3                     parsley sprigs - (to 4) -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme leaves
  1                     bay leaf
  1                     whole clove
     1/2      teaspoon  cracked black peppercorns
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed

Heat the oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly oil sheet pan and place in the oven to heat.  Place the bones on the sheet pan and roast for 30 minutes, turning occasionally. 
Paint the bones with a thin layer of the thinned tomato paste, and roast for an additional 30 minutes, turning occasionally, until evenly browned. 
Place the bones in the stockpot and cover with cold water.  Bring to a boil, and then lower to a simmer.  Skim any scum that forms on the surface gradually as needed. 
Drain and reserve the fat from the pan; deglaze the pan with water and add to the stockpot.  Continue to simmer the stock for 6 to 7 hours, skimming as needed.  If necessary, you may add more hot water to keep the bones covered. 
Toss the mirepoix (onions, carrots, celery) with the fat and brown in the oven.  Add the browned mirepoix, tomatoes and sachet (parsley, thyme, bay, cloves, peppercorns, garlic placed into a 4" square of cheesecloth and tied into a sack) to the pot.  Simmer for another 1 to 2 hours. 
Strain the stock through a china cap layered with cheesecloth, and cool the stockpot in an ice-water bath.  Transfer to a container and refrigerate overnight; the next day, skim off all the fat that's risen to the surface. 
This recipe yields about 1 gallon of stock.

  1                cup  diced peeled rutabaga (wax turnips
  1                cup  diced peeled parsnips

Season the beef with salt and pepper.  Tie the bay leaves, thyme and rosemary into a sachet garni in cheesecloth. 
In a large casserole combine the oil and butter and heat until the butter bubbles.  Add the beef in one flat and not too tightly packed layer and brown the beef well on all sides.  Remove the beef, set aside and add the onions to the casserole and cook to a golden caramelized color.  Sprinkle the onions with the flour and stir to combine well. 
Return the beef to the casserole, add the beer, hot broth, herb sachet garni, tomatoes, salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to a slow simmer.  Cook for 3/4 hour. 
Add the carrots, celery, rutabaga and parsnips and continue to cook for 1 additional hour. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chili                           Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil or bacon fat
  1 1/2         pounds  onions -- coarsely chopped
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced, or crushed
                        through a press
  2             pounds  lean ground beef, sirloin, or chuck
  2             pounds  lean ground pork
     3/4           cup  chili powder, (preferably a mix of half
                        ancho and half pasilla, but any will do)
  3        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2        tablespoons  sugar - (to 3 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin -- plus
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano -- plus
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds -- (optional)
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper -- (optional)
  3                     bay leaves
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- undrained, and
                        roughly chopped
  1                can  tomato sauce - (8 oz)
  3            bottles  dark or medium beer - (12 oz ea) -- such as
                        Mexican Dos Equis, Heineken, or Beck's
  6             slices  hickory-smoked bacon -- finely chopped
  1              pound  dried small pink beans -- soaked, and
                        still in their soaking liquid
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced, or crushed
                        through a press
  2          teaspoons  salt

Spoon the oil into a large, heavy casserole or Dutch oven set over moderate heat.  Add the onions and sautÈ until softened and lightly colored, about 10 minutes.  Add the garlic and sautÈ for 2 minutes.  Reserve. 
Return the pot to moderate heat and crumble in the beef and pork.  Increase the heat to high and brown well, without stirring, for 5 minutes.  Reduce the heat to moderately-high and brown, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes longer. 
Return the onions to the pot and stir in 1/2 cup of the chili powder, 2 tablespoons of the cocoa, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, 1 tablespoon of the cumin, 1 tablespoon of the oregano, fennel seeds, salt, cayenne, and bay leaves.  Add the tomatoes and their juices, the tomato sauce, 2 bottles of the beer and 4 cups of water. 
Bring the mixture to a boil over moderate heat.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 3 hours.  Stir gently every 30 minutes, but do not stir during the last 15 to 20 minutes so all of the fat will rise to the top. 
Meanwhile, prepare the beans.  Put the bacon in a large, heavy saucepan set over moderate heat.  Cook, stirring frequently, until crisp and deep golden brown.  Spoon off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat.  Drain the beans (no matter which soaking technique you have used) and measure the liquid.  Add water to make 6 cups. 
Add the beans and liquid to the bacon in the pan and bring to a boil, stirring frequently, over moderate heat.  Reduce the heat to low, partially cover, and simmer for 1 hour. 
Add the garlic and salt, partially cover, and simmer until the beans are tender, about 1 hour longer.  Remove from the heat and set aside. 
When the chili has cooked for 3 hours, degrease it, skimming off most of the fat.  Place a paper towel flat on the surface to soak up any remaining fat repeat, if necessary.  Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup chili powder, 1 tablespoon cocoa, 1 teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon oregano.  Taste for balance of acidity to sweetness and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, if needed.  Add the beans and their cooking liquid.  Set the chili aside to cool to room temperature.  If making ahead, cover and refrigerate overnight. 
Pre-heat the oven to 300 degrees.  Stir the remaining 1 bottle of beer into the chili.  Bake, uncovered, for 2 hours, stirring once in a while.  Serve hot. 
This recipe yields 12 servings (20 cups).

                      Black Bean Chili With Oranges

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chili                           Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  onions -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1         tablespoon  salad oil
  3               cans  black beans - (15 oz ea) -- drained, and
                        rinsed well
  1                cup  vegetable broth
  1         tablespoon  coriander seeds
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/8      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes -- or to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cardamom
  4              large  naval oranges - (2 to 2 1/2 lbs total)
  1                cup  nonfat sour cream
                        Salt -- to taste

In a 5- to 6-quart pan, combine onions, garlic, oil, and 1/4 cup water.  Cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until onions are tinged with brown (about 10 minutes); add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if pan appears dry. 
Add beans, broth, coriander seeds, oregano, allspice, red pepper flakes, and cardamom.  Bring to a boil; then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until flavors are blended (about 10 minutes). 
Meanwhile, finely shred enough peel (colored part only) from oranges to make 2 teaspoons.  Squeeze juice from enough oranges to make 1/2 cup.  Set shredded peel and juice aside.  Cut peel and all white membrane from remaining oranges; thinly slice fruit crosswise.  Cover sliced oranges and set aside. 
Uncover chili; bring to a boil over medium heat.  Then boil, stirring occasionally, until thickened (15 to 20 minutes; as chili thickens, reduce heat and stir more often).  Stir 1 teaspoon of the orange peel and the 1/2 cup orange juice into chili. 
Ladle chili into bowls; top with orange slices and sour cream.  Garnish with remaining 1 teaspoon orange peel.  Season to taste with salt. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a 5- to 6-quart pan, combine onions, garlic, oil, and 1/4 cup water.  Cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until onions are tinged with brown (about 10 minutes); add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if pan appears dry. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add beans, broth, coriander seeds, oregano, allspice, red pepper flakes, and cardamom.  Bring to a boil; then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until flavors are blended (about 10 minutes). 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, finely shred enough peel (colored part only) from oranges to make 2 teaspoons.  Squeeze juice from enough oranges to make 1/2 cup.  Set shredded peel and juice aside.  Cut peel and all white membrane from remaining oranges; thinly slice fruit crosswise.  Cover sliced oranges and set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Uncover chili; bring to a boil over medium heat.  Then boil, stirring occasionally, until thickened (15 to 20 minutes; as chili thickens, reduce heat and stir more often).  Stir 1 teaspoon of the orange peel and the 1/2 cup orange juice into chili. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Ladle chili into bowls; top with orange slices and sour cream.  Garnish with remaining 1 teaspoon orange peel.  Season to taste with salt.

                  Butternut-Cider Soup With Ginger Cream

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  butternut squash - (8 cups diced)
  6                     bacon slices
  4        tablespoons  butter -- (divided)
  1                cup  chopped onion
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  vermouth or other dry white wine
  3 1/2           cups  cider
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
  1                cup  whipping cream
     1/4      teaspoon  fresh-grated nutmeg

With a very sharp knife, cut off stem and blossom ends of squash.  With a potato peeler, slice off skin.  Cut squash in half lengthwise; scoop out and discard seeds and strings.  Cut squash into 1-inch cubes.  You should have about 8 cups. 
In a soup kettle, fry bacon until crisp.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Add 2 tablespoons butter to the bacon fat and melt.  Add squash and saute over high heat, stirring often, until chunks begin to caramelize and turn brown, about 5 minutes. 
Add remaining butter and onion.  Season with salt and pepper.  Reduce heat to medium and cook until onion is softened, about 5 minutes longer.  Increase heat to medium-high, add vermouth and stir until the liquid is absorbed.  Add cider.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. 
Meanwhile, combine ginger and whipping cream in a small saucepan.  Boil over high heat, whisking constantly, until cream is reduced to 1/2 cup.  Set aside. 
In batches, puree soup in a food processor or blender.  Return to kettle and add additional cider, if necessary, to produce a thick, soupy consistency.  Stir in nutmeg and crumble in bacon.  Heat through. 
Ladle soup into 8 bowls.  Place a small amount of ginger cream in the center of each bowl and swirl to create an attractive pattern. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  This is a very rich-tasting soup.  One you can be proud to serve your guests.

With a very sharp knife, cut off stem and blossom ends of squash.  With a potato peeler, slice off skin.  Cut squash in half lengthwise; scoop out and discard seeds and strings.  Cut squash into 1-inch cubes.  You should have about 8 cups. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a soup kettle, fry bacon until crisp.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Add 2 tablespoons butter to the bacon fat and melt.  Add squash and saute over high heat, stirring often, until chunks begin to caramelize and turn brown, about 5 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add remaining butter and onion.  Season with salt and pepper.  Reduce heat to medium and cook until onion is softened, about 5 minutes longer.  Increase heat to medium-high, add vermouth and stir until the liquid is absorbed.  Add cider.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, combine ginger and whipping cream in a small saucepan.  Boil over high heat, whisking constantly, until cream is reduced to 1/2 cup.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In batches, puree soup in a food processor or blender.  Return to kettle and add additional cider, if necessary, to produce a thick, soupy consistency.  Stir in nutmeg and crumble in bacon.  Heat through. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Ladle soup into 8 bowls.  Place a small amount of ginger cream in the center of each bowl and swirl to create an attractive pattern. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This is a very rich-tasting soup.  One you can be proud to serve your guests.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  chicken bones
  1              large  onion -- peeled, quartered
  1              large  carrot -- cut into thirds
  2                     celery stalks -- cut into thirds
  2              large  or 4 small leeks -- halved lengthwise,
                        and washed well
  2                     bay leaves
  6             sprigs  fresh flat-leaf parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  12             whole  black peppercorns

Place all the ingredients in an 8-quart stock pot and cover with cold water.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  As the stock approaches a boil, remove any impurities that rise to the top by skimming with a ladle.  Reduce the heat and simmer the stock for 3 to 4 hours, continuing to skim impurities from time to time while the stock cooks.  Taste after 3 hours for the strength of stock you want. 
Remove from the heat and let the sock sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then ladle through a fine strainer.  Once strained, remove the fat from the stock by stock by skimming with a ladle.  Another way to defat the sock is to place the cooled stock in the refrigerator overnight.  The fat will set on the top and can be easily spooned off.  Cool by placing the container of strained stock in an ice water bath, then refrigerate. 
The stock will keep for about 1 week in the refrigerator, or freeze in 1 cup batches for longer storage. 
Variation:  Use a large (5- to 6-pound) roasting chicken in place of the bones.  Use the meat for chicken salad or croquettes. 
This recipe yields 1 1/2 quarts.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless pork shoulder -- trimmed of fat,
                        and cut into 3/4" cubes
  1          large can  tomatoes - (abt 28 oz)
  2             medium  onions -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced celery
  1           teaspoon  dry oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  rubbed sage
  2                     dry bay leaves
  1              large  green bell pepper - (abt 8 oz) -- seeded, chopped
  2             medium  fresh green Anaheim, poblano, or other
                        mild chiles (3 to 4 oz) -- seeded, chopped
  4               cups  hot cooked rice
                        Cilantro sprigs

Place pork in a wide nonstick frying pan.  Drain about 1/2 cup liquid from tomatoes into pan.  Bring to a boil over high heat; then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. 
Uncover pan; add onions, celery, oregano, and sage.  Cook over high heat, stirring often, until liquid has evaporated and drippings are browned (8 to 10 minutes).  Add bay leaves.  Cut up tomatoes; then add tomatoes and their remaining liquid and stir to scrape browned bits free. 
Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 more minutes.  Stir in bell pepper and chiles; cover and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until pork is very tender when pierced (about 15 more minutes).  If chili is too thin, uncover and simmer until it's as thick as you like.  Skim and discard fat, if necessary.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  low-sodium chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  finely chopped fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  reduced-sodium soy sauce - (to 3 tspns)
  12            ounces  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut 1/2" cubes
  6             ounces  mushrooms -- sliced
  3               cups  thinly-sliced bok choy
  1                cup  cubed firm tofu in 1/2" cubes
     1/2           cup  sliced green onions
  8             ounces  small cooked shrimp
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
                        Ground red pepper (cayenne) or chili oil -- (optional)

In a 4- to 5-quart pan, combine broth, ginger, and soy sauce; bring to a boil over high heat.  Add chicken, mushrooms, bok choy, tofu, and onions.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in center; cut to test (about 2 minutes). 
Remove pan from heat and stir in shrimp and cilantro.  Season to taste with red pepper, if desired. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This Asian-style soup is ready to serve almost as soon as it boils.  Once you've prepared the nourishing ingredients -- chicken, shrimp, tofu, and vegetables -- there's little left to do but combine and heat them, then savor the result.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  red bell peppers
  1              pound  ripe tomatoes
  1              pound  cucumber
  6             ounces  crustless French or Italian bread -- (weight after the
                        crust is removed)
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- peeled
  1                cup  chopped sweet onion
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped peeled seeded cucumber
  2                     hard-boiled eggs -- very coarsely
                        chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped pitted mild brine-cured
                        black olives
  2                     Haas avocados
                        Lemon juice
                        Minced parsley -- for garnish

Grill peppers on a grill, or on top of a gas range.  Frequently turn peppers until evenly charred on all sides (about 5 to 7 minutes).  Peel charred skin under cool running water.  Cut peppers open; discard stems and seeds.  Place peeled and seeded peppers in food processor. 
Cut out the stems of each tomato, then blanch and peel.  Cut skinned tomatoes in quarters and squeeze out seeds from the tomato pieces.  Place peeled and seeded tomatoes in the food processor. 
Peel the cucumbers, and cut them in half the long way.  Working with a teaspoon, scoop out the cucumber seeds.  Cut the cucumbers into the coarse chunks, and add them to the food processors. 
Place the bread in a bowl of cold water for 30 seconds, then squeeze the water out of the bread.  Add the bread to the food processor, along with the garlic, onion, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Process for at least 2 minutes, or until a smooth puree is achieved. 
Place the gazpacho in a covered bowl and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours (the longer it sits, the better the flavors will blend). 
Working over a bowl, place the gazpacho in a strainer.  Mash the gazpacho against the sides of the strainer with a wooden spoon, extracting every possible drop of liquid.  This may take 15 to 20 minutes.  Discard the content of the strainer. 
The gazpacho in the bowl will be medium-thin; if you 've used a very fine strainer, you'll have about 3 cups of gazpacho.  Gently stir in the cucumber, eggs, and olives. 
Peel the avocados, pit them, and cut into very coarse chunks.  Drizzle chunks with lemon juice, to prevent discoloration, and season with salt.  Gently stir into gazpacho. 
Serve immediately in small soup bowls, garnished with parsley. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Grill peppers on a grill, or on top of a gas range.  Frequently turn peppers until evenly charred on all sides (about 5 to 7 minutes).  Peel charred skin under cool running water.  Cut peppers open; discard stems and seeds.  Place peeled and seeded peppers in food processor. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut out the stems of each tomato, then blanch and peel.  Cut skinned tomatoes in quarters and squeeze out seeds from the tomato pieces.  Place peeled and seeded tomatoes in the food processor. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Peel the cucumbers, and cut them in half the long way.  Working with a teaspoon, scoop out the cucumber seeds.  Cut the cucumbers into the coarse chunks, and add them to the food processors. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the bread in a bowl of cold water for 30 seconds, then squeeze the water out of the bread.  Add the bread to the food processor, along with the garlic, onion, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Process for at least 2 minutes, or until a smooth puree is achieved. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the gazpacho in a covered bowl and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours (the longer it sits, the better the flavors will blend). 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Working over a bowl, place the gazpacho in a strainer.  Mash the gazpacho against the sides of the strainer with a wooden spoon, extracting every possible drop of liquid.  This may take 15 to 20 minutes.  Discard the content of the strainer. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
The gazpacho in the bowl will be medium-thin; if you &apos;ve used a very fine strainer, you&apos;ll have about 3 cups of gazpacho.  Gently stir in the cucumber, eggs, and olives. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Peel the avocados, pit them, and cut into very coarse chunks.  Drizzle chunks with lemon juice, to prevent discoloration, and season with salt.  Gently stir into gazpacho. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve immediately in small soup bowls, garnished with parsley. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2                     cantaloupes
  1                     honeydew melon
  1              pound  potatoes
  6               cups  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  6             sprigs  mint leaves

Remove skin and seeds from cantaloupe and honeydew, cut melon in cubes and put in a bowl in the refrigerator. 
Peel potatoes and cut them in pieces.  Put in a saucepan with water, salt and pepper.  Cook over medium heat until potatoes are barely soft. 
Divide potatoes and water into two saucepans.  Add the cantaloupe to one and the honeydew to the other.  Cook for one more minute, then chill immediately. 
In a blender or food processor, blend contents of each pan separately to a creamy texture.  Pour both mixtures slowly into a serving bowl at the same time so finished soup appears half orange and half green.  Decorate with mint leaves.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  snow crab clusters (legs)
  4             quarts  water - (16 cups)
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1 1/2                 celery stalks -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- quartered
  2                     potatoes -- peeled, chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  2          teaspoons  mustard seed
  1         tablespoon  chopped pimento
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  2                     bay leaves
     1/3           cup  tomato sauce
  2        tablespoons  half-and-half
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
     1/4      teaspoon  thyme
     1/8      teaspoon  basil
     1/8      teaspoon  marjoram

Remove all the crab meat from the shells and set it aside. 
Put half of the shells into a large pot with 4 quarts of water over high heat.  Add onion, 1 stalk of chopped celery, and garlic, then bring mixture to a boil.  Continue to boil for 1 hour, stirring occasionally (the white part of the shells will start to become transparent), then strain stock.  Discard the shells, onion, celery and garlic, keeping only the stock. 
Measure 3 quarts (12 cups) of the stock into a large sauce pan or cooking pot.  If you don't have enough stock, add enough water to make 3 quarts. 
Add potatoes, bring mixture to a boil, then add 1/2 of the crab and the remaining ingredients to the pot and bring it back to boiling.  Reduce heat and simmer for 4 hours, uncovered until it reduces by about half and starts to thicken. 
Add the remaining crab and simmer for another hour until the soup is very thick. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Put half of the shells into a large pot with 4 quarts of water over high heat.  Add onion, 1 stalk of chopped celery, and garlic, then bring mixture to a boil.  Continue to boil for 1 hour, stirring occasionally (the white part of the shells will start to become transparent), then strain stock.  Discard the shells, onion, celery and garlic, keeping only the stock. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Measure 3 quarts (12 cups) of the stock into a large sauce pan or cooking pot.  If you don&apos;t have enough stock, add enough water to make 3 quarts. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add potatoes, bring mixture to a boil, then add 1/2 of the crab and the remaining ingredients to the pot and bring it back to boiling.  Reduce heat and simmer for 4 hours, uncovered until it reduces by about half and starts to thicken. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the remaining crab and simmer for another hour until the soup is very thick. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Cooking oil
  10            pounds  crawfish tails
  20            medium  onions -- chopped
  5                     bell peppers -- chopped
  10       tablespoons  flour
                        Water -- as needed
  1              bunch  shallots -- chopped
  1                cup  chopped parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Ground red pepper -- to taste
                        Tabasco sauce -- to taste
                        Steaming rice -- for serving

In a 15- to 20-pound roaster or Dutch oven, heat 1/8 inch of oil.  (Use more if crawfish tails do not have much fat on them.)  Fry crawfish, a layer at a time, until they are crusty, not brown.  Remove from oil and set aside. 
Saute onions and bell peppers in oil until clear.  Return tails to pot and stir in flour until smooth, adding more oil if needed for smoothness.  Gradually add water to achieve consistency desired.  Stir in shallots, parsley, and seasonings, and bring to a boil.  Continue boiling rapidly for 10 minutes.  Turn off, cool and refrigerate.  To serve, reheat slowly and spoon over mounds of steaming rice. 
This recipe yields 40 to 50 servings.

Recipe By     :Linda and Fred Griffith, "Onions, Onions, Onions"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  4               cups  finely-diced white onions
  1 1/2           cups  chopped leeks, white part only
     3/4           cup  finely-diced shallots
  2              large  carrots -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh tarragon
  3        tablespoons  unbleached flour
  5               cups  milk
     3/4           cup  port wine
     1/2         pound  Stilton cheese -- crumbled
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  3             strips  cooked bacon -- crumbled, (optional)
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh chives

In a large, heavy-bottomed non-aluminum saucepan, melt butter over low heat.  Add onions, leeks, shallots, carrots, parsley and tarragon.  Cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook over very low heat, stirring occasionally, until onion and carrots are tender, about 20 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3           teaspoon  olive oil
  4                     bacon slices -- diced
     1/2                Spanish onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1                cup  black beans -- soaked overnight
  1 1/2          quart  water
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  long-grain rice
  1                     mango -- diced
     1/2                red bell pepper -- chopped
     1/2         bunch  scallions -- sliced thin
     1/2         bunch  flat-leaf parsley -- chopped

  1         tablespoon  minced purple onion
     1/2         pound  fresh spinach
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced

     1/4           cup  plain low-fat yogurt
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

For the soup, position knife blade in food processor bowl; add cucumber, 1 cup yogurt, and next 3 ingredients.  Process until smooth; pour into a bowl.  Stir in remaining 1 cup yogurt and purple onion.  Cover and chill 3 hours. 
For the spinach puree, remove stems from spinach; wash leaves.  (Do not pat dry.)  Place in a large skillet over medium heat; cover and cook 7 minutes or until spinach wilts, stirring occasionally.  (Do not add water.)  Press spinach between paper towels until barely moist; set aside.

  2                     chicken bouillon cubes
  28            ounces  canned whole tomatoes with liquid -- quartered
  1                can  tomato paste - (6 oz)
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  3              large  celery ribs -- chopped
  4                     carrots -- peeled, bias sliced

Sort and wash all beans thoroughly.  Drain and place in a 4-quart kettle with 5 cups of water.  Bring to a boil, boil 2 minutes, remove from heat, cover and let stand for at least 1 hour, preferably more. 
Meanwhile, place ham bone and 3 quarts of water in an 8-quart soup kettle.  Simmer until beans have cooled 1 hour. 
Drain beans and add to the ham stock.  Add remaining ingredients and simmer about 2 hours or until beans are tender.  Add more hot water if needed to keep beans covered. 
Remove bone, discard fat, skin and gristle; return chopped ham to pot.  Ladle into warm soup bowls and serve. 
This recipe yields about 5 1/2 quarts. 
Comments:  This makes a lot of delicious soup so freeze some for later or give to a nice neighbor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  assorted fish fillets, such as snapper,
                        halibut, tilefish, and/or cod -- skinned, boned,
                        and cut into chunks
  1 1/2           cups  diced onions
  2                     leeks, white and light green parts only -- split, well washed
                        and diced (abt 2 1/2 cups)
  2                     celery stalks -- diced (abt 1/2 cup)
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped garlic
  1                cup  canned plum tomatoes -- drained, seeded,
                        and diced
  1           teaspoon  saffron threads
  2                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  dried thyme
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2             quarts  Fish Stock -- (see recipe)
  2                     Idaho potatoes - (abt 1 lb) -- peeled, diced
  1              small  lobster, raw and in the shell -- cut into pieces
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2         pound  fresh shrimp -- peeled, deveined
                        French baguette -- sliced 1/4" thick
                        (about 3 to 4 slices per person)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  cracked black peppercorns - (to 2 tspns)

Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed soup pot, add the onions, leeks, and celery, and saute until translucent, about 6 minutes. 
Add the garlic, tomatoes, saffron, and seasonings.  Stir for about 2 minutes, then add the white wine and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until almost all the liquid has evaporated, before adding the Fish Stock. 
Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes.  At the end of 45 minutes, add the potatoes and begin to cook. 
While the broth is simmering, make the Peppery Croutons by brushing one side of each French bread slice with olive oil, sprinkle with cracked pepper, and toast in a 300 degree oven until crisp (about 12 minutes). 
After the potatoes have simmered for 10 minutes, add the lobster.  Return to a boil and cook at a strong simmer for 5 minutes, before adding the fish chunks and the shrimp and cook until the fish is just cooked, but not yet flaking apart. 
Remove the bay leaves, taste for seasoning, and serve immediately, garnished with the Peppery Croutons. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pounds  lean fish bones, heads, etc.
  2        tablespoons  butter
  8             ounces  onions -- diced
  4             ounces  celery -- diced
  4             ounces  parsnips -- diced
  4             ounces  mushroom trimmings
  4             quarts  cold water
  1                cup  dry white wine
  6                     parsley stems - (to 8) -- chopped
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4      teaspoon  cracked black peppercorns
  1                     whole clove

Melt the butter in the bottom of a large stockpot.  Add the mirepoix (onions, celery, parsnips, mushrooms), and place the bones on top.  Cover the mixture with a piece of parchment paper cut to fit the pot.  Sweat the mirepoix and bones over low heat for about 5 minutes, until the bones turn opaque and release some juices.  Add the wine, bring to a simmer.  Add the sachet (parsley, bay, peppercorns, clove and placed into a 4" square of cheesecloth and tied into a sack), and water to cover. 
Bring to a simmer, skim any scum that forms, and continue to simmer for 45 minutes.  Strain through a china cap layered with cheesecloth.  Cool the stock immediately in an ice-water bath, transfer to a container and refrigerate.  Skim off any fat that rises to the top. 
This recipe yields ?? servings. 
Comments:  Fish stock is also know as fish fumet.  Make sure the fish bones you use are from lean fish and not fatty fish (avoid salmon or trout bones, for instance).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1              pound  ground skinless turkey
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced or pressed
  1                can  tomato sauce - (8 oz)
  1                can  stewed tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                can  red kidney beans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed;
                        (or 2 cups cooked red kidney beans,
                        drained and rinsed)
  1         tablespoon  molasses
     1/4      teaspoon  liquid hot pepper seasoning
  1         tablespoon  unsweetened cocoa
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  dry oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  dry basil

In a 4- to 5-quart pan, combine onion and 1/4 cup water.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; then boil, stirring occasionally, until liquid evaporates and onion begins to brown (about 5 minutes). 
To deglaze, add 1/4 cup more water and stir to scrape browned bits free.  Then continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to brown again.  Repeat deglazing and browning steps, using 1/4 cup more water. 
Crumble turkey into pan; add garlic.  Cook, stirring, until meat is no longer pink and liquid has evaporated.  Stir in tomato sauce, tomatoes, beans, molasses, hot pepper seasoning, cocoa, paprika, cumin, oregano, and basil.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until flavors are well blended (about 30 minutes). 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

To deglaze, add 1/4 cup more water and stir to scrape browned bits free.  Then continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to brown again.  Repeat deglazing and browning steps, using 1/4 cup more water.

Crumble turkey into pan; add garlic.  Cook, stirring, until meat is no longer pink and liquid has evaporated.  Stir in tomato sauce, tomatoes, beans, molasses, hot pepper seasoning, cocoa, paprika, cumin, oregano, and basil.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until flavors are well blended (about 30 minutes).

Comments:  Serve this streamlined version of an intricate Mexican dish as you would chili -- ladle it into big bowls to eat with a spoon.  Offer water-crisped tortilla chips alongside; they complement the chili without compromising its low fat content.

                         Harvest Pumpkin Soup II

Recipe By     :American Dairy Association

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pumpkin - (approx 3 lbs)
                        (or 2 1/2 cups canned pumpkin)
  1                     potato -- peeled, chopped
  2                     leeks, white portion only -- sliced
                        (or 1/3 cup sliced green onions,
                        white part only)
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  14 1/2        ounces  chicken stock
  4               cups  milk
     1/2           cup  unsweetened heavy cream -- softly whipped
                        (or use sour cream)

For fresh pumpkin, cut in half and remove seeds.  Bake in greased pan, cut-side down, 40 to 50 minutes at 375 degrees until tender.  Scrape pulp from shell and reserve. 
Saute potato and leeks in butter until soft; add seasonings, chicken stock, pumpkin, and milk.  Simmer 25 minutes, then puree in small batches in blender or processor.  Garnish each serving with cream. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  The venerable pumpkin, one of the prize products of the Indian Summer harvest, is also a flavorful, versatile, and surprisingly sophisticated menu ingredient.  When shedding its more traditional identity, as in pumpkin pie and pumpkin bread, fresh pumpkin becomes a hearty base for a main course, stick-to-the-ribs vegetable soup.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             quarts  water - (16 cups)
  6               cups  chicken stock
  2                     potatoes -- peeled, sliced
  2                     carrots -- peeled, sliced
  2                     celery stalks with leaves -- sliced
  2               cups  diced peeled eggplant
                        (abt 1/2 of an eggplant)
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1                cup  frozen yellow corn
     2/3           cup  diced canned roasted red pepper
     1/2           cup  tomato sauce
     1/2           cup  shelled pistachios
     1/2           cup  roasted cashews
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
     1/4           cup  lemon juice
     1/4           cup  butter
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  thyme
  1                     bay leaf
  1               dash  marjoram
  1               dash  nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste

Combine all ingredients in a large pot over high heat.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 4 to 5 hours or until soup has reduced by more than half, and is thick and brownish in color.  It should have a thick consistency. 
Stir occasionally for the first few hours, but stir often in the last hour.  The edges of the potatoes should become more rounded, and the nuts will soften.  Serve hot. 
Because of the reduction of this soup the salt in the stock may be enough so do not add additional salt until the soup has reduced. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 
Comments:  This soup was made famous by the Seinfeld television series when it was served by the "Soup Nazi" but the robust flavor should make it famous on it's own.

Combine all ingredients in a large pot over high heat.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 4 to 5 hours or until soup has reduced by more than half, and is thick and brownish in color.  It should have a thick consistency. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir occasionally for the first few hours, but stir often in the last hour.  The edges of the potatoes should become more rounded, and the nuts will soften.  Serve hot. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Because of the reduction of this soup the salt in the stock may be enough so do not add additional salt until the soup has reduced. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  This soup was made famous by the Seinfeld television series when it was served by the &quot;Soup Nazi&quot; but the robust flavor should make it famous on it&apos;s own.

  1              piece  Parmesan cheese rind - (abt 5" by 2")
                        Salt -- to taste
  1                can  cannellini beans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
     1/4           cup  basil pesto

Bring vegetables, tomatoes, water, cheese rind, and 1 teaspoon salt to boil in a soup kettle or pot.  Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender but still hold their shape, about 1 hour. 
The soup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 days or frozen for 1 month.  Defrost if necessary and reheat before proceeding with recipe. 
Add beans and cook just until heated through, about 5 minutes.  Remove pot from heat.  Remove and discard cheese rind.  Stir in pesto (or rosemary garlic mixture).  Adjust seasonings, adding pepper and more salt, if necessary. 
Ladle soup into bowls and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  chicken breast fillets - (4 fillets)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  10              cups  water
  2               cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  tomato sauce
  1                     potato -- peeled, chopped
  1              small  onion -- diced
  1                cup  frozen yellow corn
     1/2                carrot -- sliced
  1                     celery stalk -- diced
  1                cup  diced canned tomatoes
  1                can  red kidney beans - (15 oz) -- plus liquid
     1/4           cup  diced canned pimento
  1                     jalapeÒo -- diced
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian parsley
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  cayenne pepper
  1               dash  basil
  1               dash  oregano
                        Sour cream - on the side
  1              pinch  chopped Italian parsley - on the side

SautÈ the chicken breasts in the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Cook the chicken on both sides until done -- about 7 to 10 minutes per side.  Cool the chicken until it can be handled.  Do not rinse the pot. 
Shred the chicken by hand into bite-sized pieces and place the pieces back into the pot. 
Add the remaining ingredients to the pot and turn heat to high.  Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 4 to 5 hours.  Stir mixture often so that many of the chicken pieces shred into much smaller bits.  Chili should reduce substantially to thicken and darken (less orange, more brown) when done. 
Combine some chopped Italian parsley with sour cream and serve it on the side for topping the chili, if desired. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                      Miso Soup With Enoki Mushrooms

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     four-inch square dried kombu -- cleaned with a
                        damp cloth
     2/3           cup  bonito flakes (fish flakes)
     1/3         pound  enoki mushrooms - (1 pkg) -- reserve a few
                        for garnish
  2        tablespoons  miso
  2                     scallions -- finely sliced

To prepare the dashi, combine the kombu and 4 cups water in a pot, and bring to a boil.  Remove the kelp, and discard.  Add the bonito flakes, stir well, and remove from the heat.  Let the flakes settle to the bottom of the pot, about 30 seconds.  Strain the stock through a fine sieve, discarding the bonito flakes. 
Return the stock to the pot, and add the mushrooms.  Cook over moderate heat until the mushrooms have softened, about 3 minutes. 
In a small bowl, dissolve miso in a ladleful of dashi.  Add dissolved miso to the soup, and stir to combine. 
Divide the soup among four bowls, and sprinkle with the reserved enoki and the scallions. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Whether in soup, marinades, salad dressings, or spread on grilled vegetables, nearly everyone in Japan consumes miso in some form every day.  The three basic kinds of miso -- barley, rice, and soybean -- are produced by crushing boiled soybeans into a paste then infusing them with a special mold from barley, rice, or soybean; these molds give the base paste distinctive flavors.  The mixture then ferments and matures for six months to three years in plastic or stainless steel holding tanks. 
Use lighter-colored varieties in delicate soups and dressings, and the darker ones in more robust dishes.  If refrigerated in an airtight container, miso can be stored for up to one year.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (abt 6 oz ea
                        or 18 oz chicken tenders)
  1             medium  onion - (abt 8 oz)
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  hot paprika
                        (or 3/4 tspn sweet paprika
                        and 1/4 tspn cayenne pepper)
  5               cups  chicken stock
  2             medium  zucchini - (abt 12 oz)
     1/2           cup  instant couscous
  1                can  chickpeas - (16 oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     cilantro sprigs

Put the oil in a deep, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Cut the chicken into 1/2- to 3/4-inch cubes.  Add to the skillet, raise the heat to high, and stir once or twice. 
While the chicken browns, peel and quarter the onion and put in a food processor.  Pulse until just chopped.  Add the onion, cumin, ginger, and paprika to the skillet.  Stir and cook for 1 minute.  Add the stock to the skillet and stir with a wide wooden spoon, scraping any bits from the bottom.  Cover and bring to a boil, about 2 minutes. 
Meanwhile, trim the zucchini and slice in half lengthwise.  Then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch wide half-moons.  When the soup comes to a boil, add the zucchini and the couscous to the skillet, stir, and cover. 
Open the can of chickpeas into a small colander, rinse, and drain briefly.  Add to the skillet.  Cover and let the soup return to a boil, then lower the heat slightly so the soup simmers briskly for 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Chop the leaves from the cilantro sprigs.  Stir into the soup, cook for 1 minute, and serve in soup plates. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  I love the exotic smells and flavors of Moroccan cuisine.  This dish was inspired by my collaboration with chef Matthew Kenney -- a real Moroccan food devotee -- on our book Matthew Kenney's Mediterranean Cooking.  Serve it with pocketless pita bread or other flatbread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              dozen  hard shell clams -- shucked, with their
                        juices reserved - (abt 3 cups)
                        (or use 2 cups canned chopped clams)
  2             medium  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice - (abt 2 cups)
  2             ounces  salt pork or bacon -- cut into 1/4" dice
  1                cup  finely-chopped onions
  2               cups  milk
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
  4          teaspoons  butter -- (optional)

If using fresh clams separate the soft part of the clams (stomach) from the hard part surrounding it.  Finely chop the hard part and set aside, and slice each soft part in two and reserve separately. 
Strain the clam liquor through two layers of cheesecloth and set aside.  If using canned clams, drain the clams in a fine sieve over a bowl and reserve the liquid. 
In a large soup pot saute the salt pork over low heat until crisp and they have rendered all their fat.  Remove and reserve.  Add the onions to the fat remaining in the pot and cook over moderate heat for about 5 minutes, until they are translucent but not brown. 
Stir in the reserved clam liquor, the finely chopped fresh clams (do not add canned clams at this point), the milk, and the potatoes.  Cover and simmer 10 to 15 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.  Stir in the reserved soft parts of the clams (or the canned clams), the reserved salt pork or bacon, and the cream, and simmer for an additional 3 minutes. 
Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.  Allow to rest off heat for one to two hours, then reheat immediately before serving.  Ladle into warm bowls, and place a teaspoon of butter on top of each serving (optional, but very traditional). 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              dozen  fresh-shucked medium oysters
                        with their liquor - (3 cups)
  6        tablespoons  butter
  2              small  fennel bulbs -- chopped fine, plus
                        feathery fennel tops -- chopped for garnish
  2 2/3           cups  milk
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  salt - (to 1 tspn)
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika

With a slotted spoon, remove the oysters from their liquor.  Strain the liquor through a sieve lined with cheesecloth. 
In a medium saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over moderate heat.  Add the fennel and cook, stirring occasionally, until the fennel is tender, about 5 minutes. 
Add the milk, cream and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.  Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. 
Reduce the heat to low, add the oysters, the reserved oyster liquor and the Worcestershire sauce and bring just to a simmer, stirring constantly.  Simmer just until the oysters plump and begin to curl, about 1 minute.  Do not boil or the cream will curdle. 
Taste and add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt if needed.  Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter.  Serve sprinkled with the paprika and chopped fennel tops. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             gallon  water -- for boiling sausage
  1              quart  water -- for roux
  1              pound  Andouille sausage -- cut 4" to 6" lengths
  1              pound  smoked pork sausage -- cut 4" to 6" lengths
  8              large  chicken breasts -- skinned, halved,
                        and well-seasoned
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  flour
  1                cup  finely-chopped onion
  3                     shallots -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley - (to 2 tbspns)
  1                can  chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz)
  1               pint  oysters - (to 2 pints) -- drained, and
                        liquid reserved
                        Gumbo file powder -- (optional)

In a large pot, gently boil Andouille in 1 gallon water for 30 minutes.  Add smoked sausage and continue to boil for 15 minutes.  Remove and cool, reserving stock. 
In a large, heavy pot, make a roux with flour and oil.  When roux is dark brown, add chicken pieces.  Over medium heat, brown chicken on both sides for about 15 minutes. 
In center of pot, push chicken aside and add onions.  Cook over low heat until onions are clear, stirring occasionally. 
While onions are cooking, heat 1 quart of water.  When onions are clear, gradually add water, reserved stock and chicken broth.  Bring to a boil.  Stir to mix thoroughly and reduce heat to simmer.  Cover and cook 45 minutes. 
Meanwhile, cut cooled Andouille and sausage into bite-sized pieces.  At the end of the 45-minute cooking time, add sausages, shallots and parsley.  Cook an additional 15 minutes.  Oyster liquid can be added to taste. 
Oysters should be dropped in just before serving, cooking just until curled.  If gumbo is to be frozen, add oysters when thawed and reheated.  Serve over steamed rice.  Sprinkle with file, if desired. 
This recipe yields 16 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     hard-cooked eggs -- (optional)
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                     scallion including green top -- minced
  1                     celery rib -- minced
  2        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  Fish Stock -- (see recipe)
                        (or use bottled clam juice)
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1 1/2         pounds  lump crabmeat -- picked free of
                        shell fragments
     1/4           cup  dry sherry
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  6        thin slices  lemon

If using the eggs, separate the yolks from the whites and save the whites for another use.  Press the yolks through a sieve and reserve. 
In a large pot, melt the butter over moderately-low heat.  Add the scallion and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Stir in the stock, milk and cream.  Bring to a simmer, stirring. 
Add the sieved egg yolks, if using, the crabmeat, sherry, salt and pepper and bring almost to a simmer.  Ladle into bowls and top each serving with a pinch of paprika and a lemon slice. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Originally this soup was prepared with the meat and roe from female blue crabs.  If you're able to get them and prefer cooking them yourself, you'll need eight or nine large crabs to get a pound and a half of meat and roe.  Since the crabs can be hard to find, we offer a recipe using lump crabmeat.  Our version is as quick and easy as it is delicious.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  oil
     1/2           cup  flour
  1              large  onion -- chopped

  3                     celery ribs -- chopped
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1             gallon  Shrimp Stock -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1              pound  fresh lump crabmeat -- picked over
  1               pint  fresh oysters -- with oyster liquor
                        reserved
                        Cooked white rice

Heat the oil in a large heavy pot and add the flour.  Cook the roux, stirring constantly, to a light brown if you want it Creole-style, and to a dark, almost milk-chocolate color if you want it Cajun-style. 
Just before the roux reaches the proper color, add the vegetables and stir like hell, being careful not to spatter yourself.  When the vegetables are tender, add the stock, salt, and peppers.  Stir until the roux is dissolved, and simmer over low heat for one hour. 
Add the seafood about 5 minutes before serving, and cook over low heat just until the shrimp turn pink.  Serve over rice. 
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  cooking oil
  2                     onions -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh red chiles - (abt 2 chiles)
  1              quart  bottled clam juice
     3/4         pound  medium shrimp -- shells removed and
                        reserved, shrimp halved lengthwise
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1                cup  water
  4             slices  bacon -- chopped
  3                     leeks, white and light-green parts only -- split lengthwise,
                        cut crosswise into 1/2" slices
  1                     celery rib -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     sweet potato - (abt 1/2 lb) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  3               cups  milk
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  2 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh chives or scallion tops

In a medium pot, heat the oil over moderately-low heat.  Add half the onions and the chiles and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the clam juice, shrimp shells, tomato paste and water. 
Raise the heat to moderately-high and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid is reduced to 1 quart, about 20 minutes.  Strain the shrimp stock into a large bowl.  Press the shrimp shells firmly to get all the liquid. 
In a large pot, cook the bacon until the fat is rendered.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Add the remaining onion, the leeks, celery and garlic to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes.  Add the shrimp stock and the sweet potato and simmer until the potato is tender, about 20 minutes. 
Add the shrimp and bacon to the pot and cook until the shrimp are just done, about 2 minutes.  Stir in the milk, paprika, salt and pepper and heat through.  Do not let the chowder boil, or it may curdle.  Ladle into bowls and top with the chives. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

                          Thai Three-Melon Soup

Recipe By     :Judy Wicks and Kevin von Klause
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     honeydew melon -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into large chunks
  1                     cantaloupe -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into large chunks
  2             pounds  watermelon -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  3        tablespoons  chopped pickled ginger
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  18             large  shrimp -- poached, peeled,
                        deveined, and chilled
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves and stems -- for garnish
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives -- for garnish
  2        tablespoons  nam pla (Thai fish sauce, available in
                        Asian markets and specialty food stores)

Combine the melons and pickled ginger in a food processor or blender and process until liquefied, about 1 minute (depending on the size of your food processor you may need to puree the melon in batches). 
Pour the puree into a nonreactive bowl and stir in the lime juice.  Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 1 hour. 
To serve, divide the soup among 6 icy-cold bowls or plates.  Top each serving with 3 shrimp, a sprinkle of the herbs, and a splash of nam pla. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Other Ways To Do It:  This soup makes an exotic dessert if topped with a scoop of Orange-Ginger Sorbet instead of the shrimp and herbs.  Or freeze it in a large shallow pan and scrape frozen soup into bowls for a refreshing granita. 
Comments:  Wandering outside the walls of the Imperial Palace in Bangkok, Thailand, Judy and I happened upon vendors offering a revitalizing melon drink to the overheated tourists.  We loved it, and adapted it into a beautiful, coral-colored soup that we serve icy-cold topped with chilled chopped poached shrimp and a splash of Thai fish sauce. 
Pickled ginger is a widely used Asian condiment that is readily available in Asian markets and some specialty food stores.  Many of our recipes call for pickled ginger juice, meaning the liquid that the ginger is packed in.  It adds sparkle, life, and a jolt of flavor to soups, sauces, dressings, vinaigrettes, and relishes.

  15                    egg whites
  1              pound  ground lean chicken
  1                     onion -- small diced
     1/2         pound  carrots -- small diced
     1/2         pound  leeks -- small diced
     1/2         pound  celery -- small diced
  1                cup  tomato puree
  5                     black peppercorns
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2         bunch  parsley stems
  3                     fresh thyme sprigs
     1/2           cup  truffle scraps
  1             gallon  Chicken Stock -- cold, (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Hot sauce -- to taste

In a mixing bowl, whip the egg whites slightly.  Combine the lean meat, vegetables, tomato puree, herbs, spices, and truffle scraps together.  Mix in the egg whites. 
In a spigot stock pot, blend the cold chicken stock with the truffle mixture.  Place the stock pot on medium heat.  Stir the liquid occasionally until the raft forms (the liquid should reach 160 degrees).  Simmer the soup for 1 1/2 hours, making sure the raft does not break or sink. 
Remove the first cup of the consommÈ from the spigot to remove sediment and discard.  Line a china cap with 5 layers of cheesecloth.  Strain the liquid slowly.  If the liquid is cloudy, strain the consommÈ again with fresh cheesecloth.  Season with salt and hot sauce.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  flour
  1 1/2           cups  oil
  1                cup  chopped onions
     1/2           cup  chopped green bell pepper
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2               cups  sliced andouille sausage
  2             quarts  stock
  2                     bay leaves
                        Salt -- to taste

                        Steamed rice -- for serving
                        Chopped scallions -- for garnish

In a large soup pot slowly heat oil and flour together over low heat, stirring constantly, until it becomes a nutty brown color and is very fragrant; be careful not to burn. 
Add onions, pepper and celery and cook, stirring, 4 minutes.  Add garlic and andouille and cook 5 minutes, until some fat releases from sausage.  Add stock, bay leaf, 2 teaspoons salt, cayenne and Creole spice to taste. 
Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour.  Add turkey and simmer 30 minutes more.  Adjust seasonings and serve with hot steamed rice and a generous sprinkle of green onions. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  mushrooms (any variety)
  1                     fenel bulb, stalks and leaves only
                        (reserve the bulb for another use)
  5                     celery stalks
  4             medium  to large carrots
  2              large  onions
     1/4                green cabbage head
     1/2         large  rutabaga -- peeled
  5                     leeks -- halved lengthwise,
                        and washed
  1        small bunch  fresh flat-leaf parsley - (abt 15 sprigs)
  1                     garlic head -- halved crosswise
                        to expose the cloves
  12             whole  black peppercorns
  6              whole  white peppercorns
  3                     bay leaves
  6                     fresh thyme sprigs - (to 8)

Slice the mushrooms, fennel stalks, celery, carrots, onions, and cabbage thin and place in an 8-quart stockpot.  Cut the rutabaga into large chunks and place in the stockpot.  Add the remaining ingredients and cover with cold water. 
Bring to a boil over high heat.  As the stock approaches a boil, skim any impurities that rise to the top with a ladle.  Lower the heat and simmer gently for 45 to 60 minutes. 
Ladle through a fine stainer, cool, and refrigerate.  The stock will keep for 4 to 5 days in the refrigerator, or freeze in 1-cup batches for longer storage. 
This recipe yields 2 quarts. 
Comments:  To intensify the flavor, reduce the stock after straining by one quarter to one half.

  2             medium  onions -- peeled
  3                     celery ribs with leaves
  1                     leek, white part only
  6                     carrots - (to 8) -- peeled
     1/4           cup  margarine
  3              large  potatoes -- peeled
  2             medium  turnips -- peeled
  3             medium  parsnips -- peeled
  1              pound  green beans
  1              bunch  watercress -- stems removed
  1              small  cabbage head -- cored, and
                        cut into 4 wedges
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  4          teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Place the slicing disk into the bowl of the food processor.  Cut the onions, celery, leek, and carrots to fit feed tube.  With light pressure, push the vegetables through the feed tube using the pusher. 
Over medium heat, melt the margarine in a large stockpot.  Add the onions, celery, leeks, and carrots and saute until the onion is soft and limp, 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat. 
Insert the French-fry blade into the food processor.  Cut the potatoes, turnips, and parsnips to fit the feed tube.  Chop, using the pusher with firm pressure.  Add these vegetables to the stockpot. 
Insert the metal blade into the food processor bowl.  Add the green beans and watercress.  Pulse several times to chop, then add to the stockpot. 
Place 2 wedges of the cabbage into the processor bowl.  Chop with several pulses.  Add to the stockpot.  Repeat with the remaining cabbage and add to the stockpot.  Add the tomato paste, salt, and white pepper to the stockpot. 
Add enough cold water to cover the vegetables, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour.  Serve hot. 
This recipe yields 5 quarts. 
Comments:  This is a good make-ahead soup that can be made quickly in the food processor.  It get thicker the longer it sits.  This also freezes well.  Those of Ashkenazic background can leave out the green beans.
