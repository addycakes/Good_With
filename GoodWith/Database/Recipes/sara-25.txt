  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pieces  Alaskan Black Cod fillet - (7 oz ea)
                        === MARINADE ===
  2               cups  acacia
                        = (or other strongly flavored honey)
     3/4           cup  grape seed oil
  1                cup  light soy sauce
     3/4           cup  white wine vinegar
                        === SAUTEED SPINACH ===
     1/2         pound  spinach -- thoroughly washed
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
                        Grated nutmeg -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To prepare the marinade:  Combine honey, grape seed oil, soy sauce and white wine vinegar.  Cover the fish with the marinade, cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.  Remove the fish and place in a pan.  Caramelize the fish under the broiler and finish in a preheated 400 degree oven until the fish reaches medium.  Reserve some of the marinade to use for sauce.

To prepare the spinach:  Heat the butter in a hot sautÈ pan.  When the butter begins to brown, add the garlic.  Add the spinach.  Cook until tender.  Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper, to taste.  Set aside.

Heat reserved marinade to boiling point, reduce heat and simmer for two to three minutes.

To assemble the plate:  In the center of each of 6 large bowls divide the spinach.  Place a portion of fish on top and pour approximately 2 tablespoons of reserved marinade, over the top of each fish.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  If Chilean Sea Bass is available, it makes an excellent substitute for the Black Cod.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  14            slices  firm white sandwich bread - (abt 1 lb)
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  3             pounds  Fuji apples - (abt 6)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  water
  4             ounces  coarsely-grated extra-sharp Cheddar - (1 c
  4              large  eggs
  2 3/4           cups  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Spread bread slices thinly on 1 side with 1/2 stick butter.  In a small bowl stir together 1/4 cup granulated sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg and sprinkle evenly over buttered sides of bread.  Arrange bread, buttered-sides up, on baking sheets and toast in batches in middle of oven until just golden, about 15 minutes.  Cool cinnamon toast on racks and quarter each slice into triangles, reserving 24 triangles.

Peel, quarter, and core apples.  Cut apples lengthwise into thin slices and in a bowl toss with lemon juice.  In a large heavy skillet melt remaining 1/2 stick butter with brown sugar over moderately-high heat, stirring, and add apples and water.  Cook mixture, covered, over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes.  Remove lid and cook apples until just tender and most liquid is evaporated, about 5 minutes more.

Butter a 9-cup oval gratin dish or a 13- by 9- by 2-inch shallow baking dish (about 3 quarts).  Arrange 1 layer of cinnamon toasts in dish, breaking triangles to fit.  Spoon half of apple mixture evenly over toasts and sprinkle evenly with 1/2 cup Cheddar.  Top with another layer of cinnamon toasts and remaining apple mixture.  Arrange reserved cinnamon toast, sugared-sides up, overlapping slightly, in a ring around edge of dish.  In a bowl whisk together eggs, remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar, milk, and salt and pour slowly and evenly over apples.  Chill pudding, covered, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

Preheat oven to degrees.

Bake pudding in middle of oven 30 minutes.  Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheddar evenly over top and bake pudding 15 minutes more.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  buttermilk
  3              large  eggs
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted, cooled, plus
                        melted butter for brushing griddle
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  whole-wheat flour
     1/4           cup  wheat germ
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  double-acting baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2               cups  diced apples
                        === SAUTEED APPLES ===
  4              large  Granny Smith or Golden Delicious apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
                        Fresh lemon juice -- as needed

In a bowl whisk together the buttermilk, the eggs, and 6 tablespoons of the butter.  In a large bowl whisk together the flours, the wheat germ, the salt, the baking powder, the baking soda, and the sugar, add the buttermilk mixture, and whisk the batter until it is just combined.

Heat a griddle over moderately-high heat until it is hot enough to make drops of water scatter over its surface and brush it with some of the additional melted butter.

Working in batches, pour the batter onto the griddle by 1/3-cup measures, sprinkle each pancake with about 2 tablespoons of the diced apples, and cook the pancakes for 2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden.

Transfer the pancakes as they are cooked to a heatproof platter and keep them warm in a preheated 200 degree oven.  Serve the pancakes with the Sauteed Apples.

Sauteed Apples:  In a large heavy skillet sautÈ the apples in the butter over moderately-high heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until they are softened.  Sprinkle them with the sugar and the cinnamon, and cook them over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 10 minutes, or until they are tender.  Stir in lemon juice, to taste and keep the mixture warm.

This recipe yields about 16 (5-inch) pancakes.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOPPING ===
  1 1/2         pounds  Golden Delicious apples - (abt 3 to 3 1/2)
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped walnuts
                        === CAKE BATTER ===
     1/2                Golden Delicious apple
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
     2/3           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  2        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh gingerroot
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  sour cream
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
                        Calvados Caramel Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Whipped cream

Make topping:  Peel, core, and quarter apples.

In a well-seasoned 10 1/4- by 2-inch cast-iron skillet melt butter over moderately-low heat just until melted (butter should not separate).  Stir in sugar until combined well.  Arrange apple quarters decoratively, cut-sides up, in skillet and sprinkle walnuts evenly between apples.  Cook mixture, undisturbed, 25 to 35 minutes, or until the apples are tender in centers and sugar is a golden caramel.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Make cake batter while topping is cooking:  Peel apple and chop fine.

In a bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon.

In another bowl with an electric mixture beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in vanilla and gingerroot and add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in sour cream and with mixer on low speed beat in flour mixture gradually until just combined.  Fold chopped apple into batter.

Remove skillet from heat and spoon batter evenly over topping.  With a metal spatula spread batter (being careful not to disturb topping), leaving a 1/4-inch border of cooked apples uncovered.

If using a non-stick stick skillet with a plastic handle, wrap handle in a double thickness of foil.  Put skillet in a shallow baking pan and bake cake in middle of oven 25 to 35 minutes, or until a tester comes out with crumbs adhering and cake is golden brown.

Cool cake in skillet on a rack 10 minutes.  Run a thin knife around edge of skillet and carefully invert cake onto a plate.

Serve cake warm or at room temperature with caramel sauce and whipped cream.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes in juice - (28 oz)
  1              small  white or sweet onion -- minced

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  beer
  2 1/2           cups  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1 1/2           cups  apple cider vinegar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chili powder
  1 1/2    tablespoons  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  dry mustard

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast                       Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  buttermilk
  3              large  eggs
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted, cooled, plus
                        melted butter for brushing griddle
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  whole-wheat flour
     1/4           cup  wheat germ
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  double-acting baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2               cups  blueberries -- picked over
                        === BLUEBERRY SYRUP ===
  6               cups  blueberries -- picked over
  3               cups  sugar
     1/2                lemon -- zest removed in stri
                        with a vegetable peeler
     1/8           cup  fresh lemon juice

In a bowl whisk together the buttermilk, the eggs, and 6 tablespoons of the butter.  In a large bowl whisk together the flours, the wheat germ, the salt, the baking powder, the baking soda, and the sugar, add the buttermilk mixture, and whisk the batter until it is just combined.

Heat a griddle over moderately-high heat until it is hot enough to make drops of water scatter over its surface and brush it with some of the additional melted butter.

Working in batches, pour the batter onto the griddle by 1/3-cup measures, sprinkle each pancake with about 2 tablespoons of the blueberries, and cook the pancakes for 2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden.

Transfer the pancakes as they are cooked to a heatproof platter and keep them warm in a preheated 200 degree oven.  Serve the pancakes with the Blueberry Syrup.

Blueberry Syrup:  In a large saucepan combine the blueberries and 3/4 cup water, bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer it, covered, for 10 minutes.  PurÈe the mixture in batches in a blender or food processor and force it through a fine sieve into a bowl, discarding the solids.  In the pan, cleaned, combine the sugar, the zest, and 1 1/2 cups water, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, and boil it, uncovered, until a candy thermometer registers 200 degrees.  Discard the zest, add the blueberry mixture, and boil the syrup, stirring, for 1 minute.  Let the syrup cool, skim off any froth, and stir in the lemon juice.  Pour the syrup into glass jars with tight-fitting lids.  The syrup keeps, covered and chilled, for 3 months.  Serve the syrup warm over pancakes or ice cream.

This recipe yields about 16 (5-inch) pancakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     yellow onions -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  fresh rosemary leaves
     1/4           cup  softened butter
                        Basic Pizza Dough -- (see below)
  10            ounces  Gorgonzola -- crumbled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BASIC PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1                cup  warm tap water -- (100 to 115 degrees)
  1            package  active dry yeast
  3               cups  all-purpose flour - (to 3 1/2)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

In a large saute pan over high heat, warm the oil.  Add the onions and rosemary, and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add butter and lower heat and continue to caramelize for about 15 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and set aside.

Spread the pizza dough with the onion mixture and scatter Gorgonzola over top.  Bake in a pizza oven or a preheated 400 degree oven until lightly golden and the crust is browned, about 20 minutes.  Cut into wedges and serve.

Basic Pizza Dough:  Pour the water onto a medium-sized mixing bowl and add the yeast, stirring with a fork until dissolved.  The water should turn a light beige color.  Add 1 cup of flour and the salt.  Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon.  Add the second cup of flour and repeat.  The dough should start coming away from the sides of the bowl, forming a soft, sticky mass.  Take the last cup of flour and sprinkle over a clean, dry work surface and flour your hands well.

Take the dough from the bowl and begin to work in the additional flour a little at a time.  Use the heel of your hand to knead the dough and push across the work surface, clenching the dough with your fist and twisting it over.  Use a dough scraper to help gather any wet dough that sticks to the surface while you are kneading.  Also only add as much flour as it takes to keep the dough from sticking to your hands.  When the dough no longer feels sticky, push the heel of your hand down into it and hold it there for 10 seconds.  If the dough comes up clean, itís ready.  If it sticks you will have to knead it a bit more.

Note:  If you have a food processor with a dough hook attachment, you can make the dough much faster.  Start by adding the yeast and water first and mixing well.  Then add all the flour and salt and mix into a ball.  Then rise the dough.

Lightly oil a 2-quart bowl with vegetable oil, and roll the ball of dough around the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil, then tightly seal the bowl with plastic wrap.  Keep in a warm place, and let the dough rise for 30 to 45 minutes.  When dough doubles in size, remove from bowl and punch it down with your fist to deflate, then knead it again for about a minute.  Dough is now ready to stretch into a round, or press into a pizza pan.  (Makes 1 ball of dough)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Lightly oil a 2-quart bowl with vegetable oil, and roll the ball of dough around the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil, then tightly seal the bowl with plastic wrap.  Keep in a warm place, and let the dough rise for 30 to 45 minutes.  When dough doubles in size, remove from bowl and punch it down with your fist to deflate, then knead it again for about a minute.  Dough is now ready to stretch into a round, or press into a pizza pan.  (Makes 1 ball of dough)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  cake flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into bits
     1/4           cup  cold vegetable shortening -- cut into bits
     1/2           cup  finely-ground blanched almonds
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                     egg white -- beaten with
  2          teaspoons  sugar -- until frothy
                        === FILLING ===
  1              quart  fresh sour red cherries -- pitted
                        = (if fresh cherries are not available,
                        use 2 (2-lb) cans sour red pitted
                        cherries with 1/4 cup of the juice)
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  grated lemon rind
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

Into a bowl sift together the all-purpose flour, cake flour, sugar, and salt.  Blend the butter and shortening into the dry ingredients with your fingertips or 2 knives until the mixture resembles meal.  Mix in the almonds.

In a small bowl beat together the egg, the heavy cream, almond extract, and vanilla.  Add just enough of the egg mixture to the dry ingredients to form a dough, toss it with a fork until it is incorporated, and form the dough into a ball.  Wrap the dough in waxed paper and chill it for at least 1 hour.

Cut off slightly more than 1/2 of the ball of dough and on a lightly floured surface, roll it into a round about 12 inches in diameter.  Lift the dough over the rolling pin and transfer it to a 9-inch pie plate, draping the excess dough loosely over the sides.  Let the dough set for 10 minutes.  Press the dough firmly into the plate and trim the excess, leaving a 1-inch overhang.  Brush the shell with the egg mixture and reserve what remains.  Chill the shell and the remaining dough overnight.

Filling:  In a large bowl combine the cherries with the sugar, cornstarch, lemon rind, almond extract, and salt.  Let stand for 30 minutes.  Drain the mixture into a bowl, measure the juices, and add water if needed to measure 1/4 cup.  Toss the filling lightly and pour into the shell.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the remaining dough into a rectangle 10 inches long and 1/8-inch thick.  With the pastry wheel or a large sharp knife cut out 10 ten-inch strips about 1/3-inch wide.  Moisten the rim of the shell with water and press firmly on the strips in a lattice pattern.  Crimp the overhanging dough into a decorative rim.  Brush the strips with the reserved egg mixture.

Bake the pie in the lower third of the oven for 20 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 375 degrees and bake the pie for 30 minutes more, or until lightly browned.  Transfer the pie to a rack and let it cool slightly.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) pie; serves 8 to 10 people.

  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  salted butter
  1                     chicken - (3 1/2 lbs) -- cut serving pieces

  1                     red bell pepper -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  chicken broth
                        Finely-chopped fresh parsley leaves -- for garnish
                        === STEAMED RICE ===
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2               cups  unconverted long-grain rice
                        === ACCOMPANIMENT ===
                        Apple Ginger Chutney -- (see recipe)

In a flameproof casserole heat the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter over moderately-high heat until the foam subsides, in it brown the chicken, patted dry and season with salt, and transfer the chicken with a slotted spoon to a plate.

Pour off the fat from the casserole, add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, and in it cook the celery, the onion, and the garlic over moderately-low heat, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened.  Add the apples, cored and chopped, and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Add the bell pepper, the curry powder, the cinnamon, and the cumin and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute.  Stir in the flour and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the broth and the chicken with any juices that have accumulated on the plate, bring the liquid to a boil, and cook the chicken mixture, covered, at a bare simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.

Transfer the chicken with a slotted spoon to a serving plate, boil the vegetable mixture, stirring, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it is thickened slightly, and season the sauce with salt and pepper.  Pour the sauce over the chicken and top it with the parsley.  Serve the curry with the rice and the Apple Ginger Chutney.

To make steamed rice:  In a large saucepan bring 5 quarts water to a boil with the salt.  Sprinkle in the rice, stirring until the water returns to a boil, and boil it for 10 minutes.  Drain the rice in a large colander and rinse it.  Set the colander over a large saucepan of boiling water and steam the rice, covered with a kitchen towel and the lid, for 15 minutes, or until it is fluffy and dry.

                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              whole  chicken breasts with first joint of
                        the wing attached -- halved, boned,
                        and skinned
                        Herb Butter -- (see below)
                        Flour -- for dredging
  2              large  eggs -- beaten with
  2          teaspoons  water
  1                cup  homemade bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
                        === HERB BUTTER ===
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- softened
  1        tablespoons  minced fresh chives
  1        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley leaves
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh tarragon leaves
  1           teaspoon  Dijon-style mustard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

"French" the chicken wing bones by scraping the meat off the bones with a sharp knife and reserving the meat for another use, detach the fillet strip from each breast, and flatten the breasts and the fillets between sheets of dampened wax paper until they are about 1/4-inch thick.

Arrange the chicken breasts skinned-side down on a work surface.  In the center of each, mound 2 tablespoons of the herb butter, and cover the mixture with a fillet strip.  Fold up the sides of the breasts to enclose the herb butter, forming the chicken into a "chop".

Dredge the chops carefully in the flour, shaking off the excess, dip them in the egg mixture, and dredge them in the bread crumbs, patting the mixture onto the flesh.  Arrange the chops on a rack set over a pan and chill them, uncovered, for at least 1 hour or overnight to let the crumbs dry.

In a large heavy skillet, heat the oil over moderate heat until it is hot, but not smoking.  Brown the chops, transferring them as they are browned to a baking pan.  Bake them in a preheated 350 degree oven for 20 minutes.  The chicken may be kept warm, covered loosely, for up to 10 minutes.

Herb Butter:  In a small bowl cream together the butter, the chives, the parsley, the tarragon, the mustard, and salt and pepper to taste.  Let the butter stand, covered, in a cool place for 1 hour to allow the flavors to develop.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === TARTAR SAUCE ===
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped red onion
  1           teaspoon  finely-minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1           teaspoon  capers -- drained, chopped
  1           teaspoon  chopped cornichon or dill pickle
  1                     anchovy fillet -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste

To make the clam cakes:  If using clams in their shells, combine the clams and water in a large skillet.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, then cover.  Steam for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the shells open.  Discard any clams that do not open.  Remove from heat and let the clams cool in their shells.  Take the meat out of the shells.  Strain the clam juice, reserving 3/4 cup.  Coarsely chop the clam meat.  This will produce approximately 1 1/4 cups of chopped meat.  If using jarred clams, drain well, reserving 3/4 cup of the juice.

In a medium bowl, combine the chopped clams, bell pepper, parsley, and tarragon; set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, baking powder, cayenne pepper, and salt.  In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, reserved or bottle clam juice, egg yolks, melted butter, and lemon juice.  Stir the liquid ingredients and clam mixture into the dry ingredients to form a batter; set aside.

In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff, glossy peaks form.  Fold them into the batter.  Let the batter stand for 15 minutes.

In a large nonstick skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of the oil over medium heat.  Spoon in about 3 tablespoons of the batter for each clam cake (about 4 per batch).  Cook, turning once, until lightly browned on each side, about 3 minutes total.  Place the cakes on a plate in a low oven to keep warm.  Repeat the process, adding more oil as needed, until all the batter is used.  Serve hot with Tartar Sauce.

To make the Tartar Sauce:  In a medium bowl, combine all of the tartar sauce ingredients and stir to blend.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.  This sauce can be made up to 2 days ahead.

This recipe yields 6 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  unsweetened chocolate
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into bits
     3/4           cup  sifted all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  double-acting baking powder
  1              pinch  salt
  2              large  eggs
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1                cup  chopped walnuts

Butter and flour an 8-inch square baking pan and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a small heavy saucepan melt the chocolate and butter over low heat, stirring until the mixture is smooth, and let the mixture cool completely.

Into a bowl sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.  In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the eggs.  While still beating, add the sugar, a little at a time, and beat the mixture at high speed for 3 minutes, or until thick and pale.

Add in the chocolate mixture and the vanilla, and then add in the flour mixture, stirring until the mixture is blended well.  Stir in the walnuts.  Pour the batter into the baking pan, smoothing the top.

Bake the brownies in the middle of the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the brownie pulls away slightly from the sides of the pan, and a cake tester, inserted in the center, comes out with crumbs adhering to it.  Let the brownies cool completely in the pan before cutting them into squares.

This recipe yields 16 brownies, 8 to 16 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted, cooled
  4              large  eggs -- beaten lightly
  6        tablespoons  sour cream
     1/4           cup  minced fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne -- or to taste
  2             pounds  lump crab meat -- picked over
  2               cups  fine fresh bread crumbs
     1/3           cup  cornmeal
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
                        === ACCOMPANIMENT ===
                        Tarragon Tartar Sauce -- (see recipe)

Keep the crab cakes warm on another baking sheet in a 200 degree oven.

Serve the crab cakes with the Tarragon Tartar Sauce and the lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 12 crab cakes, 6 servings.

  1                     thyme sprig
                        === CRANBERRY SAUCE ===
  1                cup  fresh or frozen cranberries
  1         tablespoon  butter -- plus
  4             ounces  cold butter - (1 stick) -- cut small pieces
                        Sugar -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
  1                cup  Riesling wine
  2               cups  cranberry juice
  1                     thyme sprig

Combine the brining solution ingredients together and cover the pork with the cranberry liquid overnight.

Puree the dried cranberries in a blender with a little bit of water until smooth.

Toast the pecans.  Place in food processor and pulse until slightly ground.  Add bread crumbs and picked thyme.  Pulse again.  Add 3 ounces clarified butter until mixture sticks together to adhere on the pork.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

After the pork has been brined, remove from the liquid and pat dry.  Discard the brining liquid.  Heat a large saute pan until hot, add 3 tablespoons of clarified butter and sear the rack on both sides.  Place the pork on a meat rack.  Spread the cranberry paste on the pork and then top with the pecan bread crumbs.  Cover with foil and bake for about 1 1/2 hours or until meat thermometer registers 130 degrees.  Remove the foil about 10 to 15 minutes before the pork is done, to brown the pecan crust.  Allow the pork to rest 15 minutes before slicing.

When ready to serve slice the rack of pork into 8 slices and plate each piece.  Arrange each plate with Wilted Spinach and a Savory Apple Tart.  Finish each plate with Cranberry Sauce.

Wilted Spinach:  Heat 2 large saute pans until hot.  Add the olive oil and garlic.  Now add the spinach, season with salt and cook until just wilted.  Serve immediately.

Savory Apple Tart:  Peel, core and dice 1 apple, saute in butter, season with salt and sugar.  Add the cream and reduce by 3/4.  Puree until very smooth.

Slice potato into thin slices with mandoline.  Cook in boiling water until almost tender.  Set aside.

Roll out puff pastry a bit.  Score with a sharp knife.  With a 2-inch cookie cutter, cut out 8 circles of puff pastry.  Place between 2 sheets of waxed paper on baking sheet, weigh down with another baking sheet and blind bake in oven until almost cooked through.  Remove from oven and let cool.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Spread a heaping teaspoon of the apple cream on top of the puff pastry.  Peel and slice the other apple, and then fan apple and potato slices around the puff pastry, making a pinwheel design.  Brush with butter and sprinkle with salt and sugar.  Bake for about 25 minutes.  Brush with a little more butter and sprinkle with some more sugar and broil for 1 minute until the tarts are caramelized.

Cranberry Sauce:  Saute the cranberries in 1 tablespoon of butter until they start to split, sprinkle with sugar and salt, deglaze with the wine and reduce until almost dry.  Add in the cranberry juice and thyme sprig; reduce by 1/2.  Strain the sauce through a fine sieve, whisk in the remaining cold butter and check for proper seasoning.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  thick soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2          teaspoons  five-spice powder
  1                     Long Island duck - (abt 5 1/2 lbs)

         Crispy Lobster Skewers With Green Papaya And Mint Salad

                        Zest of 1 lime
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  6                     scallions -- cut 2" pieces
  3                     egg whites
  2        tablespoons  cold water
     1/2           cup  water chestnut flour
                        Peanut or corn oil -- for frying
  6                     wooden skewers - (10" long) -- soaked 30 minutes
                        === GREEN PAPAYA AND MINT SALAD ===
  2                     green papayas, thinly sliced
  1              bunch  wild mint -- chopped
  3            bunches  Upland cress
                        = (or 2 bunches watercress)
  1                     daikon -- julienned
  1                     carrot -- julienned
  1              small  cucumber -- sliced thinly
  12                    scallions -- cut thin rounds
                        === VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Nam Pla (Vietnamese fish sauce)
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  oil of your choice

Put coconut into a plastic bag and drop the bag onto a hard surface to split the coconut and catch the liquid.  Remove the outer shell and discard.  Finely grate 1 cup of fresh coconut.  Thinly shave the remaining coconut into moon shaped pieces.  Toast shavings lightly and set aside for garnish.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Drop live lobsters into a pot of boiling water and cook for only 5 minutes.  Remove the lobsters from the water and plunge them into a large bowl or pot filled with iced water to stop the cooking.  The lobsters should be cooked early in the day so the lobsters have time to reabsorb their wonderful juices.

In a 2-quart saucepan, add the oil and butter.  Remove the claws and tails from all the lobsters.  Set aside.  Remove the outer shell from 3 of the lobsters.  Saute the 6 lobster bodies over medium-high heat until a little bit colored.  Leaving some of the shells on will give your sauce a pink cast.

Add the shallots, chile, and lemongrass.  Cook gently until tender.  Deglaze the pan with white wine.  Add grated coconut and ginger.  Add enough cold water to barely cover the lobster bodies.  Add curry paste or curry powder.  Let sauce simmer slowly for 20 to 30 minutes until reduced, showing a little "body".

Add heavy cream and let sauce reduce slightly.  Add lime juice and lime zest.  Add salt and pepper, to taste.  Finish with 2 tablespoons of butter for silkiness.

Strain sauce.  Take approximately 1/2 of the solids and puree in blender with some liquid.  Add pureed solids back to sauce.  Set aside.

Remove claw meat from their shells.  Split the tail, removing all the shell carefully from the tail, except the last segmet of shell connected to the actual tail flippers.

Skewer the 2 segments of the tail with 1 claw and 1 piece of scallion in between.  You will have 6 skewers.

Beat the egg whites with the 2 tablespoons of cold water to thin out.  Dip each skewer lightly into the egg white mixture.  Very delicately, sprinkle water chestnut flour all over the lobster.  Donít pack on too much.

Bring a large pot of peanut oil to 350 degrees.  Fry 2 skewers at a time.  They will only take approximately 2 to 3 minutes to crisp.  Remove skewers from the oil and drain.  Place in barely warm oven while the other skewers cook.

To serve, place finished skewers on plate with your delicate salad leaning against the lobster.  Spoon the curried coconut sauce around the plate and garnish with toasted coconut "moons".

Green Papaya and Mint Salad:  In a large bowl, assemble the salad, combining the green papayas, the mint, the Upland or watercress, daikon, carrot, cucumber, and scallions rounds.  Dress salad with vinaigrette right before serving.  (Makes 6 servings)

Vinaigrette:  Whisk together rice wine vinegar, Nam Pla, ginger and oil.  Set aside.  (Makes approximately 1/2 cup)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Put coconut into a plastic bag and drop the bag onto a hard surface to split the coconut and catch the liquid.  Remove the outer shell and discard.  Finely grate 1 cup of fresh coconut.  Thinly shave the remaining coconut into moon shaped pieces.  Toast shavings lightly and set aside for garnish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Drop live lobsters into a pot of boiling water and cook for only 5 minutes.  Remove the lobsters from the water and plunge them into a large bowl or pot filled with iced water to stop the cooking.  The lobsters should be cooked early in the day so the lobsters have time to reabsorb their wonderful juices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a 2-quart saucepan, add the oil and butter.  Remove the claws and tails from all the lobsters.  Set aside.  Remove the outer shell from 3 of the lobsters.  Saute the 6 lobster bodies over medium-high heat until a little bit colored.  Leaving some of the shells on will give your sauce a pink cast.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the shallots, chile, and lemongrass.  Cook gently until tender.  Deglaze the pan with white wine.  Add grated coconut and ginger.  Add enough cold water to barely cover the lobster bodies.  Add curry paste or curry powder.  Let sauce simmer slowly for 20 to 30 minutes until reduced, showing a little &quot;body&quot;.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add heavy cream and let sauce reduce slightly.  Add lime juice and lime zest.  Add salt and pepper, to taste.  Finish with 2 tablespoons of butter for silkiness.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain sauce.  Take approximately 1/2 of the solids and puree in blender with some liquid.  Add pureed solids back to sauce.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove claw meat from their shells.  Split the tail, removing all the shell carefully from the tail, except the last segmet of shell connected to the actual tail flippers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Skewer the 2 segments of the tail with 1 claw and 1 piece of scallion in between.  You will have 6 skewers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat the egg whites with the 2 tablespoons of cold water to thin out.  Dip each skewer lightly into the egg white mixture.  Very delicately, sprinkle water chestnut flour all over the lobster.  Donít pack on too much.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring a large pot of peanut oil to 350 degrees.  Fry 2 skewers at a time.  They will only take approximately 2 to 3 minutes to crisp.  Remove skewers from the oil and drain.  Place in barely warm oven while the other skewers cook.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, place finished skewers on plate with your delicate salad leaning against the lobster.  Spoon the curried coconut sauce around the plate and garnish with toasted coconut &quot;moons&quot;.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Green Papaya and Mint Salad:  In a large bowl, assemble the salad, combining the green papayas, the mint, the Upland or watercress, daikon, carrot, cucumber, and scallions rounds.  Dress salad with vinaigrette right before serving.  (Makes 6 servings)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Vinaigrette:  Whisk together rice wine vinegar, Nam Pla, ginger and oil.  Set aside.  (Makes approximately 1/2 cup)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  half-and-half
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1               pint  strawberries

In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, vanilla, and salt.  Pour the half-and-half and cream into the top of a double boiler and heat over hot water until hot, but not boiling.  Stir with a wooden spoon, scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking.  Slowly pour the hot cream into the eggs and whisk until smooth.

Return to the double boiler and cook over medium-low until thick and bubbling around the edges.  The custard will coat a wooden spoon.  Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a metal bowl.  Cover and chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.

Rinse and hull the berries.  Roughly chop the berries and transfer half to a small bowl.  Mash the other half with a fork or potato masher; they will not be smooth but still a little chunky.  Add them to the chopped berries.  Chill for at least 1 hour.

Pour the cream into the canister of an ice cream maker.  Freeze according to manufacturerís instructions.  When the ice cream is the consistency of whipped cream, stir in the berries.  Transfer to a shallow quart container, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze in the refrigerator's freezer for at least 3 hours until ready to serve.  Let the ice cream sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes before scooping.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

                        = (or coarsely ground pork)
  2        tablespoons  potato starch
                        Bamboo skewers -- soaked for 20 minute
                        and drained

Whisk together fish sauce, oil, and sugar until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Stir in shallot and garlic, and season with pepper.  Add pork and pound the meat into the marinade until evenly coated.  Marinate, refrigerated, for 1 hour.

Place pork between the palms of your hands and squeeze out excess liquid.  Put drained meat in a container and place in freezer for 1 hour.

Put partially frozen pork in a food processor and pulse to loosen the meat, about 2 minutes.  Add potato starch and continue pulsing until mixture has firm paste-like consistency, about 5 minutes.  Form into meatballs.

Slide 3 to 5 meatballs onto each skewer.  Grill over a barbecue or on a well oiled grill pan over medium-high heat until the meatballs are cooked through, rolling them around in the pan, about 6 minutes.

This recipe yields 20 meatballs.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped finely
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  light corn syrup
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  vanilla
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1               pint  premium quality vanilla ice cream
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Walnuts -- toasted, chopped

In a heavy saucepan melt the chocolate with the butter and the corn syrup over moderately-low heat.  Stirring, add the cream and the sugar, and cook the mixture, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved.  Bring the mixture to a boil over moderate heat and boil it, without stirring, for 8 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla and the salt.

Scoop ice cream into four serving dishes and pour hot fudge sauce over vanilla ice cream.  The sauce keeps, covered and chilled, for 1 month.  Let the sauce cool completely before covering it; any condensation will make it grainy.  Reheat the sauce, uncovered, in a double boiler.  (Makes 1 1/3 cups sauce)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === VANILLA-BEAN ICE CREAM ===
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  whole milk
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  3                     vanilla beans -- split lengthwise
  2              large  eggs
                        === DARK HOT FUDGE SAUCE ===
     2/3           cup  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped fine
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  light corn syrup
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

Scoop ice cream into 8 sundae dishes and spoon heated hot fudge sauce over it.  Spoon heated butterscotch sauce over each portion and top with chopped walnuts.  Garnish each sundae with a maraschino cherry.

Vanilla-Bean Ice Cream:  Combine cream, milk, sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a heavy saucepan.  Scrape seeds from vanilla beans with tip of a knife into cream mixture, then drop in pods.  Heat mixture just to a boil.

Whisk eggs in a large bowl, then add hot cream mixture in a slow stream, whisking.  Pour mixture into saucepan and cook over moderately-low heat, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened and an instant-read thermometer registers 170 degrees (do not let boil).

Pour custard through a fine sieve into a clean metal bowl, then cool, stirring occasionally.  Chill, covered, until cold, at least 3 hours.

Freeze custard in an ice-cream maker.  Transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.  (Makes 1 1/2 quarts)

Dark Hot Fudge Sauce:  In a small heavy saucepan heat heavy cream and sugar over moderate heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved.  Add chocolate, butter, and corn syrup and continue to cook, stirring, just until smooth.  Bring mixture to a boil over moderate heat and boil 8 minutes.  Remove pan from heat and stir in vanilla and salt.  Sauce will keep, covered and chilled, for 3 weeks.  Let the sauce cool completely before covering (any condensation will make it grainy).  Reheat sauce, uncovered, over simmering water in a double boiler.  Serve sauce hot over ice cream.  (Makes 1 cup)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  2                     eggs
     2/3           cup  milk
     1/3           cup  water
  1                cup  dulce de leche - (caramelized condensed
                        milk available at many specialty markets)
  2        tablespoons  melted butter
                        Sugar -- for garnish
                        Whipped cream -- for garnish
                        Mint sprigs -- for garnish

In a bowl combine flour, salt, baking powder, milk, eggs and water.  Stir to combine and refrigerate for 3 to 6 hours.

Preheat oven at 350 degrees.

Heat a 8-inch non-stick pan.  Pour about 3 to 4 ounces of batter into the pan and swirl the pan to coat the pan evenly.  When the edges begin to brown, peel the pancakes from the pan and flip over.  After 30 seconds, remove the pancake from the pan.

When all the pancakes are done, fill them with 1 to 2 tablespoons of dulce de leche and roll them up.  Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with sugar.  Warm in oven for 1 or 2 minutes.  Remove from oven, sprinkle with sugar, and caramelize with a propane gas torch.  Serve with whipped cream and garnish with mint sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Propane Gas Torch Warning:  Propane gas torches are highly flammable and should be kept away from heat or flame, and should not be exposed to prolonged sunlight.  Propane gas torches should only be used in well-ventilated areas.  When lighting a propane gas torch, place the torch on a flat, steady surface, facing away from you.  Light the match or lighter and then open the gas valve.  Light the gas jet, and blow out the match.  Always turn off the burner valve to "finger tight" when finished using the torch.  Children should never use a propane gas torch without adult supervision.

  4              large  ripe peaches
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1                cup  sugar

                     Plantain And Black Bean Fritters

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Sue Torres
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BLACK BEAN FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  diced onion
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  dried black beans -- picked over,
                        and soaked overnight
  1              pinch  dried oregano -- (optional)
                        === PLANTAIN DOUGH ===
  3                     black plantains
                        Bread crumbs -- as needed
                        === CURED RED ONIONS ===
  3                     red onions -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  fresh lime juice

Drain the bean liquid and rinse.

Heat a small saucepan with enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan, over medium heat.  Add the onions and garlic and cook until translucent, about 4 minutes.  Add the beans, a dash of oregano (if using) and water to cover 2 inches above the beans.  Bring to boil over high heat, reduce the heat to low, and cook partly covered, until tender.

Keep water in reserve to replenish the cooking liquid as necessary so the beans are always covered by at least 1-inch.  The beans should be cooked until tender, about 1 hour.

Drain excess liquid.  Place the beans in a bowl and mash until pureed.  Season with salt and black pepper and keep at room temperature.

Plantain Dough:  Rinse the plantains with the skins on.  Place the plantains in a sauce pan and cover with hot water.  Place the saucepan over high heat and cook until the skins of the plantain start to open.  Drain the liquid and lay the plantains to cool.  Peel the plaintains while the plantains are still warm, mash in a bowl to form a dough.  If the dough is too wet add bread crumbs until workable.  Divide the dough into 8 balls.

Using a clean flat surface, flatten the balls into round circles 1-inch thick.  Spoon 1/4 teaspoon of the black bean mixture in the center of the plantain.  Fold the edges of the plantain over the center of the plantain to close the bean mixture inside.  If you canít cover all the bean mix, take a piece of plantain mash and place over the beans, while forming into a 1-inch thick round circle.

To assemble the plate:  Heat a sautÈ pan over medium-high heat.  Add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan.  Place the fritters in the hot oil and cook until golden brown on each side.  Reduce to low flame and continue to cook until the fritter is hot throughout.  Serve immediately, with a dollop of sour cream and cured red onions.

Cured Red Onions:  Place the sliced red onions in a small shallow container.  Pour the lime juice over the onions, and season with salt.  Mix well to combine the flavors.  Cover and let sit in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

Categories    : Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  baby or medium squid (tentacles optional),
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  2        tablespoons  coarse sea salt
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
  1                     limes - (to 2) -- cut crosswise
                        into 8 wedges

Slice clean, dry squid into 1/8-inch rings.  If using medium-size squid, cut open squid and make a light crisscross pattern on the outside with a paring knife, then cut into approximately 1-inch pieces.

Heat oil in wok over medium heat to about 375 degrees.  Mix salt, pepper, and cornstarch in a plastic bag.  Add the squid, seal the bag, and shake it to coat each piece evenly.  Put a few squid pieces at a time in the palm of your hand and shake off the excess cornstarch mix.

Working in batches, deep-fry the squid until the rings turn golden and crisp, about 1 minute, or if using 1-inch square pieces, until they curl up and crisp, about 1 minute.  Drain on paper towels and serve with lime wedges on the side.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  A spicy lemon grass dipping sauce goes well with this.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  broccoli rabe -- stems cleaned
  2                     garlic cloves - (to 3) -- minced
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1              pound  Italian sweet or hot sausage in casing
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BASIC PIZZA DOUGH ===
  1                cup  warm tap water -- (100 to 115 degrees)
  1            package  active dry yeast
  3               cups  all-purpose flour - (to 3 1/2)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Wash the broccoli rabe well and let strain in a colander.  Bring about 2 quarts of water to a boil and add a little salt.  Add the broccoli rabe to the pot and bring back to a boil, and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes.  Strain the broccoli rabe, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid.  Run under cold water to cool down, drain, then coarsely chop the broccoli rabe.  Set aside.

Meanwhile, remove the sausage from itís casing, and crumble it well with your hands.  SautÈ the sausage meat in a little oil for about 2 to 3 minutes until no longer pink.  Set aside.

In a Dutch oven or large sautÈ pan, add the garlic and the olive oil and heat over medium flame until garlic is golden.  Add the broccoli rabe and toss a little to mix well.  Season with salt and pepper, red pepper flakes.  Add the reserved cooking liquid and let simmer on a low flame for about 5 minutes, stirring often.  Add the cooked sausage meat to this and mix well.  Check seasoning.  Cool down mixture if not using right away.

Spread the pizza dough with the rabe mixture.  Bake in a pizza oven or a preheated 400 degree oven until lightly golden and the crust is browned, about 20 minutes.  Cut into wedges and serve

Basic Pizza Dough:  Pour the water onto a medium-sized mixing bowl and add the yeast, stirring with a fork until dissolved.  The water should turn a light beige color.  Add 1 cup of flour and the salt.  Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon.  Add the second cup of flour and repeat.  The dough should start coming away from the sides of the bowl, forming a soft, sticky mass.  Take the last cup of flour and sprinkle over a clean, dry work surface and flour your hands well.

Take the dough from the bowl and begin to work in the additional flour a little at a time.  Use the heel of your hand to knead the dough and push across the work surface, clenching the dough with your fist and twisting it over.  Use a dough scraper to help gather any wet dough that sticks to the surface while you are kneading.  Also only add as much flour as it takes to keep the dough from sticking to your hands.  When the dough no longer feels sticky, push the heel of your hand down into it and hold it there for 10 seconds.  If the dough comes up clean, itís ready.  If it sticks you will have to knead it a bit more.

Note:  If you have a food processor with a dough hook attachment, you can make the dough much faster.  Start by adding the yeast and water first and mixing well.  Then add all the flour and salt and mix into a ball.  Then rise the dough.

Lightly oil a 2-quart bowl with vegetable oil, and roll the ball of dough around the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil, then tightly seal the bowl with plastic wrap.  Keep in a warm place, and let the dough rise for 30 to 45 minutes.  When dough doubles in size, remove from bowl and punch it down with your fist to deflate, then knead it again for about a minute.  Dough is now ready to stretch into a round, or press into a pizza pan.  (Makes 1 ball of dough)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Wash the broccoli rabe well and let strain in a colander.  Bring about 2 quarts of water to a boil and add a little salt.  Add the broccoli rabe to the pot and bring back to a boil, and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes.  Strain the broccoli rabe, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid.  Run under cold water to cool down, drain, then coarsely chop the broccoli rabe.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, remove the sausage from itís casing, and crumble it well with your hands.  SautÈ the sausage meat in a little oil for about 2 to 3 minutes until no longer pink.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a Dutch oven or large sautÈ pan, add the garlic and the olive oil and heat over medium flame until garlic is golden.  Add the broccoli rabe and toss a little to mix well.  Season with salt and pepper, red pepper flakes.  Add the reserved cooking liquid and let simmer on a low flame for about 5 minutes, stirring often.  Add the cooked sausage meat to this and mix well.  Check seasoning.  Cool down mixture if not using right away.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the pizza dough with the rabe mixture.  Bake in a pizza oven or a preheated 400 degree oven until lightly golden and the crust is browned, about 20 minutes.  Cut into wedges and serve
</DirT>
<DirT>
Basic Pizza Dough:  Pour the water onto a medium-sized mixing bowl and add the yeast, stirring with a fork until dissolved.  The water should turn a light beige color.  Add 1 cup of flour and the salt.  Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon.  Add the second cup of flour and repeat.  The dough should start coming away from the sides of the bowl, forming a soft, sticky mass.  Take the last cup of flour and sprinkle over a clean, dry work surface and flour your hands well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Take the dough from the bowl and begin to work in the additional flour a little at a time.  Use the heel of your hand to knead the dough and push across the work surface, clenching the dough with your fist and twisting it over.  Use a dough scraper to help gather any wet dough that sticks to the surface while you are kneading.  Also only add as much flour as it takes to keep the dough from sticking to your hands.  When the dough no longer feels sticky, push the heel of your hand down into it and hold it there for 10 seconds.  If the dough comes up clean, itís ready.  If it sticks you will have to knead it a bit more.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  If you have a food processor with a dough hook attachment, you can make the dough much faster.  Start by adding the yeast and water first and mixing well.  Then add all the flour and salt and mix into a ball.  Then rise the dough.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly oil a 2-quart bowl with vegetable oil, and roll the ball of dough around the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil, then tightly seal the bowl with plastic wrap.  Keep in a warm place, and let the dough rise for 30 to 45 minutes.  When dough doubles in size, remove from bowl and punch it down with your fist to deflate, then knead it again for about a minute.  Dough is now ready to stretch into a round, or press into a pizza pan.  (Makes 1 ball of dough)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  rice flour
  1              pinch  turmeric
     1/2           cup  coconut milk
  2               cups  water
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced scallions
  1              pound  small shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and halved lengthwise
  1              pound  mung bean sprouts -- root ends trimmed

Whisk together flour, turmeric, coconut milk, 2 cups water, 2 tablespoons oil, and scallions until well combined.  Allow batter to rest 30 minutes.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok or skillet over high heat.  Add shrimp and cook until opaque, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the bean sprouts and cook until just translucent but still firm, about 1 minute.  Transfer to a platter and set aside.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  While tilting the pan add 1/4 cup batter, swirling the pan at the same time to evenly distribute the batter.  Once the crepe starts to bubble gently in the center and loosen itself at the edges, 3 to 5 minutes, add shrimp and bean sprouts, fold over one half of the lacy crepe, and slide onto a serving dish.  Continue making crepes as you serve them.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                        === SALSA DEL DIABLO ===
     1/4         pound  tomatoes
                        = (1/2 med-lge round or 2 to 3 plum)
  5                     chiles guajillos -- stemmed, seeded

  2              whole  allspice
  3                     black peppercorns
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Worchestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  butter
  1           teaspoon  sunflower or vegetable oil
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or more to taste
                        === FISH ===
  2              large  fresh banana leaves - (abt 1/2 lb)
                        = (or substitute frozen)
  2 1/2         pounds  whole sea bass, red snapper or
                        striped bass -- butterflied or fille
  4        tablespoons  soft butter - (1/2 stick) -- to coat the foil and
                        Salt -- mixed with
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to sprinkle on fish
  3        tablespoons  Worchestershire sauce
  3        tablespoons  Maggi sauce
     1/2         pound  tomatoes -- thinly-sliced
                        = (1 medm-lge round or 4 to 5 plum)
     1/2        medium  white onion -- thinly sliced
  5                     bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley leaves

In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.  Cut an X in the bottom of the tomatoes.  Place the tomatoes in the boiling water and boil for 5 minutes.  Remove the tomatoes from the pot and reserve the water.  When tomatoes are cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skins.

On a dry comal, griddle or in a cast-iron frying pan, toast the chiles until they give off their aroma.  Place in a bowl and cover with reserved tomato water.  Soak for 20 minutes.  Remove chiles from the water.  Reserve the water.

On the same comal, roast the onion and garlic for 8 to 10 minutes over medium heat or until transparent.

Place the chiles, tomatoes, onion, garlic, oregano, allspice, peppercorns, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce in a blender.  Blend well with 1/2 cup chile soaking water.  Pour through a strainer to remove the skins.

In a medium frying pan, heat the butter and oil.  Pour in the chile mixture add the bay leaf.  Fry for 5 minutes.  Add salt.

Holding the banana leaves with tongs, pass the leaves over a gas flame to soften them.  If you don't have a flame handy, you can boil them until soft, about 20 minutes, covered.  Remove and set aside.

Fish:  Heat a long griddle that covers 2 burners until very hot.  Open the fish so it is lying flat, skin-side down.

Cut a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil twice the size of the fish.  Totally butter one half of the foil.  Place the banana leaf on the buttered portion of the foil.  Lay the fish skin-side down, on top of the leaf.  Sprinkle salt and pepper over the fish.

Spoon 1/4 cup of the salsa del diablo over the fish.  Sprinkle the Worcestershire and Maggi sauce over the fish, including the head.  Dot butter over the fish.  Add the tomato and onion slices.  Add the bay leaves and parsley.

Cover the fish with the banana leaf.  Pull the foil over the top of the fish and seal by folding over the edges.  It is important to have a good seal on all 3 edges, so the steam does not escape during cooking process.

Carefully move fish over to the grill and cook for 10 minutes.  The foil should fully puff up in the process.  Watch the foil to make sure that the steam is not escaping.  If it is, reseal the fish.  Serve immediately with totadas or totopos.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.  Cut an X in the bottom of the tomatoes.  Place the tomatoes in the boiling water and boil for 5 minutes.  Remove the tomatoes from the pot and reserve the water.  When tomatoes are cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skins.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On a dry comal, griddle or in a cast-iron frying pan, toast the chiles until they give off their aroma.  Place in a bowl and cover with reserved tomato water.  Soak for 20 minutes.  Remove chiles from the water.  Reserve the water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On the same comal, roast the onion and garlic for 8 to 10 minutes over medium heat or until transparent.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the chiles, tomatoes, onion, garlic, oregano, allspice, peppercorns, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce in a blender.  Blend well with 1/2 cup chile soaking water.  Pour through a strainer to remove the skins.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium frying pan, heat the butter and oil.  Pour in the chile mixture add the bay leaf.  Fry for 5 minutes.  Add salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Holding the banana leaves with tongs, pass the leaves over a gas flame to soften them.  If you don&apos;t have a flame handy, you can boil them until soft, about 20 minutes, covered.  Remove and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fish:  Heat a long griddle that covers 2 burners until very hot.  Open the fish so it is lying flat, skin-side down.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil twice the size of the fish.  Totally butter one half of the foil.  Place the banana leaf on the buttered portion of the foil.  Lay the fish skin-side down, on top of the leaf.  Sprinkle salt and pepper over the fish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon 1/4 cup of the salsa del diablo over the fish.  Sprinkle the Worcestershire and Maggi sauce over the fish, including the head.  Dot butter over the fish.  Add the tomato and onion slices.  Add the bay leaves and parsley.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cover the fish with the banana leaf.  Pull the foil over the top of the fish and seal by folding over the edges.  It is important to have a good seal on all 3 edges, so the steam does not escape during cooking process.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Carefully move fish over to the grill and cook for 10 minutes.  The foil should fully puff up in the process.  Watch the foil to make sure that the steam is not escaping.  If it is, reseal the fish.  Serve immediately with totadas or totopos.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Brunch                          Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  double-acting baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  milk
  2              large  eggs
  3 1/2         ounces  smoked salmon, dried
  1                     red onion -- finely diced
  6        tablespoons  fresh dill
                        === TOPPING ===
                        Softened cream cheese -- and
                        Finely-chopped scallions -- or
                        CrËme fraiche (or sour cream) -- and
                        Salmon caviar

Preheat your waffle iron.  If you want to hold the finished waffles until serving time, preheat your oven to 200 degrees.

Melt the butter and reserve.  In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper.  In another bowl, whisk together the milk and eggs until well blended.  Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients and whisk gently to combine.  Fold in the salmon, onion, dill, and melted butter.

Lightly butter or spray the grids or your iron, if needed.  Brush or spray the grids again only if subsequent waffles stick.

Spoon out 1/2 cup of the batter (or the amount recommended by your waffle makerís instructions) onto the hot iron.  Spread the batter evenly over the grids with a metal spatula or wooden spoon, stopping right before the edge.  Close the lid and bake until golden and crisp.  Serve immediately or keep the waffles, in a single layer, on a rack in the preheated oven while you make the rest of the batch.

Serve with either a scoop of cream cheese and a sprinkling of chopped scallions, or a generous spoonful of crËme fraiche (or sour cream) and some salmon caviar.

This recipe yields 6 (6 1/2-inch round) waffles.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  18                    live blue crabs
  2        tablespoons  Crab-Boil Spices -- (see recipe)
     1/2    tablespoon  cayenne
     1/4           cup  table salt
  2                     lemons -- quartered
  1                     onion -- halved
     3/4        pounds  small potatoes - (abt 2" dia)
  1                     garlic head -- not separated
                        into cloves
  3                     corn ears -- shucked
  1         tablespoon  Crab-Boil Spices -- or to taste,
                        for sprinkling over boiled seafood
                        French bread, for accompaniment

In a kettle bring 5 gallons water to a boil.

While water is coming to a boil, in a deep sink rinse crabs in 2 or 3 changes of water.  (Do not fill sink too full or crabs may crawl out.)  Add 2 tablespoons Crab-Boil Spices, cayenne, salt, lemons, and onions to boiling water and boil 5 minutes.  Add potatoes and garlic and boil until tender, about 15 minutes.  Transfer potatoes and garlic with a large sieve to a large platter and keep warm, covered with foil.  Add corn to boiling water and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.  Transfer corn with tongs to platter and keep warm, covered with foil.

Return water to a boil.  Transfer about 6 crabs carefully with long tongs to sieve, holding them down in sieve with tongs, and turn crabs out into boiling water.  Add remaining crabs in same manner.  Return water to a boil and cook crabs until just cooked through, about 10 minutes.  (To determine doneness, remove a claw and crack it with the handle of a dinner knife.  Use knife to extract meat from claw.)  Transfer crabs with sieve to another large platter and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Crab-Boil Spices.

Serve with French bread.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

In a kettle bring 5 gallons water to a boil.

<DirT>
While water is coming to a boil, in a deep sink rinse crabs in 2 or 3 changes of water.  (Do not fill sink too full or crabs may crawl out.)  Add 2 tablespoons Crab-Boil Spices, cayenne, salt, lemons, and onions to boiling water and boil 5 minutes.  Add potatoes and garlic and boil until tender, about 15 minutes.  Transfer potatoes and garlic with a large sieve to a large platter and keep warm, covered with foil.  Add corn to boiling water and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.  Transfer corn with tongs to platter and keep warm, covered with foil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return water to a boil.  Transfer about 6 crabs carefully with long tongs to sieve, holding them down in sieve with tongs, and turn crabs out into boiling water.  Add remaining crabs in same manner.  Return water to a boil and cook crabs until just cooked through, about 10 minutes.  (To determine doneness, remove a claw and crack it with the handle of a dinner knife.  Use knife to extract meat from claw.)  Transfer crabs with sieve to another large platter and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Crab-Boil Spices.

                          Spicy Ricotta Waffles

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast                       Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  double-acting baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper - (generous)
  1                cup  ricotta
  2              large  eggs
  1 1/4           cups  milk
                        Salsa, (homemade or store-bought) -- as an accompaniment
                        Cilantro -- for garnish

Preheat your waffle iron.  Preheat your oven to 200 degrees so you can hold the finished waffles until serving time.

Melt the butter and reserve.  In a medium-size bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pepper to combine.  In a large bowl, beat the ricotta for 1 minute with a mixer until the mixer leaves tracks.  Donít worry if itís not completely smooth.  Add the eggs and beat for another minute.  When the combination is smooth and shiny, add the milk.  Turn the dry ingredients into the bowl with the ricotta mixture and whisk gently to combine.  Stir in the melted butter.

Lightly butter or spray the grids of your waffle iron, if needed.  Brush or spray the grids again only if subsequent waffles stick.

Spoon out 1 cup of batter for a Belgian waffle maker (or the amount recommended by your waffle makerís instructions) onto hot iron.  Spread the batter evenly over the grids with a metal spatula or wooden spoon, stopping right before the edge.  Close the lid and bake until pale golden and lightly crisped.  Put finished waffles in a single layer on a baking sheet, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep in the preheated oven while you make the rest of the batch.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOFU ===
  3        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  naturally brewed soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped basil leaves
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon zest
  1              pound  firm tofu -- rinsed, patted dry,
                        and sliced 1/2" thick
                        === BROCOLI RABE ===
  2             pounds  broccoli rabe -- tough stalks trimmed
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  8                     plump garlic cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  hot red pepper flakes
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-milled black pepper -- to taste
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a bowl, combine the lemon juice, soy sauce, basil, oil, vinegar, and lemon zest.  Lay the tofu slices in a baking dish that can hold them in a single snug layer.  Pour the marinade over the tofu.  Bake for 30 minutes, or until the tofu is nearly dry and well browned.

To make the broccoli rabe, chop the tender stalks and greens into 2-inch pieces and soak them in a large basin of cold water.

In a heavy, wide saute pan over medium heat, warm the oil.  Add the garlic and saute gently for 3 to 5 minutes, until golden.  Add the red pepper flakes and tofu and saute for 1 minute.  Scoop the greens from the water and add them to the pan.  Raise the heat and turn the greens over in the oil with a pair of tongs.  When the greens begin to simmer, reduce the heat to low and cover.  Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, until the greens are tender.

Season with salt and pepper and serve drizzled with some of the liquor and garnished with the lemon wedges and garlic cloves.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

     3/4           cup  sweetened condensed milk
     1/2           cup  crema or half-and-half
  1                cup  evaporated milk
  2        tablespoons  rum, brandy, mezcal, or
                        other liquor of your choice
                        === FROSTING ===
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  confectioners' sugar -- sifted
  2        tablespoons  milk

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Oil a jellyroll baking pan and line it with waxed paper oiled on both sides.  Separate the yolks and whites in 2 bowls.  Sift the flour and baking powder together.

Beat the yolks until light and lemon colored, about 20 minutes.  The consistency should be very thick, and when you lift the beaters, the mixture should fall in one solid mass, known as the "ribbon stage".  Add 1/2 cup of the sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time.  Add the vanilla and beat 3 minutes more.

Whip the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar slowly until it makes a meringue.  Add the whites to the yolks one-third at a time and fold in with a rubber spatula.  Add the flour all at once and fold in.

Spread the batter in the pan and bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until the cake comes away from the sides of the pan.  Let it rest for 5 minutes, then remove it from the pan and place on a clean tea towel that has been dusted with confectionersí sugar.  Remove the waxed paper by rubbing the top of the paper with a dry cloth all over the surface and peeling off.  Cover the cake with another tea towel and roll up the cake lengthwise in the towels, like a jellyroll, while still warm.

For the filling:  Whip the cream and vanilla until soft peaks form.  Add the confectioners' sugar.  Add the fruit to the whipped cream and fold in.

For the soaking liquid:  Mix the milks with a whisk.  Add the liquor.

For the frosting:  In a mixing bowl, beat the butter until soft and fluffy, about 10 minutes.  Add the vanilla and mix for 2 minutes.  Slowly add the confectioners' sugar until it is well incorporated.  Add the milk.

To assemble the cake:  Unroll the cake and remove the tea towel from the top layer.  Spread the whipped cream mixture on the cake and, using the bottom as leverage, roll it up lengthwise.  Transfer the cake to a serving tray seam-side down.  Make holes in the cake with a skewer and drizzle the soaking liquid, slowly, letting it absorb bit by bit.  Cover the cake with the frosting.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RICE ===
  3        tablespoons  sunflower or vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped white onion
  1 1/2    tablespoons  finely-chopped garlic
  2               cups  white rice
  4               cups  chicken stock -- heated
  2             sprigs  fresh hierbabuena
                        = (or 2 tbspns mint leaves)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === PLANTAINS ===
  1              pound  ripe plantains -- peeled
  1                cup  sunflower or vegetable oil

In a heavy 4-quart stockpot, heat the oil over low heat.  Add the onion and fry until soft and clear, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and continue to fry for another 3 to 5 minutes.  Add the rice and stir well.  Fry slowly without moving it too much, about 10 minutes.  Stir in the hot chicken stock and the hierbabuena or mint.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and let cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until all the stock is absorbed.  Do not peek at or stir the rice during the cooking process.

Cut the plantains in half.  Cut each half lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices (about 4 to 5 slices).  In an 8-inch cast-iron frying pan, heat the oil until smoking.  Add the plantains and fry 3 to 5 minutes on each side or until brown.  Remove them from the oil and drain on paper towels.  Mound the rice on a plate or a platter and serve with the fried plantains on top.

This recipe yields 8 servings.
