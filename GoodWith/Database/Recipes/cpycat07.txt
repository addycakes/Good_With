Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  teriyaki marinade
  4                     chicken breast fillets
                        === FAT-FREE ASIAN DRESSING ===
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  3        tablespoons  dry pectin
  1         tablespoon  white vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
                        === SALAD ===
  8               cups  chopped Romaine lettuce
  8               cups  chopped Iceberg lettuce
  3               cups  shredded red cabbage
  3               cups  shredded green cabbage
  2               cups  shredded carrots
  1                cup  chopped green onion
  1 1/3           cups  crispy chow mein noodles

Combine teriyaki marinade and chicken breasts in a medium bowl or resealable plastic bag.  Marinate chicken for 3 to 4 hours.

Prepare the dressing by combining all of the ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Bring mixture to a rolling boil while stirring often with a whisk, then remove the pan from the heat to cool.  When dressing has cooled, pour it into a covered container and chill.

When chicken breasts have marinated, preheat barbecue grill to high heat.  Grill chicken for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until done.

Combine the Romaine and Iceberg lettuce, red and green cabbage and 1 cup of shredded carrots in a large bowl with the dressing.  Toss well.   Divide the tossed greens among four plates.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup of green onions over each salad, followed by 1/3 cup of crispy chow mein noodles.

When the chicken breasts are done, slice each one, widthwise, into bite-size pieces.  Sprinkle the sliced chicken breasts over each salad.  Place a 1/4-cup pile of shredded carrots in the center of each salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PICO DE GALLO ===
  1                     tomato -- chopped (1/2 cup)
  3        tablespoons  chopped Spanish onion
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  canned jalapeÒo slices (nacho slices) -- diced
  1               dash  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === POTATO BOATS ===
  3             medium  russet potatoes
                        Canola oil nonstick cooking spray -- as needed
                        Salt -- as needed
     1/3           cup  reduced-fat shredded Cheddar cheese
     1/3           cup  reduced-fat Mozzarella cheese
  2             slices  Canadian bacon -- diced (abt 2 tbspns)
                        === ON THE SIDE ===
                        Fat-free sour cream
                        Salsa

In a bowl, combine all the Pico De Gallo ingredients to make it.  When well combined, place in refrigerator till serving time.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place potatoes in oven and bake for at least 1 hour or until tender.  Set aside to cool.  When potatoes are sufficiently cooled enough to handle, cut through them lengthwise 2 times.  This should make 3 one-half to three-fourth inch slices.  You can either throw away the middle slices or save them to make a different potato dish with.

You should have 2 whole potato skins from each potato now.  Turn the oven up to 450 degrees.  Take a spoon and scoop out the inside of the potato skins.  Be sure to leave around one-fourth of an inch of potato inside each skin.  Spray the entire potato skin on all sides with a light spray of non stick canola oil.  Put the skins on a cookie sheet with the cut-side facing up.  Salt them and bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until the edges begin to brown.

In a bowl, combine the cheeses.  Sprinkle 1 1/2 tablespoons on each potato skin.  Then sprinkle a teaspoon of Canadian bacon on top of the cheese that was sprinkled on each skin.  Top this with a large tablespoon of pico de gallo.  Then sprinkle each skin with some more cheese.

Place the skins back into the oven again and baked for 2 to 4 minutes or until the cheese melts.  Remove the potatoes from the oven and let them sit for around a minute or so.  With a knife, slice each one lengthwise.  Serve hot with sour cream and salsa on the side.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon filets - (5 oz ea)
                        Melted butter -- as needed

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  8             ounces  tomato sauce
  1                     tomato -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  diced onion
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  dried Oregano
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  dried basil
                        === PIZZA STICKS ===
  10            ounces  Pillsbury Pizza Dough
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        === TOPPINGS ===
  1 3/4           cups  grated Mozzarella cheese
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  dried basil
     1/4      teaspoon  caraway
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic salt
                        === OPTIONAL ===
  3             ounces  pepperoni -- diced
  3             ounces  Italian sausage -- cooked, crumbled

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Prepare dipping sauce by combining all the ingredients in a small, uncovered saucepan and bringing the mixture to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer the mixture for 1/2 hour.  Can be made ahead and refrigerated for several days.

Prepare the pizza sticks by first proofing the dough.  Unroll the dough onto a cutting board and straighten the edges.  It should form a rectangle that is longer from left to right than top to bottom.  With a pizza cutter, slice through the middle of the dough lengthwise.  This will divide the rectangle into 2 thinner rectangles that will measure 4 to 5 inches from top to bottom.  Slice the dough from top to bottom into 1 1/2-inch wide pieces.  You should have somewhere between 20 to 24 dough slices.

Place the slices onto a greased cookie sheet about 1/2-inch apart and bake for 3 minutes.  You may have to use more than one cookie sheet.  This will proof the dough so it becomes stiff.

Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan or deep fryer to 350 degrees.  Oil should be at least 1/2-inch deep if using the stove.  You will want to use more oil if using a deep fryer.

Fry pizza sticks 5 to 6 at a time until they are dark golden brown.  Remove from oil onto a paper towel to drain.  When all the pizza dough sticks are fried, arrange them on foil-lined cookie sheets.

Preheat the broiler.  Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese evenly over the dough.  Sprinkle the parmesan cheese evenly over the mozzarella.  Combine the oregano, basil, caraway seeds and garlic salt in a small bowl.  Sprinkle the spice mixture over the cheese.  If using the pepperoni and sausage, sprinkle that on now.  Broil the pizza sticks for 2 minutes or until the cheese is melted.  Serve hot with dipping sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 20 to 24 sticks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             slices  lean bacon -- sliced 1/2" pieces
  2                     flour tortilla shells - (8" dia)
                        Softened butter -- as needed for
                        lightly spreading on tortilla shells
  1         tablespoon  Pico De Gallo -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  shredded Colby/Monterey Jack Cheese
                        Sour Cream -- for serving
                        Guacamole -- for serving
                        Picante Sauce -- for serving

Slice bacon and fry until bacon starts to turn crisp but not hard and brittle.  Remove from pan, drain bacon and set aside.

Spread butter lightly on one side of the flour tortilla shell.  Place buttered-side of shell down, into a non-stick fry pan that has been preheated on medium heat.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of bacon over entire shell, then add 1 tablespoon Pico de gallo, and 1/4 cup shredded Colby/Monterey Jack cheese over the bacon.  Place the second flour shell on top of fixings, buttered-side up.

Cook for about one to two minutes just long enough to heat the inside ingredients and then carefully flip the quesadilla on the other side and finish cooking.  The quesadilla should be heated through but not browned.

Remove quesadilla and place on a serving dish and cut into individual triangle serving pieces.  Serve quesadillas with your favorite guacamole sour cream, and picante sauce.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     boneless skinless chicken breasts
  1            package  Monterey Jack cheese - (8 oz or larger)
     1/2           cup  butter -- melted
  1                cup  Italian seasoned bread crumbs
  1 1/2    tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              small  red bell pepper
  1              small  green bell pepper

Cut some of the cheese into 8 slices, and reserve part of it for the cheese sauce.

Place 1 chicken breast between two sheets of wax paper.  Working from the center to the edges pound with a meat mallet until flat and rectangular shaped.  Repeat with remaining breasts.  Wrap the flattened chicken breasts around cheese.  Secure with wooden picks or uncooked spaghetti noodles.

Combine the bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, salt, cumin and pepper.  Roll the secured chicken pieces in the melted butter and then in the bread crumb mixture.  Place chicken breasts in a 13- by 9-inch baking dish, but don't crowd them.  Drizzle the remaining butter over all eight of the breasts.  Refrigerate for 1 hour or freeze to bake later (baking time will be increased by about 5 to 10 minutes).

Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until chicken is done.

Make a roux with butter and flour.  Add about 1 cup milk.  Bring to a simmer.  Add cheese and lower the heat, stirring constantly so cheese does not burn.  Add milk as needed to thin out the cheese sauce.  Dice bell peppers.

When chicken is done, pour some cheese sauce over top and sprinkle with diced peppers.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Place chicken breasts in a 13- by 9-inch baking dish, but don&apos;t crowd them.  Drizzle the remaining butter over all eight of the breasts.  Refrigerate for 1 hour or freeze to bake later (baking time will be increased by about 5 to 10 minutes).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until chicken is done.

<DirT>
Make a roux with butter and flour.  Add about 1 cup milk.  Bring to a simmer.  Add cheese and lower the heat, stirring constantly so cheese does not burn.  Add milk as needed to thin out the cheese sauce.  Dice bell peppers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When chicken is done, pour some cheese sauce over top and sprinkle with diced peppers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              whole  pita breads (to 3)
  1            package  frozen spinach - (10 oz)
     1/3           cup  nutritional yeast
  1             medium  onion
  5                     plum tomatoes - (to 6)
  1            package  fresh mushrooms - (8 oz)
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4)
  1           teaspoon  basil
  1           teaspoon  parsley
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2           cup  rice milk - (to 1)
  4        tablespoons  flour

Thaw spinach completely, press out all water.  Heat milk in saucepan, when hot but not boiling stir in flour.  Stir until sauce begins to thicken, turn heat down.  Add nutritional yeast and spinach.  Stir constantly until thick and gooey, only about 3 to 4 minutes.

In separate pan, sautÈ onion, garlic, until onion is tender.  Stir in tomatoes, mushrooms, and spices.  SautÈ until just done.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Using a very sharp bread knife, split each pita bread so that you have two round flat pieces instead of one thick one.  Place each piece of bread on a cookie sheet or pizza pan.  Spread spinach sauce over each.  Top with tomato mixture, being careful to avoid the juice.  Bake for 5 to 7 minutes.  Watch closely so that the edges of the pita don't burn.  Makes a nice crunchy crust.

This recipe yields 4 to 5 individual pizzas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     mushroom -- diced
  1         tablespoon  butter -- softened
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3             ounces  Steak-Umm
     1/4           cup  shredded Cheddar cheese
     1/4           cup  shredded Monterey Jack cheese
  1                     flour tortilla - (10" dia)
  1         tablespoon  diced tomato
  1           teaspoon  diced red onion
     1/4      teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
  1              slice  bacon -- cooked

SautÈ the mushroom in small pan with 1/2 teaspoon butter and dash of salt and pepper.  Break beef into bite-size pieces and grill it in another pan over medium heat until brown.  Add a dash of salt and pepper.  Drain off the fat.

Build your sandwich by first sprinkling both cheeses into the center of the tortilla.  Sprinkle the tomato, onion, mushroom and cilantro over the cheese.  Crumble the bacon and sprinkle it over the cheese.  Sprinkle the beef over the other ingredients, then add a bit more salt and pepper.

Fold the sides in like a burrito, then use the 1 tablespoon butter to butter the top and bottom of the sandwich and grill it in a hot pan over medium heat for 2 minutes per side.  Slice in half diagonally and serve with lettuce, sour cream and salsa.

This recipe yields 1 sandwich.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  fresh zucchini -- 1/4" bias half-moons
     1/2         pound  yellow squash -- 1/4" bias half-moons
     1/4         pound  red pepper -- cut 1/4" julienne
                        strips
     1/4         pound  fresh carrots -- cut 4" by 1/4"
                        sticks
     1/4         pound  red onions -- cut 1/4" julienne
                        strips
  3        tablespoons  butter or margarine
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated garlic
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  fresh or dried parsley

Thoroughly clean and sanitize sink.  Rinse and wash all vegetables under cold water.  Clean and sanitize cutting board and knife.

Cut the ends off of the zucchini and squash, then cut down the center lengthwise.  Using chef knife, cut into 1/4-inch bias half-moons.

Slice red pepper in half and remove the stem.  Core and remove seeds from the red peppers.  Cut each half in half, then slice lengthwise.

Slice both ends of red onion off.  Remove the peel and core of the onion.  Slice lengthwise for a 1/4-inch julienne cut.

Peel carrots.  Trim top end of carrot and narrow bottom end to result in a 4-inch length of (somewhat) uniform width.  Cut each piece in half lengthwise, then cut the halves into quarters, result should be approximately 1/4-inch by 1/4-inch sticks.

Heat butter or margarine in a sautÈ pan over medium heat (do not scorch).  Add salt, sugar and garlic.  Add vegetables (start with carrots and work back up the list -- denser vegetables take longer to heat) and cook until hot, yet crisp.  When vegetables are all in pan and cooking, add Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce and parsley.  Mix thoroughly and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  warm water
  1 1/8      teaspoons  active dry yeast - (1 1/2 pkgs)
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1 1/8      teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  bread flour
  3               cups  regular flour
  2               cups  warm water
  2        tablespoons  baking soda
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  butter - (to 4) -- melted

Sprinkle yeast on lukewarm water in mixing bowl; stir to dissolve.  Add sugar, salt and stir to dissolve; add flour and knead dough until smooth and elastic.  Let rise at least 1/2 hour.

While dough is rising, prepare a baking soda water bath with 2 cups warm water and 2 tablespoons baking soda.  Be certain to stir often.

After dough has risen, pinch off bits of dough and roll into a long rope (about 1/2-inch or less thick) and shape.  Dip pretzel in soda solution and place on greased baking sheet.  Allow pretzels to rise again.

Bake in oven at 450 degrees for about 10 minutes or until golden.  Brush with melted butter and enjoy!

Toppings: After you brush with butter try sprinkling with coarse salt.  Or for Auntie Anne's famous Cinnamon Sugar, try melting a stick of butter in a shallow bowl (big enough to fit the entire pretzel) and in another shallow bowl make a mixture of cinnamon and sugar.  Dip the pretzel into the butter, coating both sides generously.  Then dip again into the cinnamon mixture.  Enjoy!

This recipe yields ?? pretzels.

Comments:  The longer and thinner you can make the dough rope, the more like Auntie Anne's they will be.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2           cups  diced zucchini
  4 1/2           cups  diced yellow squash
  1 1/2           cups  chopped yellow onion
  1            package  Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix -- prepared as directed
  1 1/2         sticks  butter
  8             ounces  American processed cheese -- diced
                        = (use a store brand not Velveta)
  3                     chicken bouillon cubes
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley

Prepare Jiffy Mix as directed, set aside to cool.

Place zucchini and yellow squash in a large sauce pan and add just enough of water to cover.  Cook on medium-low heat just until tender, remove from heat.  Drain squash, reserve one cup of water for casserole.

On medium-low temperature place all of the butter in large sauce pan and sautÈ the onions until the onions turn clear, add salt, pepper, thyme, and parsley.  Add chicken bouillon cubes and garlic to onions, stir.  Add drained squash and diced cheese, stir.  Crumble corn bread in squash and pour the reserved cup of water and mix well.

Place squash mixture in a 13- by 11-inch baking pan that has been sprayed with a non-stick spray.  Cover casserole and place in a preheated 350 degree oven.  Bake for 50 to 60 minutes.  Remove cover the last 20 minutes of baking time.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This is a wonderful way to dress up your standard squash casserole.  We found that this casserole is a great replacement for stuffing or potatoes.  If you tend to prefer less butter, please add less than is suggested.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  fudge chocolate brownie mix
  1            package  English walnuts - (14 oz) -- coarsely chopped
                        Vanilla ice cream
  1                     small jar fudge topping
  1                     small jar maraschino cherry's

Follow the directions on the package of brownie mix for fudge style brownies and add 1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped walnuts to mix and stir.  Pour batter into a 13- by 9-inch pan so the brownies will not be excessively thick.  Bake according to directions but do not over bake.  We like ours a little underdone.

To assemble on an individual serving plate: warm a 4- by 4-inch slice of brownie and place a large round spoon full of vanilla ice cream on top, cover with fudge, place about a tablespoon of walnuts on topping and add a maraschino cherry.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh baby carrots
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2         tablespoon  margarine

Rinse carrots and place in a 2-quart sauce pan.  Pour enough water in sauce pan to just cover the top of the carrots.  Cover carrots with a lid, place on medium heat and bring to a boil.  Turn heat to low and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes until the carrots are tender when pricked with a fork.

When carrots start to become tender pour half of the water off carrots and add salt, sugar and margarine.  Place lid on pan and cook until completely tender but not mushy.  More salt may be added if needed.

Serve carrots along side your favorite entree.  The kids will enjoy the little baby carrots.  For some additional flair you might want to substitute brown sugar, and a dash of nutmeg will do wonders.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Talk about yummy.  You can make sweet tasting carrots at home.  These are a favorite of many.

Categories    : Casseroles                      Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  crumbled Cornbread -- (see below)
     1/2           cup  melted butter
                        === CORNBREAD ===
  1                cup  yellow corn meal
     1/3           cup  flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  buttermilk
  1                     egg
                        === CHICKEN FILLING ===
  2 1/2           cups  bite-size cooked chicken breast
     1/4           cup  chopped yellow onion
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced celery
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                can  cream of chicken soup
  1 3/4            cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  butter

Mix all together in mixing bowl until smooth.  Pour into greased 8- by 8-inch baking pan and bake at 375 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes until done.  Remove from oven and let cool completely.  When cool crumble corn bread and place 3 cups of corn bread crumbs in mixing bowl.  Add 1/2 cup melted butter to crumbs and mix well, set aside.

Chicken Filling:  In sauce pan on medium low heat place butter and sautÈ onions, and celery until transparent, stirring occasionally.  Add chicken broth, cream of chicken soup, salt, and pepper.

Spoon cornbread crumb topping on top of chicken mixture, do not stir into chicken filling and place baking dish in preheated oven at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes.  The crumbs will turn a golden yellow. A side order of Country Green Beans (see recipe) or a salad makes for a hearty meal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  bacon -- fried crisp
  1                cup  diced yellow onion
     2/3           cup  flour
  6               cups  chicken broth
  4               cups  diced peeled baked potato
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  1 1/2      teaspoons  granulated garlic
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried basil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Tabasco sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1                cup  grated Cheddar cheese
     1/4           cup  diced green onion

Chop bacon.  Set aside.  Cook onions in drippings over medium-high heat until transparent.  Add flour stirring to prevent lumps.  Cook for 3 to 5 minutes until mixture just begins to turn golden.  Add broth (it helps if it is warm) gradually, stirring constantly with whisk until thickened.

Reduce heat to simmer and add potatoes, cream, bacon, parsley, garlic, basil, Tabasco, and black pepper.  Simmer 10 minutes.  Do Not Boil.  Add cheese and green onion.  Stir until cheese melts.  This can be made ahead up to the point of adding the cheese and onion.

Reheat the soup very slowly and gently.  Be careful that it does not boil.  Then add the cheese and green onion.  Of course if there is any leftover it reheats beautifully.  I have never tried freezing it.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             medium  Russet potatoes
  3                cup  whole milk
     1/2           cup  half-and-half
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1                cup  shredded Cheddar cheese
  1 1/2       teaspoon  chives
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or more to taste
  2 1/2    tablespoons  butter
     1/4      teaspoon  celery salt
  1                     green onion -- diced
  5                     strips bacon -- diced, crisply
                        fried and drained
  1 1/4       teaspoon  fennel seeds

Wash and scrub potatoes, pat dry.  Rub potatoes with butter and place in baking pan, bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until done.  Remove from oven and cool slightly.  When the potatoes have cooled enough to touch, peel the potatoes.

While potatoes are cooling, add fennel seeds to milk and half-and-half, and scald the milk.  Scalding is heating milk at moderated temperature just until boiling point but not boiling and quickly remove from heat.  Scalding will keep the mixture from seperating.  Let milk cool slightly with fennel seeds in mixture.

When potatoes or cool enough to work with carefully cut 4 in half and spoon out cooked potato and place in a food processor.  Potatoes should measure out to 1 1/2 to 2 cups cooked potato.  Dice the 5th potato and set aside.  Save the potato skins for baked potato skins later.

To the cooked potato add sour cream, chives, salt, pepper, celery salt and 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon shredded cheddar cheese.  Strain the fennel seeds from warm milk and discard seeds. Pour milk mixture into food processor and processes 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until smooth.  Place mixture into a sauce pan add butter and diced potato stir frequently and simmer on very low setting for about 15 to 20 minutes.

When ready to serve ladle into individual bowls and garnish with cheddar cheese, bacon, and diced green onion.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COBBLER ===
  1                can  sliced apples - (20 oz) -- divided into
  1 1/2           cups  apple juice from the can of apples
  1                cup  drained apples
  2               cups  English walnuts -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  cinnamon -- plus
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  3         tablespoon  melted butter
     1/4           cup  white corn syrup
  1                cup  brown sugar
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  1              stick  butter -- chilled
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  1                     egg yolk
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Cobbler:  Please note you divide the can of apples into the apples and the juice.  You will have some apples left over.  You also may need to add some more apple juice to this.

In mixing bowl add all ingredients and stir well.  If you do not have enough apple juice from can of apples add a little water to make up the difference.  Set aside.

Cookie Topping for Cobbler:  This is easy to blend in a food processor.  Cut butter into four pieces and place in processor, add sugar, vanilla, and egg.  Process until blended.  Add flour, baking powder, and salt, blend dry ingredients until all is mixed well.  Should form a ball very quickly.  Remove from processor and place between waxed paper and chill just long enough so dough may be rolled out with out sticking to wax paper.

Spray a 8- by 11 1/2- by 2-inch baking pan with oil spray.  Pour walnut mixture in dish and cover with rolled out cookie dough topping.  Bake at 375 degrees 20 to 24 minutes, top should be golden brown.

Walnut cobbler should be served hot with crust-side down with a generous serving of your favorite vanilla ice cream on top.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  diced sweet onions
     1/4           cup  diced bell pepper
     1/4           cup  diced tomatoes -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  diced cooked lean ham
     3/4           cup  finely-shredded Cheddar cheese
                        = (reserve 1/4 cup for garnish)
     1/4           cup  diced lean bacon -- fried, drained
     1/3           cup  sliced small breakfast sausage links -- fried, drained
     1/3           cup  shredded roast beef
                        = (or diced roasted beef from the deli)
  3                     eggs - (to 4) -- beaten (1 cup)
     1/8           cup  water
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  butter

In a sauce pan on medium-low heat melt butter and add onions and bell peppers.  Stir until onions and pepper are soft but not browned.  Add diced ham and stir until the ham is limp and heated through.  Immediately remove from heat and set a side.

In a mixing bowl add eggs, water and salt beat and stir well.  Set aside.

Heat a 12-inch fry pan on medium-low heat, add a little oil (1 teaspoon) or spray with a non stick vegetable spray.  A non stick pan works great.  Place egg mixture in pan and sprinkle with onions, bell pepper, ham, tomato if you wish, sausage, bacon, and 1/2 of the roast beef, and 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese.  Place a lid on until omelet starts to set.  Immediately remove lid and fold omelet from the sides to the middle.  If this is difficult, fold in half, sprinkle with the rest of cheese and roast beef.

Serve with a side order of Picante Sauce or Sour Cream with a little diced green onion.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This is a great meaty omelet.  You can substitute deli roast beef in a bind.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  brownie mix
                        Mint Mousse -- (see below)
  1                cup  semi-sweet chocolate chips
     1/4           cup  milk, cream, or half and half
  1            package  Andes mints
                        === MINT MOUSSE ===
  1                cup  chopped Andes mints
                        = (better to use mostly green ones
                        for color)
  6                     eggs -- separated
     3/4           cup  heavy cream

Mix brownies according to package directions.  Pour into a lightly greased springform pan and bake according to package directions.

Mint Mousse:  In microwave, for about 15 seconds, melt the mints.

Set up a double boiler on the stove (best to use a metal bowl.)  Place egg yolks on top of double boiler and whisk using a wire whisk until pale yellow and frothy.  Add melted mints and mix until combined.  The mix will get stiff.

In a separate bowl, using a hand blender, whisk egg whites until stiff.  Fold the egg whites into the mint and egg yolk mixture a little bit at a time.  Next, whip up the heavy cream with a hand-held blender until thick.  Fold this a little at a time into the egg and chocolate mix.  If you like, you can add a few drops of green food coloring, but it's not necessary for taste.

Top the cooled brownie with the mousse mixture and leave to set in the refrigerator.

Next, heat the cream, milk, or half-and-half in a pan on the stove. (Non-stick pans work best.)  Add the chocolate chips and melt and continually stir over a low heat until you have a chocolate sauce.  Top the cooled pie with the chocolate sauce.  Decorate with Andes mints.  Also, if you wish, you can crush more Andes mints and when the pie is set and chilled, brush the sides with melted chocolate and press on the crushed mints.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTA ===
  1 3/4           cups  flour
  2        tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1              pinch  salt
  2                     extra-large eggs
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
                        === FILLING ===
  4               cups  whole milk ricotta cheese
  2               cups  heavy cream
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  grated orange zest
  2        tablespoons  Grand Marnier
  1              pinch  salt
  12            ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped

Combine the flour, cocoa, and salt in a bowl and make a well in the center.  Add the eggs and oil in the center of the well and mix with a fork to form the dough.  Knead the dough for 15 minutes until it is smooth and shiny, adding more flour if necessary to keep the dough from sticking.  Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for half an hour.

Roll the pasta out by hand or with a machine and cut into eight 4 1/2- by 11-inch strips.  Cook two strips at a time in boiling salted water.  Cook just 20 seconds after the water returns to a boil.  Plunge the noodles into cold water to stop the cooking.  When cooled, place on towels in a single layer to drain.

Combine all filling ingredients and mix until smooth.

To assemble:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees with the rack in the upper third of the oven.  Generously butter an 8- by 11- by 2-inch pan.  Alternate layers of noodles, cheese filling, and chocolate, ending with a cheese layer.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until the top is lightly colored.  Let the lasagna stand for 10 minutes to solidify, then serve warm.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  5          teaspoons  olive oil
  4             ounces  mushrooms -- thinly sliced
  2             ounces  sliced prosciutto
                        = (or thinly-sliced deli ham)
     3/4           cup  shredded Italian fontina cheese
  1              small  garlic clove -- thinly sliced
  2              large  plum tomatoes - (6 oz) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and slivered
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh basil leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place chicken breasts between two layers of wax paper and pound with a meat mallet to 1/4-thick cutlets.

Heat 2 teaspoons of the olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the mushrooms and sautÈ until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste; let cool.

Arrange one slice of prosciutto over each cutlet.  Sprinkle fontina cheese over prosciutto, dividing it equally.  Mound one quarter of sautÈed mushrooms in the center of each cutlet.  Fold the long sides of the cutlet toward the center, then roll up, enclosing the mushroom filling.

Tie the chicken rolls with kitchen twine and place them seam-side down on a small baking pan that has been lightly oiled.  Rub the chicken roll with 2 teaspoons of the olive oil and season with salt and black pepper to taste.  Bake for 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.  (Internal temperature should register 165 degrees when measured with a meat thermometer.)

Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and sautÈ until golden.  Add the tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes.  Stir in the basil and season with salt and black pepper to taste.

When the chicken is ready, remove the twine and slice each roll into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Fan the slices out on four individual dinner plates and serve each with a spoonful of the tomato-garlic sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  6        tablespoons  confectioner's sugar
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        === ITALIAN SPONGE CAKE ===
  5                     egg yolks
  5                     egg whites
  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  sifted cake flour

Vanilla Cream Filling:  Combine sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a saucepan.  Gradually add cold milk, stirring well.  Slowly stir in the scalded milk.  Stirring gently and constantly, rapidly bring mixture to boiling over direct heat and cook 3 minutes.  Pour into top of double boiler and place over simmering water.  Cover and cook about 12 minutes, stirring 3 or 4 times.  Vigorously stir about 3 tablespoons hot mixture into the eggs.  Immediately blend into mixture in double boiler.  Cook over simmering water 3 to 5 minutes.  Stir slowly so mixture cooks evenly.  Remove from heat and cool.  Stir in vanilla extract and chill.

Chocolate Cream Filling:  Add Unsweetened chocolate to 1 1/2 cups of milk and scald.  Combine sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a saucepan.  Gradually add cold milk, stirring well.  Slowly stir in the scalded milk.  Stirring gently and constantly, rapidly bring mixture to boiling over direct heat and cook 3 minutes.  Pour into top of double boiler and place over simmering water.  Cover and cook about 12 minutes, stirring 3 or 4 times.  Vigorously stir about 3 tablespoons hot mixture into eggs.  Immediately blend into mixture in double boiler.  Cook over simmering water 3 to 5 minutes.  Stir slowly so mixture cooks evenly.  Remove from heat and cool.  Stir in vanilla extract.  Chill.

Whipped Cream:  Beat whipping cream, 1 cup at a time, in a chilled 1-quart bowl using chilled beaters.  Beat until cream stands in peaks.  Put whipped cream into a large chilled bowl.  Fold or beat confectioner's sugar and vanilla extract into whipped cream until blended.

Italian Sponge Cake:  Combine egg yolks, 1/2 cup sugar, lemon juice, lemon peel, and vanilla extract.  Beat 3 to 4 minutes with an electric mixer on medium-high speed; set aside.  Add salt to egg white and beat until frothy.  Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar, beating constantly until stiff peaks are formed.  Gently fold egg yolk mixture into beaten egg whites.  Sift flour over the egg mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, gently folding until just blended after each addition.  Turn batter into  three 11- by 7- by 1 1/2-inch baking pans.  Bake at 325 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes, or until cake springs back when lightly touched or when a cake tester inserted comes out clean.  Invert and leave cake in pan until completely cooled.

Assembling Rum Cake:  Place one layer of the cake on serving dish and sprinkle with the Italian Brandy.  Spread half the vanilla cream.  Place the second layer of cake crust-side down and sprinkle with Rosolio.  Spread half the chocolate cream.  Place the third layer of cake crust-side down and sprinkle with Rum.  Cover the top of the cake with the remaining vanilla cream.  Cover the sides of the cake with the remaining chocolate cream.  Decorate the top and bottom edges with the whipped cream.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless skinless chicken breast -- (1/3" to 1/2" thick)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2               cups  flaked coconut
  1                cup  corn starch
     1/4           cup  flour
  2                     eggs -- beaten
     1/4           cup  water
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying
                        Rainforest Cafe's Honey Mustard Dressing -- (see recipe)

Trim chicken breasts so the pieces will measure 4 inches long and about 2 1/2 inches wide.  Sprinkle sugar and salt over chicken breast and place in a zip lock bag and marinate in refrigerator for 4 hours.

When chicken breasts are ready to be prepared, rinse lightly and drain.  Place coconut, corn starch, and flour in a bowl and mix well.  In separate bowl place beaten eggs and add water, blend well.  Have oil hot and ready to fry chicken breasts.

Dip chicken breast in egg wash and then place chicken breast in coconut mixture, coating well.  Carefully place chicken in hot oil and cook until lightly golden.  Remove and place on a paper towel.  When frying chicken do not crowd and keep a check on the oil so it does not burn.

The coconut chicken was served with the honey mustard on top of the chicken pieces, we have elected to serve the sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:    For presentation and tasty side compliment.  Slice a ripe pineapple in 1/8-inch pieces and cut the round slices in half.  Lightly sautÈ the pineapple in a non stick sauce pan that has been sprayed with a non stick spray just until heated through.  The pineapple will turn more intense yellow.  Serving fresh sautÈed pineapple is also great with a pork entrÈe.

Comments:    For presentation and tasty side compliment.  Slice a ripe pineapple in 1/8-inch pieces and cut the round slices in half.  Lightly sautÈ the pineapple in a non stick sauce pan that has been sprayed with a non stick spray just until heated through.  The pineapple will turn more intense yellow.  Serving fresh sautÈed pineapple is also great with a pork entrÈe.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === VEGETABLE MIX ===
  1                cup  red onion in 1/4" strips
  1                cup  red pepper in 1" x 1/4" strips
  1                cup  celery in 1/4" pieces
  1                cup  baby carrot slims
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FISH IN A BAG ===
  4                     sheets parchment paper
                        Butter -- melted
  2               cups  Vegetable Mix -- from above
  8                     strips fresh skinless fish - (2 1/2 oz ea)
                        Old Bay or Seafood seasoning
  4                     lemon wheels/ 1/4"-thick
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme

Vegetable Mix:  Mix vegetables and season with salt and pepper or Mrs. Dash vegetable seasoning.

Fish In A Bag:  Fold parchment paper in half short ways and crease.  Unfold parchment paper and brush completely with melted butter to the edges.  Place 1/2 cup vegetable mix in the center of the right half.

Brush melted butter on two 2.5-ounce fresh fish filets and shake on a generous coating of Old Bay or Seafood seasoning.  Place seasoned fish 1/2-inch apart on top of vegetable mix to allow for even cooking.  Place one lemon wheel and one sprig of thyme on fish.

Fold the left side of the parchment paper over the right side.  Crimp paper (like a pie crust) until bottom and top of the paper are completely sealed.  Brush top of parchment paper with melted butter to the edges to prevent bag from burning when cooked.  Repeat for each serving.

Place bags on a greased cookie sheet with an inverted buttered pie pan over each (to prevent paper from burning).  Bake at 350 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     lobster tails - (4 to 5 oz ea) -- in the shell
  12                    jumbo sea scallops -- side muscle removed
  1 1/4            cup  Lemon-Garlic Butter Sauce
  1         tablespoon  McCormick Season-All
  6               cups  cooked rice (a lightly seasoned pilaf)
  4                     lemon wedges
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsely
     1/2           cup  melted butter -- for dipping
  12                    metal skewers - (8" long)

Preheat oven or grill to 450 degrees.

Cut each lobster tail completely in half lengthwise and remove the vein.  Gently lift the lobster meat from the shell, leaving meat attached at tail end, and place meat back into shell.  (This makes it easier to eat the lobster after it is cooked.)

Wrap each lobster tail, including the shell, around one scallop, similar to wrapping bacon around a filet mignon.

To skewer, gently pierce the base of the tail fins, passing the skewer through the scallop and piercing through the other end of the tail.  Leave approximately 1 to 2 inches at the end of the skewer to prevent chop from sliding off during cooking.

Lightly brush the topside of each lobsterchop with the Lemon-Garlic Butter.  (A light coating will prevent "flare-ups" when grilling.)  Sprinkle the lobsterchops with Season-All, place on a wax-paper lined tray and refrigerate until ready to grill.

Place lobsterchops, meat-side down, on preheated grill.  Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, rotating lobsterchops 90 degrees after 2 minutes.  Turn lobsterchops over and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes or until the lobster and the scallop have reached an internal temperature of 150 degrees.  Lightly brush the meat side of each lobsterchop with Lemon-Garlic Butter just before removing from the grill.

For each plate, place 3 lobsterchops on a bed of your favorite rice accompanied by a small cup of melted butter and a lemon wedge.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
