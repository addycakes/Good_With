  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2                onion -- peeled
  2          teaspoons  cooking oil
  1                     red beet - (5 to 6 oz) -- peeled, quartered
     1/4                cabbage head - (abt 8 oz) -- rinsed
  3               cups  beef broth
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  3        tablespoons  sour cream or plain yogurt
                        Coarsely-chopped fennel leaves or chives -- (optional)

Shred the onion in a food processor fitted with the shredding disk.  Don't clean the bowl and blade until all vegetables have been processed.  Transfer the onion to a large micro-safe bowl; toss with the oil.  Cover loosely and microwave at medium-high for 2 minutes. 
Shred the beet in the processor.  Add to the onion and microwave at medium-high for 3 minutes. 
Cut the cabbage into chunks and shred in the processor.  Add to the onion/beet, along with the broth.  Microwave, loosely covered, on high for 3 minutes.  Test the soup -- the vegetables should be cooked through but not mushy.  If needed, microwave up to 2 minutes longer in 30-second increments.  Taste for salt.  Amount needed depends on saltiness of the broth.  Stir in the vinegar. 
Ladle into bowls and top each with a dollop of sour cream or yogurt.  If you wish, garnish with coarsely chopped fresh fennel fronds or chives. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments :  Any leftover borscht is excellent served cold the next day.

                          3 Ingredient Corn Soup

Recipe By     :Marion Cunningham
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  corn kernels - (abt 9 ears fresh corn)
  4 1/2           cups  milk
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste

Cutting the kernels off the cob:  Pull the outer leaves and silky threads off each ear of corn. 
Put a large piece of waxed paper on cutting board. 
Hold each ear of corn, large end upright, on the cutting board and, using a sharp knife, cut the kernels off the cob from top to bottom. 
Pick up the ends of the waxed paper and, using it as a sling, transfer the corn to a heavy-bottomed saucepan. 
Making the soup:  Add 3 cups of milk and the salt to the saucepan.  Turn the heat to medium-high and stir often until the milk begins to boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, so the milk simmers, but does not boil.  Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring every few minutes. 
Finishing the soup:  If you want a crunchy corn soup, just add the remaining 1 1/2 cups milk, taste and add more salt if needed; heat and serve. 
If you want creamy corn soup, pour the soup into a food processor and process until the corn is pureed (the kernels will be broken down into small bits, or blended completely into the milk, depending on how powerful your processor is).  Pour the soup back into the saucepan and add the remaining 1 1/2 cups milk.  Taste and add more salt if needed; heat and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This easy summer soup can be either creamy or crunchy, depending on whether you puree it or not.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === QUICK SCALLOP STOCK ===
  1              pound  sea scallops -- connective tissue
                        removed and discarded
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  oil
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  water
  1              small  onion -- sliced
  1                     carrot -- sliced
  1                     celery stalk -- sliced
  3                     parsley sprigs
  1                     bay leaf -- broken in half
  6                     black peppercorns
                        === CHOWDER ===
  4             ounces  thick-cut sliced bacon -- cut in 1/4" cubes
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2               cups  chopped leeks, white and light green parts -- (abt 2 large)
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
  1         tablespoon  flour
  1 1/2           cups  half-and-half
     3/4           cup  1% or 2% milk
     3/4         pound  Yukon Gold or red boiling potatoes -- peel, cut 1/2" dice
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1               dash  cayenne pepper
     3/4         pound  very thin asparagus -- tough ends cut off
                        and discarded
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped parsley, preferably flat leaf

Quick Scallop Stock:  Cut scallops horizontally into 1/4-inch-thick rounds and pat dry.  Heat butter and oil until hot in heavy, medium-size nonreactive skillet (cast iron does not work well).  Add scallops and saute, turning several times, until scallops are opaque and barely golden, about 2 minutes.  Remove scallops to plate and reserve. 
Add wine and water to skillet and scrape any brown bits off skillet bottom.  Add onion, carrot, celery, parsley, bay leaf and peppercorns.  Bring mixture to simmer and lower heat.  Pour any juices from reserved scallops into skillet.  Simmer stock, uncovered, 20 minutes. 
Drain stock through large strainer into bowl and press down on vegetables with spoon to extract as much liquid as possible.  Stock can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool, cover and refrigerate.  Cover and refrigerate cooked scallops separately. 
Chowder:  Blanch bacon in boiling water to cover 5 minutes.  Drain and pat dry. 
Heat butter in 3- or 4-quart, heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Add bacon and saute, stirring, until crisp.  Add leeks and thyme and stir and cook 2 minutes.  Sprinkle flour over mixture and cook 1 minute more. 
Heat half-and-half and milk until just hot.  Gradually stir in Quick Scallop Stock and hot milk mixture.  Add potatoes, salt, black pepper, nutmeg and cayenne pepper and lower heat to simmer.  Simmer chowder, stirring often, until potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes.  Chowder can be prepared ahead to this point.  Cool, cover and refrigerate. 
Cut tops from asparagus spears and cut stalks diagonally into 1/2-inch pieces.  Reheat chowder, stirring constantly, over medium heat and add asparagus and cook until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add reserved scallops and cook 1 minute more.  Season to taste with salt, black pepper and nutmeg. 
Ladle chowder into 4 or 5 shallow soup bowls.  Garnish each with chopped parsley. 
This recipe yields 4 to 5 servings.

Quick Scallop Stock:  Cut scallops horizontally into 1/4-inch-thick rounds and pat dry.  Heat butter and oil until hot in heavy, medium-size nonreactive skillet (cast iron does not work well).  Add scallops and saute, turning several times, until scallops are opaque and barely golden, about 2 minutes.  Remove scallops to plate and reserve. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add wine and water to skillet and scrape any brown bits off skillet bottom.  Add onion, carrot, celery, parsley, bay leaf and peppercorns.  Bring mixture to simmer and lower heat.  Pour any juices from reserved scallops into skillet.  Simmer stock, uncovered, 20 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain stock through large strainer into bowl and press down on vegetables with spoon to extract as much liquid as possible.  Stock can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool, cover and refrigerate.  Cover and refrigerate cooked scallops separately. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Chowder:  Blanch bacon in boiling water to cover 5 minutes.  Drain and pat dry. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat butter in 3- or 4-quart, heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Add bacon and saute, stirring, until crisp.  Add leeks and thyme and stir and cook 2 minutes.  Sprinkle flour over mixture and cook 1 minute more. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat half-and-half and milk until just hot.  Gradually stir in Quick Scallop Stock and hot milk mixture.  Add potatoes, salt, black pepper, nutmeg and cayenne pepper and lower heat to simmer.  Simmer chowder, stirring often, until potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes.  Chowder can be prepared ahead to this point.  Cool, cover and refrigerate. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut tops from asparagus spears and cut stalks diagonally into 1/2-inch pieces.  Reheat chowder, stirring constantly, over medium heat and add asparagus and cook until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add reserved scallops and cook 1 minute more.  Season to taste with salt, black pepper and nutmeg. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Ladle chowder into 4 or 5 shallow soup bowls.  Garnish each with chopped parsley. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 5 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  chicken or vegetable broth
  3               cups  asparagus ends
                        Coarse or kosher salt
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chopped mint leaves -- (about 3 sprigs)
                        Grated zest (colored part) of 1/2 lemon

Add the milk and cream and heat until small bubbles form on the sides of the pan and the soup is steaming.  Season to taste with salt.  Soup can be served hot at this point, sprinkled with lemon zest.  Or cool soup completely, then chill in the refrigerator.  Stir in the chopped mint and serve cold.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ORANGE CREME FRAICHE ===
     1/2           cup  creme fraiche
  2        tablespoons  fresh orange juice
     1/4      teaspoon  minced orange peel
                        === SOUP ===
  3             pounds  asparagus
  5               cups  hot vegetable broth
  1         tablespoon  light olive oil
  2               cups  yellow onion -- sliced thin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                     baking potato -- peeled, sliced
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice

Orange Creme Fraiche:  Combine creme fraiche, orange juice and orange peel.  (Makes about 1/2 cup) 
Soup:  Break off woody ends of asparagus and add them to vegetable stock.  Cut remaining asparagus on diagonal into 2-inch pieces. 
Heat olive oil in soup pot and add onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pinch pepper.  Saute over medium heat until onion is soft, about 5 minutes.  Add potato and 1 cup vegetable broth, cover and cook until potato is soft, about 10 minutes. 
Reserve 1/2 cup asparagus tips for garnish and add rest to soup with 1/2 teaspoon salt and remaining 4 cups vegetable broth.  Cook uncovered over medium heat until asparagus is tender, about 15 minutes. 
Puree soup in blender or food processor, return to pot and add orange juice.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Bring lightly salted water to boil, add reserved asparagus tips and cook until just tender, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Rinse under cold water to stop cooking unless soup is to be served immediately.  Garnish each serving with few asparagus tips and swirl of Orange Creme Fraiche. 
This recipe yields 2 quarts or 8 servings. 
Each (2-cup) serving with 1 tablespoon Orange Creme Fraiche: 148 calories; 673 mg sodium; 19 mg cholesterol; 8 grams fat; 17 grams carbohydrates; 6 grams protein; 1.75 grams fiber.

              Beef Stew With Parsnips, Shallots And Rosemary

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pounds  beef bottom round -- fat removed,
                        cut into 1" pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh rosemary
  2        tablespoons  olive oil - (to 4 tbspns)
  4               cups  red wine
  3             pounds  shallots -- peeled, halved
                        (or quartered if very large)
  8               cups  low-salt beef broth
  3             pounds  parsnips
  2             pounds  red new potatoes -- unpeeled

Season the meat with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with a bit of the rosemary. 
Heat a large, heavy stockpot over medium-high heat.  When warm, add enough oil to fully cover the bottom of the pan and heat until almost smoking. 
Working in batches, add the meat without crowding the pan.  Allow the meat to brown on one side, then turn and brown on the other sides, turning as necessary.  When the cubes are nicely browned, remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside. 
Deglaze the pan with half of the wine, scraping the bottom of the pan to dislodge all the browned bits.  Boil until the liquid has almost evaporated. 
Reduce heat to medium.  Add the shallots and remaining rosemary and brown slightly, about 3 minutes.  Add the remaining wine and simmer until the alcohol evaporates, about 2 minutes. 
Return the meat to the pan.  Add the broth, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 50 minutes, until the meat is quite tender. 
While the meat cooks, peel the parsnips and roll-cut into even bite-size pieces (place parsnip on a cutting board and cut off an end on the bias.  Roll the parsnip 180 degrees and cut again on the bias.  Repeat.) 
Cut the new potatoes into similar-size pieces -- quartered if large, or leave whole if very small. 
When the meat has cooked 50 minutes, add the parsnips and potatoes.  Cover and cook for 20 minutes, until tender. 
This recipe yields 12 servings. 
Comments:  In this Now & Later beef stew recipe, sweet parsnips balance the acidity of a healthy dose of red wine.  When preparing a long-simmering stew like this, your main goal should be to cut the meat and vegetables into uniform pieces.  They cook more evenly that way, and they also look a whole lot better on the plate. 
Though supermarkets offer cubed stew meat, you'll have a cleaner tasting, less fatty stew if you buy bottom round and cut it yourself.

                     Beer And Cheese Soup With Apples

Recipe By     :Greg Patent and Dorothy Hinshaw Patent, "A Is For Apple"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  1                cup  finely-chopped onions
  2             medium  apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and diced (about 2 cups)
  1                cup  beer
  2               cups  nonfat or whole milk
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour -- (spoon lightly into
                        the cup and level off)
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  Tabasco -- or to taste (optional)
  2               cups  shredded extra-sharp or sharp cheddar
                        cheese -- (8 oz)
                        Paprika

Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Stir in the onions, cover, and cook for about 5 minutes, until onions are almost tender but not browned.  Add the apples and cook, covered, until the apples are tender but still have a little crunch, about 5 to 8 minutes. 
Meanwhile, combine the beer and milk in a heavy saucepan and bring to almost boiling over medium-high heat.  Remove from heat and set aside. 
Add the flour, 1 teaspoon salt and Tabasco, if using, to the apple mixture and stir almost constantly over medium-high heat for 2 minutes to cook the flour.  Remove the pan from heat and add the beer mixture all at once.  Stir gently with a wooden spoon, scraping bottom of pan to release any cooked flour. 
Return mixture to medium-high heat and bring to a simmer, stirring frequently.  Cook for 2 minutes (soup will thicken), then lower heat to medium and gradually add the cheese, stirring until each addition is melted and soup is smooth. 
Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt or Tabasco if necessary.  Ladle into bowls, sprinkle lightly with paprika and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 
Comments:  A crisp apple like Granny Smith gives this creamy soup a contrasting texture.  Use a light-tasting beer, like Corona.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  thinly-sliced onions
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  2        tablespoons  real butter
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1                can  tomato juice or V-8 - (46 oz)
  1                cup  canned beef consomme -- undiluted
  1                     beef bouillon cube
                        (or 1 tspn instant bouillon )
  1                     bay leaf -- (optional)
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water or consomme
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  8                     ovenproof soup bowls
  8             slices  French bread -- toasted
  8             ounces  shredded Gruyere or aged Swiss cheese

In a large kettle or Dutch oven, saute sliced onions with garlic in butter and oil (melted and mixed, so butter won't burn).  Saute slowly and thoroughly, stirring frequently, until onions are tender; moderate heat to caramelize the natural sugars in the onions after 15 or 20 minutes, without overbrowning the garlic or onions. 
Stir in tomato juice, beef consomme, bouillon cube or granules, the bay leaf and basil.  Bring to a boil, crushing the bouillon cube with mixing spoon as soon as possible and stirring well.  Add no salt, but a little pepper or hot sauce is optional. 
Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.  Increase heat and stir in the dissolved cornstarch.  Return to simmer for about 10 minutes.  This isn't enough cornstarch to thicken this much liquid, but it adds a gloss and some body to it.  Fish out the bay leaf and discard.  Stir in the fresh parsley and ladle into the ovenproof soup bowls or crocks. 
Have broiler heated, with oven rack only slightly above middle of oven, not too close to the red-hot broiler unit. 
Top soup with toasted bread slice per bowl and sprinkle generously with cheese.  Broil 2 minutes or until cheese melts.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1             medium  onion -- diced (abt 1 1/2 cups)
  2                     celery stalks -- diced (abt 1 cup)
  2                     green onions -- minced
  1                bag  brown lentils - (16 oz) -- rinsed
                        under cold running water
  2          teaspoons  Cajun seasoning blend
  10              cups  water
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  salt

In a large kettle, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the sausage, green pepper, onion, celery and green onion and cook over medium to medium-low heat for 10 to 12 minutes.  Vegetables should "sweat" not brown.  Adjust heat lower if vegetables start to brown. 
Add the lentils, Cajun seasoning blend, water, diced tomatoes garlic powder and thyme leaves.  Stir well.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and cover.  Cook for 1 1/2 hours, or until lentils are soft.  Add more water if necessary, if it cooks away.  Stir in salt.  Serve hot. 
This recipe yields 12 servings. 
Comments:  Aromatic and delicious, this recipe for spicy Cajun Lentil Stew will satisfy your cravings for a full-flavored winter meal that isn't loaded in fat.  This vegetable-rich stew contains less than 5 grams of fat per serving, yet it tastes rich and meaty from a combination of smoked sausage and brown lentils. 
This chunky stew is plenty spicy too -- if you like food that tastes milder, add just one teaspoon of Cajun seasoning spices instead of the two teaspoons called for in the recipe.  Cajun seasoning blends are available in the spice aisle of most supermarkets.  When shopping for Cajun spices or any seasoning blend, buy the smallest quantity you can unless you plan to use it often.  Spices lose their potency in a matter of months.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  olive oil
  1 1/4         pounds  eggplant -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  10            ounces  celery - (abt 5 stalks) -- diced
  1           teaspoon  chopped unsalted anchovies
  1           teaspoon  capers -- drained, rinsed,
                        and dried
  1           teaspoon  chopped gherkins
  3             ounces  diced black olives
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  3        tablespoons  white or red wine vinegar
  1                cup  tomato sauce (homemade or canned)

Have ready two plates lined with paper towels. 
In a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat, heat about 1 cup oil.  Add the eggplant and fry until slightly softened, about 1 minute.  (Do not crowd the pan; you may have to fry the eggplant in batches.)  With a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the eggplant to the paper towels to drain. 
Repeat the procedure with the celery. 
In a medium saucepan over low heat, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil.  Add the anchovies and cook until they melt into the oil, about 2 minutes.  Add the capers, gherkins, olives, sugar and vinegar and cook until the vinegar evaporates, about 4 minutes.  Add the tomato sauce and simmer for 3 minutes.  Add the eggplant and celery and simmer for 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat; set aside to cool. 
This recipe yields about 4 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  unsalted butter - (6 tbspns)
  1              large  yellow onion -- chopped
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh ginger root
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  7               cups  vegetable stock or broth (preferably
                        low-sodium)
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1 1/2         pounds  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1              Pinch  curry powder

Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              small  red bell peppers
  2              small  garlic cloves
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  tomato paste
  1         thin slice  firm stale white bread -- crusts trimmed,
                        torn into small pieces
  1 1/4           cups  diced red tomatoes
  2 1/3           cups  tomato juice
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
  1 1/2      teaspoons  olive oil
     1/3           cup  diced celery
     1/3           cup  chopped red onions
     1/3           cup  diced cucumber
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
     3/4      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped parsley
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CUCUMBER-CILANTRO YOGURT ===
     3/4           cup  plain yogurt
  1         tablespoon  chopped cilantro
     1/3           cup  diced cucumber
                        Hot pepper sauce such as Tabasco -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === FOR SERVING ===
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro

To roast the peppers:  Preheat the broiler.  Broil the red peppers on all sides until the skins are charred and blistered.  Using metal tongs, transfer the peppers to a large stainless-steel bowl.  Cover with aluminum foil and seal tightly.  Let cool completely.  Peel and core the peppers, taking care to remove all of the seeds; coarsely chop the peppers.  (The chopped, charred peppers can be made a day in advance; refrigerate in a covered storage container.) 
For the gazpacho:  On a cutting board, mash the garlic cloves with the salt to create a paste.  Set aside. 
In a blender, combine the red peppers, tomato paste, bread, 1/2 of the tomatoes, 1/2 of the tomato juice and the oil and process on high speed until the solids are pureed, about 1 minute. 
Pour the contents of the blender into a nonreactive bowl; stir in the remaining tomatoes and tomato juice along with the celery, onions, cucumber, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and parsley.  Blend in the garlic-salt paste, mixing well.  Season to taste with the pepper.  Cover tightly and chill thoroughly for at least 4 hours or up to 8 hours. 
For the cucumber-cilantro yogurt:  In a medium nonreactive bowl, blend together the yogurt, cilantro, cucumber and hot pepper sauce.  Season to taste with the salt.  Chill the yogurt mixture for 30 minutes or up to 3 hours. 
To serve:  Stir the chopped cilantro into the chilled soup, ladle the soup into serving bowls and garnish with a dollop of the cucumber-cilantro yogurt mixture. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Charred red peppers add a mellow and sweet-smoky edge to this soup.

     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  3             pounds  boneless beef chuck -- cut into 1" cubes
  1 3/4           cups  finely-diced onion
  1           teaspoon  chopped garlic
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  tomato puree
  4               cups  beef broth
  2                     bay leaves
  2            pinches  dried thyme
  2            pinches  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
  6                     celery ribs -- cut large pieces
  2 3/4           cups  cut carrots in large pieces
  1              large  red bell pepper
  1            package  small pearl onions - (8 oz) -- peeled
  1                cup  diced tomatoes
  1 2/3           cups  frozen green peas
  1         tablespoon  Tabasco sauce

Heat oil in a large pot until very hot.  Add beef; brown well, stirring frequently.  Do not crowd beef in pot; if necessary, brown beef in batches. 
Add onions and garlic; cook until lightly browned.  Sprinkle flour into pot; stir to combine with fat, making a roux.  Cook until roux is lightly browned. 
Stir in tomato puree and stock.  Continue to stir until sauce thickens.  Add bay leaves, thyme and black pepper. 
Reduce heat to low; cover pot.  Cook until meat is tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Stir and check occasionally to keep mixture from scorching. 
While meat is cooking, bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil.  Add celery, carrots, red bell pepper and onions.  Cook until vegetables are tender.  Drain. 
When the meat is tender, add cooked vegetables, diced tomatoes, peas and Tabasco to stew.  Heat through.  Remove and discard bay leaves.  Serve hot. 
Miner's beef stew can be served in a "boule," a round loaf of bread that has been hollowed out. 
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

             Chicken And Sweet Pepper Soup With Mini-Ravioli

Recipe By     :Marcie Ver Ploeg, "Chicken Soup"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         pound  skinless boneless chicken breasts -- cut into 3/4" cubes
  2               cups  frozen pepper stir-fry (red, green and
                        yellow bell peppers and onions) - (8 oz)
  1                can  chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz)
  4 1/2         ounces  fresh cheese mini-ravioli - (1/2 pkg)
  1                jar  roasted red peppers - (6 oz)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
                        (or 3/4 tspn dried basil)

In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add chicken and frozen vegetables and cook, tossing, until chicken is white on outside and vegetables are thawed, 2 to 3 minutes. 
Pour chicken broth over chicken and vegetables.  Bring to a boil, add ravioli and cook, stirring gently, until ravioli are just tender, 4 to 5 minutes. 
Meanwhile, drain roasted peppers and puree in a food processor or blender. 
Stir basil into soup.  Ladle into bowls, dividing ravioli evenly and spoon a dollop of roasted pepper puree on top. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  With two top-notch, cook's-helper ingredients frozen stir-fry peppers and fresh mini-ravioli (usually found in the dairy section of the supermarket) this colorful meal in a bowl will be ready in minutes.  To substitute frozen or larger ravioli, simply follow the cooking times on the package.

  1              pound  andouille sausage -- cut 1/4" slices
  1               pint  oysters with their liquor

Season the hen well with salt and cayenne pepper.  Warm chicken broth in a sauce pan.  In a heavy black iron pot, make a dark roux by slowly browning the oil and flour, stirring constantly. 
When roux is the color of a pecan, add the onions, green bell pepper and celery; cook until vegetables are wilted, about 10 to 15 minutes. 
Add warmed chicken broth to vegetable mixture.  Add chicken.  Add bay leaves and thyme.  Cook over medium heat for 1 hour.  Add andouille and cook for at least another hour or until hen is tender.  Check seasonings.  A few minutes before serving, add oysters and their liquor; simmer just until oysters curl.  If gumbo becomes too thick during cooking, simply add more chicken broth or water. 
This recipe yields 10 servings. 
Comments:  Here is a recipe from Marcelle Bienvenu's wonderful cookbook "Who's Your Mama, Are You Catholic, and Can You Make a Roux?"  Bienvenu says her father once told her the roux should cook as long as it took to drink two beers.  Not being a beer drinker, she adjusted the time.  She cooks the roux as long as it takes to play two record albums.  You'll have to make your own adjustments for CDs and tapes.

Recipe By     :Dave Owens
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1                cup  sliced peeled shallots
  2             pounds  green peas (fresh or frozen)
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
  4               cups  vegetable stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  sour cream
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh dill
  2          teaspoons  cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  diced carrot in 1/8" cubes
  9                     snow peas -- cut into
                        matchstick-size pieces
  1         tablespoon  truffle oil

Heat olive oil in heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add shallots; saute until tender and translucent.  Do not let brown.  Add peas, thyme and stock.  Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. 
Cook until peas are just tender and bright green, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Strain, reserving liquid. 
Remove thyme sprig from solids.  Puree solids in a blender with just enough liquid to make a smooth puree. 
Push puree through a sieve until all that remains are the shells of the peas and perhaps some of the shallot. 
Add some of the remaining liquid to adjust the consistency of the soup; it should cling to a spoon.  Save any remaining liquid for another use. 
Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste; let chill.  Combine sour cream, dill, vinegar and salt and pepper to taste; chill. 
Before serving soup, check seasoning and consistency.  Ladle into bowls; garnish with sour cream mixture, carrot, snow peas and a drizzle of truffle oil. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Chinese Chicken Soup With Won Ton Noodles

Recipe By     :Melanie Barnard, "365 More Ways to Cook Chicken"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  chicken broth preferably reduced-sodium
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  grated fresh ginger
  2               cups  packaged fresh or frozen mixed
                        oriental vegetables
  6                     won ton skins -- cut into thin strips
  1                cup  thinly-sliced cooked chicken
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onions

In a large saucepan, bring broth, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger and oriental vegetables to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until vegetables are just tender, about 5 minutes. 
Add won ton skins and chicken.  Cook 2 minutes.  Stir in green onions and serve at once. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Instead of filled won tons, the won ton skins and other ingredients are added separately here to make a soup that is really quick and easy.  Any brand or combination of frozen oriental vegetables will work nicely.

In a large saucepan, bring broth, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger and oriental vegetables to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until vegetables are just tender, about 5 minutes.

Add won ton skins and chicken.  Cook 2 minutes.  Stir in green onions and serve at once.

<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Instead of filled won tons, the won ton skins and other ingredients are added separately here to make a soup that is really quick and easy.  Any brand or combination of frozen oriental vegetables will work nicely.

Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/8           cup  diced turkey bacon
  2               cups  diced onions
  1                cup  diced celery
  1                cup  sliced scallions
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3               cups  diced potatoes
  1                can  reduced-sodium vegetable or chicken broth -- (14 1/2 oz) defatted
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     bay leaf

In a soup pot over medium-high heat, saute bacon 5 minutes until browned.  Add onions, celery, scallions, and garlic.  Cook 5 minutes, stirring often; do not brown.  Add potatoes, broth, mustard, thyme, pepper, and bay leaf.  Mix well. 
Bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 10 minutes until potatoes are tender.  Remove bay leaf.  Use this base in the recipes that follow. 
This recipe yields 6 cups. 
Tom's Chowder Tips:  Want a thicker broth?  Forget the fatty butter and flour base.  Instead, puree a cup of vegetables with broth in a blender. 
For milk-based chowder, heat the milk separately and add just before serving to keep the milk from curding. 
Tom's secret ingredients:  Stir in some mustard for a flavor boost.  Dijon, yellow, deli, and German are all equally good. 
Instant Chowders: 
Potato Chowder:  Add 3 cups hot low-fat (1%) milk to the chowder base. 
Tomato Chowder:  Add a 15-ounce can of chopped tomatoes and 2 cups chicken or vegetable broth to the chowder base.  Heat through. 
These recipes yield ?? servings. 
Comments:  I like to use turkey bacon; it gives chowder a nice smoky flavor.  But you can replace it with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Refrigerate chowder base for up to two days, or freeze for future use.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unbleached flour
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  2          teaspoons  salt
  3        tablespoons  chili powder -- plus
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
  2             pounds  lean beef -- trimmed of all
                        visible fat, cut into 1" cubes
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  2             medium  onions -- sliced
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  28            ounces  canned whole tomatoes -- broken into pieces
  1         tablespoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground cloves
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2              small  potatoes -- chopped
  3             medium  carrots -- chopped

In a large bowl, mix the flour, paprika, salt, and 1 teaspoon of the chili powder.  Add the beef and mix until well coated. 
Warm the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add the beef and cook, stirring frequently, until well browned.  Add the onions and garlic.  Cook for 5 minutes or until the onions are soft and translucent. 
Add the tomatoes (with juice), cinnamon, cloves, red-pepper flakes, and the remaining 3 tablespoons of the chili powder.  Cover and simmer for 2 hours.  Add the potatoes and carrots.  Cook for about 45 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  This stew doesn't take long to prepare but does require a longer cooking time.  Try this on the weekend while you're doing other chores around the house.  It freezes so well, I always make more than is needed for one meal.

                       Chunky Tomato And Bacon Soup

Recipe By     :Kim Rizk
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  thick-sliced bacon (4 or 5 strips) -- coarsely chopped
  1              large  onion -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  3 1/2         pounds  ripe tomatoes -- cored, (or canned
                        tomatoes) coarsely chopped (8 cups
                        chopped), with their juice
                        Coarse (kosher) salt -- to taste
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1              small  fresh thyme sprig handful
     1/2           cup  milk
  1                cup  heavy (whipping) cream
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Fresh thyme leaves -- for garnish

Combine the bacon, onion and butter in a large heavy-bottomed soup pot, and saute over medium-high heat until the bacon is crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. 
Stir in the tomatoes (juice and all), and scrape up the browned bits clinging to the bottom of the pot.  Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. 
Add the stock.  Working over the soup pot, strip the thyme leaves and the tender portions of the stems into the soup.  Continue to simmer, partially covered, until the soup is fragrant and slightly thickened, about 25 minutes.  Stir the soup occasionally. 
Stir in the milk and cream, and warm the soup over low heat for 5 minutes.  Then season with additional salt, if needed, and pepper to taste.  Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with the extra thyme, and serve hot. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  This tomato soup recipe is from Princeton Township, NJ author Kim Rizk, author of "Hay Day Country Market Cookbook" (Workman, $13.95).  If you like chunky tomato soup, it's a winner.  It can be made with fresh or canned tomatoes.

                           Classic Ratatouille

Recipe By     :Julia Child
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  eggplant
     1/2         pound  zucchini
  1           teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  olive oil - (to 7 tbspns) -- divided
     1/2         pound  thinly-sliced yellow onions -- (abt 1 1/2 cups)
  1                     green bell pepper - (to 2) -- sliced (about 1 cup)
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled and mashed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  firm ripe tomatoes - (abt 2 large)
  3        tablespoons  minced parsley

Peel the eggplant and cut into lengthwise slices 3/8-inch thick, about 3 inches long and 1-inch wide.  Scrub the zucchini, trim off the ends, and cut the zucchini into slices about the same size as the eggplant.  Place the vegetables in a glass or stainless steel mixing bowl, toss with 1 teaspoon salt and let stand for 30 minutes.  Drain, then pat slices dry on paper towels. 
In a large skillet, heat about 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high to high heat.  A few at a time so you don't overcrowd the pan, saute the eggplant and zucchini slices for about 1 minute on each side until lightly browned, adding more olive oil (for a total of 4 tablespoons) as needed.  Set vegetables aside. 
Reduce heat.  In the same skillet, cook the onions and bell peppers slowly in 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil for about 10 minutes, until tender but not browned.  Stir in the garlic and season to taste with salt and pepper. 
While onions and peppers are cooking, peel tomatoes by dipping in boiling water or holding over a gas burner, then shocking in cold water.  Remove skins, cut out stem and cut tomatoes in half to squeeze out seeds and excess juice.  Slice tomato pulp into 3/8-inch strips.  Lay the tomato strips over the onions and peppers.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover skillet and cook over medium-low to low heat for 5 minutes, or until tomatoes have begun to render their juice.  Uncover, baste tomatoes with the juices, raise heat and boil for several minutes, until juice has almost entirely evaporated. 
In a heavy Dutch oven or heatproof casserole, place a third of the tomato/onion mixture in the bottom and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the parsley.  Arrange half of the eggplant and zucchini on top, then top with half the remaining tomato mixture and parsley.  Top with the remaining eggplant and zucchini slices and finish with the remaining tomato mixture and parsley. 
Cover the casserole or Dutch oven and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes.  Uncover, tip casserole and baste with the rendered juices.  Correct seasoning if necessary.  Raise heat slightly and cook, uncovered, for about 15 minutes, until juices have evaporated, leaving a spoon or two of the flavored olive oil from the eggplant.  Watch heat and don't let the bottom of the vegetables scorch. 
Serve hot, room temperature or cold. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  Julia Child's versions of classic dishes often seem to have too many steps -- until you get to the end and realize that her way is worth it.  In this classic ratatouille,, the eggplant and zucchini are quickly browned, then the onions, tomatoes and green peppers are cooked together before the whole thing is recombined.  The result is lovely ratatouille -- meaty slices of vegetables with a soft backdrop of tomatoes and onions.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  ripe stone fruit -- washed
     1/4           cup  lemon juice -- or to taste
  8               cups  water
     3/4           cup  sugar -- or to taste
  2                     whole cloves
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1                     three-inch strip lemon zest
  1 1/2    tablespoons  arrowroot or cornstarch
     1/2           cup  white wine
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  creme fraiche or plain yogurt -- (to 3/4 cup)

Pit the fruit, cutting larger fruit into quarters (pit cherries over a bowl to catch juices and add them to the pot).  Remove 1/2 cup fruit, chop and reserve for garnish, tossing with a little lemon juice.  Refrigerate in a covered container. 
Combine the remaining fruit and the water in a nonreactive pan.  Bring to a boil, then simmer until the fruit is very soft, 15 to 25 minutes, depending on fruit. 
Cool slightly, then pass through a food mill or puree in a blender or processor.  Return to the pan; add the sugar, cloves, cinnamon and lemon zest.  Bring to a near boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 8 minutes.  Remove the whole spices and lemon zest. 
Dissolve the arrowroot or cornstarch in a little cold water.  Add to the simmering soup and cook, stirring, until the soup is clear and lightly thickened. 
Add the wine and return to a simmer for 2 minutes; do not let the soup boil. 
Remove from heat and add the optional almond extract and lemon juice to taste.  Add more sugar, if desired. 
Transfer the soup to a covered container and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours or overnight.  Taste for sweetness and acidity, adding more sugar and/or lemon juice if desired.  Stir in the reserved chopped fruit. 
Serve in small bowls or large cups, swirling about 1 tablespoon creme fraiche or sour cream into each serving just until streaked. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  In Germany and Austria, this soup is most commonly made with cherries, preferably a mixture of sweet and sour cherries, but apricots, peaches and plums also work well.

                        Parsley sprigs

Boil the potato in 2 cups of water until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain, save the broth, and set the potato aside. 
Melt the butter in a soup pot on medium heat.  Add the leek, cooking sherry if using, mustard, saffron if using, salt and pepper.  Saute for 5 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon.  Add the potato, its broth, the pumpkin, carrot, half of the corn, and 2 cups of water, and stir. 
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. 
In a blender or a bowl, blend or mash half the soup with the milk until thick and silky smooth.  Return the blended soup to the pot, and stir.  Add the remaining corn and stir. 
Ladle into bowls and garnish with cheese and parsley. 
Alternately, ladle into crocks or baked pumpkins or squash shells, garnish, place on a cookie sheet, and bake at 400 degrees until bubbling and lightly browned on top. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                             Creamy Corn Soup

Recipe By     :Molly Lopez
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  6                     scallions -- minced (trim the
                        "hairy" tip, and cut the white and
                        lower half of green part in tiny pieces)
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped small
  2               cups  corn
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried basil
  1                cup  vegetable broth or the strained liquid
                        from the can of corn
  1                cup  milk

Put a medium-sized saucepan on the stove and turn on the heat to low.  Use a dinner knife to cut 1 tablespoon butter from the stick.  Put the butter into the saucepan and push it around until it melts. 
Add the scallions, celery, corn, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon basil.  Turn the heat up to medium.  Stir and cook the vegetables for about 8 minutes.  Add 1 cup broth or corn liquid and turn up the heat until it begins to boil.  Ask an adult to help decide when it's hot enough.  Turn the heat down to low and cover the pot.  Let it cook with the cover on for 5 minutes. 
Meanwhile, measure 1 cup milk in a glass measure.  Ask an adult to help you uncover the soup and carefully pour it into a blender or a food processor.  Pour in the milk, and puree it until it is smooth.  Ask an adult to help you pour the pureed soup back into the same saucepan.  Heat it just a little if it has cooled down, then ladle it into bowls, and serve. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 
Comments:  You can use fresh, frozen or canned corn for this soup.  If you use frozen corn, just put it in a strainer first and run some water over it, directly from the faucet, for about 2 minutes.  If you are using fresh corn, ask an adult to scrape it off the cob with a small, sharp knife.  You will need about 3 ears of corn.  If you are using canned corn and it is packed in just water and salt with no sugar, the liquid from the can might taste good enough to use in the soup.  Taste it and if you like it, use this instead of broth.  Otherwise, use vegetable broth.

NOTES : When most kids hear the words "healthy food," they picture weird creations piled high with things like oats and vegetables.  These are usually the foods left on your plate after a meal until someone makes you eat them.  However, Mollie Katzen's new book, "Honest Pretzels and 64 Other Amazing Recipes for Cooks Ages 8 & Up" (Tricycle Press. $19.95), has recipes that make healthy food fun to make, and delicious to eat.

Put a medium-sized saucepan on the stove and turn on the heat to low.  Use a dinner knife to cut 1 tablespoon butter from the stick.  Put the butter into the saucepan and push it around until it melts. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the scallions, celery, corn, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon basil.  Turn the heat up to medium.  Stir and cook the vegetables for about 8 minutes.  Add 1 cup broth or corn liquid and turn up the heat until it begins to boil.  Ask an adult to help decide when it&apos;s hot enough.  Turn the heat down to low and cover the pot.  Let it cook with the cover on for 5 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, measure 1 cup milk in a glass measure.  Ask an adult to help you uncover the soup and carefully pour it into a blender or a food processor.  Pour in the milk, and puree it until it is smooth.  Ask an adult to help you pour the pureed soup back into the same saucepan.  Heat it just a little if it has cooled down, then ladle it into bowls, and serve. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  You can use fresh, frozen or canned corn for this soup.  If you use frozen corn, just put it in a strainer first and run some water over it, directly from the faucet, for about 2 minutes.  If you are using fresh corn, ask an adult to scrape it off the cob with a small, sharp knife.  You will need about 3 ears of corn.  If you are using canned corn and it is packed in just water and salt with no sugar, the liquid from the can might taste good enough to use in the soup.  Taste it and if you like it, use this instead of broth.  Otherwise, use vegetable broth.

When most kids hear the words &quot;healthy food,&quot; they picture weird creations piled high with things like oats and vegetables.  These are usually the foods left on your plate after a meal until someone makes you eat them.  However, Mollie Katzen&apos;s new book, &quot;Honest Pretzels and 64 Other Amazing Recipes for Cooks Ages 8 &amp; Up&quot; (Tricycle Press. $19.95), has recipes that make healthy food fun to make, and delicious to eat.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  butter
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  2              large  Granny Smith or other tart apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped (3 1/2 cups)
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallot
     1/2           cup  semi-dry white wine
  1 1/2    tablespoons  quick-cooking tapioca
     1/2      teaspoon  curry powder - (to 1 tspn)
  3               cups  low-salt chicken broth -- homemade or canned
  1                     three-inch strip lemon zest
  2                     whole cloves
  1 1/2    tablespoons  light brown sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- whipped
  1         tablespoon  julienned fresh mint leaves

Heat the butter and oil in heavy pot.  Add the apples and shallot and saute over medium heat, stiring occasionally, for about 10 minutes. 
Combine the wine and tapioca in a cup and set aside to soften. 
After 10 minutes, add the curry to the apples, using the larger amount if you like a strong curry flavor.  Saute 3 minutes, stirring, then add the broth.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer.  When apples are quite soft, add the wine/tapioca mixture, the lemon zest, cloves and sugar.  Stir; return to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. 
Remove from heat and let cool briefly.  Remove and discard the zest and cloves.  Taste for salt.  Whether you have to add any depends on the saltiness of the stock used.  Puree in batches in a blender or food processor.  Place in a covered container and chill at least 4 hours, and up to 3 days. 
Before serving, fold in the whipped cream.  Sprinkle each serving with mint. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Charles Auchmutey
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  coarse-ground round or sirloin beef
     1/2         pound  Boston butt pork -- coarsely ground
     1/2         pound  chicken pieces
  1                can  tomatoes - (28 oz) -- coarsely chopped,
                        with juice
  1                can  creamed corn - (16 1/2 oz)
     1/4           cup  ketchup
  1         tablespoon  butter (not margarine)
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1 1/2           cups  water

Using a large skillet, cook the beef and pork very slowly and stir often.  Do not overcook.  Skim off excess grease. 
Remove skin and excess fat from chicken.  Place in a pan, cover chicken with water, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until chicken falls off the bones, 20 to 30 minutes.  Reserve broth for another use, if desired.  Remove bones and tear meat into tiny pieces with fingers. 
Add chicken to beef-pork mixture in skillet.  Mix well.  Start cooking very slowly over medium-low heat and stir often with a wooden spoon until meats are thoroughly blended. 
Place mixture in Crock-Pot.  Add the tomatoes, corn, ketchup, butter, vinegar, salt, peppers, sugar and water.  Mix well.  Cook at 300 to 325 degrees for 5 to 6 hours.  Serve. 
This recipe yields about 8 servings. 
Comments:  The origins of Brunswick stew, initially based on squirrel meat, then on chicken or rabbit or all three, are shrouded in mystery, Joseph E. Dabney writes in "Smokehouse Ham, Spoon Bread, and Scuppernong Wine: The Folklore and Art of Southern Appalachian Cooking" (Cumberland House, $27.95). 
He quotes a comment from "none other than the dean of Southern food critics and food arbiter supreme, Nashville's John Egerton."  According to Egerton, "It seems safe to say that Indians were making stews with wild game long before any Europeans arrived, and in that sense there was Brunswick stew before there was a Brunswick." 
Dabney says this modern-day "kitchen-friendly" Brunswick stew recipe comes from Atlanta's Charles Auchmutey, a native of Bartow County, Ga.

  1              pound  beef shin meat -- cut 1" cubes
  8             ounces  Genoa salami (peeled) -- cut 1" pieces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOUP GIFT MIX ===
  1                cup  dry split peas -- divided
     1/3           cup  beef bouillon granules
     1/2           cup  barley
  1                cup  dry lentils -- divided
     1/3           cup  dried minced onion
     1/4           cup  Italian seasoning mix -- mixed with
  1           teaspoon  dried parsley - (about)
  1                cup  uncooked long-grain or wild rice -- divided
                        === TO MAKE THE SOUP ===
  1              pound  stewing meat -- cut into 1/2" cubes
  3             quarts  water - (to 3 1/2 quarts)
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (28 oz)

To prepare the soup mix:  Using a one-quart canning jar, place 1/2 cup of the split peas in an even layer.  Add the beef bouillon granules, making an even layer.  Top with the barley.  Place 1/2 cup of the lentils on top of the barley in an even layer, followed by all of the minced onion and then the Italian seasoning mix.  Place 1/2 cup of the rice on top.  Add another layer of split peas using the remaining 1/2 cup, and top with a layer of the remaining 1/2 cup lentils.  End with as much rice as needed to fill the jar.  Cover and seal. 
Cut a decorative piece of fabric to fit over the lid and secure with an elastic band.  Tie a ribbon around the band.  Write the other soup ingredients and directions on a small piece of paper and attach to the jar, or secure under the fabric. 
To prepare the soup:  In a large soup pot, brown the stewing meat and drain.  Add the water, tomatoes and soup mix; bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 45 to 60 minutes or until the peas, lentils and barley are tender. 
This recipe yields about 4 quarts of soup.

To prepare the soup mix:  Using a one-quart canning jar, place 1/2 cup of the split peas in an even layer.  Add the beef bouillon granules, making an even layer.  Top with the barley.  Place 1/2 cup of the lentils on top of the barley in an even layer, followed by all of the minced onion and then the Italian seasoning mix.  Place 1/2 cup of the rice on top.  Add another layer of split peas using the remaining 1/2 cup, and top with a layer of the remaining 1/2 cup lentils.  End with as much rice as needed to fill the jar.  Cover and seal.

<DirT>
Cut a decorative piece of fabric to fit over the lid and secure with an elastic band.  Tie a ribbon around the band.  Write the other soup ingredients and directions on a small piece of paper and attach to the jar, or secure under the fabric. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare the soup:  In a large soup pot, brown the stewing meat and drain.  Add the water, tomatoes and soup mix; bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 45 to 60 minutes or until the peas, lentils and barley are tender.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             quarts  water
  2          teaspoons  salt
  4        tablespoons  Old Bay seasoning
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2                     celery ribs -- cut 2" pieces (optional)
  4             medium  or 8 small red-skinned potatoes
  4                     corn ears -- husks and silks
                        removed and ears cut in half
     3/4         pound  chorizo or other spicy smoked sausage -- cut 2" lengths
  2             pounds  large shrimp -- peeled or unpeeled

In an extra-large stockpot over high heat, combine the water, salt, Old Bay, red pepper flakes and celery.  Bring to a boil; cook for 5 minutes.  Skim and discard any foam that rises to the top. 
Add potatoes and cook just until fork-tender, 10 to 20 minutes depending on size of potatoes.  Add corn and sausage; cook 3 to 5 minutes longer.  Add shrimp and cook until pink and opaque. 
Serve in shallow bowls with some of the spicy liquid, if desired, for dunking bread. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This Low country classic is casual summer eating at its best.  Halve or double the recipe depending on the number of diners; spread out newspapers on the table and put a bowl in the middle for tossing the shrimp shells as you peel and eat them.  Have some crusty bread for dunking in the spicy liquid.

                         Garlic Soup With Tomato

Recipe By     :Barbara Kafka, "Soup: A Way of Life"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               thin  peasant bread slices
  3             medium  to large tomatoes -- cut into chunks
  10                    garlic cloves -- smashed, peeled,
                        and coarsely chopped
  2             medium  bell peppers - red, green, yellow,
                        or a combination -- cored, seeded,
                        deribbed and cut into chunks
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt -- or to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the oven to 225 degrees.  Lay the bread directly on the middle rack and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, just to dry it out. 
In a food processor, pulse the tomatoes, half of the garlic, and the bell peppers until coarsely chopped. 
In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat.  Scrape the vegetables into the pan.  Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Stir in the remaining garlic, the salt and 2 cups water.  Bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes.  Season with pepper.  The soup can be made ahead to this point and refrigerated for up to two days. 
If it has been refrigerated, quickly bring the soup back to a boil.  Lay 1 slice of dry bread in the bottom of each of four shallow soup bowls.  Pour the soup over the bread.  Let sit for 10 minutes.  Serve. 
This recipe yields about 6 cups; 4 first-course servings. 
Comments:  The garlic is added in two lots here to get two different flavors.  The first amount is sauteed with other vegetables at the beginning of the recipe in good Italian or Spanish fashion.  The second goes in near the end to provide a bite.  The tomatoes provide most of the liquid.

                         Gazpacho (Lower Calorie)

Recipe By     :Steve Petusevsky
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  fresh pineapple chunks
  1                cup  papaya or mango chunks
  1                cup  peach chunks - (3 medium)
  1                cup  plum chunks - (3 medium)
  1                cup  unsweetened pineapple juice
  2               cups  tomato juice
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
  1           teaspoon  minced gingerroot
  2        tablespoons  lemon or lime juice
  6                     cilantro sprigs -- minced
     1/2           cup  dry sherry -- (optional)

Combine all ingredients in a food processor fitted with the metal blade or blender and process or puree until fairly smooth but still allowing some chunks to remain. 
This recipe yields about 2 quarts for 8 one-cup servings. 
Per (1-cup) serving without dry sherry:  75 calories;  1 gram protein;  no fat;  19 grams carbohydrates;  no cholesterol;  222 milligrams sodium;  2 grams total fiber;  no calories from fat. 
Per (1-cup) serving with dry sherry:  94 calories;  1 gram protein;  no fat;  19 grams carbohydrates;  no cholesterol;  223 milligrams sodium;  2 grams total fiber;  no calories from fat. 
Comments:  I've recently started a diet and find that keeping a pitcher of this filling, relatively low-calorie gazpacho in my refrigerator helps me curb my appetite.  It also opens up space in my refrigerator so I can keep on buying more fruit.

  6             slices  white bread -- crusts removed,
                        and cut into small cubes

In a bowl, mix tomatoes, green pepper, onion, cucumber, vinegar, garlic, tomato juice, olive oil and bread.  Put mixture in batches in a blender and blend on high speed for 3 to 4 minutes, until very smooth.  Strain through a coarse strainer.

Garnish soup with croutons and serve. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Penelope Casas, "Paella!"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             slices  good-quality sandwich bread -- crusts removed
  2 3/4         pounds  very ripe and flavorful tomatoes -- chopped
  1              small  to medium green bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt -- or to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  finest extra-virgin olive oil -- plus extra
                        for drizzling
  1         tablespoon  vinegar, sherry wine preferred
  6        tablespoons  chopped hard-cooked egg
  6        tablespoons  diced Spanish serrano ham or prosciutto
                        cut from a 1/4"-thick slice - (omit if
                        preparing a vegetarian menu)

Soak the bread by holding it under running water and squeeze dry.  Place all the ingredients except the egg and ham in a food processor and blend until finely chopped.  Pass through a food mill or strainer.  (If using a strainer, press with the back of a wooden spoon to extract as much liquid as possible.) 
Taste for salt, adding more if necessary until flavors are fully developed. Depending on the tomatoes, it may be necessary to thin with a little water.  Chill well, at least several hours or overnight.  To serve, drizzle a little olive oil over each serving and sprinkle with the egg and ham. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2           cup  sliced celery
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  2               cups  sliced carrots
  1                     Yukon gold potato -- peeled, diced
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh ginger
  2               cups  vegetable broth
  3               cups  half-and-half
  2               cups  corn kernels

                         Granny's Butternut Soup

Recipe By     :Chefs Jeff Blank and Jay Moore
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     butternut squash
  4             medium  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced
  2             quarts  poultry stock -- reduced to 2 cups,
                        and kept hot
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  6        tablespoons  Pernod (liqueur tasting of licorice),
                        or dry sherry
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  1 1/2    tablespoons  salt - (chefs' preference: most folks
                        would use less)
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Jerked Pumpkin Seeds -- see * Note

* Note:  Heat oven to 250 degrees.  Toss 1 1/2 cups hull-less pumpkin seeds (sometimes sold as pepitas in nut shops) with 3 tablespoons butter and 1/3 cup dry jerk seasoning (including Jamaican allspice).  Bake in thin layer in 250-degree oven for 1 hour, turning and tossing pepitas at 15-minute intervals.  If you can't find these edible pumpkin seeds, don't substitute ones from Jack-O-Lantern pumpkins that chew like wood splinters.  Substitute chopped walnuts, roasted with a bit of allspice-and-pepper butter. 
Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Cut stem from the squash and place squash in roasting pan.  Set in oven 1 hour and 15 minutes or until neck of the squash is tender.  Use a fork to check for doneness.  It should pierce the skin and squash should feel soft. 
Cool for 30 minutes or so, until you can handle squash. 
Cut in half lengthwise; remove meat of squash.  Discard seeds and skin.  In batches, combine squash with peeled, cored apples and hot poultry stock in a blender.  Puree until smooth.  Do this in batches.  Caution:  When using hot poultry stock, steam will expand, lifting the blending level and spraying liquid on you and the kitchen.  Hold vented lid down with dry kitchen cloth. 
Transfer the squash/apple puree to heavy-bottomed sauce pan.  Add nutmeg, cinnamon, Pernod or sherry and cream.  Simmer 15 to 20 minutes over medium heat.  Stir often.  Taste and add salt and pepper.  Serve hot, topped with garnish of julienned apples and jerked pumpkin seeds. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

            James McNair's Carabaccia (Florentine Onion Soup)

Recipe By     :James McNair
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4             pounds  yellow onions -- halved lengthwise,
                        and thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
  1             bottle  dry white wine - (750 ml)
  1                cup  water
  3               cups  homemade meat or chicken stock
                        or canned reduced-sodium broth
  1                     cinnamon stick
  4               cups  torn or cut stale Italian or French bread -- (abt 5 oz)
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- (abt 3 oz)

Combine the oil and butter in a heavy stock pot and place over medium heat until the butter is melted.  Add the onions and toss well to coat with the oil and butter.  Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions just begin to color, about 30 minutes. 
Uncover the onions, increase the heat to medium, sprinkle with the sugar and a little salt and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are richly browned and caramelized, 20 minutes or longer, depending upon the moisture content of the onions. 
Add the wine, water, stock or broth and cinnamon stick.  Stir well and bring to a boil.  Cover tightly, reduce the heat and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. 
Add the bread to the simmering soup and continue cooking until the bread disintegrates, 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the soup from sticking to the bottom of the pot.  Add water as needed if the soup gets too thick. 
Discard the cinnamon stick.  Using a wire whisk, whip the soup until the bread is well incorporated.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Ladle the hot soup into warmed bowls and sprinkle each serving with a portion of the cheese. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Carabaccia means "a combination of simple things."  McNair suggests using onions that look especially dry because they will caramelize best.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              slice  bacon -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped
  1                cup  diced turnip
  1                cup  diced summer squash
  1                cup  diced potato
  1              small  garlic clove -- minced
  3        tablespoons  thyme leaves
  4               cups  fish stock or bottled clam juice -- (to 6 cups)
  3              large  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6              small  clams or mussels - (to 8) -- cleaned, (optional)
  12            ounces  firm white fish fillets (cut into chunks)
                        and/or shrimp (peeled and deveined)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley

In a large stockpot over medium heat, fry the bacon until it begins to crisp.  Remove the bacon from the pan and set aside. 
Add the oil to the bacon drippings in the pot.  Add the onion and celery and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the turnip, squash, potato, garlic and thyme and cook for 5 minutes. 
Add the fish stock or clam juice and the tomatoes, bring the mixture to a boil and simmer just until the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.  Season with the salt and pepper to taste.  Bring the soup to a boil.  If using clams or mussels, add them and continue cooking until shells open. 
Turn off the heat, add the shrimp or fish, cover and let sit until cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Remove clam or mussel shells, if desired.  Sprinkle with the bacon and parsley and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Ann Cashion, chef and owner of the recently opened Johnny's Halfshell near Dupont Circle and Cashion's Eat Place in Adams-Morgan, recently demonstrated the preparation of this simple summer chowder.  She recommends varying the ingredients according to personal preference or availability, substituting, for example, green beans cut into 1-inch pieces or kohlrabi for the turnip or potato.

She recommends varying the ingredients according to personal preference or availability, substituting, for example, green beans cut into 1-inch pieces or kohlrabi for the turnip or potato.

  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped
  1                     carrot -- peeled, chopped
  1                cup  red lentils - (1/2 lb)
     1/3           cup  dry red wine
  4               cups  water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chili powder
  1                     bay leaf
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4         pound  thin asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        cut into diagonal slices
  1             large-  tomato -- seeded, chopped

In 4-quart saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onion, celery, and carrot; saute until onion is golden -- about 5 minutes.  Stir in lentils and wine; heat to boiling.  Cook over high heat until liquid is almost evaporated. 
Stir in water, chili powder, bay leaf, salt, pepper, and allspice.  Heat mixture just to boiling; reduce heat to low and simmer 15 minutes.  Stir in asparagus and tomato and continue to cook 10 to 15 minutes longer or until lentils are tender. 
Discard bay leaf.  Ladle soup among serving bowls and serve. 
Comments:  Red lentils cook up quickly.  To maintain the shape of the lentils, simmer them gently just until soft. 
This recipe yields four 1 1/4 cup servings

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2      teaspoons  butter
     1/4         large  yellow onion -- chopped
  3             ounces  diced green bell pepper -- (abt 2/3 cup)
  2             ounces  diced pimento -- (abt 3 tbspns)
  6             ounces  tomato paste
     3/4         ounce  diced pickled jalapenos -- (abt 2 tbspns)
     3/4      teaspoon  ground red (cayenne) pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground black pepper
  5 1/2         ounces  chicken base paste (see note) -- (1/2 cup plus 2 tspns)
  2               cups  uncooked white long-grain rice
  1              quart  water

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a 9- by 13-inch pan or glass dish, combine butter, onion, green bell pepper, pimento, tomato paste, jalapenos, ground red pepper, black pepper, chicken base, rice and water.  Stir until ingredients are evenly mixed. 
Bake about 45 minutes or until rice is tender but not dry. 
Stir again; serve. 
This recipe yields 12 to 15 servings. 
Comments:  Seafood base paste and chicken base paste add lots of flavor to these recipes.  They also incorporate all the salt that is needed.  We found chicken base paste in the soup aisle at Dierberg's in a brand called Better Than Bouillon.  (The chicken base paste can be substituted for seafood base paste, if necessary, Marcos says, but the gumbo will have less of a seafood flavor.)  Allen's Warehouse Market, 8543 Page Avenue, carries frozen lobster, shrimp or clam base.

  3              whole  fresh thyme sprigs - (to 4)
  1              whole  fresh rosemary sprig - (to 2)
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped garlic or garlic puree
  3             quarts  chicken stock
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste

* Note:  If apple-smoked bacon is unavailable, use any smoked bacon and add 2 teaspoons brown sugar. 
The night before, sort, rinse and soak beans according to package directions.  Or, for a quick soak, rinse beans and place in a large pot, then cover with water.  Bring water to a boil over high heat, cover and boil for 1 minute.  Remove from heat; leave covered 1 hour. 
Drain beans; set aside. 
Over medium heat in a large, heavy pot, cook bacon until nearly brown.  Add onion; cook until soft. 
Fold a piece of cheesecloth to make an 8-inch square.  Rinse thyme and rosemary; place in cheesecloth.  Tie ends together with string or white thread. 
Add beans to onion mixture along with garlic, chicken stock, herb bundle and bay leaf. 
Simmer about 45 minutes or until beans are tender but not overcooked.  Discard herb bundle and bay leaf. 
In food processor or blender, puree half of the beans in small batches.  Stir pureed beans back into soup.  Add salt and pepper to taste. 
This recipe yields about 4 quarts; 16 servings. 
Comments:  Chef David Holben kitchen-tested this delicious white bean soup recipe for home preparation and says "it comes out great."  It's a favorite at his restaurant in Dallas, Mediterraneo.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  spicy sausage - (abt 1 lb)
  1              slice  bacon -- diced 1/4" pieces
     3/4           cup  onions in 1/8" dice
  1 1/4      teaspoons  minced garlic
  1              quart  rich chicken stock
                        (or 1 fluid ounce chicken base mixed
                        with 1 quart water)
  2             medium  potatoes -- halved lengthwise,
                        then cut into 1/4" slices
  2               cups  cavallo greens or kale -- cut in half,
                        then sliced into 1/16" strips
     1/3           cup  heavy whipping cream

Place the sausage on a baking sheet and lightly prick the skins.  Bake in a 300-degree oven for 15 minutes, or until well done.  Cut in half lengthwise, then slice.  Measure 1 1/2 cups. 
Place bacon and onions in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan and cook over medium heat until the onions are almost clear.  Add the garlic and cook 1 more minute.  Add the chicken stock and potatoes.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to simmer and cook 15 minutes.  Add the sausage, greens and whipping cream and simmer 5 more minutes before serving. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  When a reader asked for the Olive Garden's recipe for Tuscan Soup, we replied that the chain no longer provided recipes to Cook's Corner, and readers supplied a homemade version.  Now we have the authentic recipe, thanks to L. Brain of the Olive Garden's corporate office.

         Penne Pasta Soup With Tomatoes, Peppered Vodka And Cream

Recipe By     :Ray L. Overton, "Main-Course Soups"
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1                     red onion -- thinly sliced
  2                     red bell peppers -- seeded, and
                        thinly sliced
  1                     green bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        thinly sliced
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                can  chopped plum tomatoes - (28 oz) -- with their juice
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  8               cups  chicken stock or broth
  12            ounces  uncooked penne pasta
     1/4           cup  pepper-flavored vodka
                        (may substitute regular vodka)
  1                cup  heavy (whipping) cream
  8             ounces  thinly-sliced smoked salmon -- (optional)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley -- plus additional
                        for garnish
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- plus additional
                        for garnish

In a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat, heat the oil.  Add the red onion, bell peppers, garlic, red pepper flakes and salt and pepper to taste.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring often to prevent the garlic from burning, for 3 to 4 minutes. 
Add the tomatoes and sugar and simmer, uncovered, until the sauce begins to thicken, about 15 minutes. 
Add the stock or broth and pasta, bring to a boil and cook until the pasta is tender but not mushy, 8 to 10 minutes.  Stir in the vodka.  Add the cream, salmon (if using), parsley and Parmesan and heat to a simmer. 
Ladle into individual bowls and, if desired, sprinkle with additional Parmesan and parsley.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 8 servings. 
Comments:  We preferred this recipe without the salmon, but fish lovers might enjoy folding in some smoked salmon in the final stages.  This recipe, and more than 80 others, are in Ray L. Overton's "Main-Course Soups" (Longstreet, $15.95).

  3                     yellow onions -- sliced
  3 1/2    tablespoons  tomato paste
  9               cups  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Several thyme sprigs
     1/2                bay leaf
                        Several savory sprigs
  5        tablespoons  quick-cooking tapioca
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill

Wash and trim the fennel, discarding tough outer layers and green part of stalks.  Cut the bulb(s) in half if small, into quarters if large. 
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the fennel and blanch for 5 minutes.  Drain and run under cold water; drain again on paper towels.  When cool, slice the fennel, reserving part of the core for garnish, if desired. 
Heat the olive oil in a large pot; add the onions and saute until golden, stirring occasionally.  Add the fennel and saute, stirring occasionally, until it is lightly browned.  Add the tomato paste and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, until the fennel is very soft. 
Puree in a blender, processor or food mill.  Return to the pan, add the chicken stock and season with salt and pepper. 
Tie the thyme, bay leaf and savory into a tight bundle and add to the pot.  Bring to a boil, then simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove the herbs.  Add the tapioca in a thin stream, stirring vigorously.  Continue cooking until the soup has thickened. 
Transfer the soup to a covered container and chill for at least 4 hours or up to 3 days. 
Before serving, stir in the cream and chopped dill.  Taste for seasoning. 
Serve in shallow bowls.  Garnish with the reserved fennel cores and additional sprigs of dill, if desired. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

                   Quick And Easy Chicken Alphabet Soup

Recipe By     :Marcie Ver Ploeg, "Chicken Soup"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6 1/2           cups  chicken broth (homemade or canned)
  1                can  tomatoes with their juice - (16 oz) -- chopped
  1            package  frozen mixed vegetables - (10 oz)
                        (corn, green beans and carrots or
                        a favorite combination)
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano or basil
     1/2           cup  alphabet or other small pasta
  2                     skinned boned chicken breasts (abt 10 oz) -- rinsed, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, bring broth, tomatoes with their juice, vegetables and oregano to a boil over medium heat, breaking up vegetables with a spoon to separate as they cook.  Reduce heat to low and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. 
Increase heat to high so soup returns to a boil.  Gradually stir in pasta, keeping broth at a boil.  Cook over medium heat until pasta is almost but not quite tender, about 3 minutes.  Add chicken breasts and continue cooking until both chicken and pasta are cooked, about 3 more minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve soup hot. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. 
Comments:  Use alphabet pasta or any small shape you like, such as small bows or pastina in this recipe.  Adjust the cooking time so the pasta and chicken are finished at the same time.

                             Red Cabbage Soup

Recipe By     :Marcella Hazan, "The Classic Italian Cook Book"
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  chopped yellow onion
  2        tablespoons  thinly-shredded pancetta (or bacon)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              pound  red cabbage -- coarsely shredded
     1/3           cup  chopped celery
  3        tablespoons  canned Italian tomatoes -- drained, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1              pinch  thyme
  1                cup  canned beef broth -- mixed with
  2               cups  water - (approximate)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- 6 to 8 twists of
                        the pepper mill
     1/2         pound  Italian sausage
  1                can  (20 oz) white kidney beans, cannellini,
                        or other white beans -- drained
                        === FLAVORED OIL ===
  2              large  or 3 medium garlic cloves -- lightly crushed
                        with a heavy knife and peeled
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped rosemary leaves

Put garlic, onion, and pancetta in a stockpot with the oil and saute over medium heat until the onion and garlic are very lightly colored. 
Add the shredded cabbage, the chopped celery, the tomatoes and a tiny pinch of thyme.  Cook over medium-low heat until the cabbage has completely wilted.  Stir thoroughly from time to time. 
When cabbage has become soft, add the broth, 2 teaspoons salt, and pepper, cover the pot, and cook at very low heat for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  This cooking may be done at various stages, spread over two or three days.  In fact, the soup acquires even better flavor when reheated in this manner. 
Turn off the heat, uncover the pot, tilt it slightly, and draw off as much as possible of the fat that rises to the surface. 
Brown the sausage in a small pan for 6 to 8 minutes over medium-low heat, drain.  Return pot to the burner and bring to a simmer.  Add the browned sausages, drained of their fat.  Puree half the cooked beans and add to the pot.  Stir well.  Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. 
Add the remaining whole beans and correct for desired thickness by adding more broth or water.  Taste and correct for salt.  Cover and simmer for 10 minutes more. 
Put the crushed garlic cloves and the oil in a small pan and saute over lively heat until the garlic is nicely browned.  Add the chopped rosemary, turn off the heat and stir two or three times.  Pour the oil through a sieve into the soup pot, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes more.  Serve with good, crusty Italian or French bread. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Here is an Italian soup, taken from a 26-year-old cookbook that warns, "You should not hesitate to take some freedom with the basic recipe, varying its proportions of sausage, beans and cabbage according to taste." 
Using the author's suggestion, we will eliminate the pork rind that is generally called for in this rich Tuscan specialty.  Use "pancetta" if you have it; if not, use bacon.  This soup develops even better flavor when warmed up one or two days later.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     fresh corn ears -- husked
  2                     red bell peppers
  3                     jumbo russet potatoes -- peeled
  6             slices  bacon -- cut small dice,
                        (optional)
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                     onion -- cut small dice
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  8               cups  chicken broth
  2                     canned chipotle chiles -- removed from
                        their sauce, seeded, and finely diced -- see * Note
                        (abt 2 tspns diced chiles total)
  2                     tomatoes -- seeded, and
                        cut into small dice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream

* Note:  You usually can find canned chipotle chiles in the Hispanic food isle in supermarkets.  Remove the peppers from their sauce and slice them in half.  Scrape off the seeds and mince into a pulp.  Any remaining peppers, when kept in sauce and tightly wrapped, will keep well in the refrigerator for a few weeks. 
Roast the corn either on a grill, in a heavy cast-iron pan over low heat or directly over a gas burner, turning until all the kernels take on a smoky hue.  Cut the kernels from the cobs, reserving 2 of the cobs. 
Roast the bell peppers on the grill or under the broiler, turning as the skin blackens on each side.  Place the roasted peppers in a plastic bag; seal and allow them to steam while you prepare the other ingredients. 
Cut 2 of the of the potatoes into small dice; set aside. 
Quarter the remaining potato and cover it with water in a small saucepan.  Cook until tender, about 15 minutes.  Mash this potato coarsely with a fork and set aside. 
Fry the optional bacon in a large heavy stock pot until almost crunchy, about 5 minutes.  Drain off most of the bacon grease.  Melt the butter in the pan, add the onion and saute until translucent, 7 to 10 minutes.  Add the garlic and saute a few more minutes. 
Deglaze the pan with the broth.  Add the reserved corn cobs, diced potatoes, mashed potato, chipotle peppers and tomatoes.  Bring to a boil, and season with salt and pepper.  Reduce to a simmer and cook until the potato pieces are cooked through, about 25 minutes. 
While the soup is cooking, remove the loosened skin from the peppers.  Discard the seeds and membrane and cut the flesh into small dice. 
Remove the cobs from the soup and add the corn kernels, roasted red pepper and cream.  Simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes.  Adjust for seasoning. 
Serve with warm tortillas or cornbread and a green salad. 
This recipe yields 12 servings. 
Comments:  If you plan to freeze part of this chowder, do not add the mashed potato and cream until just before serving.  Heat the defrosted soup for 5 minutes with the mashed potato and cream.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil spray
  2              small  sweet onions, such as Vidalia
  1 1/4           cups  diced tomatoes
  2 1/4           cups  vegetable-tomato juice, such as V-8
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/3           cup  diced cucumber
     1/4           cup  diced celery
     1/4           cup  diced green bell pepper
                        Hot pepper sauce such as Tabasco -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

If you are not grilling the onions as described below, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Coat a baking sheet with the vegetable oil spray.  Place the onions on the prepared baking sheet and roast until softened, about 45 minutes (depending on the size of the onions).  Set aside to cool completely.  Remove the outer peel and trim the root end; coarsely chop the onions. 
In a blender, combine the onions, 1/2 of the tomatoes, 1/2 of the vegetable-tomato juice and the oil.  Cover and blend on high speed until the solids are pureed, about 1 minute. 
Pour the contents of the blender into a nonreactive bowl; stir in the remaining tomatoes and the vegetable-tomato juice along with the cucumbers, celery, green pepper, hot pepper sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and parsley.  Season with the salt and pepper to taste.  Cover tightly and chill thoroughly, at least 4 hours or up to 8 hours. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  If you have an outdoor barbecue, cook the onions on the grill.  First peel the onions, leaving the root intact, then quarter them; brush the onion quarters with a little olive oil and set them on the perimeter of the grill.  Turn the onions from time to time until they char lightly on the edges and are cooked through and softened; cool the onions, trim away the root and coarsely chop.

Turn the onions from time to time until they char lightly on the edges and are cooked through and softened; cool the onions, trim away the root and coarsely chop.

  3              large  red bell peppers -- roasted, peeled,
                        and seeded
     1/2           cup  cooked moist rice - (lightly packed)
  1                     yellow onion -- chopped (abt 1 1/2 cups)
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed through press
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1                can  (14 1/2 oz) fat-free low-sodium chicken
                        broth or vegetable broth
  1                cup  2% milk

In a medium-size saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat.  Add the onions and garlic.  Saute 10 to 12 minutes over low heat until lightly golden; regulate heat to prevent burning.  Stir in the sugar, salt, white pepper and nutmeg. 
Add the onion mixture to the red pepper mixture and puree again.  With the motor running, pour in the chicken broth.  Stir in the milk. 
Transfer to a saucepan or microwave-safe dish and heat until steaming.  Do not boil.  Serve hot garnished with about 1 tablespoon of minced fresh herbs on top. 
This recipe yields 6 (1-cup) servings. 
Comments:  One word of caution when heating the soup -- do not allow it to boil or the milk will curdle.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24                    roma tomatoes -- washed, quartered
  1              large  red onion -- peeled, and
                        roughly chopped
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- washed, seeded,
                        deveined, and roughly chopped
  1              bunch  parsley stems
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves
  1                     bay leaf
                        Olive oil -- to lightly coat
  3                     garlic heads -- cut in half (remove
                        some of the papery skin)
  2               cups  crushed canned tomatoes
  1                cup  vegetable broth or wine
     1/2           cup  water
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISHES ===
                        Favorite herbed oil -- (optional)
                        Garlic croutons -- (optional)

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  In a large roasting pan, mix together the tomatoes, red onion, jalapeÒo, parsley stems, basil and bay leaf.  Drizzle with a little olive oil and toss gently to coat.  Position the garlic head halves on top of the mixture.  Brush the garlic with a little olive oil.  Roast in the oven for 1 hour, just until the skins starts to blister on the tomatoes and the garlic is soft; stir the tomatoes often to avoid burning the top layer while the bottom remains undercooked. 
Remove from the oven, cool slightly and pass the mixture through a food mill with a medium disc.  Transfer to a soup pot, add the crushed tomatoes, broth and water.  Bring to a boil.  Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary.  Serve drizzled with herb oil and garlic croutons. 
This recipe yields about 6 cups. 
Cook's note:  If soup is too thick for your liking, add more broth, wine or water to thin to desired consistency.

  4        tablespoons  butter -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  chopped onion
     1/2                red bell pepper -- diced

  2             medium  potatoes -- diced
  2               cups  fish stock or clam juice
  1              quart  milk
  2               cups  corn kernels -- fresh or frozen
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1              pound  rockfish or striped bass -- skinned, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces, or 1 pint

Add the fish (or oysters) to the soup and cook just until the fish is cooked through, about 10 minutes. 
Sprinkle the chowder with parsley and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

                   Russian Sweet And Sour Cabbage Soup

Recipe By     :Richard Sax
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2             medium  onions -- halved, and
                        sliced crosswise
  3             medium  carrots -- cut 1/2" slices
  1             medium  green cabbage - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  paprika (preferably Hungarian)
  3 1/2           cups  chicken broth or bouillon
  1                can  whole peeled tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz) -- with liquid
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  golden raisins, dried cherries,
                        or cranberries
  5        tablespoons  lemon juice -- divided
  3        tablespoons  brown sugar
  3             medium  potatoes - (1 lb) -- cut 3/4" chunks
     1/4           cup  crushed ginger snaps - (abt 4 cookies)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill
                        (if using dried dill start with 1 tspn)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat.  Add onions and carrots.  Saute until softened, stirring, about 5 minutes. 
Meanwhile, discard any spoiled outer leaves from cabbage.  Quarter the head, core and slice cabbage into 1/4-inch strips.  Add cabbage and garlic to onion mixture.  Cover and cook just until softened, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. 
Add paprika and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Add broth, tomatoes and water.  Bring to a boil, partially cover and simmer 20 minutes. 
Meanwhile, squeeze lemon juice.  Add raisins and 3 tablespoons of the juice to the soup.  Stir in brown sugar and the potatoes. 
Bring soup to a boil, partially cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. 
Stir in ginger snap crumbs (gingerbread cookies may be used), dill, the remaining lemon juice, salt and pepper.  If necessary, adjust all seasonings, adjusting the sweet-sour balance by adding more lemon juice or sugar. 
Serve hot with additional chopped dill sprinkled over each serving.  Use fresh parsley along with dried dillweed if fresh dill is not available, and be cautious when substituting dried dill; it can be overpowering. 
This recipe yields about 10 cups.

Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat.  Add onions and carrots.  Saute until softened, stirring, about 5 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, discard any spoiled outer leaves from cabbage.  Quarter the head, core and slice cabbage into 1/4-inch strips.  Add cabbage and garlic to onion mixture.  Cover and cook just until softened, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add paprika and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Add broth, tomatoes and water.  Bring to a boil, partially cover and simmer 20 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, squeeze lemon juice.  Add raisins and 3 tablespoons of the juice to the soup.  Stir in brown sugar and the potatoes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring soup to a boil, partially cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir in ginger snap crumbs (gingerbread cookies may be used), dill, the remaining lemon juice, salt and pepper.  If necessary, adjust all seasonings, adjusting the sweet-sour balance by adding more lemon juice or sugar. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve hot with additional chopped dill sprinkled over each serving.  Use fresh parsley along with dried dillweed if fresh dill is not available, and be cautious when substituting dried dill; it can be overpowering. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 10 cups.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter or margarine
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped onion
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
  2               cans  chicken broth - (14 1/2 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  honey
  1                cup  whole kernel corn -- fresh or frozen
  1                cup  whole milk
     1/2         pound  cooked bay shrimp
                        Salt -- (optional)

In medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.  Add onions; cook and stir 3 to 5 minutes or until onions are tender.  Stir in flour and curry powder; cook and stir 1 minute.  Whisk in chicken broth, lime juice and honey.  Bring to a boil; stir in corn.  Reduce heat and simmer 3 minutes.  Remove from heat; stir in milk and shrimp.  Season with salt if desired. 
Transfer soup to bowl; cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours, until well chilled. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  The Senegalese Soup borrows from Senegal's West African tradition.  It is enriched with shrimp, corn and curry seasoning, balanced with lime juice and honey.  The colorful gazpacho is like a chopped salad turned into soup, refreshing and a little pungent.

                          Spinach Parsley Pesto

Categories    : Condiments                      Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     garlic cloves
  1              bunch  parsley preferably flat leaf -- (abt 1 cup packed leaves)
  2               cups  washed fresh spinach leaves - (packed) -- half a 10-oz bag
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  walnuts
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

Peel the garlic by placing the broad side of a chef's knife or other flat surface over each clove and giving it a firm whack with your hand.  Drop the cloves one at a time through a food processor feed tube onto the moving blade.  Chop finely.  Rinse and dry the parsley in a lettuce spinner or use paper towels.  Remove and discard the tough stems.  Drop the leaves through the feed tube onto the moving blade and mince finely. 
If the spinach is gritty, rinse and dry using a lettuce spinner or paper towels.  Remove any tough stems and discard.  Add half the spinach to the processor bowl and drizzle a tablespoon or so of the oil through the feed tube while processing.  Process until finely minced, about 15 seconds.  Repeat with the remaining spinach, drizzling in another tablespoon or so of oil.  Add the walnuts and process until well-chopped, about 15 seconds. 
Add the cheese and salt to the bowl and process while drizzling the remaining oil through the feed tube, about 15 seconds.  Serve at once, or refrigerate up to 4 days, or freeze up to 3 months. 
This recipe yields 1 1/2 cups. 
Comments:  To freeze the pesto, take a muffin tin and line six holes with plastic wrap.  Scoop 1/4 cup pesto into each hole.  Twist the plastic wrap to close it around the pesto, secure the bundle with a twist-tie, then freeze the bundles in the muffin tin for 48 hours.  Once frozen, remove the pouches from the tin, drop them into a zipper-top plastic bag and store in the freezer.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  vine-ripened tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  extra virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Start bringing a large pot of water to a boil. 
Using a small paring knife, cut out the woody stem end of each tomato, then score an "X" on the bottom of each; this will help with the peeling. 
Fill a large bowl with ice water. 
When the water in the pot has reached a rolling boil, slip in 3 or 4 tomatoes.  Don't crowd the pot.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the tomatoes as soon as the skins split, less than 30 seconds.  Transfer the tomatoes to the ice water to cool.  Repeat with the remaining tomatoes. 
When cool, the tomato skins should peel off easily; if not, blanch them quickly again.  Cut each peeled tomato in half width-wise.  Squeeze each half over a bowl to remove the seeds.  Chop the tomatoes into small dice.  Discard the seeds. 
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Add the garlic and saute until the aroma is released, about 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook quickly over medium heat, until just heated through.  (Don't cook them any longer or they will lose some of their firm texture.)  Season with salt and pepper. 
Use as a garnish for the Tuscan Bean Soup recipe.
