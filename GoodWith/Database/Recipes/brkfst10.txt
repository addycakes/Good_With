  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     2/3           cup  blanched almonds
  1                cup  sugar
     2/3           cup  golden raisins
     2/3           cup  dried currants
     1/2           cup  candied citron
     1/2           cup  candied orange or lemon peel
     1/2           cup  candied red cherries -- chopped
  1                cup  butter -- softened
  4              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  orange-flavored liqueur

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Grease and flour an 8-inch springform pan.

In a medium bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, salt, allspice and cinnamon.

In a food processor with a knife blade attached, combine 1/3 cup almonds and 1/4 cup sugar.  Process until almonds are finely ground.

In a medium bowl, mix ground-almond mixture, raisins, currants, citron, orange peel and cherries.

In a large bowl with mixer at low speed, beat remaining 3/4 cup of sugar and butter until well blended.  Increase speed to medium-high and beat 5 minutes, or until light and creamy.  Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in orange liqueur.

Reduce speed to low, beat in flour mixture until blended (batter will be thick).  Stir in fruit mixture.

Spoon batter into prepared pan, spreading evenly.  Arrange remaining 1/3 cup almonds on top of batter.

Bake 2 hours to 2 hours 15 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean.  Cover pan loosely with foil after 1 hour to prevent top from overbrowning.

Cool in pan on wire rack 20 minutes.  With a small knife, loosen cake from sides of pan; remove pan side.  Cool completely on wire rack.

When cool, remove pan bottom and wrap cake in plastic wrap and then in foil.  Let stand overnight before serving.

This recipe yields 20 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
     3/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                     egg
  2 3/4            cup  flour
  1           envelope  yeast - (1 tbspn)
                        === FILLING ===
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  1                     egg
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  preserves
                        = (raspberry or boysenberry work well)
                        === TOPPING ===
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/3           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted
  1                     egg -- beaten
                        A small amount vegetable or canola oil

Combine water, butter, sugar and salt in a small saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until butter is melted.  Heat or cool the mixture as necessary so that it is very warm (120 to 130 degrees).

In a large bowl or in a mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix 1 cup flour and yeast.  Add the very warm water mixture and mix until blened.  Mix in the egg.  Add remaining flour by 1/2 cupfulls until you have a soft dough.  Beat, or knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 to 10 minutes).  Add more flour, if necessary, to keep dough from sticking.

Lightly coat a large bowl with vegetable or canola oil.  Place dough in bowl and turn to coat with oil.  Cover bowl with a clean kitchen towel and place in a warm, draft-free are until the dough has doubled in size.  This should take about an hour.

Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees and grease an 8- by 10-inch (or larger) baking pan.

Beat together cream cheese, egg and sugar until smooth and creamy.

When dough has doubled, punch it down and use a floured rolling pin on a floured surface to roll in into a rectangle, roughly the size of your baking sheet.  Place dough on greased baking sheet.  With a sharp knife, score the dough into thirds, lengthwise.  Spread the preserves evenly over the center third of the dough.  Use a sharp knife to cut strips at 1-inch intervals along the two outside thirds.  Carefully spread the cream cheese mixture over the preserves.  Starting at one end, alternately cross the cut strips over the center.  Tuck in strips at bottom.

Brush top of coffee cake with beaten egg.  Sprinkle sugar and almonds over top.  Cover coffee cake and let rise again, until almost doubled (about 30 minutes).

Bake in a 350 degree oven for about 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown and the filling has set.  Allow to cool slightly before serving.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  Don't forget, you can make the yeast dough ahead of time and keep it in your refrigerator.  Just allow extra time for it to come to room temperature before proceeding to roll it out.

  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  1                     small can Mandarin oranges
  3        tablespoons  margarine
  1                cup  biscuit baking mix
                        =(Jiffy or Bisquick)
     1/2           cup  cream

Drain the syrup from the fruit cocktail and the oranges and mix it with the light brown sugar and the cornstarch.

Stir over a medium heat until thick.  After it has thickened add the fruit and bring to boil, remove from heat and pour into a square baking dish (9- by 9- or 8- by 8-inch).

Spread 2 tablespoons of the margarine over the top of the fruit.  Mix the biscuit mix with the cream and the remaing margarine.  It should be moist but still a bit stiff.

Spoon the mix over the top of the fruit.  Bake for 20 minutes at 400 degrees or until the biscuits are golden brown.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 24    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Breakfast/Brunch


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  milk
  2        tablespoons  yeast
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/3           cup  butter -- melted, cooled
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
  4                     eggs
  5               cups  flour
  1 1/3           cups  currants or raisins
  1                     egg white
                        === GLAZE ===
  1 1/3           cups  confectioner's sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-chopped lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon extract
  1         tablespoon  milk - (to 2)

In a small saucepan, heat milk to very warm, but not hot (110 degrees if using a candy thermometer).  Fit an electric mixer with a dough hook.  Pour warm milk in the bowl of mixer and sprinkle yeast over.  Mix to dissolve and let sit for 5 minutes.

With mixer running at low speed, add sugar, salt, butter, cinnamon, nutmeg and eggs.  Gradually add flour, dough will be wet and sticky, and continue kneading with dough hook until smooth, about 5 minutes.  Detach bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let the dough "rest" for 30 to 45 minutes.

Return bowl to mixer and knead until smooth and elastic, for about 3 more minutes.  Add currants or raisins and knead until well mixed.  At this point, dough will still be fairly wet and sticky.  Shape dough in a ball, place in a buttered dish, cover with plastic wrap and let rise overnight in the refrigerator.  Excess moisture will be absorbed by the morning.

Let dough sit at room temperature for about a half-hour.  Line a large baking pan (or pans) with parchment paper (you could also lightly grease a baking pan, but parchment works better).  Divide dough into 24 equal pieces (in half, half again, etc., etc.).  Shape each portion into a ball and place on baking sheet, about 1/2-inch apart.  Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.

In the meantime, pre-heat oven to 400 degrees.

When buns have risen, take a sharp or serrated knife and carefully slash buns with a cross.  Brush them with egg white and place in oven.  Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees, then bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes more.  Transfer to a wire rack.  Whisk together glaze ingredients, and spoon over buns in a cross pattern.  Serve warm, if possible.

This recipe yields 2 dozen buns.

Comments:  A traditional favorite on Good Friday in England, Hot Cross Buns are a spicy currant or raisin studded yeast bun, topped with a "Cross" of lemon flavored icing.  While Christians have adopted the cake and the symbolism of the cross, it wasn't always so.  To Pagans then as now, the cross was symbolic of the sun wheel, which symbolizes perfect balance at the time of the Spring Equinox.

Hot Cross Buns were probably originally used in ceremonies and rituals and the Christian Church attempted to ban the buns, although they proved too popular.  Left with no alternative but defeat, the church did the next best thing and "Christianized" the bread with Queen Elizabeth I passing a law which limited the bun's consumption to proper religious ceremonies, such as Christmas, Easter or funerals.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/4           cup  crystallized ginger -- finely chopped
                        = (found in the spice section of store)
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon zest
  1                cup  lowfat buttermilk (2%)
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  water
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        === BRUNCH ACCOMPANIMENT ===
                        Margarita Fruit Salad -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a medium bowl, mix together flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking soda and cream of tartar.  Stir in ginger and lemon zest.

In a small bowl, combine buttermilk and oil and add to the dry ingredients, stirring just until blended.

Turn the slightly sticky dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and pat to 1/2-inch thickness.  Using a floured, 4-inch round cutter, cut out the dough.  Cut each circle in half to make half-moons.  Reroll and cut the scraps, handling the dough as little as possible.

Place scones onto a baking sheet that has been lightly coated with nonstick cooking spray.

In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg with the water.  Brush the tops of the scones with the egg glaze.  Sprinkle scones with 1 tablespoon of sugar.

Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the tops are golden and firm to touch.  Serve warm.  Serve these scones for brunch with Margarita Fruit Salad.

This recipe yields about 16 scones.

In a medium bowl, mix together flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking soda and cream of tartar.  Stir in ginger and lemon zest.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, combine buttermilk and oil and add to the dry ingredients, stirring just until blended.

<DirT>
Turn the slightly sticky dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and pat to 1/2-inch thickness.  Using a floured, 4-inch round cutter, cut out the dough.  Cut each circle in half to make half-moons.  Reroll and cut the scraps, handling the dough as little as possible.

<DirT>
Place scones onto a baking sheet that has been lightly coated with nonstick cooking spray.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg with the water.  Brush the tops of the scones with the egg glaze.  Sprinkle scones with 1 tablespoon of sugar.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the tops are golden and firm to touch.  Serve warm.  Serve these scones for brunch with Margarita Fruit Salad.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields about 16 scones.

Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes
                Omelets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  chopped peeled seeded tomato
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
  1                     instant chicken bouillon
  1                cup  diced cooked chicken or turkey
  8              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black peppper
  4        tablespoons  margarine or butter

In a blender container, combine the 1/4 cup of water, tomato, oil, chili powder, and chicken bouillon granules.  Blend until very smooth.

Transfer to a small saucepan.  Cook, stirring constantly, until thick, about 7 minutes.  Stir in the chicken or turkey.  Season with a little salt and pepper.  Keep warm.

With a fork, beat the eggs with the second 1/4 cup of water, the salt and pepper, until well blended but not frothy.

In an 8-inch omelet pan heat 1 tablespoon of the butter until it sizzles and browns slightly.  Tilt the pan to coat the bottom and sides.  Pour about 1/2 cup of the egg mixture, leaving the heat on medium-high.  As the egg sets, lift the edges to allow the uncooked portion on top to run under the cooked portion.  Continue until all of the egg is cooked.

Spoon about 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture down the center of the omelet.  Fold the sides of the omelet up over the chicken mixture.  Tilt the omelet pan to roll the omelet over and out onto a hot plate.

Repeat with the remaining butter, egg mixture and chicken filling, three more times and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a blender container, combine the 1/4 cup of water, tomato, oil, chili powder, and chicken bouillon granules.  Blend until very smooth.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer to a small saucepan.  Cook, stirring constantly, until thick, about 7 minutes.  Stir in the chicken or turkey.  Season with a little salt and pepper.  Keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With a fork, beat the eggs with the second 1/4 cup of water, the salt and pepper, until well blended but not frothy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In an 8-inch omelet pan heat 1 tablespoon of the butter until it sizzles and browns slightly.  Tilt the pan to coat the bottom and sides.  Pour about 1/2 cup of the egg mixture, leaving the heat on medium-high.  As the egg sets, lift the edges to allow the uncooked portion on top to run under the cooked portion.  Continue until all of the egg is cooked.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon about 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture down the center of the omelet.  Fold the sides of the omelet up over the chicken mixture.  Tilt the omelet pan to roll the omelet over and out onto a hot plate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Repeat with the remaining butter, egg mixture and chicken filling, three more times and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

     2/3           cup  quick or old-fashioned oats

     1/4           cup  milk

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Fritters


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           envelope  dry yeast
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  warm water -- divided
  2                     eggs -- room temperature
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  fruit
                        = (diced fresh apples, raisins or
                        dried currants)
                        Oil -- for frying
                        Confectioner's sugar -- for dusting

Pour 1/2 cup warm water, about 85 to 115 degrees, into the bowl of a large food processor.  Sprinkle the yeast and sugar over the water and mix at low speed.  Let stand for five minutes.

Slowly mix in remaining water, eggs, vanilla and salt.  Slowly add flour a cup at a time.  Mix on high for about a minute or two.  The dough should turn into a ball and roll around the processor.

If the dough does not ball up because it's to dry, add water one tablespoon at a time until it does.  If your mixture is more like a batter, add flour one tablespoon at a time.

Mix in fruit.  Remove from food processor.  Place in an oiled bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.

Heat about 2 inches of oil in a large skillet.  Punch down dough.  Roll the dough into small balls, about 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter.  Drop dough balls into hot oil, frying until golden brown, turning as needed.  Drain on paper towels and dust with confectioner's sugar.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 to 5 dozen.

Comments:  The name of these tasty treats literally translates to "oil balls."  Don't let this unappetizing name fool you, Olie Bollen are delicious.  The Dutch regularly stud their Olie Bollen dough with raisins, currants or even finely-diced apples.  Why not use all three?

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  vegetarian refried beans
     1/4           cup  salsa or taco sauce -- divided
  2                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  water
                        Cooking spray -- as needed
  2        tablespoons  shredded reduced-fat Monterey Jack
                        = (or Cheddar cheese)
                        Lemon and/or lime wedges -- (optional)

In small saucepan over low heat, stir together beans and 2 tablespoons of the salsa.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through.  Keep warm while preparing omelet.

In small bowl, beat together eggs and water until blended.  Evenly coat 7- to 10-inch omelet pan or skillet with cooking spray.  Heat over medium-high heat until just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water.  Pour in egg mixture.  (Mixture should set immediately at edges.)

With an inverted pancake turner, carefully push cooked portions at edges toward center so uncooked portions can reach hot pan surface, tilting pan and moving cooked portions as necessary.  Cook until top is thickened and no visible liquid egg remains.

Spread hot bean mixture down center of omelet.  Sprinkle with cheese.  With pancake turner, fold sides of omelet over beans and cheese.  Slide from pan onto plate.  Spoon on remaining salsa.  Garnish with lemon and lime wedges, if desired.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

  3                     eggs

Categories    : Breakfast/Brunch                Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BASIC FRENCH OMELET ===
  2           teaspoon  olive oil -- divided
  6                     egg whites -- whipped
  1         tablespoon  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === POTATO AND BACON FILLING ===
  4             slices  low-fat bacon -- cooked, crumbled
  2             medium  potatoes -- cooked, peeled,
                        and diced
  2        tablespoons  chopped onions
  2        tablespoons  choped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  grated fat-free cheddar cheese

Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil over high heat in a skillet with a rounded bottom and sloping sides.  In a mixing bowl, whip your egg whites, water, salt, and black pepper together, using a fork.  Pour egg mixture into skillet.  Cook over moderately-high heat until the bottom is set.  Using a spatula, move the cooked mixture to the center and allow the uncooked mixture to flow into the bottom of the pan.

When cooked, the omelet should be barely brown on the bottom, soft and moist in the center.  Spoon the filling down the center of the omelet.  Using a spatula and starting from the handle side, fold one third of the omelet over the center.  With a heated serving plate in one hand, grasp the skillet in the other, palm up and tilt so the omelet rolls over onto the plate.

For Potato And Bacon Filling:  Cook bacon in a large skillet.  Then, drain on paper towel and crumble.  Heat skillet again and add remaining oil.  Then, add potatoes, onions, and bacon again.  Cook until onions are tender.  Lower heat.  Cover and keep warm.  Spoon half the filling onto each Basic French Omelet.  Sprinkle each with parsley and cheddar cheese just before folding.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

                           Rolled Sweet Omelet

                Japanese                        Omelets


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     eggs
  1                     hanpen (pureed and steamed fish cake)
     1/2           cup  dashi soup stock
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Put hanpen cake in blender and chop well.

To blender, now add soup stock, sugar, salt, soy sauce, and eggs; stir well.

Pour this mixture into a flat slightly-oiled baking pan and bake for 15 minutes at 250 degrees.

Take the omelet out from the pan when it's still hot.  Now place the omelet on top of a bamboo mat and roll it.  Leave alone until it cools.

Remove the bamboo mat and cut the omelet into half inch slices.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe known as datemaki may seem strange as fish for breakfast is not correct in America.  Remembering that hanpen and soup stock are for flavor only allows you to replace them with other flavors you enjoy.  The feeling and shape of the omelet should not be effected.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Breakfast/Brunch


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  yeast
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  butter
  1                     egg
  2                     egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
     1/4           cup  raisins
     1/4           cup  currants
     1/4           cup  sherry - (scant)
                        = (preferably a sweet or cream sherry)
     1/4           cup  slivered almonds
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  confectioner's sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  milk

Butter a 2-pound coffee can.  Fold a doubled sheet of aluminum foil around the top of the can to extend it about 2 inches.

Soak currants and raisins in sherry for about 1/2 hour before beginning dough.

Combine yeast, 1 cup flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl of an electric mixer.

Heat milk and butter until butter is melted and mixture is very warm (about 115 degrees on a candy thermometer).  Pour milk mixture into dry ingredients with mixer slowly running, then beat until smooth.  Beat in eggs, egg yolks and lemon zest.  Gradually add remaining flour, beating well after each addition.  Beat in almonds and sherry soaked raisins and currants.

Knead until smooth and satiny.  Place in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a warm, draft free place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.

Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.

Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead a few times.  Shape dough into a ball and place in greased 2-pound coffee can.  Loosely cover top of can with plastic wrap or foil and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, or until dough almost reaches the top of the can.

Bake for about 50 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean and the loaf sounds hollow when thumped.  Let cool in pan on a wire rack, remove from can after about 10 minutes and let cool completely.

To mix glaze, blend confectioner's sugar and milk until smooth.  Spread glaze over top, letting it drizzle down the sides.

To serve, cut off the frosted crown and place in the center of a serving plate.  Cut remaining loaf lengthwise, then in half crosswise and arrange on plate around the cut top.

This recipe yields 1 tall loaf.

Comments:  This traditional Russian Easter bread, is baked, believe it or not, in an empty 2-pound coffee can.  This unusual baking "pan" is what allows the bread to achieve its stately height.  It was traditional to lay a single red rose on top of the glazed top of this impressive bread, and, providing your rose has been grown pesticide free, it can still make an impressive picture today.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  shredded carrots
     1/2                small can crushed pineapple with juice
                        A handful of raisins
     1/2           cup  orange juice
  1              pinch  cinnamon
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1                cup  old-fashioned uncooked oatmeal -- more or less

Mix all, stirring in enough old fashioned uncooked oatmeal to soak up the juice -- the longer it sits, the more juice the oats will absorb.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  This is delicious!  Top with sliced banana if desired.  You can vary this using different grains (such as cooked rice, bulgur, raw millet).  Use your imagination and your taste buds.  Experiment!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20                    sorrel leaves -- stems removed
  3          teaspoons  butter
  3                     eggs

  2        tablespoons  cream

Cut the sorrel leaves into strips.  Melt half the butter in an omelet pan and cook the leaves until they have wilted and turned a gray-green color.  This will take just a minute or two.

Lightly beat the eggs with he water, season with salt and pepper, then stir in the sorrel.  Melt the remaining butter in the omelette pan and when it is hot, add the eggs.  As the edges cook, pull them into the middle of the pan with a fork, tilting the pan as you do so that uncooked eggs will flow into its place.

When the eggs are cooked, fold the omelet in thirds and turn it out onto a plate.  Return the pan to the fire and add the cream.  Bring it to a boil and let it reduce enough just to thicken slightly.

Make a slice down the center of the omelette, pour in the cream and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  olive oil
  4             medium  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  6                     eggs
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1                     green pepper -- chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the oil in a large frying pan and then gently fry the sliced potatoes until almost soft, stirring from time to time so that they don't burn on the bottom of the pan.  Add the onion and the green pepper and continue frying until all the vegetables are soft.  Drain the vegetables in a colander to get rid of the excess oil.

Beat the eggs in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.  Add the potatoes, etc. and mix well and check seasoning.

Heat a little oil in a frying pan on a moderate heat.  Pour in the potatoes and eggs and shake the frying pan from time to time so that the omelette doesn't stick to the bottom.  Once the bottom of the omelette has set, turn the heat down low and cover the pan.

After about ten minutes, turn the omelette by placing either a flat plate or saucepan lid on the frying pan and quickly turning over.  Gently slide the omelette back into the frying pan and continue frying, once again shaking the pan from time to time so that it doesn't stick to the bottom, until it has set all the way through.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  whole-wheat pastry flour
     1/2           cup  unbleached white flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3                     tabblespoons margarine
     1/3           cup  apple juice
  1                cup  well-mashed cooked sweet potato
  3        tablespoons  honey
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped pecans or walnuts

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

In a mixing bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder and salt.  Work the margarine in with a pastry blender or the tines of a fork until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.  Add the apple juice, sweet potato, honey and nuts and work them in to form a soft dough.

Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board and knead in just enough extra flour to make the dough lose its stickiness.

With floured hands, divide the dough into 16 equal parts.  Shape into small balls and arrange on a lightly oiled cookie sheet, patting them down a bit to flatten.

Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of one tests clean.  Transfer the biscuits to a plate and serve hot.

This recipe yields 16 biscuits.
