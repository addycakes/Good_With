                           Classic Garlic Bread

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     baguette or loaf of French bread
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2                     fresh garlic cloves -- chopped finely, or
                        forced through a press
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cut the bread diagonally into 3/4-inch slices.  Don't slice all the way through the loaf.

Mix the butter and the garlic, add a pinch of salt and pepper and blend into a smooth paste.  Spread the mixture onto each slice as if you were buttering a piece of bread.

Put the loaf back together, wrap it in foil and put it in a hot oven for ten minutes.  Unwrap the foil for the last minute of heating and you'll get a crisp crust to the loaf.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Garlic Bread goes well with any of Wolfgang's Soups, but try it with his new Turkey with Egg Noodles or Chicken with Pasta and Mushrooms and you'll discover a perfect combination.

                           Ginger Creme Brulee

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Custards                        Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  3               cups  heavy cream
  1                     vanilla bean -- split
  3             pieces  fresh ginger - (dime-size)
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  brown cane sugar

In a large metal bowl set over a pan of warm water on medium-low heat, whisk the egg yolks and granulated sugar together until the mixture is light and thick enough to form a ribbon.  Remove from the heat and carefully whisk in the cream.

Add split vanilla bean and ginger slices.  Place bowl back over warm water and cook slowly for about 45 minutes, stirring frequently.  Take care that the water in the pan does not boil.  The custard is done when mixture adheres to your fingers without dripping.

When the custard is done, remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, a little at a time until all of it has been incorporated.  Strain through a fine strainer into a bowl.  Ladle into 6 individual 4-ounce ramekins or a shallow 1-quart heat-proof dish.  Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 6 hours.

Preheat broiler.  Sieve over the custard an even layer of brown sugar approximately 1/4-inch thick.  With the rack as close as it will go to the broiler, place the ramekins under the hot broiler for about 3 minutes or until sugar caramelizes (you can use a propane torch to accomplish the same task).  Chill until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  shredded white cabbage
  1                     carrot -- grated
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  peanut butter -- smooth
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
     1/3           cup  unsalted roasted peanuts
  1           teaspoon  butter

Wash the cabbage and then shred it into thin slices.

Mix the vinegar, lemon juice, peanut butter, mayonnaise, sesame oil, and soy sauce in a bowl.  Blend well and season with salt, pepper, and a dash of hot pepper sauce if you like it fiery.

Pour this mixture over the cabbage and grated carrot in a large bowl.  Toss energetically.  Place in the refrigerator, covered, for at least an hour.

Meanwhile melt the butter in a saucepan, add the peanuts and stir for three or four minutes until the peanuts are golden brown.  Be careful to avoid burning the peanuts.  Drain on a paper towel, cool, and sprinkle with chopped parsley over the salad immediately prior to serving.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     ripe pears
  1                     lemon
  1             bottle  Zinfandel
  1              whole  vanilla bean -- split in half
     1/2      teaspoon  black peppercorns
     1/2                cinnamon stick
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1                     basket fresh raspberries
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- for garnish

Peel, halve and core the pears.  Rub each half with lemon juice.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  peanut oil
  1 1/2           cups  minced onion
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  2               cups  arborio rice
  1                cup  dry white wine
  8             ounces  portobello mushrooms
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  6               cups  chicken broth
  4        tablespoons  chilled butter -- cut small pieces
     1/2           cup  grated parmesan cheese -- divided

In a medium skillet, heat olive oil.  Add mushrooms; cook and stir until tender, 5 to 6 minutes.  Pour 3 cups of the broth into the rice, over medium-high heat stir until almost al dente.  Stir in the cooked mushrooms and the additional broth, as needed.  The risotto should be creamy, not runny.

Remove saucepan from heat.  Vigorously beat in butter and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until completely dissolved.  Stir in parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

       Roasted Chicken Breast, Wild Mushroom Risotto, Black Truffle

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  goat cheese
  1              ounce  black truffles -- divided
  4              whole  chicken breasts -- boned
  5        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
                        Freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  port
  5 1/2           cups  chicken stock -- heated, divided
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  peanut oil
  1                cup  minced onion
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  2               cups  Arborio rice
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  mushroom stock -- heated, divided
     1/2         pound  wild mushrooms -- stems reserved
                        for stock
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  chopped peeled seeded tomato
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  1              large  pinch chopped Italian parsley

For the chicken:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In small bowl, crumble goat cheese and combine with 1 teaspoon chopped black  Gently slip your fingers under skin of each chicken breast, lifting it slightly.  Divide cheese mixture and stuff under skin, patting down to distribute it evenly.

Rub each breast with only 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Put chicken breast, skin-side down, on grill or sear in sautÈ pan until golden brown.  Turn breast to meat side and sear for 5 minutes more.  Finish cooking in 350 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes until chicken breast is done.  Do not overcook.

Remove chicken from pan and keep warm.  Pour out any fat that may remain and deglaze pan with port.  Add only 1/2 cup of chicken stock and reduce just until sauce thickens.  Whisk in butter and season with salt and pepper to taste.

For the risotto:  In medium-size heavy saucepan, heat peanut oil.  Over medium-high heat, sautÈ onion and garlic just to soften, stirring often with wooden spoon, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Add rice and continue to stir, coating rice with oil and onion.

Deglaze with white wine and cook until liquid is absorbed, stirring often.  Pour in enough mushroom and/or chicken stock to cover, about 3 cups.  Cook, stirring often, until liquid is absorbed.

Meanwhile, in medium skillet, heat remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil.  If mushrooms are large, cut them into bite-size pieces and sautÈ over medium-high heat just to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.  Set aside.

Pour 3 more cups of stock into rice, turn heat to high and stir in generous pinch of salt and tomatoes.  Stir until almost al dente.  Stir in mushrooms and, if necessary, remaining 1 cup of stock.  Risotto should be creamy, not runny.  Remove from heat and vigorously beat in chilled butter and Parmesan cheese until completely melted.  Stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.

For the presentation:  Place mushroom risotto on heated plate, top with grilled chicken breast and spoon a little sauce over.  Using a mandoline, thinly slice remaining truffles and sprinkle over each chicken breast.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Truffles, available at gourmet food stores, are quite expensive.  If youíre on a budget, this recipe may be prepared without them.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  arugula
  1                     garlic clove
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  shaved Parmesan cheese
  1           teaspoon  white wine vinegar
  2             slices  bacon -- cooked, crumbled,
                        reserving the bacon fat
  1              slice  Italian bread
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Trim, wash, and dry the arugula.  Cut the crusts from the bread and cut into cubes.  Peel and crush the garlic.

Heat the butter with the bacon fat in a skillet, add the garlic and then saute the bread cubes until golden brown.  Drain on a paper towel.

Blend the olive oil and vinegar in a bowl, season with salt and pepper, then gently but thoroughly coat the arugula leaves with this dressing.  Cut the bacon into small pieces, add croutons, and mix with the salad.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  The bitterness of the arugula goes well with Wolfgang's Hearty Potato and Cheddar Soup or Chicken with Sweet Corn.

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  large red skin or Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, sliced thin
  1                cup  coarsely-grated Gruyere or Swiss cheese
  1                cup  milk
  1                     egg
  1              pinch  paprika
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Put the potato slices into a large saucepan of salted boiling water and cook for four minutes.  Remove and drain.

Arrange the first layer of sliced potatoes on the bottom of a baking dish.  Cover with about a third of the cheese and a pinch of salt and pepper.  Arrange the second layer of potatoes on top.  Add the another third of the cheese and season with salt and pepper.  Place the final layer of potatoes on top.

Now comes the hard part!  In a small saucepan bring the milk to a boil.  In a mixing bowl whisk the egg for about thirty seconds.  In a steady stream add the hot milk into the egg, continuing to whisk the mixture as you pour.

Pour the mixture over the potatoes, add the remaining cheese, a little salt, pepper, and paprika, and bake in a warm oven for half an hour.  It's ready when the top is golden brown and the potatoes are cooked.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  The perfect accompaniment for Wolfgang's Roast Chicken and Vegetables.

  1              small  onion

  2             medium  carrots -- peeled
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  water
     1/2        gallon  Chicken Stock II -- (see recipe)
                        = (or 1/2 gallon water, 4 bouillon cubes,
                        a pinch of thyme, and 1/2 bay leaf)
  6                     ripe tomatoes -- peeled, seeded
  4             medium  garlic cloves
  30                    fresh basil leaves -- washed, dried
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground blak pepper

Cut the leeks, potato, onion, celery, zucchini, green beans, and carrots into 1/4-inch dice.

In a 6-quart stockpot, combine 3 tablespoons olive oil with 3 tablespoons water.  Add the vegetables and saute, over medium-low heat, until all the water evaporates.  Do not brown the vegetables.

Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Cook at a gentle boil for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, make a puree with the tomatoes, basil leaves, garlic, and remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil.  Add the puree to the cooked soup.  Stir thoroughly.  Do not boil again.

Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve hot or cold from a tureen or in individual bowls.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     bone-in leg of lamb - (3 to 4 lbs)
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2         pound  onion - (1 large) -- coarsely chopped
  1              large  carrot -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1                     celery stalk -- coarsely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1                cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  brown chicken, brown veal or lamb stock
  6             ounces  tomatoes -- ends removed,
                        and coarsely chopped
  5 1/2         ounces  blanched whole almonds -- lightly toasted,
                        see * Note
  8             ounces  California raisins

* Note:  To toast almonds, spread on a baking tray and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven until lightly browned, about 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Lay the lamb out, skin-side down, and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon each cumin and pepper and thyme.  Roll and tie well with butcher's string.  Season the outside lightly with salt and pepper.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in an ovenproof casserole slightly larger than the lamb.  Brown the lamb on all sides, then pour out the oil.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil to the casserole, stir in the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic and, over medium-high heat, cook until the onion has colored slightly, 4 to 5 minutes.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon of cumin and the rosemary, deglaze the pan with the red wine, and bring to a boil.  Pour in the stock, add the tomatoes, season with 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, cover, and transfer to the oven.  Braise until almost tender, about 1 hour.

Remove the meat and keep warm.  With a slotted spoon, separate the vegetable from the sauce and puree in a blender.  Scrape back into the sauce and reduce just until the sauce thickens slightly.  Strain into a clean casserole and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Place the meat in the sauce, surround with the almonds and raisins, and return to the oven for about 15 minutes longer, until the lamb is very tender and the raisins are soft.  (If the sauce thickens too much, thin with a little stock).

Presentation:  Cut the lamb into thin slices and arrange on heated plates.  Spoon some sauce over, placing the raisins on and around the meat.  Serve immediately.  Pass any remaining sauce in a small bowl.

To prepare ahead:  In step 5, strain the sauce into a clean casserole.  At serving time, return the meat to the pan along with the raisins and continue with the recipe.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Line a buttered 10-inch pie dish or flan ring with pastry.  Refrigerate for 1/2 hour.  Line with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or uncooked beans.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes, or until crust is golden.  Let cool.  Remove paper and beans.

Meanwhile, in large stainless steel saucepan, combine sugar syrup, orange peel, Grand Marnier, vanilla bean with scrapings, cinnamon stick and nutmeg.  Bring to boil.  Stir in cranberries then reduce heat and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes or until berries are softened.  Remove vanilla bean and cinnamon stick.

Spread mixture in thin layer on bottom of tart shell.  (Leftover marmalade is good served on side with smoked meat, fowl or curry.)

In a bowl, combine pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and pepper.  Beat in eggs, cream, half-and-half and bourbon.  Pour into pastry shell.  Bake at 375 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes or until set.

Serve with cinnamon ice cream, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Wolfgang Puck is a German-born chef who has made his mark here in California.  He has such goldmines as Spago's in LA and Stars in the City plus a few more salted away around the globe.  This is Wolfgang  Puck's very own 'punkin' pie.  How does it stack up against Grandma's?

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Baking potatoes
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === OPTIONAL TOPPINGS ===
                        Butter
                        Grated cheese
                        Yoghurt
                        Cottage cheese
                        Cream cheese
                        Fromage frais
                        Tofu mayonnaise
                        Chili mayonaisse
                        Chopped scallions
                        Crumbled cooked bacon

This is the simplest possible accompaniment for Wolfgang's hearty soups.  Make sure you scrub the baking potatoes first.  Rub them with a little olive oil and salt.  The secret to great baked potatoes lies in cooking them on a wire rack and never on a solid surface like a baking tray.  Bake them for 50 to 60 minutes at 400 degrees.  You know they're cooked when the flesh 'gives' when you press them.

Now's when the fun starts.  Cut them in two or split them across the top.  Add a little butter, cheese, yoghurt, cottage cheese, cream cheese, fromage frais, tofu mayonnaise, or chili mayonaisse.  Add scallions, bacon, anything that takes your fancy.  If necessary place the potato with the topping under the grill for a couple of minutes to melt the sauce into the potato.  And don't forget the salt and pepper.

This recipe yields ? servings.

Comments:  Baked potatoes go perfectly with Wolfgang's Hearty Vegetable Beef Soup.
