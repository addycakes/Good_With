        Arthur Schwartz's Casserole Of Salt Cod And Potatoes - ...

Recipe By     :Arthur Schwartz
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     medium-large onion -- thinly sliced
  1              large  garlic clove -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  mussillo of salt cod
                        = (weighed after it has soaked for 36
                        hours, and cut into 1/2" thick slices)
     3/4         pound  all-purpose potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" thick slices
  2                     canned peeled plum tomatoes -- with their
                        interior juices
  12                    Gaeta olives -- pitted and halved
  2        tablespoons  salted capers -- thoroughly rinsed
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil

In a deep 10-inch skillet, a saute pan, or a shallow stove-top casserole, which should have a cover and, optimally, should be presentable enough to take to the table, saute the onion and the garlic in the olive oil until the onion is golden, about 8 minutes.  Remove and reserve about half the onion and garlic mixture.

Arrange a layer of salt cod over the onions remaining in the pan, then make a layer of sliced potato.  Spread around the reserved onion mixture.  Cut or crush the tomatoes directly into the pan and spread them around.  Spread around the olives, the capers, and the oregano.  Pour the water over all, then drizzle with the additional tablespoon of olive oil.

Cover and bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Keep the heat adjusted so the dish simmers briskly for about 30 minutes.  In the end, the potatoes should be tender and a flavorful broth will have developed.

Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes, during which time the potatoes will become softer, absorbing some of the juices; the juices left in the pan, although reduced in volume, will become a rosy colored sauce.

For maximum visual effect, bring the pan to the table undisturbed and serve, hot or warm, directly from the pan.  (The longer the dish sits and cools, the fewer, but more viscous the juices, which is actually the way some people prefer it.)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Benevento is often the exception to the rule in Campania.  It was ruled by the Germanic Lombards long after any other part of Southern Italy was.  It was never part of the Kingdom of Naples or the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.  It was still a Papal State at the time of Italian unification in 1860.  And, more to the culinary point, the Beneventani are more likely to combine garlic and onion in one dish when most Campanians would make a face of disgust at the mention of such a thing.  Except for that touch, this could as easily be Neapolitan, or from Salerno.

Mussillo is the center-cut of the cod, a thick and solid cut -- you might say the tenderloin.  North American cod bought in the approximately one-pound box usually provides such a piece; the thinner or scraggly pieces are generally trimmed off and sold as flaked cod.  You will probably have to buy two boxes to get enough for this recipe.  Use the rest to make another recipe with cod.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
  2               cups  arugola leaves -- washed
  2               cups  spinach leaves -- washed
  1                cup  thinly-sliced fresh strawberries
     1/4           cup  diced citron
  2        tablespoons  honey
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

In a small saute pan, melt the butter and toast the pine nuts until they are lightly browned.  Transfer the pine nuts to a small bowl and set aside.

If you have a salad spinner, spin dry the arugola and spinach leaves.  Otherwise wrap the leaves in several layers of paper towels and squeeze on the towels to eliminate excess water.  Tear the leaves into pieces and put them in a salad bowl.  Add the strawberries, and citron.

Heat the honey and balsamic vinegar together in a small saucepan just until the honey melts.  Transfer the mixture to a small bowl and whisk in the olive oil 1 tablespoon at a time until an emulsion is created.  Stir in the salt.

Just before serving, pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently.  Sprinkle the pine nuts over the top and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This arugola, spinach, and strawberry salad is a favorite of diners at the charming and innovative restaurant Osteria la Fontanina in Verona.  It is a nice departure from the traditional insalata verde (mixed salad).  The warm honey and balsamic vinegar dressing is a nice compliment to the spiciness of the arugola.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  pine nuts
                        = (or chopped walnuts)
     3/4         pound  arugula -- stemmed, and
                        torn into pieces
  12            ounces  strawberries -- stemmed, washed,
                        dried, and cut in half
  1                     ripe mango -- peeled, and
                        cut into small pieces
  2             ounces  candied citron -- diced
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt -- or more to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spread the nuts on a baking sheet and toast them for about 5 to 7 minutes, or until they are browned.  Transfer the nuts to a small bowl.

Fill a bowl with cold water and submerge the arugula in it.  Let the arugula soak for 5 to 10 minutes.  Drain, and repeat the process one more time to make sure no dirt or sand remains.  Drain the arugula, spin it dry in a salad spinner or roll it in a towel, pressing as much water out as possible.  Transfer the arugula to a salad bowl.  Add the strawberries, mango, and citron.  Toss the mixture gently.

Pour the orange juice into a small bowl.  Drizzle in the olive oil with a whisk a little at a time until an emulsion is created.  Stir in the salt.

Pour the dressing over the salad and toss it gently.  Sprinkle the nuts over the top and serve immediately.

Note:  Arugula can also be made into a pesto much like the basil version and is delicious over fish or pasta.

Did you know that if you sow arugula seeds in your garden, they will resow themselves year after year?  Antique arugula is very hardy and will last in the garden in northern climates into November.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  My friends Giulia and Mario Cocco live in Verona and are always gracious hosts.  They treat me to large portions of la vera cucina Veronese and we have a good time talking about food and customs.  One day we had a light lunch with a refreshing and elegant-looking salad made with arugula, strawberries, citron, and nuts; it shimmered in a light dressing of extra virgin olive oil and freshly squeezed orange juice.  Arugula is a sharp-tasting green that looks much like the leaves of radish plants and comes in many varieties.  My husband, Guy, covets this plant in his garden, growing several types, including a sawtooth variety known as antique arugula.  Most people I know mix arugula with other greens in order to tame its outrageous peppery taste, but in this salad it stands alone in the salad bowl, beautifully balanced by the sweetness of the fruit and citron.  Citron is available in Italian specialty stores, especially at holiday time, or it can be ordered by catalog.  If it's not available, substitute golden raisins, or diced, mixed candied fruits.

Spread the nuts on a baking sheet and toast them for about 5 to 7 minutes, or until they are browned.  Transfer the nuts to a small bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill a bowl with cold water and submerge the arugula in it.  Let the arugula soak for 5 to 10 minutes.  Drain, and repeat the process one more time to make sure no dirt or sand remains.  Drain the arugula, spin it dry in a salad spinner or roll it in a towel, pressing as much water out as possible.  Transfer the arugula to a salad bowl.  Add the strawberries, mango, and citron.  Toss the mixture gently.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the orange juice into a small bowl.  Drizzle in the olive oil with a whisk a little at a time until an emulsion is created.  Stir in the salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the dressing over the salad and toss it gently.  Sprinkle the nuts over the top and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Arugula can also be made into a pesto much like the basil version and is delicious over fish or pasta.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Did you know that if you sow arugula seeds in your garden, they will resow themselves year after year?  Antique arugula is very hardy and will last in the garden in northern climates into November.
</DirT>

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     red bell peppers - (abt 2 lbs)
  2             pounds  thin asparagus -- stalks trimmed
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste

Preheat the broiler.  Place the peppers on a broiler pan and broil, turning, until blackened all over.  Remove the peppers to a dish and let cool.  Peel, core, and seed the peppers, and cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Brush a cookie sheet with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Place the asparagus on the sheet and turn to coat with the oil.  Roast for 20 to 30 minutes, until a knife is easily inserted in the stalk.

Remove the asparagus to a cutting board, and cut in half.  Place on a platter and add the pepper strips.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup plus 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, the balsamic vinegar, and salt, and toss gently.  Cover and let marinate at room temperature for several hours before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Make this roasted asparagus and sweet red pepper salad early in the day to allow the flavors to mingle.  This salad is very versatile: Serve as part of an antipasto table or instead of a mixed green salad.

       Baked Squid And Scallops - {Calamari E Cappesante Al Forno}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     fresh or frozen squid - (abt 6" long)
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled and minced
  1             medium  onion -- peeled and minced
     1/4         pound  bay scallops
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1           teaspoon  capers in brine -- drained
     1/2           cup  toasted bread crumbs
  2                     plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Clean the squid by pulling the head away from the body, removing the pen (plasticlike bone).  Cut the tentacles below the eyes and save.  Rinse the squid body clean and pull off the outer purple skin and discard.  Drain the squid on paper towels and set aside.  Rinse the tentacles, dice them, and set aside.

In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil.  Add the garlic, onion, and tentacles and saute the mixture for about 4 minutes.  Add the scallops and continue sauteing for 3 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a bowl; add the sea salt, capers, and bread crumbs and mix well.  Divide the mixture and stuff into each squid body.  Close the openings with a toothpick and set aside.

Heat the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet, add the stuffed squid, and brown slowly over low heat for 5 minutes.  Raise the heat to medium, add the tomatoes and wine, and cook for 2 minutes.  Cover the skillet, lower the heat, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the squid are easily pierced with a knife.  Serve immediately with some of the pan juices poured over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Here is a recipe I particularly love when fresh squid are available, although frozen squid may be used.  Actually, there are two types of squid: Calamari and totani.  The calamaro is more tender then the totani.  I use very small calamari for grilling and in seafood salads.  Larger ones are stuffed and baked, or simmered in tomato sauce.  For this recipe, use 5- or 6-inch-long calamari.

          Beef Stew, Lombardy Style - {Stracotto Alla Lombarda}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Italian
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  boneless rump or eye round roast
  2 1/2           cups  dry red wine
                        = (such as Barolo)
  1                cup  diced onion
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled and minced
  1                     celery rib -- diced
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  2                     bay leaves
  2                     whole cloves
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/2           cup  diced pancetta
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the meat in a deep heatproof, noncorrosive casserole just large enough to hold it.  Add the wine, half the onion, and the garlic, celery, nutmeg, bay leaves, and cloves.  Cover the meat and refrigerate several hours or overnight, turning the meat occasionally.

When ready to cook, drain the meat from the marinade and wipe dry.  Drain the vegetables and reserve.  Save the marinade.

Wipe the casserole dry and melt the butter.  Add the pancetta and the remaining onion.  Saute for 3 or 4 minutes or until the pancetta just begins to crisp and the onion is soft.  Transfer the mixture to a plate and reserve.

Rub the meat with the flour and add to the drippings in the casserole.  Brown the meat slowly on all sides.  Return the pancetta mixture to the casserole along with the reserved vegetables.  Cook slowly about 5 to 10 minutes.  Add salt and pepper to taste, and pour in the reserved marinade.  Bring the mixture to the boil, then lower the heat to a simmer, cover the pot, and cook about 2 hours or until the meat is tender.

Remove the meat to a platter.  Remove the bay leaves and cloves and discard.  Place the remaining liquid and vegetables in a food processor or blender and pulse until smooth.  Slice the meat and top with the sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The success of this classic beef stew from Lombardy depends on several things: The marinating time (overnight is best), the use of a good red wine, and the flavoring of the onions with pancetta, or Italian bacon.  Once cooked, the stew is even better the next day, served with slices of golden polenta.

                 Beet Salad - {Insalata Di Barbabietola}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  beets - (4 to 6)
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  crushed garlic
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced fresh mint
                        Salt -- to taste
  2                     hard-boiled eggs -- sliced
  1              small  red-leaf lettuce head -- cleaned, and
                        separated into leaves
                        Mint sprigs -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Remove any leaves from beets and cut the stems, leaving about 2 inches of stem attached.  Wash and dry the beets well.  Wrap each in aluminum foil and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a knife can easily be inserted.  Unwrap and let cool.

In a flat shallow serving dish, mix the remaining ingredients except the eggs, lettuce, and mint sprigs.

Peel the beets, cut off and discard the remaining stems, and slice the beets into 1/4-inch rounds.  Place beets in the marinade and gently toss with a spoon.  Cover the dish and let beets marinate at room temperature for at least 2 hours.

To serve, divide the lettuce leaves among 4 salad plates.  Place some of the beets on top of each dish and garnish with a few egg slices.  Add a mint sprig to each plate, if you wish.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Nothing could get me to eat my grandmother Galasso's beet salad.  Her purple stained fingers were a tip-off that boiled beets were in the refrigerator.  And now, I have trouble getting my family to eat them, so I've dressed them up in a zippy dressing that is very refreshing.  Baking instead of boiling the beets prevents the juices and color from leaching out.

            Belgian Endive, Pomegranate And Orange Salad - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  Belgian endive - (abt 4 small) -- washed
  1                     celery rib -- washed, and
                        cut into thin slices
  6                     Cerigonola olives in brine -- pitted, and
                        cut into slices
  2                     blood or navel oranges -- peeled, and
                        cut into segments
  1         tablespoon  capers in salt -- (optional), rinsed,
                        and diced
     1/2           cup  pomegranate seeds
                        === DRESSING ===
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Cut the endive in half lengthwise, then cut each half in half and separate the leaves from the stem.  Place the leaves in a salad bowl and add the celery, olives, oranges, and capers (if used).

To prepare the dressing, in a bowl whisk the lemon juice, salt, and sugar together.  Slowly pour the olive oil into the lemon mixture, whisking until the mixture thickens a bit and is smooth.

Pour the dressing over the salad and toss.  Sprinkle on the pomegranate seeds and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Looking at the surrounding pristine countryside of Sicily from the belvedere in Enna gives one a sense of why this city was envied for its invincible location high atop a mountain perch.  On Enna's street corners are peddlers with cartfuls of broccolo (Cauliflower) for purchase.  Long as a baseball bat, zucchine lunge (long zucchini) is available too, as are creamy white, tight heads of Belgian endive.  The Ennese make a wonderful salad using endive, pomegranate seeds, and blood orange segments.  The pomegranates and oranges are very refreshing with a sweet-tart flavor.  Since pomegranates are not available year-round, I buy them in season, extract the seeds, and freeze them.  That way I can enjoy the salad all year long; it is particularly attractive at Christmastime.  If you cannot find blood oranges, use navel oranges instead.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  top round roast
  2                     garlic cloves -- slivered
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- diced
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  minced flat-leaf parsley
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh basil
  1              large  carrot -- peeled and shredded
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  dry red wine

Dry the roast well with paper towels.  Make slits all over the roast and insert the garlic slivers.  Rub the roast with salt and pepper.

In a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Brown the roast slowly on all sides.  Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes, or until they begin to wilt.  Add the vinegar, parsley, basil, and carrot, and cook for 5 minutes.

Mix the tomato paste and wine together in a small bowl and add to the roast.  Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for about 1 hour and 45 minutes, or until a knife is easily inserted into the meat.

Remove the meat to a cutting board and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.  Strain the pan juices through a sieve set over a bowl, pressing on the solids with a wooden spoon to extract as much liquid as possible.  Set the pot aside.

Cut the roast into 1/4-inch slices.  Return the meat to the pot, add the strained juices, and bring the juices to a simmer.  Serve immediately, with some of the juices poured over the meat.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I make this braised roast using an old homemade red wine vinegar, but any good-quality commercial brand will lend the right zing to the sauce.

                    Broccoli And Borlotti Salad - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  borlotti (cranberry) beans or chickpeas -- soaked overnight
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  hot red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1              pound  broccoli -- cut into 1" florets

Drain the beans, rinse, place in a pot, and cover with cold water.  Bring the beans to a boil and cook for about 35 to 45 minutes, or until tender but not mushy.  They should remain firm to the bite.  Drain the beans and set aside.

While the beans are cooking, make the dressing.  In a serving dish, large enough to hold the beans and broccoli, mix 7 tablespoons of olive oil, lemon juice, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and parsley.

Place the broccoli in a large pot of boiling water.  Add the remaining tablespoon olive oil.  Do not cover the pot.  Cook the broccoli until a knife is easily inserted into the stem end, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Carefully drain the broccoli and cool to room temperature.

Add the beans and the broccoli to the dressing.  Toss gently to coat the vegetables well.  Cover the dish and let the vegetables marinate at room temperature for several hours, stirring often.

Note:  Adding a little olive oil to the cooking water when boiling green vegetables helps retain their color.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  It always puzzled me as to why I did not see broccoli in many markets in northern and central Italy.  I learned that broccoli is regarded as a southern Italian vegetable, appearing in the cooler months of the year.

In this recipe, broccoli is boiled and then served cold, combined with borlotti beans.  You can also use chickpeas in place of the borlotti.  Soak the beans the night before you plan to make the salad; otherwise they will take about an hour to cook.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
     3/4           cup  honey
                        Grated zest of 4 oranges
  4        tablespoons  wine vinegar
  7        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  2               cups  seedless green grapes -- washed, and
                        stems removed
                        === CAPON ===
  1              pound  arugula -- stemmed, washed,
                        and dried
  1              whole  capon - (abt 9 lbs) -- washed and dried
  3                     celery ribs -- washed and trimmed
  2              large  carrots scraped
  1              large  onion -- peeled, and
                        cut into quarters
  1              large  bay leaf
  20                    whole cloves
  12             whole  black peppercorns
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley

For the Sauce:  Pour the raisins into a small bowl and cover them with boiling water.  Let the raisins soak for 1 hour.  Drain the raisins and set aside.

In a separate bowl, mix the honey, zest, wine vinegar, and salt.  Whisk in the olive oil a few drops at a time until an emulsion, or thick blended sauce, is obtained.  Transfer the sauce to a small saucepan and stir in the raisins.  The sauce can be prepared up to three days in advance.

For the Capon:  Stack the arugula leaves in small bunches on a cutting board.  Roll the leaves tightly up like a cigar and cut thin crosswise strips no wider than 1/8-inch.  These strips are known as a chiffonnade.  Transfer the chiffonnade to a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate.

Place the capon and the rest of the ingredients in a 10-quart soup pan.  Fill with water to cover the ingredients.  Cover the pot and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat to simmer and cook the capon for 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours, or until a fork inserted near the leg bone can easily detach it.  As the soup cooks, use a skimmer to remove any foam that accumulates on the top of the broth.

Remove the capon to a dish and let cool.  Strain the soup into a large bowl, pressing on the solids to extract the juices.  Discard the solids.  Stir in the parsley and adjust for salt.  The broth can be used as is, with pasta or vegetables or frozen for future use.

Cut the capon into serving pieces, removing the bones, and place the pieces on a platter.  Slowly reheat the sauce.  Stir in the grapes.  Transfer the sauce to a sauce bowl.  Serve the capon with some of the sauce and sprinkle a little of the chiffonnade over the top.

Note:  The capon can be cooked a day ahead, removed from the broth and wrapped in foil and refrigerated.  Chill the broth overnight to make it easier to remove any fat that has accumulated at the top of the broth.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  One day, while staying at my friend Giulia's house in Verona, I received a phone call from Marilisa Allegrini, inviting me to visit the Allegrini winery for a private tasting and lunch.  What a perfect plan for a picture-perfect day in the Veneto region of Italy.  Naturally I said yes, and it did not take much coaxing to get Giulia to come along as well.  Marilisa is the sixth generation of her family to make wine and we sampled Recioto della Valpolicella Amarone, as well as others.  Invented by the Greeks, Recioto is a method of picking and drying grapes until they are shriveled; this concentrates the sugar producing wine with deeper flavor.  After the tasting we had a delightful lunch at Trattoria alla Coa.  A sampling of the house pastas included homemade tagliolini, strands of pasta as thin as dental floss dressed in a butter sauce with specks of fresh black truffles grated over the top.  When fresh truffles are in season these agnolotti are referred to as gioielli -- jewels.  The second course, cappone agrodolce, capon in a sweet-and-sour honey sauce, stays in my mind as a culinary triumph.  Capon is a castrated male chicken that produces a delicate-textured meat with mild flavor.  The delicacy of the meat paired with the sweet sauce and topped with sharp-tasting shreds of arugola was extraordinary.  Order capons from a butcher.  If you do not have a butcher, ask your grocery store to carry them or order them by mail from Balducci's*.  This dish can also be made by substituting a free-range chicken such as one from Bell and Evans.  Here is my re-creation of this wonderful dish.

          Carp With Rosemary And Fennel - {Regina In Porchetta}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Fish (Ocean)
                Italian                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  whole cleaned carp
                        = (or farm-raised trout or sea bass)
     1/4         pound  cooked ham -- (optional)
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary -- needles only
  1         tablespoon  fresh fennel seeds
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled
                        Juice of 1 lemon
     1/4           cup  Colavita extra-virgin olive oil
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Wash and dry the fish in and out and set aside.

Mince the ham, rosemary, fennel seeds, and garlic together in a food processor until a paste is formed.  Stuff the paste into the cavity of the fish and place the fish in a lightly oiled baking dish large enough to hold it.

In a small bowl whisk together the lemon juice and the olive oil until an emulsion is formed.  Add salt to taste.

Bake the fish for 30 minutes, basting occasionally with the lemon and olive oil mixture.  Carefully transfer the fish to a cutting board; remove the head and discard.  Scrape the skin away from the fish and discard it.  Carefully remove the filling from the cavity and place on a serving platter; remove the fish meat with a couple of soup spoons and serve immediately along with some of the filling.  Pass lemon wedges on the side for sprinkling on top of the fish.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Comments:  Regina in porchetta is that lovely classical Umbrian fish dish made with carp so revered by the fishermen of Isola Maggiore but, if that is not available, use whole farm-raised trout or sea bass.  The delicacy of the fish is balanced by the savory stuffing of rosemary and fennel seeds, reminiscent of the preparation used for stuffing pork, hence the name "in porchetta".  This is such an easy dish to prepare for company that it will become a favorite!

Wash and dry the fish in and out and set aside.

<DirT>
Mince the ham, rosemary, fennel seeds, and garlic together in a food processor until a paste is formed.  Stuff the paste into the cavity of the fish and place the fish in a lightly oiled baking dish large enough to hold it.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl whisk together the lemon juice and the olive oil until an emulsion is formed.  Add salt to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the fish for 30 minutes, basting occasionally with the lemon and olive oil mixture.  Carefully transfer the fish to a cutting board; remove the head and discard.  Scrape the skin away from the fish and discard it.  Carefully remove the filling from the cavity and place on a serving platter; remove the fish meat with a couple of soup spoons and serve immediately along with some of the filling.  Pass lemon wedges on the side for sprinkling on top of the fish.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Comments:  Regina in porchetta is that lovely classical Umbrian fish dish made with carp so revered by the fishermen of Isola Maggiore but, if that is not available, use whole farm-raised trout or sea bass.  The delicacy of the fish is balanced by the savory stuffing of rosemary and fennel seeds, reminiscent of the preparation used for stuffing pork, hence the name &quot;in porchetta&quot;.  This is such an easy dish to prepare for company that it will become a favorite!

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  yellow bell pepper
  2             pounds  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 3"-long matchstick pieces
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
     1/4           cup  minced fresh mint
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  Raspberry-Mint Vinegar -- (see recipe)
                        = (or other fruit-flavored vinegar)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  1               head  red leaf or curly green lettuce -- leaves separated,
                        washed, and dried

Preheat the broiler.  Place the pepper on the broiler pan and broil it, turning, until the skin is blackened all over.  Place the pepper in a paper bag and let cool.  When cool, peel, core, and seed the pepper and cut into thin strips.  Place the pepper strips in a glass dish large enough to hold the carrots.

Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil.  Add the carrots and cook until just tender.  Drain well and add to the peppers.

Add the shallots and mint, then add the olive oil, vinegar, and sugar and toss gently to coat the carrots and peppers with the dressing.  Cover the dish and let marinate for several hours at room temperature, or overnight in the refrigerator (bring to room temperature before serving).

To serve, line a platter with the lettuce leaves.  Arrange the carrot salad on top.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Crisp-tender carrots marinated with shallots, roasted sweet yellow peppers, and raspberry-mint vinegar make an eye-appealing salad for a picnic or spring luncheon.

                   Chicken Breast With White Wine - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Italian
                Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              whole  chicken breasts -- boned and skinned
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  flour -- for dredging
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  6                     garlic cloves -- cut into thin slices
  8              large  sage leaves
  1                cup  dry white wine

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut the chicken breasts horizontally into 2-inch wide strips.

Mix flour, salt and pepper on a plate.  Dredge each chicken strip in the flour mixture and set aside on a plate.

Pour the olive oil into a large baking pan or use two smaller ones to hold the pieces in a single layer and divide the ingredients between the two pans.  Scatter the butter, garlic, and sage leaves over the oil.  Lay the chicken strips on top.  Bake until browned, turning the strips once.

Add the wine and continue to bake for another 15 to 20 minutes until the wine has cooked down and forms a sauce.  Serve the chicken with some of the juices poured over the strips.

Note:  You must be prepared when dealing with raw chicken or meat.  Get everything you need for the recipe before you begin to cook.  Prepare everything called for, saving the chicken as the last to be prepped.  Have paper towels handy so you do not contaminate the kitchen area as you work.  After the dish is ready, wash your hands in hot soapy water and disinfect the sink and counter areas where you have worked.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I was truly spoiled by the food served at Spannocchia.  Everything was, to use a cliche, "right off the farm", so it was the freshest it could be.  I fell in love with this delicious and easy to prepare chicken dish flavored with wine and sage that Graziella and Gaetana prepared one night for dinner.  Of course the quality of the chicken is critical.  On the farm, chickens are fed natural grains and are allowed to wander here and there.  So if you try this recipe, use free-range chicken if possible; you will definitely taste a difference.

             Chicken Cooked Under Bricks - {Pollo Al Mattone}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Italian
                Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Juice of 2 lemons
  2          teaspoons  hot red pepper flakes
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarse sea salt
  4             pounds  roasting chicken -- split in half
  3                     clean bricks - (to 4) -- each wrapped in
                        aluminum foil

Prepare the grill.

In a large shallow bowl, combine the lemon juice, red pepper flakes, pepper, and salt.  Coat each side of the chicken halves with the mixture, then place them directly on the grill and position the bricks on top of each half.

Grill carefully, watching and regulating the heat as necessary to avoid flare-ups.  Remove the bricks using oven mitts.  Use tongs to turn the chicken once to cook on the other side.  Reposition the bricks on top of the chicken.  When a fork easily pierces the chicken and the juices run clear, remove the bricks, transfer the chicken to a cutting board and cut it into pieces.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Pollo al mattone, chicken cooked under bricks, is said to have originated in Impruneta, the town near Florence famous all over the world for its beautifully made terra cotta tiles.  According to tradition, this dish was made for the feast of San Luca, the town's patron.  The method of grilling the chicken with a weight on it allows the bird to keep contact with the grill and cook evenly.  At one time heavy terra cotta pots were used to weigh the chicken down.  Even if you do not have a fireplace grill like "G's", you can achieve the same results on a really hot outdoor grill, about 500 degrees.

                    Chicken In Wine - {Pollo Al Vino}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Italian
                Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/4         pounds  small cut-up bone-in chicken
                        = (free-range preferable)
  2 1/2           cups  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  white vinegar
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/2         pound  onions -- peeled and chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  crushed juniper berries
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of fresh black pepper
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar

Two days before cooking the chicken, place the pieces in a large glass or ceramic baking dish large enough to hold the pieces in a single layer.  Pour 1 1/2 cups of the wine and the white vinegar over the chicken, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate.

When ready to cook, drain the chicken and dry the pieces well on paper toweling.  Set them aside.  Discard the wine-vinegar mixture.

In a large saute pan large enough to hold all the pieces, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter, add the onions, and saute until they become soft and translucent but not brown.  Remove the onions to a dish.

Add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the pan and the chicken pieces skin-side down.  Brown the chicken quickly on all sides.  Return the onions to the pan, sprinkle the chicken with the juniper berries, salt, and pepper.  Lower the heat and pour in the remaining 1 1/4 cups wine.  Cover the pan and cook the chicken over low heat for 15 minutes.  Uncover the pan and continue cooking over low heat for another 20 minutes, turning the pieces occasionally.

Add the balsamic vinegar, raise the heat to medium, and continue cooking an additional 5 minutes.  Serve the chicken with some of the pan juices.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I have been stumped trying to duplicate my family's chicken in wine dish for as long as I have been in the kitchen.  No one remembers exactly how my Grandmother Saporito achieved that fabulous glazed chicken with the bones permeated with wine flavor.  No amount of nostalgic recollecting or toying with ingredients could come close to the taste of hers.  She butchered her own chickens and made her own wine, and I believe that accounts for the difference.  In another attempt at her recipe, I have created this chicken in wine dish, using free-range chicken, which I feel has better flavor and stands up over the long cooking process.  Begin by marinating the chicken pieces in dry white wine for 2 days.  Following this step will leave the meat with a rich wine taste after it is cookedÖbut it still does not compare with Grandma's.

Two days before cooking the chicken, place the pieces in a large glass or ceramic baking dish large enough to hold the pieces in a single layer.  Pour 1 1/2 cups of the wine and the white vinegar over the chicken, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to cook, drain the chicken and dry the pieces well on paper toweling.  Set them aside.  Discard the wine-vinegar mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large saute pan large enough to hold all the pieces, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter, add the onions, and saute until they become soft and translucent but not brown.  Remove the onions to a dish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the pan and the chicken pieces skin-side down.  Brown the chicken quickly on all sides.  Return the onions to the pan, sprinkle the chicken with the juniper berries, salt, and pepper.  Lower the heat and pour in the remaining 1 1/4 cups wine.  Cover the pan and cook the chicken over low heat for 15 minutes.  Uncover the pan and continue cooking over low heat for another 20 minutes, turning the pieces occasionally.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the balsamic vinegar, raise the heat to medium, and continue cooking an additional 5 minutes.  Serve the chicken with some of the pan juices.

Comments:  I have been stumped trying to duplicate my family&apos;s chicken in wine dish for as long as I have been in the kitchen.  No one remembers exactly how my Grandmother Saporito achieved that fabulous glazed chicken with the bones permeated with wine flavor.  No amount of nostalgic recollecting or toying with ingredients could come close to the taste of hers.  She butchered her own chickens and made her own wine, and I believe that accounts for the difference.  In another attempt at her recipe, I have created this chicken in wine dish, using free-range chicken, which I feel has better flavor and stands up over the long cooking process.  Begin by marinating the chicken pieces in dry white wine for 2 days.  Following this step will leave the meat with a rich wine taste after it is cookedÖbut it still does not compare with Grandma&apos;s.

       Classic Fish Stew From Livorno - {Cacciucco Alla Livornese}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  onion -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/4           cup  parsley leaves
  8                     basil leaves
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  hot red pepper flakes
     2/3           cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  diced peeled plum tomatoes
  1                cup  clam juice, fish bouillon or water
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt -- or more to taste
     1/2         pound  cleaned squid -- cut into 1" rings
     1/2         pound  swordfish -- skinned, and
                        cut into 1" chunks
     1/2         pound  medium shrimp - (abt 13) -- shelled
                        = (or bite-size pieces of cod or
                        other firm fish)
     1/4         pound  sea scallops
     1/4         pound  monk fish
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  8                     toasted bread slices

In a food processor or by hand, mince the onion, garlic, parsley and basil together.  Heat the oil in a heavy-duty pot and stir in the minced onion mixture.  Cook over low heat until the ingredients soften, then stir in the pepper flakes and cook 1 minute longer.

Raise the heat to high, pour in the wine and allow most of it to evaporate.  Lower heat and stir in the tomatoes, clam juice and salt.  When bubbles just begin to appear on the sides of the pot, begin adding the fish pieces in the order given, allowing the squid to cook for 5 minutes before adding the swordfish.  Cook just until the fish turns opaque or whitish looking and flakes easily with a fork and the shrimp have turned pink.  Stir in the lemon juice and correct the salt, if necessary.

Ladle the soup over the toasted bread slices and serve piping hot.

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

Comments:  This dish originated with fishermen in Livorno; they sold the best of their catch and used what was left over and unwanted at day's end to make fish stew.  A variety of fish went into the pot including squid, monkfish and cod.  Tradition dictates that at least 5 different types of fish be used, one for each of the "c"s in the word cacciucco, which means mixture.  In this preparation start by adding he fish that takes the longest to cook.  Make sure all the fish is cut the same size to keep down cooking time.  This dish from start to finish should take about 25 minutes and is even better the next day.  Crackling, crusty bread and a crisp salad make the meal both wholesome and complete.  This stew is usually cooked in an earthenware pot atop the stove.  Use your heaviest pot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1              large  white onion -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  minced Italian parsley
  4              large  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  3               cups  hot water
  3             pounds  fresh cod fillets -- cut into chunks
                        with skin attached
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
     1/4           cup  raisins
                        Fine salt -- to taste
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper

In a soup pot heat the olive oil, stir in the onions, and cook over medium heat until they are wilted down but not browned.  Stir in the parsley and potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden brown.

Add the water and stir the ingredients.  Place the codfish chunks on top of the mixture and sprinkle on the pine nuts and raisins.  Cover the pot and allow to cook for 15 minutes.

Uncover the pot, stir the ingredients carefully, and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Ladle the fish into soup bowls and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Gloucester, Massachusetts, is a fishing community and home to nearly thirty-two thousand Sicilians who settled there to make their living from the sea much as they had done in their native Sicily.  The life of a fisherman is physically exhausting and very dangerous, as evidenced by the community's monuments dedicated to fisherman.  For an introductory segment on fresh codfish for one of my programs, I traveled to Gloucester to cook with Angela Orlando Sanfilippo, president and CEO of the Fishermen's Wives Association.  Angela was born in Porticello, Sicily, and is an expert on all kinds of fish and seafood cookery.  She is a national spokesperson and activist for reform and fairness in the fishing industry.  One of her most requested recipes is baccala in bianco (fresh codfish stew).  She begins with a soffritto, a saute of onions and potatoes that becomes the base for a stew in which water is the only liquid.  Pine nuts and raisins, two typical ingredients of many Sicilian dishes, are added when the stew is served.  When I sampled the dish, I knew it would become a favorite.  The broth was light, the fish meaty and delicate, and the seasonings perfect.  The dish can also be made with dried and rehydrated codfish, but the taste will be very different.

                 Cold Codfish And Cauliflower Salad - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Salads/Dressings                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  dried salted cod
  1               head  cauliflower -- trimmed, and
                        cut into small florets
                        Water for cooking the cauliflower
  2               cups  water for cooking the cod
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Juice of one large lemon
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  Sicilian green olives in brine -- pitted, and
                        coarsely chopped
     1/3           cup  minced Italian parsley

Place the codfish in the kitchen sink and allow tap water to drip on it for a day to rehydrate it.  Or immerse it in a pan of water and change the water several times during the day(s) until the fish is refreshed and plump.  During the process, rinse the fish 4 or 5 times under cold water to rid it of the salt.

Fill a 2-quart saucepan with 2 cups of water.  Place a steamer basket in the pot and pile the florets in the basket.  Cover the pan and bring the water to a boil.  Lower the heat, and steam-cook the florets until they are tender but not mushy.  This will take about 5 to 6 minutes.  Or cook the florets in 2 quarts of boiling water until tender if you do not have a steamer basket.  Drain the florets in a colander and transfer them to a large bowl to cool.

Transfer the codfish to a saute pan, add the 2 cups of water, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and the lemon juice.  Cover the pan and cook the fish over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, or until it easily flakes when pierced with a fork.  Drain the baccala with a slotted spoon and transfer it to the bowl with the florets.

Mix the remaining olive oil with the vinegar, salt, and pepper and pour over the fish and cauliflower mixture.  Add the olives and parsley and toss gently.  Serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  My husband's mother, Antoinette Esposito, was fond of this cold codfish salad with cauliflower, which she served during Lent and occasionally on Friday nights.  You can find dried salted cod on display in Italian grocery stores and in some Asian markets.  Grocery stores also carry salted cod in wooden boxes.  Since the codfish will need to be rehydrated, start the process two days ahead.  Remember to change the soaking water frequently or allow sufficient time for tap water to slowly drip on the fish and refresh it completely.  This is a wonderful and filling salad for a hot summer day.  Serve it with crusty bread.

Place the codfish in the kitchen sink and allow tap water to drip on it for a day to rehydrate it.  Or immerse it in a pan of water and change the water several times during the day(s) until the fish is refreshed and plump.  During the process, rinse the fish 4 or 5 times under cold water to rid it of the salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill a 2-quart saucepan with 2 cups of water.  Place a steamer basket in the pot and pile the florets in the basket.  Cover the pan and bring the water to a boil.  Lower the heat, and steam-cook the florets until they are tender but not mushy.  This will take about 5 to 6 minutes.  Or cook the florets in 2 quarts of boiling water until tender if you do not have a steamer basket.  Drain the florets in a colander and transfer them to a large bowl to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the codfish to a saute pan, add the 2 cups of water, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and the lemon juice.  Cover the pan and cook the fish over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, or until it easily flakes when pierced with a fork.  Drain the baccala with a slotted spoon and transfer it to the bowl with the florets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix the remaining olive oil with the vinegar, salt, and pepper and pour over the fish and cauliflower mixture.  Add the olives and parsley and toss gently.  Serve at room temperature.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  My husband&apos;s mother, Antoinette Esposito, was fond of this cold codfish salad with cauliflower, which she served during Lent and occasionally on Friday nights.  You can find dried salted cod on display in Italian grocery stores and in some Asian markets.  Grocery stores also carry salted cod in wooden boxes.  Since the codfish will need to be rehydrated, start the process two days ahead.  Remember to change the soaking water frequently or allow sufficient time for tap water to slowly drip on the fish and refresh it completely.  This is a wonderful and filling salad for a hot summer day.  Serve it with crusty bread.

Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Rabbit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  rabbit pieces
     1/4         pound  pancetta or salt pork -- diced
                        Juice of 1 large lemon
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped onions
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  fresh rosemary
                        = (or a teaspoon dried salt and
                        freshly-ground black pepper)
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        = (preferably Soave)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  shelled fresh peas

Place the rabbit pieces in a bowl and add cold water to cover.  Add the lemon juice and refrigerate, covered, overnight.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Remove the rabbit pieces from the water and dry well.  Combine the flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and lightly flour the rabbit pieces.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the rabbit pieces and brown them on all sides.  Add the pancetta or salt pork and saute for 2 minutes.  Sprinkle with the rosemary and remove from heat.

Spread the onions in the bottom of a baking dish.  Arrange the rabbit pieces, with pancetta or salt pork, on top.  Add the wine, peas, and salt and pepper to taste.  Cover the dish with foil and bake for 35 minutes, or until the rabbit pieces are tender.

Serve in the baking dish or transfer the rabbit to a serving platter and spoon the vegetables and pan juices over.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Southern Italians are very fond of country-style rabbit dishes.  In Sorrento, you begin the preparation for the following dish by making a visit to the market to pick out a fresh rabbit.  Then it must be cleaned, cut into pieces, and soaked to remove some of its gaminess.

We do not have the same demand for rabbit as in Italy, but if you can find it fresh rather then frozen, you will be surprised at how delicate this dish is.

              Farro Salad From Tuscany - {Insalata Di Farro}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  farro
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  8                     cherry tomatoes -- halved
     2/3           cup  shredded arugula leaves
                        Grated pecorino cheese

The fast way to cook farro is to cover it with water the night before you plan to cook it; next day drain off the water and put the farro in a 1-quart saucepan.  Cover it with fresh water and cook until it is tender but not mushy.  This will take about 15 minutes.  Drain and transfer to a bowl.  Farro can be cooked without presoaking but will need a longer cooking time, about 30 minutes.

Pour the olive oil over the farro and mix it well to coat the grains.  Stir in the salt and vinegar.  Divide the farro among 4 salad plates.  Sprinkle the arugula evenly among the plates.  Place 4 tomato halves on each plate and sprinkle with the cheese.

Pass more olive oil at the table to drizzle on top.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Wednesday night is pizza night at Spannocchia, when the outdoor wood burning oven is fired up and farmhands and guests sit at long communal wooden tables to enjoy gorgonzola and pear pizza, eggplant pizza, four cheese pizza, and even hot dog and pineapple pizza!  They also help themselves to farro salad made from the farro grown in the campo (field) on the farm.  It is delicious and nutritious.

                 Farro With Cod - {Farrotto Con Merluzzo}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  skinless cod
  3               cups  water
     1/2           cup  farro
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2               cups  diced leeks
  1                     carrot -- scraped and diced
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
  2               cups  vegetable or chicken broth
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of black pepper
  2        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice

Simmer the cod in the water in a saute pan just until the fish turns milky-white and easily flakes.  Drain the fish with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl.  With a fork, flake the fish and set aside.

Melt the butter over medium heat in a copper or heavy-clad 2-quart pot.  Stir in the farro, leeks, carrots, and parsley, and cook the mixture, stirring frequently, to coat all the grains.

When the leeks are wilted and soft, slowly pour in 1/2 cup of the broth and stir the mixture until all the broth is absorbed.  Continue adding small amounts of liquid, allowing the grain to absorb each  Add the wine and cook the mixture just until the grains are no longer hard; they should remain firm but cooked.

Gently stir in the cod and cook slowly just until the mixture is hot.  Stir in the salt, pepper and lemon juice.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Farro is extremely nutritious and versatile, perfect in many recipes.  In this version, poached cod is added to the cooked farro at the last minute.  It is called farrotto because the cooking process is similar to making a risotto in which Arborio rice is lightly toasted in melted butter in a pot before liquids are added.  Viewers who request really healthy food will enjoy this well-balanced dish that is high in essential vitamins and nutrients.  It makes a good main course served with a side dish of steamed Swiss chard and a green salad.

Simmer the cod in the water in a saute pan just until the fish turns milky-white and easily flakes.  Drain the fish with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl.  With a fork, flake the fish and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt the butter over medium heat in a copper or heavy-clad 2-quart pot.  Stir in the farro, leeks, carrots, and parsley, and cook the mixture, stirring frequently, to coat all the grains.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the leeks are wilted and soft, slowly pour in 1/2 cup of the broth and stir the mixture until all the broth is absorbed.  Continue adding small amounts of liquid, allowing the grain to absorb each  Add the wine and cook the mixture just until the grains are no longer hard; they should remain firm but cooked.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Gently stir in the cod and cook slowly just until the mixture is hot.  Stir in the salt, pepper and lemon juice.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Farro is extremely nutritious and versatile, perfect in many recipes.  In this version, poached cod is added to the cooked farro at the last minute.  It is called farrotto because the cooking process is similar to making a risotto in which Arborio rice is lightly toasted in melted butter in a pot before liquids are added.  Viewers who request really healthy food will enjoy this well-balanced dish that is high in essential vitamins and nutrients.  It makes a good main course served with a side dish of steamed Swiss chard and a green salad.

                      Fennel And Orange Salad - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  blood or navel oranges
  1             medium  fennel bulb -- trimmed, and
                        cut into thin strips
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced fennel leaves
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped walnuts
     1/2           cup  Colavita extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
                        Romaine lettuce leaves

Peel the oranges and remove as much of the pith (white membrane) as possible.  Slice the oranges into thin rounds and place them in a shallow dish, slightly overlapping them.  Sprinkle over the fennel strips, fennel leaves, and walnuts.  Drizzle the olive oil over, and sprinkle with salt and cracked pepper.

Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let the salad stand at room temperature for several hours.  Every so often, tilt and turn the dish so that the oil and juices that have collected flow over and around the oranges.

To serve, arrange the salad on a bed of Romaine lettuce and pour the juices over.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This Sicilian salad is colorful and unusual.  My grandmother used to tell us that when there was nothing to eat in Sicily, there were always tarocchi, or blood oranges, so called because of their deep red color.  Blood oranges are available in late June and early July, but when I can't get them, I use navel oranges.

                     Fish Cakes - {Polpette Di Pesce}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  soft fresh bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  milk
  3              large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  grated Pecorino Romano cheese
  1              pound  fresh monkfish, haddock, swordfish, or
                        cod fillets
  3               cups  water
     1/4      teaspoon  coarse salt
  1              small  carrot -- peeled
  1              small  onion -- peeled, quartered
     1/4           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 1/3)
     3/4           cup  fine bread crumbs
  2               cups  vegetable oil - (to 3) -- for frying
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

In a bowl, moisten the fresh bread crumbs with the milk.  Mix in 1 egg, sea salt, pepper, parsley, and cheese.  Set aside.

Place the fish in a shallow pan with the water, coarse salt, carrot, and onion; simmer until fish easily flakes, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Carefully lift the fish out of the water with a strainer, place in a bowl, and cool to room temperature.  Dice the carrot and add to the bread crumb mixture.  Discard the water and onion.  Flake the fish with a fork, then add it to the bread crumb mixture and mix well.

Have ready a plate with the flour, and one with the fine bread crumbs.  In a small bowl, beat the remaining eggs.

Divide the fish mixture evenly into 8 balls, forming them with your hands.  Roll each ball in the flour and shake off the excess.  Coat the balls in the beaten egg, then roll them in the bread crumbs, coating them evenly.  Place the balls on a plate and press down slightly with your hand to flatten a little.

In a deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat the vegetable oil to 375 degrees.  Fry the fish cakes in the oil until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Drain on brown paper and serve hot, accompanied by lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Fish cakes are a frequent meal at our house during Lent.  You can vary the type of fish, but I like using monkfish, which is very firm.  Other choices include haddock and cod or even leftover cooked fish.

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

                Pork                            Sausage

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Natural hog casings -- as needed
  5             pounds  boneless pork butt -- ground
  2        tablespoons  fine sea salt
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  fennel seeds
  1         tablespoon  hot red pepper flakes - (to 2)

In a bowl, soak 3 or 4 casings in several changes of cold water for about 10 minutes to remove the salt.  If the casings are very long, cut them into 24-inch segments.

In a large bowl, combine the pork with all the remaining ingredients and mix well.  Test a small piece for seasoning by frying it in a hot skillet, and correct the seasoning if necessary.

Drain the casings.  Slip one end of a casing over the narrow opening of a sausage funnel.  Place the funnel under the faucet and run cold water through it.  With your hands, slide the casing up onto the funnel, leaving about 2 inches free at the end.  Remove the funnel from the faucet and tie a knot in the end.

Push the sausage mixture, a little at a time, through the funnel with your thumbs, and fill the casing, leaving about 2 inches free at the end.  Tie a knot in the end and release any air bubbles in the casing by pricking it with a sterilized safety pin.  Repeat with the remaining meat.

To bake the sausages, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place the sausages in a baking dish and add just enough water to cover the bottom of the pan.  Bake, uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes, or until nicely browned.  As excess water and fat accumulate in the pan, drain it off; after about 20 minutes, the sausage will begin to brown in its own juices.

Remove the sausage to paper towels to drain.  Cut into pieces and serve.

To fry, place the sausages in a large skillet and add just enough water to cover the bottom of the pan.  Cook over medium heat, turning occasionally, for about 20 minutes, or until browned.  As excess water and fat accumulate in the pan, pour them off.

Cut into pieces and serve.

This recipe yields 5 pounds.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Italian
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  top round steak or flank steak -- cut abt 1/4" thick
                        Salt -- as needed
  1         tablespoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  3                     garlic cloves -- cut thin slivers
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
     1/2           cup  grated Pecorino Romano cheese
  1              small  red onion -- thinly sliced
  3                     hard-boiled eggs -- shelled, optional
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  lard or butter
  4               cups  crushed fresh or canned plum tomatoes
                        = (abt 8 medium tomatoes)
     1/2           cup  water
  1                cup  dry red wine
  1                     bay leaf
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Lay the meat out flat and pound it with a meat hammer to flatten it slightly to a uniform thickness.  Be careful not to tear the meat.  (It will be a little more difficult to do this with flank steak.)

Wipe the meat dry with paper towels.  Rub it all over with 1 teaspoon salt and the coarse pepper.  Sprinkle the slivers of garlic evenly over the meat, then scatter over the parsley, cheese, and onion.  Place the eggs lengthwise down the center of the meat so they are touching each other.  Starting at a long side, roll up the meat like a jelly roll.  Tie the roll with string at 1-inch intervals.

In a large deep saucepan, heat the olive oil and lard or butter over medium-high heat.  Add the chopped garlic and saute until soft.  Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and discard.  Add the meat to the pan and brown it on all sides.  Lower the heat to medium-low and add all the remaining ingredients; add salt to taste.  Stir to blend well.  Simmer the meat, covered for 1 1/2 hours, or until tender.

Remove the meat from the sauce and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.  Remove the strings and cut into 1/2-inch slices.  Arrange on a serving platter, spoon the sauce over, and serve immediately with pasta.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Grandma Gallasso's braciolone, or rolled stuffed beef, was a great favorite in our house.  Round or flank steak was sprinkled with slivers of garlic, then stuffed, rolled and tied, browned, and cooked in tomato sauce.  The only thing I did not like was the hard-boiled eggs Grandma put in the center; when I make the dish, I leave them out.

Lay the meat out flat and pound it with a meat hammer to flatten it slightly to a uniform thickness.  Be careful not to tear the meat.  (It will be a little more difficult to do this with flank steak.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wipe the meat dry with paper towels.  Rub it all over with 1 teaspoon salt and the coarse pepper.  Sprinkle the slivers of garlic evenly over the meat, then scatter over the parsley, cheese, and onion.  Place the eggs lengthwise down the center of the meat so they are touching each other.  Starting at a long side, roll up the meat like a jelly roll.  Tie the roll with string at 1-inch intervals.
</DirT>

In a large deep saucepan, heat the olive oil and lard or butter over medium-high heat.  Add the chopped garlic and saute until soft.  Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and discard.  Add the meat to the pan and brown it on all sides.  Lower the heat to medium-low and add all the remaining ingredients; add salt to taste.  Stir to blend well.  Simmer the meat, covered for 1 1/2 hours, or until tender.

               Green Bean, Chickpea And Tomato Salad - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  green beans -- trimmed
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh basil
  4             medium  ripe plum tomatoes -- sliced
  1 1/2           cups  canned chickpeas -- drained, and
                        well rinsed
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
  2              small  radicchio heads -- leaves separated,
                        washed, and dried

Cook the beans, uncovered, in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 8 minutes.  Drain well.

In a shallow glass dish, combine the oil, vinegar, garlic, and basil.  Add the beans and toss to coat.  Add the tomatoes, chickpeas, and salt and toss again.  Cover the dish and let marinate at room temperature for several hours, stirring the salad occasionally.

To serve, line individual salad dishes with the radicchio leaves.  Spoon the salad onto the lettuce.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  There is a nice balance of colors and flavors in this salad of green beans, chickpeas, and tomatoes.  Save time by using canned chickpeas.  The longer this salad marinates, the tastier it will be.  As a summer lunch, serve the salad with Libretti Di Olive (see recipe), small pizzas that are folded in half and eaten out of hand.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  Thyme-Peppercorn Oil -- plus
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Thyme-Peppercorn Oil -- (see recipe)
  2             pounds  swordfish -- cut into 4 pieces,
                        and patted dry
  4             medium  red onions -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar

Early in the day, marinate the fish:  Pour 2 1/2 tablespoons of the oil into a glass dish large enough to hold the fish in one layer.  Add the fish, turning to coat.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to grill.

Preheat a charcoal or gas grill.  In a skillet, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil.  Add the onions and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until they have darkened and are caramelized, about 20 minutes.  Raise the heat to high, stir in the vinegar, and let the vinegar evaporate.  Reduce the heat to low and keep warm.

Grill the fish for about 4 minutes on each side, basting with the marinade just until a knife is easily inserted.  Remove the fish to a serving dish.  Place the onions on top and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Early in the day, marinate the fish:  Pour 2 1/2 tablespoons of the oil into a glass dish large enough to hold the fish in one layer.  Add the fish, turning to coat.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to grill.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat a charcoal or gas grill.  In a skillet, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil.  Add the onions and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until they have darkened and are caramelized, about 20 minutes.  Raise the heat to high, stir in the vinegar, and let the vinegar evaporate.  Reduce the heat to low and keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Grill the fish for about 4 minutes on each side, basting with the marinade just until a knife is easily inserted.  Remove the fish to a serving dish.  Place the onions on top and serve immediately.

            Grilled T-Bone Steak - {Bistecca Alla Fiorentina}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Italian
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  T-bone steak
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  fresh rosemary needles
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  red wine
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  arugola leaves

Fire up the grill and get it really hot!

Make a pile on a cutting board of the garlic and rosemary.  Sprinkle the pile with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt.  Use a chef's knife or rocking knife called a mezzaluna and finely mince the ingredients.  Rub the mixture all over the steak and put it on the grill.  Grill the steak until it is nicely browned on the outside but remains rare inside.  Use a small knife and make an incision in the meat to determine rareness.

While the steak is cooking, combine the wine and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Use a brush or rosemary sprig to baste the steak as it cooks.

In a bowl, toss together the arugola, remaining olive oil and salt.

When the steak is ready, cut it into 1/4-inch slices and place them on a plate.  Spread the arugola salad over the steak and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Before the Tuscans coined the word bistecca for a T-bone steak, it went by the name carbonate, literally carbon steak, since it was cooked over a charcoal flame.  Tradition recalls that the name bistecca took hold after some eighteenth century Englishmen visiting Tuscany saw the steak being grilled in the town square, and cried out "beef steak" which then became bistecca.  The meat is from a special breed of cows called Chianini, which is low in fat and juicy, owing to the grasses that the cows feed on.  A true bistecca is cooked on the outside but remains fairly raw inside.  It is served with arugola or other salad greens and the dish is also called tagliata, meaning cut into slices.

                    Gubbian Style Stewed Chicken - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Italian
                Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  Colavita extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  white onion -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
  3 1/2         pounds  cut-up bone-in chicken
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  4                     fresh sage leaves -- crumbled
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        = (such as Orvieto Classico)
  4              large  plum tomatoes -- pureed, and
                        sieved to remove skin and seeds
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Grinding coarse black pepper

Get the olive oil hot in a large saute pan and cook the onion over medium-low heat until it is soft and translucent.

Raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken pieces.  Be sure they are well dried before adding them to the pan.  Keep a bunch of paper towels handy for this.

Cook, turning the pieces until they are browned on all sides.  This should take about 5 minutes.  Add the wine vinegar and allow it to evaporate.

Lower the heat; add the sage and rosemary.  Continue cooking over low heat for 15 minutes.  Raise the temperature to high, add the wine, and allow it to evaporate.

Pour in the pureed tomato juice.  Season the mixture with salt and pepper and continue cooking uncovered for 25 minutes or until the juices thicken and the chicken is tender when pierced with a fork.

Arrange the chicken on a platter; pour the sauce over the top.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A fricco is a stew of sorts, and in this easy to prepare Gubbian-style chicken stew, it is Orvieto Classico wine that gives great merit to its flavor along with the presence of rosemary, which shows the fondness that Umbrians have for this herb in many of their foods.  This dish is even better if made the day before serving.

          Hazelnut-Coated Goat Cheese And Cantaloupe Salad - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  good-quality goat cheese
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped hazelnuts
  1 1/2           cups  diced cantaloupe
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced mint
     2/3           cup  shredded radicchio

Cut the cheese into eight equal pieces and roll each piece in the hazelnuts to completely coat it.  Place the pieces on a dish, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate.

In a small bowl combine the cantaloupe, sugar, lemon zest, and mint.  Cover and macerate at room temperature for at least 2 hours before serving.

Bring cheese to room temperature at least 1 hour before serving.  (It is always best to serve cheese at room temperature for maximum flavor.)  Sprinkle some of the radicchio, and then add 1 piece of cheese, to each of 8 plates.  Spoon some of the cantaloupe and mint onto each and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  I have fond memories of this unusual salad of creamy goat cheese encrusted with hazelnuts and served with sweet cantaloupe.  This is a nice departure from the more predictable salads where goat cheese is strewn on top of lettuce.  Be sure to use a young, creamy goat cheese.

              Hunter-Style Chicken - {Pollo Alla Cacciatora}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Italian
                Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  chicken -- cut-up
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- peeled and chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled and minced
  1                     bay leaf
  2               cans  whole tomatoes - (28 oz ea)
  2                     bell peppers (1 red, 1 yellow) -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into strips
     1/2         pound  button mushrooms -- sliced

Wash and dry the chicken pieces.  Rub the pieces with the salt and pepper and set them aside.

In a large heavy-duty skillet, heat the olive oil and cook the onions until they are soft but not browned.  Stir in the garlic and continue cooking until the garlic softens.  Add the chicken pieces and brown them evenly on all sides.  Add the bay leaf.  Add the tomatoes, squeezing them slightly with your hands, and also add any tomato juice.  Lower the heat to simmer, cover the pot, and cook the chicken for 1/2 hour.

Uncover the pot, stir in the peppers, cover the pot, and cook until the peppers are soft and the chicken is fork-tender.  Stir in the mushrooms, cover the pot, and cook about 5 minutes, or just until the mushrooms are soft.

Serve immediately with good crusty bread, or with rice or potatoes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  On one of the remote shoots for the "Going Home For Good Italian Food" series, I visited my mother, who made one of my very favorite dishes, Pollo alla Cacciatora, a country-style dish in which chicken pieces are simmered together with tomatoes and sweet bell peppers.  No one knows why this dish is called hunter-style, except perhaps that in the Renaissance those who could afford to enjoy poultry were the well-to-do, who also enjoyed the sport of hunting.  This dish developed in central Italy and has many variations.  I often receive letters from viewers asking for the recipe.  Use free-range chickens, which are grain-fed, and chemical free; they cost a little more but are readily available in grocery stores.  And if possible, use a heavy cast-iron skillet for even browning and cooking.

In a large heavy-duty skillet, heat the olive oil and cook the onions until they are soft but not browned.  Stir in the garlic and continue cooking until the garlic softens.  Add the chicken pieces and brown them evenly on all sides.  Add the bay leaf.  Add the tomatoes, squeezing them slightly with your hands, and also add any tomato juice.  Lower the heat to simmer, cover the pot, and cook the chicken for 1/2 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Uncover the pot, stir in the peppers, cover the pot, and cook until the peppers are soft and the chicken is fork-tender.  Stir in the mushrooms, cover the pot, and cook about 5 minutes, or just until the mushrooms are soft.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve immediately with good crusty bread, or with rice or potatoes.

<DirT>

Comments:  On one of the remote shoots for the &quot;Going Home For Good Italian Food&quot; series, I visited my mother, who made one of my very favorite dishes, Pollo alla Cacciatora, a country-style dish in which chicken pieces are simmered together with tomatoes and sweet bell peppers.  No one knows why this dish is called hunter-style, except perhaps that in the Renaissance those who could afford to enjoy poultry were the well-to-do, who also enjoyed the sport of hunting.  This dish developed in central Italy and has many variations.  I often receive letters from viewers asking for the recipe.  Use free-range chickens, which are grain-fed, and chemical free; they cost a little more but are readily available in grocery stores.  And if possible, use a heavy cast-iron skillet for even browning and cooking.

             Iris' Tuscan Meatballs - {Polpettine Alla Iris}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Italian
                Main Dish                       Meatballs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  cooked roast beef
     1/4         pound  mortadella (4 slices) with
                        black peppercorns or pistachio nuts
     1/4           cup  parsley leaves
     1/4           cup  dried porcini mushrooms -- soaked in
     1/2           cup  warm water
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Grinding coarse black pepper
     1/2           cup  prepared besciamella sauce
                        Flour -- for coating
                        meatballs
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for frying

Grind the roast beef, mortadella, and parsley in a food processor until it is very fine.  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl.

Drain the water from the porcini, pat them dry and chop them coarsely.  Melt the butter in a small saute pan and cook the porcini for 2 or 3 minutes and then add them to the meat.  Stir in the eggs, cheese, nutmeg, salt, pepper, and the besciamella sauce.  Mix all the ingredients until well combined.

Use about 1/4 cup of the meat mixture to form each meatball.  Place them on a baking sheet.  Or make smaller meatballs as desired.

Place some flour on a plate.  Lightly roll each meatball in the flour; shake off the excess and place them on a platter.  Cover and refrigerate them for at least 1 hour.

Heat 3 cups of the oil in a deep fryer or heavy duty pot and when the oil registers 375 degrees, it is ready for frying.  Fry the meatballs a few at a time in the oil until they are golden brown.  Remove them with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined tray to drain.

Serve the meatballs warm on a bed of arugola leaves.

Note:  Iris used olive oil to fry the meatballs but sunflower oil works well too and gives a slightly lighter taste.

The meatballs will cook faster if you use a small size skillet.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 second course servings or 24 servings as part of an antipasto.

Comments:  When Iris made her delicate olive-sized polpettine, and served them as an antipasto, I felt honored because in an Italian home you would not be served them unless you were considered family.  Meatballs are for many of us a symbol of comfort food, and a part of true casalinga or home cooking.  They originated as a holdover from the days when there was little refrigeration, making it necessary to use up leftover meat trimmings, or boiled meats that had been used to make broth.  So polpette (meatballs) were born and vary in their ingredients from place to place.  One thing is certain, you will never have a dish of spaghetti in Italy served with meatballs since they are traditionally a second course served apart from the pasta course.  Following is my adaptation of Iris' recipe.  To make the job simple, everything can be prepared using a food processor; as Iris cautions, the secret to the tender texture is to grind everything very fine.

                 Lake Trasimeno Fish Stew - {Tegamaccio}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/3           cup  minced parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1                cup  diced celery
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  6               cups  pureed fresh plum tomatoes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Grinding black pepper to taste
  2             pounds  assorted cleaned fish -- cut into 1" chunks
  4             slices  toasted bread - (to 6)

Heat the olive oil in a sauce pan; when it shimmers add the parsley, pepper flakes, and celery and cook until the celery begins to soften.  Stir in the garlic and cook until the garlic softens.  Stir in the tomatoes, salt, and pepper.

Lower the heat to simmer and add the fish.  Cook slowly, covered for 5 to 8 minutes or just until the fish easily flakes with a fork.  Place a slice of bread in individual soup bowls and ladle the fish stew over the top.  Pass olive oil to drizzle on top.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This delicate fish stew is typical of what you will find on Isola Maggiore and Lago Trasimeno.  The secret to this dish is to make sure the fish are all cut the same size and all require the same amount of cooking time.  Traditionally a combination of eels, tench, perch, trout, whiting and grayling is used, but use what is available and make sure to use fish that will not break apart as it is cooked.  Cusk and haddock are good for this also.

            Lamb Shanks In Tomato Sauce With Orecchiette - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Lamb
                Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  canned plum tomatoes - (2 28-oz cans)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     meaty lamb shanks - (1 to 1 1/4 lbs)
  4                     garlic cloves -- peeled, halved
  1              large  onion -- peeled and chopped
     3/4           cup  dry red wine
     3/4           cup  tomato paste
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Dried red pepper flakes -- to taste
  5              large  fresh basil leaves
  1              pound  store-bought or homemade orecchiette
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  water
                        Grated Pecorino cheese -- for sprinkling

Puree the tomatoes with their juice in a food processor, blender, or food mill.  Transfer the tomatoes to a pot large enough to hold the lamb shanks.  Bring the tomatoes to a boil, reduce the heat to simmer, and allow the tomatoes to cook while preparing the lamb shanks.

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan large enough to hold the lamb shanks.  When the oil is hot, add the shanks and brown them evenly on all sides.  Transfer the lamb shanks to the pot with the tomatoes.  Discard all but 1/3 cup of the oil remaining in the saute pan.

Add the garlic to the saute pan and cook over medium-low heat until the garlic is golden brown.  With a slotted spoon, remove the garlic and add it to the pot with the tomatoes and lamb shanks.  Add the onion to the oil and cook over medium-low heat until the onions are soft, about 15 minutes.  Increase the heat to medium, pour in the wine, and allow it to evaporate, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the tomato paste with a wooden spoon and scrape up any bits of meat that are stuck to the bottom of the pan.

Add the onion mixture to the tomatoes and lamb; stir in the salt and red pepper flakes; cover the pot and allow the ingredients to simmer gently.  Stir occasionally.  When the meat is fork-tender but not falling from the bones, remove it to a dish, cover, and keep warm.  Stir the basil into the tomato sauce.

Cook the orecchiette in 4 to 6 quarts of rapidly boiling water to which 1 tablespoon of salt has been added.  Orecchiette take a little longer to cook than other types of dried pasta because of their concave shape.  They are cooked when there is no trace of white flour remaining when cut into; the orecchiette should retain their shape and be al dente, firm but cooked.

Drain the orecchiette, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.  Transfer the orecchiette to a serving dish.  Mix 2 cups of the tomato sauce with the 2 tablespoons of water and pour it over the orecchiette.  Mix well.  Serve the pasta immediately as a first course with a sprinkling of grated Pecorino cheese.  Serve the lamb shanks as a second course.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  A few years ago I spent some time in Puglia, the region at the heel of Italy's boot, and it was there that I met the well-known and well-loved New York cooking teacher Anna Amendolara Nurse.  Anna's family came from Bari, so the trip to Puglia put together by Oldways Preservation Trust and the International Olive Oil Council was a special one for her.  Anna not only knew Pugliese specialties and the culture surrounding them, she was also very active serving on the board of the James Beard Foundation.  As we traveled around Puglia I asked Anna about her favorite Pugliese foods.  Orecchiette, a dried pasta made from water and semolina flour and shaped by hand into something resembling little ears, was at the top of her list.  The indentations were meant to trap a hearty tomato sauce in which the lamb shanks were cooked.  Anna uses the sauce to serve orecchiette as a first course, then offers the lamb shanks as a secondo, or second course.  I loved the dish so much that I asked Anna to demonstrate how to make it on one of the episodes of Ciao Italia.  Here is her beloved recipe.

Cook the orecchiette in 4 to 6 quarts of rapidly boiling water to which 1 tablespoon of salt has been added.  Orecchiette take a little longer to cook than other types of dried pasta because of their concave shape.  They are cooked when there is no trace of white flour remaining when cut into; the orecchiette should retain their shape and be al dente, firm but cooked.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain the orecchiette, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.  Transfer the orecchiette to a serving dish.  Mix 2 cups of the tomato sauce with the 2 tablespoons of water and pour it over the orecchiette.  Mix well.  Serve the pasta immediately as a first course with a sprinkling of grated Pecorino cheese.  Serve the lamb shanks as a second course.

Comments:  A few years ago I spent some time in Puglia, the region at the heel of Italy&apos;s boot, and it was there that I met the well-known and well-loved New York cooking teacher Anna Amendolara Nurse.  Anna&apos;s family came from Bari, so the trip to Puglia put together by Oldways Preservation Trust and the International Olive Oil Council was a special one for her.  Anna not only knew Pugliese specialties and the culture surrounding them, she was also very active serving on the board of the James Beard Foundation.  As we traveled around Puglia I asked Anna about her favorite Pugliese foods.  Orecchiette, a dried pasta made from water and semolina flour and shaped by hand into something resembling little ears, was at the top of her list.  The indentations were meant to trap a hearty tomato sauce in which the lamb shanks were cooked.  Anna uses the sauce to serve orecchiette as a first course, then offers the lamb shanks as a secondo, or second course.  I loved the dish so much that I asked Anna to demonstrate how to make it on one of the episodes of Ciao Italia.  Here is her beloved recipe.

                Layered Onion Casserole From Cannara - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Umbrian Ragu Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        === CREAM SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  flour
  4               cups  milk
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground nutmeg
                        === FILLING ===
  2             pounds  Spanish onions -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" thick rings
  5        tablespoons  flour
  1                cup  vegetable oil - (to 1 1/2)
     1/2         pound  mozzarella cheese -- diced
  6        tablespoons  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Make the ragu sauce and set it aside if assembling the dish that day or refrigerate the ragu for up to 5 days for later assembly.

Melt the butter over medium heat in a 2-quart saucepan.  Stir in the flour and cook the mixture until it is smooth but not browned.  Slowly pour in the milk and continue to cook stirring frequently until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Remove the sauce from the heat, stir in the salt, and nutmeg.  Cover the pot and set aside or refrigerate the sauce if you are planning to make the casserole a few days later.

Put the onion rings in a large paper bag with the flour.  Close the bag and shake it to lightly coat the rings.

Heat 1 cup of the vegetable oil in a heavy duty pot or sautÈ pan, and when the oil begins to shimmer, add the onions in batches, and brown them on both sides.  As they brown remove them to paper-lined baking sheets.  Add more oil as needed to cook all the onions.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spread 1/2 cup of the cream sauce in the bottom of a 13- by 8 1/2- by 2-inch casserole or similar dish.

Spread 2 cups of the ragu over the cream sauce.  Spread 1/3 of the onion mixture over the ragu, 1/3 of the mozzarella over the onions, 1/2 cup of the cream sauce over the mozzarella cheese, and 2 tablespoons of the Parmigiano cheese over the mozzarella cheese.  Continue making two more layers in the same manner.  Pour the remaining cream sauce over the casserole.

Bake uncovered for 30 to 35 minutes or until it is bubbly and hot.

Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Cannara, a small town near the ceramic center of Deruta, is known as the onion capital of Italy, and many traditional dishes from antipasto to main dishes feature the humble onion as the central ingredient.  So revered are the onions of Cannara that every September a sagra (festival) is held called la festa della cipolla (the onion festival), where visitors can get their fill of all sorts of tasty onion dishes.  My favorite is this exquisite fried onion and ragu casserole laced with a velvety cream sauce.  The dish should be prepared in stages to make the final assembly easy.  I make the cream sauce and the ragu several days ahead and then refrigerate them.  The onions are cooked just before the final assembly.  Use my Umbrian Ragu Sauce in this recipe.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     cooked medium artichoke hearts
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  leeks, white parts only -- sliced thin rings
  1             medium  fennel bulb -- quartered, and
                        cut into thin strips, tops minced
     3/4         pound  mild or hot Italian sausage
  1           teaspoon  fennel seeds
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  toasted pine nuts
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1             recipe  Pasta Frolla -- chilled
                        = (see recipe)
  4              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  water

Cut the artichoke hearts into small pieces and place them in a large bowl.  Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet and saute the leeks for about 3 minutes or until wilted.  Add leeks to the artichokes.  Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the skillet and saute the fennel for about 4 minutes or until it begins to soften.  Add the fennel to the bowl with the artichokes.

In the same skillet, brown the sausage, adding no additional fat; add a little water if the sausage is lean.  When the sausage is browned, drain off the fat, transfer sausage to a cutting board, and let cool for 10 minutes.  Cut the sausage into 1/4-inch slices, then add them to the bowl.

Toss 2 tablespoons fennel leaves, fennel seeds, sea salt, pepper, pine nuts, and cheese into the artichoke mixture and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Divide the dough into 2 pieces.  Roll each piece on a lightly floured surface into a 14-inch circle, then use 1 piece to line a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  Let the excess dough hang over the edges.  Place the filling in the tart shell, smoothing it out but not compacting it.

In a small bowl, whisk 3 eggs with the wine and pour the mixture into the tart shell.  Place the second piece of dough over the top, letting the edges hang over.  With a rolling pin, roll over the edges of the pan to cut off the excess dough.

Re-roll the pastry scraps and make a decorative pattern of vines and leaves over the top of the tart.  In a small bowl, beat the remaining egg with the water and brush the mixture evenly over the top of the tart.  Bake the tart for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.

Remove the tart to a rack and let cool slightly.  Remove the sides of the tart pan, and place the tart on a serving dish.  Slice into wedges to serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  To prevent the edges of the tart from browning too much, cover them loosely with a piece of aluminum foil.

                Little Olive Pizzas - {Libretti Di Olive}

Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2 1/4           cups  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  6               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 6 1/2)
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              small  hot red pepper -- diced
  1              small  hot green pepper -- diced
     1/2           cup  oil-cured black olives -- pitted and chopped
     1/2           cup  Sicilian green olives in brine -- drained, pitted,
                        and chopped

Pour 1/4 cup of the warm water into a large bowl and stir in the yeast.  Let the yeast proof for about 10 minutes, until foamy.

Add the remaining 2 cups warm water and 5 cups of the flour to the yeast mixture.  Mix with your hands; add the additional flour as needed until a smooth ball of dough is formed.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes.

Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil, add the dough, and turn to coat with the oil.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours.

In a small skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Add the red and green peppers and cook for about 2 minutes, pressing on them with the back of a wooden spoon to release their flavor.  Set aside.

Mix the black and green olives together in a small bowl.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Lightly grease two cookie sheets.  Punch the dough down and knead it on a floured surface for 4 to 5 minutes.  Divide the dough in half and roll each piece into a 12-inch circle.  Pour half the oil and pepper mixture over each piece and use a pastry brush to brush the mixture evenly over the dough.  Roll each piece up like a jellyroll and then into a ball, and knead again until the peppers are well distributed.

Divide each piece of dough into 8 pieces.  Roll each piece into a 5-inch circle.  Sprinkle the olive mixture evenly over the pizze, pressing the olives into the dough with your fingers.

Brush the tops with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Place the pizze on lightly greased cookie sheets and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned.  Serve warm, and fold in half to eat.

This recipe yields 16 pizzas.

Comments:  Libretti are small pizzas folded in half, like a book, and then eaten out of hand.  The inspiration for this recipe comes from the many versions of libretti I've sampled all over Italy.  Mine are made with a yeast dough that is first brushed with hot red and green peppers that have been cooked in olive oil, and then embedded with oil-cured black and brine-cured green olives.  The recipe makes sixteen libretti; they never last long, but you can freeze any leftovers.  You can also divide the dough in half rather than into smaller pieces and make two sixteen-inch pizze from this recipe.

<DirT>
Pour 1/4 cup of the warm water into a large bowl and stir in the yeast.  Let the yeast proof for about 10 minutes, until foamy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the remaining 2 cups warm water and 5 cups of the flour to the yeast mixture.  Mix with your hands; add the additional flour as needed until a smooth ball of dough is formed.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil, add the dough, and turn to coat with the oil.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Add the red and green peppers and cook for about 2 minutes, pressing on them with the back of a wooden spoon to release their flavor.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix the black and green olives together in a small bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Lightly grease two cookie sheets.  Punch the dough down and knead it on a floured surface for 4 to 5 minutes.  Divide the dough in half and roll each piece into a 12-inch circle.  Pour half the oil and pepper mixture over each piece and use a pastry brush to brush the mixture evenly over the dough.  Roll each piece up like a jellyroll and then into a ball, and knead again until the peppers are well distributed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide each piece of dough into 8 pieces.  Roll each piece into a 5-inch circle.  Sprinkle the olive mixture evenly over the pizze, pressing the olives into the dough with your fingers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush the tops with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Place the pizze on lightly greased cookie sheets and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned.  Serve warm, and fold in half to eat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 16 pizzas.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Libretti are small pizzas folded in half, like a book, and then eaten out of hand.  The inspiration for this recipe comes from the many versions of libretti I&apos;ve sampled all over Italy.  Mine are made with a yeast dough that is first brushed with hot red and green peppers that have been cooked in olive oil, and then embedded with oil-cured black and brine-cured green olives.  The recipe makes sixteen libretti; they never last long, but you can freeze any leftovers.  You can also divide the dough in half rather than into smaller pieces and make two sixteen-inch pizze from this recipe.

                Little Pork Purses - {Borsette Di Maiale}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  thinly-sliced leeks
     1/4           cup  diced fennel
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4         pound  Italian Fontina cheese -- diced
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- diced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  finely-minced fresh thyme
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     center-cut 3/4"-thick pork chops -- with 2" deep
                        pockets - (abt 2 1/2 lbs total)

In a medium skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Add the leeks and fennel and cook over low heat until they just begin to color.  Raise the heat, add the lemon juice, and let it evaporate.  Remove the mixture to a bowl to cool slightly.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Brush a casserole dish large enough to hold the pork chops in a single layer with the remaining olive oil.  Add the cheese, prosciutto, and thyme to the leek mixture and mix well.  Season with salt and pepper.

Fill the pork pockets with the mixture, packing it in firmly.  Close the openings with toothpicks or sew closed with cooking string.  Lay the pork in the prepared dish, and season with salt and pepper.

Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes, or until nicely browned.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Italian cooks are very fond of stuffing vegetables, meats, fish, and fowl.  In this recipe for borsette, "little purses", or stuffed pork chops, the savory filling is made from Fontina cheese, prosciutto, leeks, and thyme.  The dish can be assembled early in the day, covered, and refrigerated until ready to bake.  Veal chops can be used in place of pork.

                    Lobster Salad Corsaro Style - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings
                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  cooked lobster tail meat
  10                    cherry tomatoes -- stemmed, washed,
                        and cut in half
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced Italian parsley
                        Grated zest of 1 large lemon
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt -- or more to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  8              whole  arugola leaves -- washed, dried,
                        and refrigerated

Cut the lobster meat up into bite-size pieces and place in a bowl.  Gently mix in the tomatoes, parsley, and lemon zest.

In a small bowl whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.  Pour the dressing over the lobster mixture and toss gently with two spoons.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  When ready to serve, allow enough time for the lobster mixture to come to room temperature.

Line each of two plates with 4 arugola leaves.  Divide the lobster mixture and spoon half of it into the center of the arugola on each plate.  Serve immediately with crusty rolls.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  I enjoyed this cold lobster salad in Cagliari, the port capital city of the island of Sardinia in a beautifully appointed restaurant called Dal Corsaro on Viale Regina Margherita, 28.  The lobster, which is called aragosta, is smaller, clawless, and sweeter than what we are used to in New England.  Served with the unusually sweet cherry tomatoes from nearby Santa Margherita, it was a perfect dish with a simple dressing of olive oil and fresh lemon juice.  To get close to the original taste, I pick a variety of cherry tomatoes from my garden called Sweet One-Hundreds.  But my advice is to make this wonderful salad in the summer when tomatoes are in season.  Be sure to make the salad at least a few hours ahead of time and then allow it to come to room temperature before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  seasoned boxed Italian bread crumbs
     3/4           cup  whole or skim milk ricotta cheese
  2             pounds  ground chuck
  2                     eggs -- slightly beaten
     1/2           cup  minced parsley
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding coarse black pepper

In a large bowl mix all the ingredients gently with wet hands and repeat occasionally as you form the meatballs to prevent them from sticking to your hands.  Scoop up about 2/3 cup of the meat to make each one.

Place the meatballs on a rimmed baking sheet lightly sprayed with olive oil and bake them for 20 to 30 minutes or until cooked through.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Making good, moist meatballs still eludes many cooks.  This became a theme of one of the shows in the Tuscan series and we invited home cooks to send us their favorite recipe.  One that intrigued me was Lulu San Angelo's meatballs made with ricotta cheese.  I invited her to come to the studio and make them for our television audience.

Categories    : Chicken                         Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick) -- cut into pieces,
                        and softened
  3              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  water
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  penne rigate
  1            package  frozen peas - (10 oz) -- thawed
  2               cups  freshly-grated Asiago cheese
  5        tablespoons  butter -- softened
  1 1/4         pounds  cooked chicken -- cut bite size
                        = (about 2 1/2 cups)
  1                cup  chicken broth
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten

In a bowl mix together the flour, sugar, salt, and zest.  Using a fork or pastry blender, work in the butter unit the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and water.  Add the yolks to the flour mixture and mix with your hands until a soft dough is formed.  If the dough seems dry, add a little water.  Gather the dough into a ball.  Divide it in half and wrap each piece in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate overnight.

Bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot.  Add the penne and cook until just al dente; the pasta should remain slightly undercooked.  Add the peas to the boiling water during the last 3 minutes of cooking.  Drain well and place in a large bowl.  Add the cheese and butter and toss well.  Set aside.

In another bowl, combine the chicken and chicken broth.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a 10- by 3-inch springform pan.  On a lightly floured surface, roll one piece of dough into a 16-inch round.  Fit the dough into the pan, letting the excess hang over the sides.

Place one third of the pasta mixture in the pastry shell and sprinkle with salt.  Spread half of the chicken and broth mixture over the pasta.  Repeat with another layer of pasta and another layer of chicken.  Spread the remaining pasta over the chicken and sprinkle with salt.

On a floured surface, roll out the remaining dough to a 12-inch round.  Place the dough over the filling.  Trim off the excess dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang and pinch the edges together to seal.  If you wish, reroll the scraps and cut out shapes to make a decorative design on top of the pie.  Brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg.

Bake for 45 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned.  Transfer the pan to a rack and let cool for 10 minutes for easier cutting.  Release the spring on the side of the pan and transfer the pasticcio to a serving plate.  With a sharp knife, cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Whenever I make pasticcio di maccheroni, an Italian version of chicken pot pie, I think of Giuseppe Lampedusa's novel The Leopard, about the decline of the aristocracy in nineteenth-century Sicily.  In his elegantly written book, Lampedusa describes lavish multicourse dinners at which "three lackeys in green, gold, and powder entered, each holding a great silver dish containing a towering macaroni pie".  Pasticcio di maccheroni is easy to assemble if you make the slightly sweet dough a day ahead and have some cooked or leftover chicken on hand.  Or the entire pie can be assembled in one day, covered with a sheet of buttered parchment paper, and baked the next day.  Either way, this savory, deep-dish pie will be the centerpiece of your buffet table.

       Marinated Green Tomato Salad - {Insalata Di Pomodori Verdi}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- finely minced
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh oregano
                        = (or 1 1/2 tspns dried oregano)
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
  3                     meaty green tomatoes - (to 4) -- thinly sliced
                        Shavings of Pecorino cheese with
                        peppercorns

Mix all the ingredients except the tomatoes in a large bowl.  Add the tomato slices and toss gently with your hands.  Layer the slices in a platter slightly overlapping them.  Cover and allow the salad to marinate at room temperature for several hours before serving.  When ready to serve, sprinkle the cheese over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Radiant red, plump tomatoes are show-stoppers in the mercati (markets) of Italy.  But it might surprise you to know that Italians like their salad tomatoes on the greenish side, since they are firmer and hold up well while riper tomatoes are reserved to make sauces.  Make this salad early in the day then serve it for lunch or dinner and mop up the flavorful juices with slices of crusty Tuscan bread.  Even though it is not traditional, I like to add shavings of Pecorino cheese to the salad for added interest.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
                        Juice of 2 to 3 lemons -- to taste
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed
     1/4           cup  chopped flat-leaf parsley
     1/3           cup  chopped fennel leaves
  1                cup  diced red bell peppers
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SEAFOOD ===
  2             pounds  small squid - (4" to 6" long)
  1           teaspoon  coarse sea salt
     1/2         pound  medium shrimp -- peeled
  1              pound  bay scallops

In a shallow nonmetal dish, combine all the marinade ingredients.  Mix well and set aside.

Remove the head of each squid by pulling it away from the body.  Cut off the tentacles below the eyes and discard the heads.  Pull out the interior membranes from each squid body and remove the plastic-like spine bone from the inside.  Pull off the outer skin.  Wash the squid bodies and tentacles thoroughly in cold water.  Cut the bodies into 1/4-inch rings and dice the tentacles.  Set aside.

Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a large saucepan and add the salt.  Add the shrimp and boil until they turn pink, about 3 minutes.  With a slotted spoon, remove the shrimp and let cool.

Add the scallops to the boiling water and boil for 3 minutes.  Remove the scallops with a slotted spoon and let cool.  Add the squid rings to the water and boil until tender, 12 to 15 minutes.  About 5 minutes before the rings are cooked, add the diced tentacles.  The squid should be tender, not chewy.  Drain well.

Toss the squid, shrimp, and scallops in the marinade.  Add salt if necessary.  Cover and let marinate overnight in the refrigerator, turning the mixture occasionally.

To serve, transfer the salad to a decorative platter, cover, and let come to room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Several preparations of squid were served on Christmas Eve at home.  My favorite has always been frutta di mare, a marinated medley of squid, shrimp, and octopus.  I use scallops in this recipe in place of octopus.  This should be made a day before it is served to allow the marinade to fully flavor the fish.

               Meat Rolls Stuffed With Ham And Herbs - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     thin slices veal, pork, or chicken -- cut for scaloppine
  8                     thin slices prosciutto
  2        tablespoons  finely-crushed juniper berries*
  8              whole  sage leaves
                        Grinding of black pepper
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  Montefalco Rosso
                        = (or other red wine)

* Note:  Juniper berries are in the spice section of most grocery stores; use a mortar and pestle to crush them or use a small spice grinder.

Lay the meat pieces out flat.  Top each one with a slice of prosciutto, a little of the crushed juniper berries, a sage leaf, a grinding of pepper, and a sprinkling of salt.  Roll each piece up to form a little bundle.  This is the involtino.  Tie the involtini with kitchen string.  Put them in a baking dish large enough to hold them in a single layer.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Brush the involtini with olive oil.  Bake them 5 minutes, then pour in the wine and continue baking an additional 7 minutes, basting the bundles occasionally with the wine.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Thin slices of meat can also be made into involtini, stuffed, rolled bundles with a savory filling.  This dish has a nice woodsy flavor provided by fresh sage and juniper berries.  Montefalco Rosso is used to make the sauce but a good dry red wine will suffice.  This is a great company dish.

* Note:  Juniper berries are in the spice section of most grocery stores; use a mortar and pestle to crush them or use a small spice grinder.

<DirT>
Lay the meat pieces out flat.  Top each one with a slice of prosciutto, a little of the crushed juniper berries, a sage leaf, a grinding of pepper, and a sprinkling of salt.  Roll each piece up to form a little bundle.  This is the involtino.  Tie the involtini with kitchen string.  Put them in a baking dish large enough to hold them in a single layer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Brush the involtini with olive oil.  Bake them 5 minutes, then pour in the wine and continue baking an additional 7 minutes, basting the bundles occasionally with the wine.  Serve hot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  Thin slices of meat can also be made into involtini, stuffed, rolled bundles with a savory filling.  This dish has a nice woodsy flavor provided by fresh sage and juniper berries.  Montefalco Rosso is used to make the sauce but a good dry red wine will suffice.  This is a great company dish.

           Mint Potato Salad - {Insalata Di Patata Alla Menta}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
     2/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  fresh mint leaves -- torn in small pieces
                        === SALAD ===
  6              large  all-purpose potatoes
                        = (or 12 small red-skinned potatoes)
  1                cup  fresh young peas -- optional
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste

In a large shallow serving dish, combine all the dressing ingredients.  Stir to blend, and set aside.

Wash the potatoes but do not peel.  Put the potatoes in a large pot, add water to cover, and bring to a boil.  Boil until tender, but not overly soft.  If using all-purpose potatoes, cut them into 1/4-inch slices; cut red potatoes in half.  Place the hot potatoes cut-sides down in the dressing.  Add the peas, if desired.

Cover the salad and let sit at room temperature for several hours before serving, turning the potatoes occasionally in the dressing.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  I loved to eat my Grandmother Galasso's potato salad on a hot and steamy August day.  The most important ingredient was fresh mint that, picked early in the morning, scented the entire kitchen.  It was generously combined with the hot potatoes and the other ingredients to marinate for several hours before serving.  Sometimes, tender young peas were added raw to this dish.

                 Mixed Fish Fry - {Fritto Misto Di Pesce}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour -- more or less
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
  3             pounds  assorted firm fish fillets and shellfish -- fish cut into
                        uniform pieces
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

In a deep-fryer or large heavy pot, heat the oil to 375 degrees.

Mix the flour and salt on a plate.  Dredge the fish and shellfish in the flour, shaking off the excess.  Fry in batches until golden brown, and remove to brown paper to drain.

Place the fish and shellfish on a platter, sprinkle with salt, and squeeze the lemon wedges over.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Fritto misto di pesce, a dish composed of several types of fish, clams, shrimp, squid, and smelts, was always the last dish to be served on Christmas Eve.  Any firm fish, however, is well suited to this cooking method.  To make a successful fritto misto remember the cardinal rules: Maintain the cooking oil at a constant temperature to ensure even browning, and fry pieces of fish or shellfish of the same size together to ensure even cooking.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless pork loin
  1              pound  boneless beef or veal loin
  1              pound  skinless boneless chicken breasts
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled and crushed
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh sage
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3             medium  bell peppers -- cut 2" squares
                        = (an assortment of red, green, and/or
                        yellow)
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  4                     thick slices pancetta or prosciutto -- cut in 1" squares
  1                     small bunch fresh sage -- leaves only
     3/4         pound  sweet or hot Italian sausage -- cut into chunks
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
                        Colavita extra-virgin olive oil -- as needed

Cut the meats and chicken into 1-inch cubes.  Season the pork with coarse salt and pepper and rub with the garlic; season the beef or veal with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the sage; season the chicken with salt and pepper and sprinkle with the rosemary.  Set aside.

In a skillet, heat the olive oil and saute the peppers until just crisp-tender.  Add the wine and cook until the liquid is reduced by about half.

Thread the skewers in this order: Pork, bell pepper, chicken, pancetta, sage leaf, veal, bell pepper, and sausage.  Do not crowd the pieces.  Place the skewers in a nonmetal dish large enough to hold them in a single layer and drizzle the lemon juice and olive oil over them.  Let them marinate for several hours in the refrigerator, basting and turning them often.

Heat the grill and lightly oil the grill rack.  Remove the skewers from the marinade, place them on the grill, and baste with the marinade.  Grill, turning and basting the skewers, until done to taste, about 8 to 12 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  At a rustic outdoor ristorante called La Stalla (the name means "stable"), everything on the menu was cooked in the classic Umbrian style, alla griglia, grilled on an open fire.  We sat under a grape arbor at tables covered with red-and-white-checked cloths.  When the spiedo misto came to the table smelling of fresh herbs and wine, it was the perfect ending to a long day.

Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1             medium  red sweet onion -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  1             medium  leek -- tops removed,
                        washed and thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/2         pound  button mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and thinly sliced
  5                     carrots -- scraped, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  2 1/2         pounds  veal shoulder chops -- wiped dry
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  finely-minced rosemary

Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in an ovenproof saute pan.  Stir in the onions and leeks and cook the mixture over medium heat until the onions and leeks are wilted.  Raise the heat to high, stir in the balsamic vinegar, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vinegar evaporates.  Remove the onions and leeks to a dish and set aside.

Add the remaining olive oil and butter to the pan, stir in the mushrooms and cook them until all their liquid has been given off.  Remove the mushrooms to the dish with the leeks and onions.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Dry the meat well on both sides with paper towels and add the pieces in a single layer to the pan; brown them well on both sides.  Sprinkle the meat with the salt and pepper.  Return the onion mixture to the pan and add the carrots.  Slowly pour in the wine along the side of the pan.  Cover the pan tightly and transfer it to the oven.

Cook for about 1 1/4 hours, or until the meat is fork tender.  Ten minutes before the dish is done, sprinkle the rosemary over the top of the meat.  Cut the meat into serving pieces; transfer the mixture with the juices to a serving platter and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The first time I prepared veal on my series I actually got some negative mail from a few viewers who felt that, due to their beliefs about the way that calves are raised, I should not have done the show.  Still many other viewers wanted to know how to cook less expensive cuts of veal.  Since Ciao Italia is about the regional cooking of Italy, I felt that I could not leave out segments that dealt with veal, but it was a long time before I once again decided to cook it on the air, selecting Ossobuco as the showpiece.  Another dish I like to prepare is veal shoulder, the blade cut, which is quite inexpensive, very tasty, and tender if cooked on low heat in the oven.  Make this dish ahead; it is even better the next day.  It is best to cook this in a 12-inch ovenproof saute pan, since the procedure begins at the stovetop and ends in the oven.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in an ovenproof saute pan.  Stir in the onions and leeks and cook the mixture over medium heat until the onions and leeks are wilted.  Raise the heat to high, stir in the balsamic vinegar, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vinegar evaporates.  Remove the onions and leeks to a dish and set aside.

Dry the meat well on both sides with paper towels and add the pieces in a single layer to the pan; brown them well on both sides.  Sprinkle the meat with the salt and pepper.  Return the onion mixture to the pan and add the carrots.  Slowly pour in the wine along the side of the pan.  Cover the pan tightly and transfer it to the oven.

Comments:  The first time I prepared veal on my series I actually got some negative mail from a few viewers who felt that, due to their beliefs about the way that calves are raised, I should not have done the show.  Still many other viewers wanted to know how to cook less expensive cuts of veal.  Since Ciao Italia is about the regional cooking of Italy, I felt that I could not leave out segments that dealt with veal, but it was a long time before I once again decided to cook it on the air, selecting Ossobuco as the showpiece.  Another dish I like to prepare is veal shoulder, the blade cut, which is quite inexpensive, very tasty, and tender if cooked on low heat in the oven.  Make this dish ahead; it is even better the next day.  It is best to cook this in a 12-inch ovenproof saute pan, since the procedure begins at the stovetop and ends in the oven.

            Pappardelle With Rabbit, Mushrooms, And Wine - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Rabbit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
  1              pound  mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        stems trimmed, and caps thinly sliced
  1                cup  dry red wine*
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of cracked black pepper
  4             pounds  cut-up rabbit -- washed and dried
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             ounces  pancetta -- diced
  1             medium  red onion -- diced
     1/2         pound  fennel, bulb only -- washed, sliced,
                        and cut into strips
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh sage leaves
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1              pound  homemade or store-bought pappardelle

* Note:  In keeping with Tuscan tradition, I like to use a good Chianti Classico wine in the preparation.

Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large (12- by 3-inch-deep) ovenproof saute pan or stove-top baking dish large enough to hold all the rabbit pieces.  Add the mush≠rooms and cook over medium-high heat, stirring fre≠quently, until they soften and begin to give off their liquid.  Reduce the heat to medium and continue cook≠ing until the liquid evaporates.  Increase the heat to high and stir in 1/2 cup of the wine.  Let most of the wine evap≠orate.  Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl and set aside.

Wipe out the saute pan with a paper towel and return to the stove top.

Mix the flour, salt, and pepper together on a dish.  With your hands, dredge each rabbit piece in the flour and shake off the excess.  Set aside.

Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the olive oil in the saute pan over medium heat and when it is hot, brown the rabbit pieces evenly.  Remove the pieces to a dish as they brown.

Add the pancetta to the pan drippings and cook the bits until they begin to brown.  Stir in the onion and fennel and cook until the onion softens and the fennel begins to brown.  Stir in the garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes more, stirring.  Increase the heat to high and stir in the remaining 1/2 cup wine and the sage leaves.  Turn off the heat and stir in the mushrooms with any liquid.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Tightly cover the pan, place it in the oven, and bake until the rabbit is ten≠der, about 40 minutes.  Uncover the pan and stir in the vinegar.  Cover and keep the pan warm while the pap≠pardelle cook.

Make and cook homemade pappardelle according to the directions or follow the directions for commercially prepared.  Drain and place them on a large, deep platter.  Spoon the rabbit and mushroom sauce over the pappardelle and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Golden, wide ribbons of noodles known as pappardelle claim Tuscany as home and were originally made to accompany wild duck because woodsmen working in the marshy area of Tuscany known as the Maremma found ducks easy to come by.  Boccaccio described pappardelle as lasagne "made two inches thick and cooked in broth and seasoned with meat, especially wild hare."   It is also com≠monly served with wild boar.  Pappardelle are easily made from the basic pasta dough recipe, or can be found on some grocery store shelves.  Domestic rabbit is used in this recipe and slowly cooked in the oven in a wine-and-mushroom sauce.  Cook the rabbit in the sauce a day ahead to save time if you are making homemade pappardelle.

                   Pasta And Salmon - {Pasta E Salmone}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4         pounds  salmon fillet in one piece
  1              large  bay leaf
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt
  4        tablespoons  butter
  4              large  shallots -- minced
  1                     bag fresh spinach - (10 oz) -- cooked, squeezed
                        dry, and finely chopped
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  1              pound  fettuccine

Place the salmon fillet skin-side down on the rack of a fish poacher and set aside.  Fill the poacher with enough water to come halfway up the sides, add the bay leaf and 1 teaspoon of the salt, and bring to a simmer.  Lower the rack into the poacher, submerging the salmon.  Cover and poach the salmon until the fish easily flakes with a fork and registers 175 to 185 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 8 to 10 minutes.

Carefully lift the poaching rack out of the poacher, draining the salmon well.  When the salmon is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin.  Cut the salmon into 1-inch chunks.

In a large skillet, melt the butter.  Add the shallots and cook until they are very soft.  Add the spinach and cook for 2 minutes.  Stir in the heavy cream, lemon zest, and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and bring to a simmer.  Add the salmon, mixing carefully.  Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.

Meanwhile, bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot.  Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente.  Drain and place on a large platter.

Pour the salmon sauce over the fettuccine and gently toss.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Poached salmon combined with spinach and a shallot-flavored cream provides the sauce for this exquisite dish.  To ensure that the salmon remains moist, I use a fish poacher and a cooking thermometer to gauge when the fish is cooked.  A large deep skillet or pot with a rack can be used in place of a fish poacher.

                Pasta With Sardines - {Pasta Con Le Sarde}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  olive oil
     2/3           cup  dried bread crumbs
  2             medium  onions -- finely minced
  3               cans  sardines in olive oil - (4 oz ea) -- drained, and
                        coarsely chopped, oil reserved
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
     1/4           cup  currants
  1              pound  bucatini or spaghetti
                        Leafy tops of 1 fennel bulb -- tied together with
                        kitchen string
     1/2      teaspoon  powdered saffron
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste

In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Add the bread crumbs and cook, stirring, until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels.

Add the remaining olive oil to the pan, then add the onions and cook until the onions are soft.  Add the sardines with their oil and cook gently for about 3 minutes.  Stir in the pine nuts and currants.  Remove from the heat.

Bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot.  Add the fennel tops and bucatini or spaghetti, and cook until the pasta is al dente.  Just before the pasta is cooked, remove 1/2 cup of the cooking water and dissolve the saffron in it; set aside.  Scoop out the fennel, untie it, and chop the leaves fine.  Set aside.

Drain the pasta and add it to the sardine mixture.  Heat the pasta and sardines over medium-low heat, stirring constantly.  Stir in the saffron water and fennel leaves and add the salt.

Place the pasta and sardine mixture on a large serving platter.  Sprinkle with the bread crumbs and serve immediately.

Note:  It is not customary to serve grated cheese on fish pastas.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Sardines with pasta called bucatini, a thick hollow spaghetti, was always part of the seven-course fish dinner Nonna Saporito served on Christmas Eve.  In this version of her recipe, I've substituted Florence fennel for her beloved wild fennel, and canned sardines for fresh, both of which are difficult, if not impossible, to find here.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
  2 1/2           cups  warm water -- (110 to 115 degrees)
  5 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 6)
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  2 1/2      teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === FILLING ===
     3/4         pound  fresh mozzarella cheese (fior di latte) -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  ham -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  provolone cheese -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  Genoa salami -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  Swiss cheese -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  capocollo -- thinly sliced
  6              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/3           cup  minced flat-leafed parsley
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for egg wash

In a large bowl, sprinkle the yeast over 1 cup of the warm water, stir well, and let proof for 5 to 10 minutes, or until foamy.  Add the remaining 1 1/2 cups water and stir well.

In another bowl, mix 5 cups of the flour with the salt.  Add to the yeast mixture along with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil.  Mix with your hands, adding additional flour if necessary, until a soft and no longer sticky dough is formed.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it until smooth and elastic.  Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil, add the dough, and turn to coat.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Brush the bottom and sides of a 15- by 13-inch baking dish or a 10- by 3-inch springform pan with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil.  Punch down the dough and knead it on a floured surface for 3 or 4 minutes.  Divide the dough in half.  On a floured surface, roll one piece of the dough to a rectangle or round at least 2 inches larger than the pan.  Fit the dough in the pan, stretching it up the sides so that it overhangs the rim.

Fill the pan with alternating layers of the sliced cheeses and meats (you should have at least 10 layers).

In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, parsley, and salt and pepper.  Pour the mixture evenly over the cheese and meat.

Break a lemon-size piece of dough off the remaining piece of dough and set aside.  On a floured surface, roll the second piece of dough out to a rectangle or round at least 1 inch larger than the pan.  Place the dough over the filling and seal the edges by pinching them closed and rolling the seam underneath itself.  Divide the reserved piece of dough in half and roll each piece into a rope.  Lay one piece across the center of the pie, and lay the second piece across it to form a cross.

Brush the top of the pie evenly with the egg wash.  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until the crust is nicely browned.  Remove from the oven and let cool completely.

If using a springform pan, release the spring, transfer the pie to a serving plate, and cut into wedges.  If using a rectangular pan, cut the pie into pieces in the pan, then transfer them to a serving dish.

Note:  This pie will keep for up to 1 week in the refrigerator.  It is best served at room temperature or just slightly warm.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Pizza chena (its name is a Neapolitan dialect term meaning "full pie") was always a part of our Easter table when I was a child.  This enormous two-crusted pie was stuffed with salami, prosciutto, cheeses of all sorts, bacon, and a dozen eggs!  I have reduced the number of eggs, but this still remains a substantial and memorable dish.

            Poached Salmon With Herbs - {Salmone Con Le Erbe}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  fennel bulbs, leafy tops and stalks only
  2             pounds  salmon fillet in one piece
  2                     bay leaves
  5        tablespoons  butter
  6              large  fresh basil leaves
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Fill a fish poacher with 1 1/2 inches of water.  Place half the fennel leaves and stalks on the poaching rack and lay the salmon skin-side down on the leaves.  Place the bay leaves on the salmon, and cover with the remaining fennel leaves and stalks.  Cover the poacher, bring the water just barely to a simmer, and cook the fish for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it is light pink in color and opaque throughout.

Alternatively, use a steamer basket set in a large frying pan to cook the salmon.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan.  Snip the basil leaves with scissors, add to the pan, and swirl the leaves in the butter for a few minutes with a wooden spoon to release their flavor.  Season with salt and pepper.

Carefully lift the poaching rack or steamer out of the poacher or frying pan.  Discard the fennel and bay leaves and transfer the salmon to a warm platter.  Pour the sauce over the salmon, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Aromatic fennel leaves infuse salmon with their delicate flavor in this simple dish.  It's easiest to cook the salmon in a fish poacher, but a large deep frying pan will also work.  I like to serve boiled artichokes and "Croquette Di Patate" (see recipe) with the salmon.

                      Pork Chops Spoleto Style - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     pitted oil-cured Kalamata olives
  6                     pitted oil-cured Cerignola olives
                        = (or other green olives)
  4                     center-cut pork chops
     1/4           cup  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        = (such as Orvieto Classico)

Use a chef's knife to mince the olives together into a fine paste.  Transfer the paste to a small bowl and set aside.

Dry the pork chops well on both sides with paper towels.  This will help to insure that they brown well.  Drop them into a heavy-duty paper bag with the flour, salt, and pepper.  Close the bag and shake to coat the chops.  Remove them from the bag, shaking off the excess flour and place them on a dish.

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan large enough to hold the chops in one layer.  When the oil begins to shimmer and smoke, add the chops, lower the heat to medium, and brown them well on both sides.  Pour in 3/4 cup of the wine and allow most of it to evaporate.  Remove the chops to a dish and keep them warm.  Stir the olive paste and the remaining wine into the pan and scrape up any bits clinging to the bottom of the pan.  Pour the sauce over the chops and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Not too far from Norcia is Spoleto, the city of music, where each year the festival dei Due Mondi is held, attracting music lovers from all over the world.  The food here, as in other parts of Umbria, is defined by its fine extra-virgin olive oil, olives, and pork products.  These savory and easy to prepare pork chops are characteristic of the style of cooking alla Spoletina, which utilizes the local ingredients of olives, olive oil, and Orvieto Classico wine.

         Pork In Balsamic Vinegar - {Maiale Con Aceto Balsamico}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
  1             medium  white onion -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
  3        tablespoons  fresh rosemary
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh sage
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
     2/3           cup  balsamic vinegar
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
  1         tablespoon  pink peppercorns
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === TENDERLOIN ===
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless pork tenderloin
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
     2/3           cup  dry white wine
                        = (preferably Frascati)

To make the marinade, in a skillet, combine the onion and cider vinegar and simmer until the onion is soft.  Add the rosemary, sage, parsley, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, peppercorns, and extra-virgin olive oil.  Stir well, remove from the heat, and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Pat the meat dry with paper towels and rub it all over with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Sprinkle with salt and black pepper.

In a frying pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat and brown the meat on all sides.  Transfer the meat to a baking dish and add 1/3 cup of the wine to the dish.  Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until cooked to 155 to 160 degrees.  Midway through the cooking, add the remaining 1/3 cup wine to the pan.

Transfer the meat to a deep nonmetal dish just large enough to hold it.  Pour the marinade over the meat, and let it marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or up to 3 days.

Bring the meat, in the marinade, to room temperature before serving.  Cut it in thin slices, arrange on a serving platter, and spoon some of the marinade over the slices.

Note:  This dish can also be reheated in the marinade and served warm.  Either way, it is a winner.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Umbria, the central region of Italy, is noted for its porchetta, or suckling pig, grilled on an open spit with fresh rosemary until the skin crackles and is almost bronze-colored.  When I was studying the food of Umbria, I was inspired by the many ways pork is prepared, including this dish, which uses pork tenderloin.  It is so easy to prepare and it can be cooked up to 3 days ahead.  The marinade, which includes balsamic vinegar, gives the pork a flavor that is hard to beat.

                    Pork Scallops In Green Sauce - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  packed flat leaf parsley -- stems removed
     1/2           cup  packed fresh basil leaves -- stems removed
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/2           cup  walnut pieces
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  5        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  thin sliced (abt 1/4"-thk) pork cutlet
     1/2           cup  sliced mushrooms
                        = (button, cremini, portobello, or
                        porcini)

Pour 4 cups of water in a saucepan and bring to a boil; add the parsley and basil and blanch the leaves for about 30 seconds or just until they are limp.  Drain the leaves and dry them on paper towels.

Put the leaves, lemon juice, butter, garlic, and walnuts in the bowl of a food processor.  Pour about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the olive oil through the feed tube with the motor running.  Process the mixture until a smooth paste forms.  If more oil is needed, add it through the feed tube.  The sauce should be fluid but not too thin.  Transfer the sauce to a small bowl and set aside.

Pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into a large saute pan, heating it until the oil begins to shimmer.  Brown the pork pieces a few at a time on both sides, adding additional olive oil if the pan gets dry.  As the pieces brown, remove them to a dish.  Stir in the mushrooms, adding a little more oil if necessary and cook them over medium heat until they exude their liquid and begin to brown.

Return the cutlets to the pan, lower the heat and stir in the sauce.  Gently mix all the ingredients until hot.  Transfer the pork and sauce to a platter and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Salsa verde, green sauce, is the secret to the success of this boneless pork cutlet dish.  Without the sauce the meat is rather bland.  Use thin, pounded slices of pork for the scallopine.  A trick for keeping the sauce looking green is to drop the parsley and basil leaves in boiling water for 30 seconds, then drain and dry them before making the sauce.  The sauce is also good served over pasta or mixed into risotto.

Pour 4 cups of water in a saucepan and bring to a boil; add the parsley and basil and blanch the leaves for about 30 seconds or just until they are limp.  Drain the leaves and dry them on paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the leaves, lemon juice, butter, garlic, and walnuts in the bowl of a food processor.  Pour about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the olive oil through the feed tube with the motor running.  Process the mixture until a smooth paste forms.  If more oil is needed, add it through the feed tube.  The sauce should be fluid but not too thin.  Transfer the sauce to a small bowl and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into a large saute pan, heating it until the oil begins to shimmer.  Brown the pork pieces a few at a time on both sides, adding additional olive oil if the pan gets dry.  As the pieces brown, remove them to a dish.  Stir in the mushrooms, adding a little more oil if necessary and cook them over medium heat until they exude their liquid and begin to brown.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the cutlets to the pan, lower the heat and stir in the sauce.  Gently mix all the ingredients until hot.  Transfer the pork and sauce to a platter and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Salsa verde, green sauce, is the secret to the success of this boneless pork cutlet dish.  Without the sauce the meat is rather bland.  Use thin, pounded slices of pork for the scallopine.  A trick for keeping the sauce looking green is to drop the parsley and basil leaves in boiling water for 30 seconds, then drain and dry them before making the sauce.  The sauce is also good served over pasta or mixed into risotto.

          Pork-Stuffed Artichokes - {Carciofi Ripieni Di Maiale}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pork                            Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  artichokes - (abt 2 lbs)
  1              pound  ground pork
     1/3           cup  diced onion
  2        tablespoons  minced Italian parsley leaves
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1 1/2           cups  fresh crushed plum tomatoes

With a knife, remove the stems of the artichokes and discard them.  With your hands, pull off the first layer of artichoke leaves at the base and discard them.  Cut 1/4-inch off of the tops of the artichokes, and with a scissors snip any needle-like points off the leaves.

Rinse the artichokes, place them in a saucepan just large enough to hold them snugly upright, and cover them with water.  Bring the artichokes to a boil, cover the pan, and boil them for 10 minutes.  With a slotted spoon remove the artichokes to a cutting board.

When cool enough to handle use a melon baller to scrape out the hairy choke from the center of the artichoke, and pull away the palest-looking innermost leaves.  Set the artichokes aside while you make the filling.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat a dry saute pan over medium-high heat.  Stir in the pork and cook until it begins to exude its fat.  Discard most of the fat.  Stir in the onions and continue cooking until the onions have wilted and the meat begins to brown.  Transfer the meat mixture to a bowl.  Stir in the parsley, salt, pepper, oregano, and cheese.  Allow the mixture to cool slightly.

Fill the cavities of the artichokes with the meat mixture, packing it in gently.  Place the artichokes in a deep casserole dish just large enough to hold them.  Pour the tomatoes over and around the artichokes.  Cover the pan with a cover or a piece of aluminum foil.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes.  Halfway through the cooking time, check to see if the bottom of the pan is dry; add a little water if necessary.

Serve the artichokes hot.

Tip:  To keep artichokes upright while cooking, position chunks of potatoes between them in the pot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  If you are in Florence in early spring, take a moment to admire the piles of gorgeous purplish-green and wine-colored artichokes at the Mercato Centrale near San Lorenzo.  They are so tender that they can be cut into thin slices and eaten raw in salads.  Ask the vendors how they like to cook them, and you could get enough versions to write a cookbook.  I have grown artichokes in my own garden to my great surprise but the season is usually not long enough, and the plants were started early in the greenhouse.  Use globe artichokes, which are not anywhere near as tender as Italian varieties, but knowing how to cook them yields good results.  In this recipe the artichokes are boiled briefly, then hollowed out to remove the hairy choke and filled with ground pork and baked in the oven with fresh tomatoes.

                Potato Croquettes - {Croquette Di Patate}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Side Dish
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  all-purpose potatoes -- peeled, quartered
  4        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  3              large  egg yolks
     3/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1              large  egg -- beaten

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the potatoes until tender.  Drain well, return them to the pot, and let then dry in the heat of the pot, shaking occasionally.

Place the potatoes in a bowl and mash until smooth.  Add 2 tablespoons of the butter, the egg yolks, nutmeg, and salt, and blend well.

Lightly butter a cookie sheet.  Spread the potato mixture evenly on the sheet.  Brush the top of the potatoes with the remaining butter, cover with wax paper, and refrigerate until cold, about 25 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 12- by 9-inch baking dish.  Sprinkle a work surface with 1/4 cup flour.  Dip your hands in the flour, then pull off a piece of the cold potatoes about the size of an egg, and form it into a cylinder.  Roll the cylinder lightly in the flour, and place in the baking dish.  Repeat with the remaining potato mixture, adding flour to the work surface as necessary.

Brush the tops of the croquettes with the beaten egg.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until nicely browned.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  These nutmeg-scented oven-baked potato croquettes can be prepared up to 2 hours ahead and refrigerated until ready to bake.  Do not mash the potatoes in a food processor; they will turn to glue.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  wild or domestic rabbit -- cut up
                        Juice of 1 lemon
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     2/3           cup  diced pancetta or prosciutto
  1             medium  white onion -- peeled, sliced thin
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled and minced
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2 1/2           cups  crushed peeled seeded plum tomatoes
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh sage
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper

Place the rabbit in a noncorrosive dish, pour in the lemon juice, and add enough cold water to come to the top of the dish.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.  Drain rabbit and pat dry.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a heavy ovenproof skillet, heat the olive oil, add the pancetta or prosciutto, and the rabbit pieces, and brown quickly on all sides.  Remove rabbit and pancetta to a dish.

Add the onion to the skillet and saute until soft. Add the garlic and also saute until soft.  Add the vinegar, tomatoes, and wine, mix well, then simmer the mixture for 5 minutes.

Add the sage, salt, and pepper to the skillet.  Return the rabbit and pancetta to the pan, cover pan with foil, and bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until the rabbit is easily pierced with a fork.  Serve with the sauce poured over the rabbit.

Note:  Serve this dish with polenta and pour some of the sauce over the slices.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Wild game dishes are very popular in Italy.  In this recipe wild rabbit is marinated overnight in lemon juice and water to take away some of the "gamey" taste.  If you like a stronger flavor or are using domestic rabbit, eliminate the marinating.

                        Thin wooden skewers
                        Sterilized 20-ounce bottle

In a saucepan, combine the vinegar, 1/4 cup of the raspberries, the sugar, and salt and bring to a boil.  Boil for 3 minutes.  Strain through a sieve set over a bowl, pressing on the raspberries to extract as much juice as possible.  Set aside to cool slightly.  Skewer the remaining raspberries and place them in the sterilized bottle.  Add the mint sprigs.

Insert a funnel into the mouth of the bottle and pour in the raspberry vinegar.  Cap or cork the bottle and place it in a sunny spot for 8 hours.

Place the vinegar in a dark place and let it age for about 6 weeks before using.

This recipe yields 2 1/2 cups.

Comments:  Fruit-flavored vinegars were served as refreshing hot-weather drinks by the ancient Romans.  Fruit vinegars are best made with seasonal fruits.  This recipe for raspberry vinegar is easily adaptable; try blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, or a mix.  Use a good-quality white vinegar.  Sometimes I create food still lifes with my vinegars, adding a sprig of mint, as here, or curled strips of orange or lime zest.  Use the vinegar on potato or green salads, for deglazing pans when cooking pork chops or chicken, or on fresh fruit salads.

Roast for 2 1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer registers 180 degrees, and the meat is tender.  Baste with the white wine while the capon is cooking.

Let the capon cool about 20 minutes before carving into pieces and serving with some of the stuffing.

                    Roast Lamb - {Abbacchio Al Forno}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Lamb
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  leg of lamb
  3                     garlic cloves -- slivered
  3             sprigs  fresh rosemary -- leaves only
                        = (or 2 tbspns dried rosemary)
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1                cup  dry white wine

Wipe the meat dry with paper towels.  With a small knife make slits about 1-inch deep all over the meat and insert the slivers of garlic and rosemary.

In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, salt, and pepper and mix well with a fork.  Rub the mixture all over the lamb, coating it well.  Place the meat in a deep dish, cover it, and let it marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the lamb on a rack in a roasting pan and add the wine to the pan.  Roast for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 170 degrees, basting the meat every 15 minutes with the pan juices.  Remove the roast to a cutting board and let cool slightly.

Carve into pieces, arrange on a platter, and pour the pan juices over the meat.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Roast baby lamb, considered a delicacy, takes the place of honor on the Italian Easter table.  The word abbacchio refers specifically to baby lamb weighing between 15 and 25 pounds and milk-fed.  Lamb is prepared in many ways in Italy: Grilled on a spit, braised, stewed, and roasted in the oven.  The Romans take particular pride in their method of cooking lamb.

             Roast Pork Tenderloin With Juniper Berries - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  pancetta -- thinly sliced
  1              large  shallot -- peeled
  2                     pork tenderloins - (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             medium  onion -- thinly sliced
  2                     bay leaves
  1           teaspoon  juniper berries -- crushed
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  2          teaspoons  olive oil

Place the pancetta and shallot in a food processor and pulse to a paste.  Or mince together with a sharp knife until a fine paste is obtained.  Season with salt and pepper.

Pat the meat dry with paper towels.  With a sharp knife, make 1/2-inch-long and 1/2-inch-deep slits along the length of each tenderloin on both sides.  Insert the pancetta mixture into the slits, packing it in well.  Season the tenderloins with salt and coarse pepper.  Set aside.

In a dish large enough to hold the tenderloins in one layer, mix together the onion, bay leaves, juniper berries, wine, and olive oil.  Add the tenderloins and turn them once or twice in the mixture.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight, basting occasionally with the marinade.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Drain the tenderloins, reserving the marinade.  Place the tenderloins in a roasting pan and roast for 45 minutes to 1 hour, basting from time to time with the reserved marinade.

Remove the tenderloins to a cutting board, reserving the pan juices, and let rest for about 10 minutes.  Then cut into thin slices, place on a platter, and pour the pan juices over the top.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The faint scent of juniper berries and aromatic roasting pork tenderloin is a sign in my kitchen that fall cooking has begun.  This dish tastes best if you can let the meat marinate overnight, but this is not essential.  Pork tenderloins are usually sold two to a package and weigh about one and a quarter pounds each.

                   Roasted Pork Da Ventura Style - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6 1/2         pounds  boneless center-cut loin pork roast -- butterflied
                        = (or sirloin roast)
  2                     garlic heads -- separated and
                        left unpeeled - (abt 12 to 15 cloves)
  2        tablespoons  fine sea salt - (to 3)
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  ground fennel seeds or fennel pollen*
                        Extra pork fat -- as needed
  4                     fennel tops with stems

* Note:  Marco used finocchio fiore or fennel flower to flavor the pork.  I bought some in a small grocery store in Sansepolcro.  You can substitute ground fennel seeds by placing whole fennel seeds in a small grinder.  Or you can buy a product called fennel pollen in specialty stores or through catalogs such as Penzey's.

When you get the roast home form the butcher, open it like a book.  Flatten the garlic cloves slightly with the back of a knife and sprinkle the garlic randomly over the meat.  It may seem like a lot of garlic, but you will be surprised at how mild the flavor will be.  Sprinkle the salt, and a grinding of black pepper evenly over the meat, then sprinkle on the ground fennel seeds or pollen.  Now roll the meat up tightly like a jellyroll.  Spread the extra pork fat on top of the roast.  Put the whole fennel leaves on top of the pork fat, and anchor everything in place by going around the roast, tying it in several places with kitchen string.

Put the roast in a pan, cover it with aluminum foil and put it in the refrigerator to marinate for two days.  Marco says that this is critical to developing the flavors.

When you are ready to cook the roast, preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Put the roast in a roasting pan and cook it on the middle oven rack for 1 1/2 hours, then raise the temperature to 425 degrees and cook 1 hour longer.  The roast should be almost bronzed looking.

Cut the strings and discard them along with the fennel tops.  Let the roast stand for 5 or 10 minutes covered.  It will slice better if you are patient.  Cut the roast into serving slices and accompany with roasted potatoes.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  This incredible pork roast known as pancetta di maiale in porchetta was worth the trip to Sansepolcro where chef Marco Tofanelli made it for me just as I had remembered his father preparing it years ago at Da Ventura.  Pancetta refers to pork from the belly of the pig.  The flavor is sweeter than our pork and the meat must marinate for two days to meld the seasonings.  To achieve the crispy exterior, ask your butcher to give you extra pork fat for placing on top of the meat, since American pork is much leaner than the Italian equivalent.  This is a great holiday main entree, and the next best thing to being at Da Ventura.

           Rolled Stuffed Turkey Breast - {Rollato Di Tacchino}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Poultry                         Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3         pound  whole chestnuts
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  fresh bread crumbs
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- diced
     1/4           cup  fresh rosemary leaves
  3        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  4             pounds  turkey breast -- butterflied
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  With a small knife, make an X in the top of each chestnut.  Place on a rimmed baking sheet and roast for about 25 minutes, or until the skins split.  Remove and let cool.  Reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees.

Crack the chestnuts open with a nutcracker and remove the nutmeats.  Coarsely chop the nutmeats and put in a large bowl.

In a skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil.  Add the bread crumbs and fry until lightly browned.  Add to the chestnuts.

Add 1 more tablespoon of the oil to the skillet, and saute the prosciutto until crispy.  Add to the bread crumbs.  Add the rosemary, parsley, garlic, cheese, and 1 tablespoon of the oil and mix well.  (The stuffing can be covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days.)

Lay the turkey breast out flat on a cutting board.  Place a large piece of wax paper over the turkey and pound it with a meat pounder to flatten it to an even thickness.  Rub the inside of the turkey with salt and pepper.  Spread the stuffing mixture evenly over the turkey breast to within 1 inch of the edges.  Do not worry if all of the stuffing does not fit; save any excess for topping the breast after it is rolled.

Starting at a long side, roll the turkey up like a jelly roll and tie it with string in four or five places.

In a large skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat.  Brown the turkey roll on all sides.  Transfer the turkey roll to a rack in a roasting pan and add the pan juices from the skillet.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and pat on any remaining stuffing over the top.

Add 1/2 cup of wine to the pan.  Roast for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until the internal temperature registers 175 to 180 degrees on an instant-read thermometer.  Baste the meat occasionally with the pan juices, adding the remaining 1 cup wine to the pan halfway through the cooking time.

Let the meat rest for 15 minutes before slicing it.  Then cut the roll into 1/2-inch slices, arrange them on a platter, and pour any pan juices over the meat.  Serve hot, or let cool completely and serve at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday.  I am in the kitchen many days before making preparations so the holiday dinner runs as smoothly as possible.  On our table, traditional turkey has given way to a stuffed turkey breast, prepared the way Italians like to have it in Perugia, the capital of Umbria.  The beauty of this recipe is that it can be made two days ahead and reheated or served at room temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  cubed eggplant
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  peanut oil -- (1/4 to 1/2)
  2             ounces  pancetta -- diced
  1             medium  white onion -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled and minced
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2              whole  chicken breasts - (abt 2 lbs)
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
  2              large  ripe plum tomatoes -- diced
  3                     fresh basil leaves - (to 4) -- chopped

Place the eggplant in a colander.  Sprinkle with salt and let stand for 1 hour.  Rinse and dry well.

In a skillet, heat 1/4 cup peanut oil.  Add the eggplant and saute until soft, about 6 to 7 minutes.  Add more oil as needed.  Set the eggplant aside.

In a heavy, heatproof 9-inch casserole, saute the pancetta over medium heat until it begins to brown.  Add the onion and saute until soft.  Add the garlic and continue cooking until garlic is soft.  Remove the ingredients to a dish and set aside.

Heat the olive oil in the casserole, add the chicken breasts, and brown slowly on each side.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Add the reserved pancetta mixture along with the wine, tomatoes, and basil and stir to blend well.

Cover the casserole and cook the chicken slowly for 45 minutes.  Add the eggplant and cook 5 minutes more.  Remove the chicken breasts to a cutting board and cut in half.  Serve the chicken with the vegetable mixture spooned over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  My husband loves this rustic chicken dish, which is even better eaten the day after it is prepared.  The pancetta and onions add the right balance of flavor.  Team this dish with polenta, pasta, rice, or potatoes.

                Sausage

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  lentils
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4         pound  pancetta -- diced
  1              large  onion -- diced
  1                     carrot -- peeled and diced
  1                     celery rib -- diced
  1              pound  Fresh Sausage -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  Tomato And Basil Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1                     bay leaf
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste

Put the lentils in a bowl, add water to cover, and let soak for several hours or overnight.  Drain.

Place the lentils in a soup pot, add 2 quarts of water, and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer, covered, for about 35 minutes, or until tender.  Drain and set aside.

In a skillet, heat the olive oil.  Add the pancetta, onion, carrot, and celery, and cook until very soft, about 6 minutes.  Remove to a dish.

In the same skillet, cook the sausage, turning frequently, until nicely browned.  Remove the sausage to paper towels to drain, then place in another dish and cover to keep warm.

Discard the fat in skillet.  Return the vegetables to the skillet, and add the tomato sauce, lentils, and bay leaf.  Cook over low heat, covered, for 5 minutes.  Season with salt, and remove from the heat.

Cut the sausage into pieces.  Pour the lentil mixture into the center of a serving platter, arrange the sausages around it, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  For Capodanno (New Year's Day), it is traditional to eat lentils and zampone, pork sausage stuffed into the skin of a pig's foot.  Here I use natural hog casings because they are more readily available.  Because they resemble tiny coins, lentils are eaten as a symbol of good luck for the coming year.

                Sausage With Penne And Tomato Sauce - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Sausage

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  homemade sausages
                        = (or store-bought Italian sausage)
     1/2           cup  water
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  1              pound  penne or other short-cut pasta
  3 1/2           cups  prepared tomato sauce
     1/2         pound  mozzarella cheese -- cubed

Put the sausage in a saute pan, add the water, and simmer uncovered until the sausage turns gray.  Discard the water and continue cooking the sausage until it begins to brown.  Add the onions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the sausage has browned on all sides and the onions are wilted.  Transfer the onions to a bowl.  Set aside.

Remove the sausage to a cutting board and allow it to cool for 5 minutes.  Cut the sausage in 1/4-inch rounds and add the sausage to the bowl with the onions.  Set aside.

Cook the penne in a pasta pot in 4 to 6 quarts of boiling water with 1 tablespoon of salt until it is al dente.  Drain the penne and transfer it to the bowl with the sausage.  Mix in 3 cups of the sauce and half of the mozzarella.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Transfer the mixture to a 9- by 13 1/2-inch baking dish.  Pour the remaining sauce over the top and sprinkle with the remaining cheese.

Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in the oven until bubbly.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I learned how to make Italian sausage from my parents, and out of the seven siblings only my brother Robert and I continue this tradition.  His sausage is very lean and his spicing is just right.  Many people think that they need an expensive meat grinder to make pork sausage.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  All you need is a sausage funnel and natural hog casings.  It actually takes longer to make the sausage in a grinder than by hand, and there is the mess to consider afterward.  To make this really simple, ask your butcher to grind a pork butt once on coarse and once on fine grind.  Then take it home and follow the instruction in my first book, Ciao Italia, for Salsiccia Fresca.  Whether you use homemade or store-bought sausage, this casserole makes a satisfying winter meal.

          Scallops With Asiago Cheese - {Cappesante Con Asiago}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh sea scallops
                        === ASIAGO CREAM SAUCE ===
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  grated Asiago cheese
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  1              pound  homemade or store-bought fettucine
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley

In a 2-quart saucepan, bring 4 cups water to a boil.  Add the scallops, reduce the heat, and simmer until they turn milky-white, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain in a colander and set aside.

To make the sauce, in a large frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the garlic and saute until soft.  Lower the heat and add the cream, Asiago cheese, salt and pepper, and nutmeg.  Stir until smooth, set aside, and cover to keep warm.

In a large pot of boiling water, cook the fettucine until al dente.  Drain well.  Add the fettucine and scallops to the warm sauce.  Gently stir to mix and coat the fettucine and scallops with the sauce, and reheat over low heat if necessary.  Transfer to a serving platter, sprinkle with the parsley, and serve immediately.  Delicious!

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Variation:  Use a combination of fresh shrimp and scallops

Comments:  I developed this seafood and pasta dish one day when I had Asiago cheese on hand.  This cow's milk cheese from northern Italy is available here, but it is not well known.  A semihard cheese with a wonderful nutty flavor, it is good as an eating cheese, grated over pasta, or melted in a cream sauce for scallops and fettucine.  This delicious dish can be put together very quickly.  You can use store-bought fettucine if you wish.

              Shoemaker-Style Chicken - {Pollo Scarpariello}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Italian
                Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  bone-in chicken pieces -- cut small pieces
  1                cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice*
                        Grated zest of 2 large lemons
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        Grinding of black pepper
     1/2           cup  flour
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  3              large  garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        finely minced
     1/2           cup  minced parsley leaves

* Note:  You'll get more juice from lemons if they are at room temperature, not refrigerated.  Roll them around before squeezing.

Wash and dry the chicken pieces and set aside.

In a plastic zipper-lock bag combine 1/2 cup of the lemon juice, the zest, salt, and pepper.  Add the chicken pieces, close the bag, and shake to distribute the ingredients around the chicken pieces.  Refrigerate overnight.

Remove the chicken from the marinade and dry the pieces well with paper towels.  Discard the marinade.  Pour the flour into a large paper bag, add the chicken pieces, close the bag tightly, and shake the bag to coat the chicken pieces with flour.  Remove the chicken pieces to a dish and set aside.

In a heavy-duty saute pan large enough to hold all the pieces in a single layer, heat the olive oil and butter until hot.  Add the chicken pieces, skin-side down, and brown them well over high heat.  This will take about 10 minutes.  Lower the heat to medium and continue to cook the chicken, uncovered, for about 20 minutes, or until the chicken is fork-tender.  Remove the chicken to a warm platter.

Stir the garlic into the drippings and cook it over medium heat until soft.  Pour in the remaining lemon juice, add the parsley, and stir and cook for 1 minute, scraping up any browned bits remaining in the pan.  Pour the juice over the chicken pieces, season with additional salt and pepper, if desired, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Comments:  Pollo scarpariello, or shoemaker-style chicken, is a country-style Neapolitan favorite with many variations.  With just a few choice ingredients and seasonings the taste is sensational.  Small bone-in chicken pieces provide the best flavor, and freshly squeezed lemon juice is a must.  Marinate the chicken at least one day before cooking in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag, shaking it occasionally to ensure it gets evenly seasoned.  The secret to the crispy golden crust is to use a good-quality heavy saute pan; the chicken is browned on high heat to seal in the juices.

* Note:  You&apos;ll get more juice from lemons if they are at room temperature, not refrigerated.  Roll them around before squeezing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wash and dry the chicken pieces and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a plastic zipper-lock bag combine 1/2 cup of the lemon juice, the zest, salt, and pepper.  Add the chicken pieces, close the bag, and shake to distribute the ingredients around the chicken pieces.  Refrigerate overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the chicken from the marinade and dry the pieces well with paper towels.  Discard the marinade.  Pour the flour into a large paper bag, add the chicken pieces, close the bag tightly, and shake the bag to coat the chicken pieces with flour.  Remove the chicken pieces to a dish and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a heavy-duty saute pan large enough to hold all the pieces in a single layer, heat the olive oil and butter until hot.  Add the chicken pieces, skin-side down, and brown them well over high heat.  This will take about 10 minutes.  Lower the heat to medium and continue to cook the chicken, uncovered, for about 20 minutes, or until the chicken is fork-tender.  Remove the chicken to a warm platter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir the garlic into the drippings and cook it over medium heat until soft.  Pour in the remaining lemon juice, add the parsley, and stir and cook for 1 minute, scraping up any browned bits remaining in the pan.  Pour the juice over the chicken pieces, season with additional salt and pepper, if desired, and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Pollo scarpariello, or shoemaker-style chicken, is a country-style Neapolitan favorite with many variations.  With just a few choice ingredients and seasonings the taste is sensational.  Small bone-in chicken pieces provide the best flavor, and freshly squeezed lemon juice is a must.  Marinate the chicken at least one day before cooking in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag, shaking it occasionally to ensure it gets evenly seasoned.  The secret to the crispy golden crust is to use a good-quality heavy saute pan; the chicken is browned on high heat to seal in the juices.

                   Shrimp With Linguini And Lemon - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  large shrimp in the shell
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled, and
                        cut in half lengthwise
  1              small  dried hot red pepper -- halved lengthwise
     3/4         pound  linguine
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt -- or more to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh parsley

In a medium saucepan, bring about 6 cups of water to a boil.  Add the shrimp and cook just until the shells turn pink, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain the shrimp in a colander and cool.  Shell and devein the shrimp, then cut in half lengthwise, but not through the tail, and set aside.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil with the garlic and red pepper.  Saute very slowly, pressing on the garlic and pepper with a wooden spoon to extract juice.  Remove and discard the garlic when it starts to soften and turn golden.  Remove the pepper when soft and discard.  Set skillet aside.

In a large pot, bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a boil.  Add the linguine and boil until al dente, or firm but not mushy.

While the linguine is cooking, reheat the skillet, add the shrimp, and saute for about 2 minutes.  Sprinkle in the sea salt and pepper.

Drain the linguine in a colander and immediately add to the shrimp.  Add the lemon juice, zest, and parsley and toss well.  Transfer to a large platter and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This light and easy to prepare scampi and linguine says it all about Italian cooking; use fresh ingredients and keep the treatment simple.

           Sole In Lemon And Oil - {Sogliola Al Limone Ed Olio}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Juice of 2 large lemons
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/3           cup  finely-minced flat-leaf parsley -- plus
                        additional sprigs for garnish
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             pounds  sole or flounder fillets
                        Lemon wedges -- for serving

In a glass dish large enough to hold the fish in one layer, mix together 1/4 cup of the olive oil, the lemon juice, garlic, parsley, and salt and pepper.  Set aside.

In a skillet, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil until smoking hot.  Add the fish, a few pieces at a time, and fry until golden brown, turning once or twice.  Remove the fish to a cutting board and let cool.  Set the pan aside.

Cut the fish into small squares and place them in the marinade.  Strain any oil remaining in the frying pan and pour it over the fish.  Cover the dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, occasionally spooning the marinade over the fish.

Bring the fish to room temperature before serving.  Arrange the fish on a platter and garnish with lemon wedges and sprigs of parsley.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The ancient Romans gave the name solea to sole because this flatfish reminds them of the sole of a sandal.  A carryover of the ancient Roman practice of preserving fish is sole marinated in lemon juice and olive oil, prepared for la vigilia.  Dover or gray sole, both mild in flavor and delicate in texture, are good for this dish, but the firmer petrale sole, which is really flounder, is a good substitute.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              dozen  small fresh clams
                        = (like mahogany or Littleneck clams)
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1                cup  thinly-sliced scallions - (abt 10)
  1                cup  thinly-sliced fennel -- bulb only
  2          teaspoons  diced seeded jalapeÒo pepper -- or more to taste
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  diced drained dried tomatoes in olive oil
     3/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  1 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  1              pound  store-bought spaghetti, linguine, or
                        shells

Scrub the clams and soak in several changes of water (discard any with broken shells).

Cut four sheets of parchment paper into 13- by 22-inch pieces and set aside.

Rinse the clams, place them in a large saute pan, add the 1 cup of wine, cover the pan, and cook over medium heat just until the clams open.  Remove them with a slotted spoon to a bowl.  Discard any clams that do not open.

Strain the cooking liquid through damp cheesecloth into a bowl; reserve 1 cup of it, and set it aside.  Shuck the clams, leaving eight in their shells.  Set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan over medium heat.  Cook the scallions and fennel, stirring, until the fennel softens; stir in the diced jalapeÒo and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic softens but does not brown.  Stir in the tomatoes, salt, and pepper and cook for 1 minute.  Add the reserved cooking liquid and the 1/2 cup wine.  Stir once or twice, reduce the heat to low and let the sauce cook, uncovered, for about 5 minutes.  Turn off the heat and stir in the parsley, lemon juice, and shucked clams.  Cover the pan and keep warm while the spaghetti cooks.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Cook the pasta following the package directions.  Drain the pasta and add it to the pan with the clams; toss well to distribute the sauce.  Divide the mixture among the parchment papers, mounding it in the center of each sheet.  Place two of the remaining clams in the shells on top of each sheet.  Bring the corners of the parchment paper up and twist them in the center to form a bundle.  Tie each with kitchen string.

Place the bundles on a cookie sheet and cook for 10 minutes.  Transfer each bundle to four individual shallow soup bowls and serve immediately, allowing, each person to open his or her own bundle.

Note:  For a less showy presentation, transfer the pasta and sauce directly to a platter.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Guests will love opening these rustic-looking parchment bundles of spaghetti with clams.  This is a favorite recipe as much for the presentation as well as the taste.  Parchment paper keeps the pasta moist, and as soon as the bundles are opened, the escaping aroma brings you right to the seashore.  Make the dish as spicy as you would like by controlling the amount of fresh hot pepper added.  And be sure to strain the cooking liquid from the clams well to eliminate any sand or grit.

                   Spinach-Stuffed Chicken Breast - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Italian
                Main Dish                       Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     chicken cutlets - (abt 2 lbs)
  2                     bags fresh spinach - (10 oz ea) -- stemmed, rinsed,
                        and drained
  4 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  1              large  garlic clove -- diced
  1                cup  diced Italian Fontina cheese
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        === SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all- purpose flour
     2/3           cup  Homemade Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste

With a meat pounder, flatten the cutlets to a 1/4-inch thickness, being careful not to tear the meat.  Set aside.

Place the spinach in a dry large skillet, cover, and cook over medium heat until wilted, about 5 minutes.  Drain and squeeze dry.  Coarsely chop and set aside.

In the same skillet, heat 2 1/2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Add the onions and garlic and cook until the onions are lightly browned.  Add the spinach and cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and let cool slightly.  Wipe out the skillet and set aside.

Stir the cheese, nutmeg, and salt into the spinach.  Spread the mixture evenly over the cutlets.  Roll each one up like a jelly roll and tie with string or fasten with toothpicks.

Return the skillet to medium-high heat and heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Add the chicken rolls and cook until nicely browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Remove the rolls to a serving dish and cover to keep warm.

Reduce the heat to medium and melt the butter.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, until the mixture forms a paste, about 1 minute.  Slowly add the broth and wine, whisking until the sauce is smooth.  Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice and salt.  Pour the sauce over the chicken and serve immediately.

Note:  The dish can be prepared a few hours in advance, covered with foil, and refrigerated.  To serve, heat, covered, for about thirty minutes in a preheated 350 degrees oven.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Nutmeg, spinach, and Fontina cheese are favorite ingredients in northern Italian cooking.  Chicken cutlets stuffed with a mixture of the three and served with a white wine sauce make a perfect company dish.  Prepare a few hours in advance if you like and then reheat before serving.

                     Stewed Cod - {Merluzzo Stufato}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- diced
  2                     celery ribs -- diced
  2               cups  coarsely-chopped plum tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  capers in brine -- drained and minced
  1                     bay leaf
  2        tablespoons  chopped flat-leaf parsley
  2             pounds  fresh cod -- cut into chunks
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and celery and cook until soft.  Stir in the tomatoes, capers, bay leaf, and parsley and simmer, covered, for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the cod, cover, and cook over low heat for about 8 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.  Add salt to taste and serve.

Variation:  The fish can also be served as a sauce over spaghetti.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  It required patience to prepare dried salt cod (baccala), stiff as a board, for la vigilia.  A few days before Christmas Eve, we would place it in the sink and turn the faucet on to a lazy drip to allow the fish to rehydrate slowly before stewing it.  Now I save time by using fresh cod instead of dried.

                  Stewed Red Mullet - {Triglia In Umido}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 3     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              whole  garlic cloves -- peeled
  1           teaspoon  hot red pepper flakes
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced chives
  1              pound  fresh or canned crushed tomatoes
  1              pound  fresh whole gutted red mullet -- rinsed and dried
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan large enough to hold the fish in a single layer.  When the oil begins to shimmer, stir in the garlic and, over medium heat, swirl the garlic in the oil until it begins to brown.  Stir in the red pepper flakes and cook 1 minute.  Stir in the parsley, chives and tomatoes.  Lower the heat and simmer the mixture for 10 minutes uncovered.  Add the fish in a single layer, covering them with some of the sauce.  Cook about 5 minutes turning them once with a wide spatula.  The fish is cooked when it easily flakes when poked with a fork.  Add salt and pepper to taste.

Serve the fish with some of the sauce and boiled new potatoes or boiled onions.

This recipe yields 2 to 3 servings.

Comments:  Triglia in umido (Stewed Red Mullet) is another fish dish that comes from Livorno and one that Maria Pia loves to serve to company since it is so quick to prepare and ready in 15 minutes.  Red mullet is extremely delicate so cooking it slowly is the key to keeping it in one piece.

        Stuffed Cabbage Cooked In Earthenware - {Terrina Di Verza}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  Savoy cabbage head -- washed, and
                        center core removed
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2         pound  ground pork
     1/4         pound  ground sirloin tips
     1/4         pound  chicken breast
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
     1/3           cup  minced Italian parsley
  2          teaspoons  minced marjoram or thyme
                        = (or 1/4 tspn dried marjoram or thyme)
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon zest
     1/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  6        tablespoons  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  2        tablespoons  grated Pecorino cheese
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
     2/3           cup  chicken broth

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.  Add the cabbage and cook just until the leaves begin to wilt and are limp enough for rolling.  Remove the cabbage with a slotted spoon and allow to cool until easy to handle.

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan and when it is hot add the meats and garlic and cook until the meats are browned.  Drain the meats through a colander to remove the excess fat.  Transfer the meat to a bowl and stir in the herbs, lemon zest, bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese, all of the Pecorino cheese, egg, salt, and black pepper.  Set the mixture aside.

Separate the cabbage leaves leaving them as whole as possible.  If you need to patch, overlap the leaves.  Divide the meat mixture among 8 of the largest leaves and roll each one up like a little bundle.

Lightly brush an earthenware baking dish or other casserole dish with olive oil and place the cabbage rolls in the dish.  Pour the chicken broth around the rolls, cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake the rolls for 30 minutes.  Remove the foil, sprinkle the tops of the rolls with the remaining Parmesan cheese, and continue baking the rolls for an additional 10 minutes.

Serve the rolls hot with some of the juices poured over them.

Variation:  5 minutes before the rolls are done, add bits of sun dried tomatoes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  One of my favorite restaurants in Umbria is Villa Roncalli in the town of Foligno.  This well appointed country restaurant specializes in spit-roasted meats, game, fowlÖand songbirds.  Since my last visit there the Italian government and nature lovers have taken steps to protect the depleting songbird population, and they are no longer featured on the menu.  One of the dishes I recall with fondness and make often is this terrina di verza or stuffed Savoy cabbage rolls.  They are juicy and flavorful, with a wonderful lemon taste, and a good example of rustic country cooking.  They are usually cooked in earthenware, which keeps in the heat and makes the rolls juicy, but I use a heavy-duty oven casserole and have great success.

<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.  Add the cabbage and cook just until the leaves begin to wilt and are limp enough for rolling.  Remove the cabbage with a slotted spoon and allow to cool until easy to handle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the olive oil in a saute pan and when it is hot add the meats and garlic and cook until the meats are browned.  Drain the meats through a colander to remove the excess fat.  Transfer the meat to a bowl and stir in the herbs, lemon zest, bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese, all of the Pecorino cheese, egg, salt, and black pepper.  Set the mixture aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Separate the cabbage leaves leaving them as whole as possible.  If you need to patch, overlap the leaves.  Divide the meat mixture among 8 of the largest leaves and roll each one up like a little bundle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly brush an earthenware baking dish or other casserole dish with olive oil and place the cabbage rolls in the dish.  Pour the chicken broth around the rolls, cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake the rolls for 30 minutes.  Remove the foil, sprinkle the tops of the rolls with the remaining Parmesan cheese, and continue baking the rolls for an additional 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve the rolls hot with some of the juices poured over them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Variation:  5 minutes before the rolls are done, add bits of sun dried tomatoes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  One of my favorite restaurants in Umbria is Villa Roncalli in the town of Foligno.  This well appointed country restaurant specializes in spit-roasted meats, game, fowlÖand songbirds.  Since my last visit there the Italian government and nature lovers have taken steps to protect the depleting songbird population, and they are no longer featured on the menu.  One of the dishes I recall with fondness and make often is this terrina di verza or stuffed Savoy cabbage rolls.  They are juicy and flavorful, with a wonderful lemon taste, and a good example of rustic country cooking.  They are usually cooked in earthenware, which keeps in the heat and makes the rolls juicy, but I use a heavy-duty oven casserole and have great success.

  1              pound  homemade or store-bought Italian sausage
  2               cups  mixed seedless red and green grapes -- cut in half

Poke the sausages with a fork and put them in a saute pan with 1/2 cup of water.  Cook the sausages uncovered over medium heat until they turn gray.  Drain off the water.  Allow the sausages to brown in their own fat, turning once or twice.  If they are very lean, add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  ripe plum tomatoes
                        = (or three 28-oz cans crushed plum
                        tomatoes with their liquid)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     2/3           cup  diced onion
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2           cups  dry red wine
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  fine sea salt -- or to taste

  6              large  fresh basil sprigs - (to 8)

                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled and minced
                        Leaves from 2 thyme sprigs
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/4         pounds  tuna steak -- cut into 4 pieces
  8                     basil leaves -- torn into pieces

In a glass casserole dish large enough to hold the fish, place the garlic, thyme, oil, sea salt, and pepper; mix well.  Place the fish on top and turn to coat on both sides.  Marinate the fish, covered, for 2 hours, turning the pieces occasionally.

Heat a cast-iron skillet until very hot.  Add the fish and cook over high heat about 2 1/2 minutes on each side.

Sprinkle the basil on top and serve the fish immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  While fish has become prohibitively expensive in Italy, it remains a very popular item in the markets and on most restaurant menus.  Tuna, swordfish, and salmon are particularly good choices for this easy preparation -- and one that you can get ready the night before.  A hot cast-iron skillet cooks the fish best; if you do not have one, cook the fish on a hot grill.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PRESERVED TUNA ===
     1/2         pound  fresh tuna
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     lemon -- sliced
     3/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- more or less
                        === SAUCE ===
  1             recipe  Preserved Tuna -- with
     1/2           cup  olive oil (from the tuna)
  1             medium  white onion -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/3           cup  minced flat-leaf parsley
  1           teaspoon  hot red pepper flakes -- or more to taste
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  spaghetti
  2        tablespoons  grated tuna roe (bottarga)

Place the tuna, 1 bay leaf, and the lemon slices in a nonreactive pot.  Cover with salted water, bring to a simmer, and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the tuna flakes easily with a fork.  Drain the tuna and let it cool.

Cut the tuna into chunks and place in a sterilized 1-pint jar.  Add the remaining bay leaf and salt and pepper.  Cover with the olive oil, making sure that the tuna is totally covered.  Cap the jar and let marinate overnight at room temperature.

The following day, check the level of the oil.  Add more if needed to cover the tuna completely.  Cap the jar and store it in the refrigerator until needed.  (Use within 2 months.)  Bring to room temperature before serving.

To make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium skillet.  Add the onion, garlic, parsley, and red pepper and saute until the garlic starts to soften.  Add the tuna, breaking it up with a fork.  Season with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and keep warm.

Meanwhile, bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot.  Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente.  Drain well.  Place the spaghetti on a warm serving platter.

Pour the sauce over the spaghetti and toss well.  Sprinkle the tuna roe over the top and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I cannot praise this dish enough; for me it is a satisfying reminder of wonderful days spent in Sicily.  I preserve fresh tuna in olive oil and keep it in the refrigerator for up to two months to quickly satisfy my craving for it.  Salted tuna roe, available in seafood stores, makes the flavors even more intense.  Use salted anchovies if tuna roe is not available.

                    Umbrian Ragu Sauce - {Ragu Umbro}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1              large  carrot -- peeled and diced
  2                     celery ribs -- diced
  1             medium  onion -- diced
     3/4         pound  ground pork
     1/4         pound  ground beef
     1/4         pound  cooked ham -- diced
     2/3           cup  dry white wine
  4              large  plum tomatoes -- seeded and diced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  1              small  black truffle -- (optional)

Melt the butter over medium heat in a saute pan, and cook the carrot, celery, and onion until the mixture is soft.  Stir in the pork and beef and brown well.  Stir in the ham.  Cook 1 minute longer.  Raise the heat to high, pour in the wine and allow it to evaporate.  Stir in the tomatoes, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.  Lower the heat and simmer the sauce, covered, for 35 minutes.

Uncover the pan, and shave the black truffle over the top.  Cover the pan and allow the truffle to permeate the ragu for 2 or 3 minutes without turning the heat back on.

Use this sauce over cooked pasta or in the recipe for Parmigiana di Cipolla di Cannara.

Note:  This sauce may be refrigerated for up to 5 days.

This recipe yields about 5 1/2 cups.

Comments:  Ragu sauces denote those with meat that are cooked for a long time, and they will differ from place to place in Italy.  Umbrian ragus are not as common as other types of sauces but here is one that is easy to make, and essential for my Parmigiano di Copolla recipe; it's also good on a short cut of pasta such as rigatoni or ziti.  The ubiquitous ingredient is shaved black truffle, added at the end of the cooking process, but this is optional.  The other unusual ingredient is nutmeg, which gives a subtle hint of sweetness and spiciness to the sauce.

Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  thinly-sliced veal - (8 slices)
                        = (or chicken or pork)
     1/3           cup  flour
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     2/3           cup  Montefalco Bianco
                        = (or other dry white wine)
                        Juice of 1 large lemon
  1         tablespoon  capers -- finely minced
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced parsley
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Grinding of black pepper

Dry the meat slices well with paper towels; put the slices in a plastic bag with the flour and shake the bag to evenly coat the slices.  Shake off the excess flour.  Set the meat aside.

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan and, when it begins to shimmer, brown the meat slices in batches.  Do this quickly and do not over cook them or they will toughen.  As you cook them, transfer them to a heatproof dish and keep them warm in the oven.

Pour the wine and lemon juice into the pan and cook, scraping up the browned bits in the pan.  Stir in the capers and parsley and cook 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper.  Pour the sauce over the veal and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Montefalco Bianco is used to make this quick veal scaloppine dish.  You can also substitute chicken or boneless pork; just make sure you are buying thinly sliced and pounded slices of meat no more than one-quarter inch thick.  Buy good capers in salt, and rinse them well before using.  These little power-packed buds are harvested from bushes that grow on craggy rocks around the Mediterranean and are used to flavor many Italian dishes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  12            slices  veal cutlet
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  Montefalco Rosso (Caprai) wine
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian flat leaf parsley

Dry the cutlets well and set aside.

On a sheet of wax paper combine the flour, salt, and pepper.  Dredge each cutlet in the flour on both sides and set the pieces on a bake sheet.

In a saute pan, melt the butter with the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Cook the cutlets quickly on both sides for no longer than 2 minutes or until they turn grayish looking.  Remove the cutlets to a plate as they are cooked; cook in batches if need be.

Raise the heat to high and stir in the wine; be sure to scrape up any browned bits in the pan.  The sauce should start to thicken slightly.  Return the veal to the pan, and cook quickly for 1 or 2 minutes.  Transfer the veal with the sauce to a serving platter.  Sprinkle on the parsley and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A fast and easy veal cutlet dish characteristic of using the wines of Montefalco, in particular Sangrantino, a DOC wine, a sort of superdoc wine.

                  Veal Marsala - {Vitello Alla Marsala}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  veal cutlets, abt 1/8" thick
                        = (cut from the saddle)
     1/2           cup  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  butter - (to 8)
     2/3           cup  Marsala wine -- sweet or dry
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
                        Lemon wedges
                        Parsley sprigs

If the veal slices are more than 1/8-inch thick, pound them thin with a meat hammer, but be careful not to rip them.  Cut any large pieces in half.

Mix the flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper together and spread it on a plate.  Dredge each cutlet in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess.

In a large frying pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the butter.  Add 4 or 5 of the veal cutlets, making sure not to crowd them, and cook for about 1 minute on each side, or until they are no longer pink.  Remove them to a warm platter.  Repeat with the remaining veal, adding more butter to the pan as needed.

Add the Marsala wine and lemon juice to the juices in the pan and simmer over medium heat, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to release all the browned bits.  Correct the seasoning if necessary, return the veal to the pan, and heat until hot.  Transfer the meat to a serving platter, pour the pan juices over, and garnish with lemon wedges and parsley sprigs.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  When I am planning to make veal Marsala, I phone my butcher and tell him exactly what I want.  He always tries to accommodate me, especially when I promise him a sampling of the dish.  When making this dish, remember not to overcook the veal.  It will only take a minute to two to cook on both sides.  I prefer sweet Marsala for the sauce, but dry can be used.

Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1                cup  dried bread crumbs
  1              pound  veal cutlets
                        = (cut from the top round)
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/4         pound  prosciutto
     1/4         pound  Italian Fontina cheese -- thinly sliced
  1              small  radicchio head -- separated into
                        leaves

Mix the flour and salt together on a plate.  In a shallow bowl, lightly beat the eggs and lemon juice together with a fork.  Spread the bread crumbs on a plate.

Pound the veal slices with a meat pounder so that they are 1/4 inch thick.  Be careful not to tear the meat.  Dry the slices with paper towels.

Dredge the slices in the flour, shaking off the excess.  Coat each slice in the egg mixture, then in the bread crumbs.  Place the slices in a single layer on a cookie sheet.  (The veal can be prepared to this point up to 2 hours ahead.  Cover with a sheet of wax paper and refrigerate.)

Preheat the broiler.  In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Brown the veal, in batches if necessary, on both sides and place on a lightly greased broiler pan.

Layer the prosciutto slices over the veal and top with the cheese.  Broil the scaloppine just until the cheese melts and begins to turn a light golden brown.  Remove to a serving plate lined with the radicchio, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Scaloppine Val d'Aostana is a dish from Valle d'Aosta, one of the provinces of the Piedmont region.  The success of this dish depends upon the cut of the veal.  Ask your butcher for scaloppine from young, milk-fed veal, cut against the grain.

              Veal Shanks In Red Wine - {Ossobuchi In Vino}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil - (to 4)
  2             medium  onions -- peeled and sliced
  2                     shallots -- peeled and sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled and sliced
  4                     veal shanks, 1 1/2" to 2" thick -- (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     2/3           cup  or more dry red wine
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley

In a heavy pot, heat the olive oil, add the onions and shallots, and saute slowly until they begin to soften.  Add the garlic and continue to saute until the garlic softens.

Add the veal shanks and brown slowly on both sides.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then slowly add the wine, lemon juice, and parsley.  Stir to blend, cover the pot, lower the heat, and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until fork-tender.  Add more wine as needed to keep the meat from drying out.  Serve the veal shanks immediately, with some pan juices.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Ossobuco literally means "a bone with a hole in it", but it has become synonymous with the veal shank and marrow.  The Milanese way to prepare it is to braise it slowly and then serve it with gremolada, a mixture of fresh lemon zest, garlic, and parsley.  I deviate from the classic here, incorporating the sauce ingredients in a different way, and then slow-simmer the veal in red wine with onions and shallots.  Make sure to use a heavy Dutch oven large enough to hold the ossobuchi in one layer.  Serve this with oven-roasted potatoes and fresh asparagus.

Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion - (4 oz) -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/4         pound  pancetta or bacon -- diced
  2             pounds  boneless veal chuck roast -- tied, and
                        dried with paper towels
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  5             sprigs  fresh tarragon
  5             sprigs  fresh summer or winter savory
  2             sprigs  fresh flat-leaf parsley
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  dry red wine

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a Dutch oven or heavy-duty pot.  Stir in the onions and cook them over medium-low heat until they are very soft.  Stir in the wine vinegar, raise the heat to high and allow the vinegar to evaporate.  Remove the onions to a dish and set aside.

Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the Dutch oven.  Stir in the pancetta and cook it until it begins to brown.  Rub the veal roast all over with the salt and pepper, add it to the Dutch oven, and brown it on all sides.

Tie the tarragon, savory, parsley, rosemary, and bay leaf together in a bundle with a piece of kitchen string and place it on top of the roast.  Scatter the onions around the roast.  Pour in the wine and let it come to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer and cook the roast, covered, for about 2 hours, or until it is fork-tender.

Remove the roast to a cutting board and let it cool for 20 minutes.  With a scissors cut and remove the strings.  Discard the strings and the bundle of herbs.  Use a sharp knife to cut the meat into slices.  Return the slices to the Dutch oven.  Reheat the meat slowly until hot.  Serve the meat with some of the juices poured over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe showcases the preparation of a tough cut of veal, a boneless chuck roast, which in Italy would come from a calf more than three months old and grazing on pastureland.  The chuck cut is from the shoulder.  It is very tasty when cooked with pancetta (Italian bacon) and wine.  The best way to cook it is very slowly over low heat in a Dutch oven.  Be sure that the pot is heavy duty, to retain the heat, and only large enough to hold the meat.  I use a 10- by 3 1/2-inch cast-iron Dutch oven.  The veal roast is even better made several days ahead.  Pair it with potatoes, polenta, or rice.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a Dutch oven or heavy-duty pot.  Stir in the onions and cook them over medium-low heat until they are very soft.  Stir in the wine vinegar, raise the heat to high and allow the vinegar to evaporate.  Remove the onions to a dish and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the Dutch oven.  Stir in the pancetta and cook it until it begins to brown.  Rub the veal roast all over with the salt and pepper, add it to the Dutch oven, and brown it on all sides.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tie the tarragon, savory, parsley, rosemary, and bay leaf together in a bundle with a piece of kitchen string and place it on top of the roast.  Scatter the onions around the roast.  Pour in the wine and let it come to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer and cook the roast, covered, for about 2 hours, or until it is fork-tender.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the roast to a cutting board and let it cool for 20 minutes.  With a scissors cut and remove the strings.  Discard the strings and the bundle of herbs.  Use a sharp knife to cut the meat into slices.  Return the slices to the Dutch oven.  Reheat the meat slowly until hot.  Serve the meat with some of the juices poured over the top.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe showcases the preparation of a tough cut of veal, a boneless chuck roast, which in Italy would come from a calf more than three months old and grazing on pastureland.  The chuck cut is from the shoulder.  It is very tasty when cooked with pancetta (Italian bacon) and wine.  The best way to cook it is very slowly over low heat in a Dutch oven.  Be sure that the pot is heavy duty, to retain the heat, and only large enough to hold the meat.  I use a 10- by 3 1/2-inch cast-iron Dutch oven.  The veal roast is even better made several days ahead.  Pair it with potatoes, polenta, or rice.

                      Veal With Black Truffles - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     veal cutlets abt 1/4" thick - (8 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     ripe strawberries -- stemmed
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3             ounces  black truffle paste
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  thin shavings of Pecorino cheese
  2                     fresh or frozen cooked artichoke hearts -- cut in thin slices

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Rub salt and pepper all over the veal slices and set aside.

Mash the strawberries in a small bowl with a fork and set them aside.

Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat in a small sauce pan.  Stir in the strawberries and cook for 1 minute.  Stir in the truffle paste and blend it in well.  Set aside.

Melt the remaining butter over medium-high heat in a 10- to 12-inch saute pan.  Brown the cutlets in batches, cooking them about 1 minute on each side.  Remove them as you cook them to a baking dish.  Keep warm.

Stir the wine and flour into the drippings in the saute pan and cook it until it is smooth, about 1 minute.  Stir in the strawberry and truffle mixture and cook until the sauce is slightly thickened.  Spoon the sauce over the veal slices.  Cover the sauce with the cheese shavings.

Bake the veal for 5 minutes or just until the cheese is melted.  Sprinkle the artichoke slices over the veal and serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Thin slices of veal cutlet, cooked in a flash in the pan, then baked, topped with a sauce of fresh strawberries, black truffle paste, slivers of cheese, and artichoke slices sounds so exotic, and it is!  This unusual and dynamite-tasting preparation is the work of chef-teacher Mario Ragni, who showed me how it was done in his Ristorante M.R. in Perugia.  I was a little leery of how sugary strawberries would taste against the woodsy truffle, but all my skepticism was laid to rest with one heavenly taste, and the twinkle in his eye.

              Venetian Marinated Fish - {Saor Alla Venezia}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Italian
                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  sole or flounder fillets
                        Flour -- for dredging
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cups  thinly-sliced white onions
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  pine nuts
     1/3           cup  golden raisins
  3        tablespoons  chopped candied citron

Dredge the fish pieces in the flour, shake off the excess, and place on a plate.

In a skillet, heat the oil, then fry the fish on both sides until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Remove the fish to a serving dish.

In the same oil (add more if necessary), slowly brown the onions about 5 to 7 minutes, until almost caramelized or deep brown in color.  Add the vinegar, pine nuts, raisins, and citron.  Cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes, then pour the mixture over the fish.  Cover the fish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 day before serving.  To serve, bring to dish to room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  During a recent stay in Venice I had an appointment to interview Venetian cooking teacher Fulvia Sesani.  One regal red rose was waiting for me in my hotel room.  With a note that said, "Benvenuta a Venezia", or "Welcome to Venice".

Trying to find the Palazzo Morosini, where Fulvia lived and conducted cooking classes, was like wandering through a maze.  Finally, arriving at the grand palace of her ancestors, I met Fulvia and was ushered into a splendid living room, where she and I talked about traditional Venetian cooking.  One classic recipe called Saor is a cooked then marinated fish dish.  Fresh sardines are used in Venice, but flounder or sole works well, too.  This is Fulvia's recipe for saor, which must be prepared a day in advance of serving.  I particularly enjoy it on a hot summer day.

                Main Dish                       Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter -- plus
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1              large  Russet potato -- peeled, and
                        cut into paper-thin slices
  1         tablespoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice -- plus
  1           teaspoon  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  fine black pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced Italian parsley
  1                     small whole potato -- scrubbed
  1 1/4         pounds  whole gutted farm-raised trout
                        = (or salmon or sea bass)

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Brush a 14- by 8- by 2 1/4-inch-deep au gratin dish or similar Pyrex baking dish with 1 teaspoon of the melted butter.  Use half of the potato slices to make an overlapping layer in the dish.

Combine the remaining butter with 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, the salt, pepper, and parsley.  Pour 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter mixture over the potatoes.  Make another layer with the remaining potato slices and pour another 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter mixture over them.

Open the fish cavity and insert the whole smaller potato.  If necessary, cut a small piece off the bottom of the potato so it does not roll before positioning it in the cavity of the fish.  Place the fish on top of the potatoes in the baking dish and brush the fish with the remaining butter.

Bake the fish for 15 to 18 minutes.  Do not overcook it or it will become dry.  Use a fork to gently poke the sides of the fish and if it flakes easily remove it at once.

Remove the whole potato from the fish cavity and discard it.  Present the dish at the table for all to admire, then remove the fish to a cutting surface and cut the head off with a fish knife or a sharp knife and discard it.  Gently pull the fish skin away from the body, starting at the tail.  It should peel off easily.  Discard the skin.  Fillet the fish, removing the bones, and serve it with some of the potatoes.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  Take the #1 vaporetto (water bus) to Piazza San Marco and head straight for the rooftop restaurant at the Danieli, one of Venice's most venerable hotels.  Marvel at one of the most spectacular sights in the whole world, the expanse of the Canale Grande as you take your seat.  Order the Branzino al forno con patate, which is a delicate-tasting sea bass baked with paper-thin potatoes.  At the Danieli, the fish is presented whole, sitting proudly upright on the potatoes.  I asked the waiter how the fish managed to stay upright and not collapse in the oven, and he quickly pulled a whole potato from the slit underside of the fish.  What a great idea, and it works!  I tried it with farm-raised trout and the results were perfect.  This is an effortless and great presentation dish for company since the potatoes can be cut and held in cold water until ready.  Any whole fish suitable for baking will do.  Have the fish gutted by the fishmonger but leave the head on.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     celery stalks with tops -- cut into quarters
  5              small  onions -- peeled, quartered
  6             medium  carrots -- quartered
  3              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
  1                cup  parsley leaves
     1/2           cup  sage leaves
     1/3           cup  rosemary needles
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3             pounds  boar meat -- cut into 1" pieces
                        = (or beef stew meat)
  1                cup  flour
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

To make quick work of the battuto put the celery, onions, carrots, and garlic in a food processor and pulse until the ingredients look coarse.  Add the parsley, sage, and rosemary needles and continue to process until there is a fine mixture.  Or use a chef's knife and mince all the ingredients.

In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil and when it begins to shimmer, lower the heat to medium and stir in the battuto ingredients.  Cook the mixture stirring occasionally until the vegetables are wilted.

Dry the meat pieces with paper towels.

In a large bag, combine the flour, salt, and pepper.  Add the meat pieces, close the bag at the top and shake it vigorously to coat the meat in the flour mixture.  Shake off the excess flour and place the meat on a dish.

Remove the wilted vegetables to a dish and set aside.  If the pan seems dry, pour in 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Raise the heat to medium-high and brown the meat, in batches if necessary, until it is nicely browned.  Raise the heat to high and pour in the wine.  Allow it to come to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and stir in the reserved vegetables.

Add additional wine to just cover the meat if necessary.  Cover the pot and allow the stew to cook for about 2 hours or until the meat is fork tender.

Correct the seasoning by adding additional salt and pepper if necessary.

Serve the stew hot.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Wild boar is synonymous with Tuscany.  Many places selling the meat have a boar's head displayed somewhere in the shop or out by the doorway.  The best way to cook it is in a stew with aromatic vegetables and a good red wine.  This is the dish I made for the farmhands at Spannocchia with some help from Graziella and Gaetana, who prepared the battuto, the aromatic vegetables that would be reduced to a fine mince and used to flavor the stew.  The recipe is enough for a crowd or to freeze some for later use.  Use stew beef as a substitute.
