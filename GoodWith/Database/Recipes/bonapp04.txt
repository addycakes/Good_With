            Almond-Raspberry Clafoutis With Vanilla Ice Cream

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  frozen raspberries in syrup - (10 oz) -- thawed
  1                cup  whole almonds - (4 1/2 oz) -- toasted
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  7              large  egg whites
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks)
  2                     half-pint baskets fresh raspberries
                        Vanilla ice cream -- (optional)

Puree frozen raspberries with their syrup in processor until smooth.  (Raspberry sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Finely grind almonds in processor.  Transfer almonds to large bowl.  Add sugar, egg whites, flour, orange juice and orange peel and whisk to blend well.

Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat; cook until butter browns, stirring frequently, about 4 minutes.  Whisk hot browned butter into almond batter until well blended.

Divide batter equally among six 1 1/4-cup custard cups (batter will fill cups only halfway).  Drop 8 raspberries into batter in each cup.  Bake clafoutis until golden brown and set in center, about 40 minutes.  Cool 15 minutes.

Serve warm with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream, if desired.  Garnish clafoutis with any remaining fresh raspberries and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "Last summer we spent a week in Paso Robles, California, and had an excellent dinner at Bistro Laurent," say Rusty and Stacey Willi of Santa Rosa, California.  "To our delight, dessert -- a warm raspberry clafouti topped with vanilla ice cream -- turned out to be one of our favorite vacation memories."

This dessert has a more cake-like texture than a traditional clafouti.  The version here is even better topped with ice cream.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry - (half 17 1/4-oz -- thawed
  4                     Golden Delicious apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and chopped
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3             medium  fennel bulbs - (abt 13 oz ea) -- halved lengthwise,
                        and stalks separated
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  2          teaspoons  aniseed
                        Vanilla ice cream -- for serving

Roll out puff pastry sheet on lightly floured surface to 12-inch square.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Trim overhang to 1 inch.  Fold in overhang to form double-thick high-standing sides.  Pierce pastry all over with fork.  Freeze pastry shell 15 minutes.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Line shell with foil and beans or pie weights.  Bake until sides are set, about 20 minutes.  Remove foil and beans.  Bake until bottom is golden, about 8 minutes longer.  Cool pastry shell.

Place apples, 1/4 cup water and 2 tablespoons sugar in heavy medium saucepan.  Simmer over medium heat until mixture is reduced to 1 1/4 cups, stirring and breaking up apples with back of spoon, about 5 minutes.  Set aside.

Cook fennel in large saucepan of boiling, lightly salted water until tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat; drain fennel well.

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Stir in 3/4 cup sugar.  Cook until sugar dissolves and mixture is dark amber, stirring frequently, about 14 minutes.  Stir in drained fennel (caramel mixture will harden).  Cover; cook until caramel melts, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Uncover and simmer until caramel thickens, about 5 minutes longer (fennel will be very tender).  (Pastry shell, apple compote and caramelized fennel can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately.  Refrigerate apple and fennel mixtures; store pastry shell airtight at room temperature.)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Spread apple compote evenly over bottom of pastry shell.  Arrange caramelized fennel evenly over compote.  Sprinkle tart with aniseed.  Bake until warmed through, about 15 minutes.  Serve with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  cornmeal
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3              large  egg yolks
                        === APRICOT FILLING ===
  5               cups  water
  12            ounces  dried apricot halves - (abt 2 2/3 cups)
     1/3           cup  apricot preserves
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
  3        tablespoons  sugar
                        === OPTIONAL FOR SERVING ===
                        Apricot Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Whipped cream

For Crust:  Whisk flour, cornmeal and salt in small bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in large bowl to blend.  Beat in egg yolks.  Add dry ingredients and beat just until blended.  Divide dough in half; flatten into disks.  Wrap each dough disk in plastic and refrigerate 20 minutes.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Let dough soften slightly at room temperature before using.)

Meanwhile, prepare Apricot Filling:  Bring 5 cups water to simmer in heavy medium pot over medium heat.  Add apricots and poach until tender, about 25 minutes.  Drain well.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly oil 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom.  Unwrap 1 dough disk; press onto bottom and up sides of tart pan.  Spread apricot preserves over bottom of crust.  Place poached apricots over preserves, covering crust completely and overlapping slightly.  Using pastry brush, brush beaten egg over edges of crust.

Roll out second dough disk between 2 sheets of parchment paper to 12-inch round.  Remove top piece of parchment; using 1-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut hole in center of top crust.  Turn crust over onto filling.  Remove second piece of parchment paper.  Press around crust edges to seal.  Cut off excess dough to make top crust flush with tart pan sides.  Brush crust with beaten egg and sprinkle with 3 tablespoons sugar.

Bake tart until cornmeal crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes.  Transfer apricot tart to rack.  Cool 30 minutes.  Remove tart from pan and cool completely.  (Apricot tart can be prepared up to 1 day ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

Serve tart with Apricot Sauce and whipped cream, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  "On a recent trip to the Napa Valley, my husband and I had lunch with friends in the Cask Room at Merryvale Vineyards in St. Helena," writes Karen G. Shughart of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.  "The meal was prepared by Knickerbockerís Catering.  Desserts must be their specialty, because the apricot tart with cornmeal crust was fabulous."

Serve this tart with or without the sweet Apricot Sauce.  Cornmeal adds texture and flavor to the crust.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              large  egg yolks
     1/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  8          teaspoons  sugar
  3               cups  whipping cream
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  4             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped very fine

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Whisk egg yolks and 1/3 cup sugar in large bowl to blend.

Pour cream into heavy medium saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean.  Bring cream to simmer.  Remove from heat.  Gradually whisk hot cream mixture into yolks.  Strain custard into another large bowl.  Transfer scant 2 cups custard to medium bowl.  Immediately add chocolate to remaining custard in large bowl.  Whisk mixture until chocolate melts and custard is smooth.

Divide chocolate custard equally among eight 2/3-cup ramekins.  Place ramekins in large roasting pan.  Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.  Bake until custard is barely set in center, about 25 minutes.  Transfer ramekins to baking sheet and refrigerate until tops of custards feel firm, about 30 minutes.  Maintain oven temperature.

Spoon vanilla custard evenly over chocolate custard, dividing equally among ramekins.  Place ramekins in large roasting pan.  Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.  Bake until vanilla custard is barely set in center, about 35 minutes.

Preheat broiler.  Arrange 4 ramekins on baking sheet.  Sprinkle 1 teaspoon sugar over each.  Broil until sugar browns, about 1 minute.  Repeat with remaining 4 custards and 4 teaspoons sugar.  Refrigerate custards at least 1 hour before serving.  (Can be prepared up to 6 hours ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  milk
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  dark corn syrup
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/4 stick) -- melted
  2        tablespoons  bourbon
  1 1/2    tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  chopped walnuts - (abt 3 oz)
     3/4           cup  walnut halves - (abt 3 oz)

For Crust:  Blend flour, sugar and salt in processor.  Add butter and process using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Whisk egg and milk in small bowl to blend, then add to processor.  Blend until moist clumps form.  Gather dough into ball and flatten into disk.  Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour.  (Dough can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.  Keep refrigerated.  Let dough soften slightly before rolling out.)

For Filling:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Whisk syrup, sugar, eggs, butter, bourbon, flour, vanilla and salt in large bowl to blend.  Mix in all walnuts.

Roll out dough on floured surface to 14-inch round.  Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish.  Fold edge under; crimp decoratively.

Pour filling into prepared crust.  Bake until crust is golden and filling is set in center when pie is shaken slightly, about 55 minutes.  Cool pie completely in pan on rack.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  "I had lunch at a historic spot in Berryville, Virginia, called the Battletown Inn," says Judy Owens of Round Hill Virginia.  "For dessert, I ordered bourbon walnut pie.  If chef Robin Smith would share her recipe, I know that baking the pie during the holidays would become a family tradition."

The sweetness of the filling is offset nicely by the bourbon.  Serve the dessert with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  butter
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2           cups  bulgur
  4               cups  chicken stock - (about)
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1              pound  asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 3/4" pieces
  1 1/2           cups  frozen peas -- unthawed
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - -- (abt 1 1/2 oz)
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon
                        Additional freshly-grated Parmesan cheese -- (optional)

Melt 4 tablespoons butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and garlic; sautÈ until light golden, about 5 minutes.  Mix in bulgur.  Add 1/2 cup stock and cook until absorbed, stirring often, about 5 minutes.  Add 1/2 cup stock 2 more times, simmering after each addition and stirring often until liquid is absorbed.

Mix in asparagus.  Continue adding stock 1/2 cup at a time until bulgur is just tender and mixture is creamy, simmering after each addition and stirring often until stock is absorbed, about 20 minutes.  Add peas and cook 3 minutes longer.  Stir in 3/4 cup Parmesan, cream, tarragon and remaining 1 tablespoon butter.  Serve, passing additional grated Parmesan, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings as a first-course.

Comments:  At the restaurant, this is made with spelt, a chewy grain that requires much longer cooking than does the more readily available bulgur called for here.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  whole milk
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/4      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  golden brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- chilled, diced
                        Vanilla ice cream

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine 1/2 cup milk, melted butter and vanilla in small bowl.  Whisk flour, baking powder and salt in medium bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat eggs and 1/4 cup sugar in large bowl until thick and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Alternately beat flour mixture into egg mixture in 3 additions and milk mixture in 2 additions, beating well after each addition.  Set batter aside.

Combine 3/4 cup milk, brown sugar and diced butter in 8-inch-diameter ceramic soufflÈ dish.  Spoon cake batter over brown sugar mixture in soufflÈ dish.  Bake until tester inserted into center of cake comes out clean and syrup is bubbling at edges, about 40 minutes.  Serve hot with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "My husband and I recently went to Chez Mimi in nearby Santa Monica," writes Randi Fine of Sherman Oaks, California.  "We shared a luscious dessert called caramel chomeur, a cake baked atop caramel sauce and served with vanilla ice cream.  Iíve searched my cookbooks, but I canít find a recipe close to it."

Chef Mimi Hebert tells us that this dessert from the Great Depression era was called chomeur (from the French word for "unemployed") because it was inexpensive to make.

  1 1/2      teaspoons  oriental sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Comments:  "My daughter and son-in-law spend their summers on Stuart Island, one of the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington," says Ann Ayres of Santa Barbara, California.  "On my way back from a visit, I planned to stop in Victoria, British Columbia.  My daughter suggested that I try Paprika Bistro.  The beet soup I ordered there was delicious."

  6 1/2         ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              pinch  salt

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  light yellow miso
  5        tablespoons  rice vinegar
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  6                     cod fillets - (6 oz ea) -- each cut 2 pieces
                        Wasabi Mashed Potatoes -- (see recipe)

Preheat broiler.  Blend miso, vinegar, sugar, soy sauce and cayenne pepper in processor.  With machine running, gradually pour in oil; blend until mixture is smooth.  Place cod fillets in large bowl.  Pour half of miso mixture over fish; toss to coat.  Transfer to rimmed baking sheet.

Broil cod 8 inches from heat until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes.  Set oven at 450 degrees; bake cod until opaque in center, about 5 minutes.  Divide cod among 6 plates.  Spoon Wasabi Mashed Potatoes alongside.  Drizzle remaining half of miso mixture over cod and potatoes, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  At the restaurant, they use black cod, also known as sablefish.  We call for more readily available white cod fillets.

Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9        tablespoons  butter
  3              large  onions -- chopped (abt 6 cups)
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  dry red wine
  3                     Cornish game hens -- quartered, and
                        backbones removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  Sherry wine vinegar
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        Chopped fresh parsley

Melt 3 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and 3 tablespoons sugar.  Cook until onions are golden, stirring often, about 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Add wine and cook until onions are very tender and mixture is reduced to thick jamlike consistency, stirring frequently, about 40 minutes.  Set compote aside.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add hen quarters and brown well on all sides, about 8 minutes.  Place hen quarters on rimmed baking sheet (do not clean skillet).  Sprinkle hens with salt and pepper.  Bake hen quarters until cooked through, about 20 minutes.

Transfer hen quarters to bowl; cover to keep warm.  Add drippings from baking sheet, vinegar and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar to skillet used to brown hens.  Bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits.  Add stock and bring to boil.  Mix remaining 4 tablespoons butter and flour in small bowl, forming paste.  Whisk paste into stock mixture.  Boil until thickened to sauce consistency, about 3 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Rewarm onion compote; spoon onto center of each plate.  Arrange 2 hen quarters around compote.  Spoon sauce over.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Cornish game hens are a delicious and more readily available substitute for the guinea hens that the chef at Restaurant HiÈly-Lucullus uses to prepare this.  (Have the butcher quarter the hens and remove their backbones.)  When in season, peaches are caramelized and served with this dish at the restaurant.

                  Creamy Corn Soup With Red Bell Pepper

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1              large  red bell pepper -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (14 1/2 oz)
  2               cups  water -- or more if needed
  2        tablespoons  chopped canned chipotle chilies -- see * Note
  2               cans  cream-style corn - (14 3/4 oz ea)
  1            package  frozen corn - (16 oz)
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
                        Chopped fresh cilantro -- (optional)

* Note:  Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.

Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add bell pepper, onion and garlic; sautÈ until onion is tender, about 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes with juices to pot; cook 2 minutes.

Combine 2 cups water and chipotle chilies in blender and puree.  Mix puree and cream-style corn into vegetables in pot.  Bring soup to boil.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add frozen corn, cream and oregano; simmer 5 minutes.  Garnish with cilantro, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 (main-course) or 6 (first-course) servings.

Comments:  "While visiting a friend in Albuquerque, I fell in love with a local bakery and cafe called Double Rainbow II," writes Beth White of Phoenix, Arizona.  "The food is great -- especially the caldo de maÏz (corn soup) that I had for lunch."

This spicy version gets its hot, smoky taste from chipotle chilies.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4         pounds  parsnips -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1              small  onion -- chopped (abt 1 cup)
  8               cups  vegetable stock or canned vegetable broth
     1/8      teaspoon  ground allspice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     bacon strips -- cooked, crumbled
                        Sour cream -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spread out parsnips in single layer on rimmed baking sheet.  Roast parsnips until brown, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.  Add parsnips and sautÈ 5 minutes.  Add stock and boil until parsnips are tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.

Working in batches, puree soup in blender.  Return to saucepan.  Stir in allspice.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Cool, then cover and chill.)

Bring soup to simmer.  Ladle into bowls.  Top with bacon and dollop of sour cream, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 (first-course) servings.

Comments:  "I enjoyed a delightful dinner at Restaurant Claes Claesz, an intimate place located in the Jordaan district of Amsterdam," writes Gretchen Method of Northville, Michigan.  "Their cream of parsnip soup was simply wonderful.  Could you get the recipe?"

There is no cream in this soup-pureeing the ingredients creates the silky texture.

  1 1/2    tablespoons  Grand Marnier or other orange liqueur

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Lightly butter six 3/4-cup soufflÈ dishes or custard cups.

Beat egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in medium bowl to blend.  Bring cream, milk and orange peel to simmer in medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Gradually whisk hot cream mixture into yolk mixture.  Stir in Grand Marnier.

Divide custard among prepared dishes.  Set dishes in large baking pan.  Add enough hot water to pan to come halfway up sides of dishes.  Bake custards until just set in center, about 40 minutes.  Remove from water.  Cool, then cover and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat broiler.  Arrange soufflÈ dishes on baking sheet.  Sprinkle 1 teaspoon sugar over each.  Broil until sugar browns, rotating baking sheet for even browning and watching closely to avoid burning, about 2 minutes.  Refrigerate 1 hour.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Begin preparing the custards a day ahead so that they can chill overnight.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  eggplant - (abt 18 oz)
     1/4           cup  olive oil (preferably extra-virgin) -- plus
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1 1/2         pounds  tomatoes - (abt 6)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper - (scant)
  4                     fresh basil sprigs

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place eggplant on baking sheet.  Pierce eggplant several times with fork.  Bake until very soft and skin wrinkles and cracks, about 45 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Cut baked eggplant in half lengthwise.  Peel off skin.  Place eggplant in sieve and let drain 45 minutes.  Finely chop eggplant.

Whisk 1/4 cup olive oil, lemon juice and garlic in medium bowl to blend.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Add eggplant; toss to coat.  (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Bring medium pot of water to boil.  Add tomatoes to boiling water and blanch 30 seconds.  Using slotted spoon, transfer tomatoes to bowl of cold water and cool.

Using small sharp knife, pull skin off tomatoes.  Core tomatoes and cut in half crosswise; squeeze out seeds.  Transfer tomatoes to processor and blend until smooth.  Transfer puree to bowl.  Mix in remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, salt and white pepper.  Let coulis stand until any air bubbles have popped, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.

Spoon 1/2 cup tomato coulis into center of 4 shallow bowls.  Using 2 large soup spoons, form eggplant mixture into oval and set atop coulis.  Repeat, placing 3 ovals in each bowl.  Garnish each with 1 fresh basil sprig.

This recipe yields 4 first-course servings.

Comments:  One of the most memorable meals of my vacation in Provence was at the one-star Auberge la FeniËre," says Jacqueline Ross of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  "Set in the LubÈron hills outside the town of Lourmarin, it's a remarkable place owned by one of France's celebrated female chefs, Reine Sammut.  I'd love to re-create my first course there, a chilled tomato puree with roasted eggplant."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fettuccine
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2 1/2       packages  frozen artichoke hearts - (8 oz ea) -- thawed, quartered
  1 1/2           cups  crumbled Gorgonzola cheese - (abt 6 oz)
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1                cup  half-and-half
  1           teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3              large  eggs -- beaten to blend
  8             slices  cooked bacon -- cut into 1" pieces
  1                cup  grated Parmesan cheese - (abt 3 oz)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley

Cook pasta in heavy large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite.  Drain well, reserving 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid.

Meanwhile, heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add garlic and sautÈ 2 minutes.  Add artichoke hearts; sautÈ 5 minutes.  Add 1/2 cup Gorgonzola cheese, cream, half-and-half, crushed red pepper, black pepper and salt and simmer until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.

Add hot pasta to sauce and toss to coat.  Remove from heat.  Add eggs to pasta and toss well.  Add bacon, 1/2 cup Gorgonzola, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and parsley and toss to incorporate.  Add reserved pasta cooking liquid to thin sauce, if desired.  Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup Gorgonzola and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese over pasta and serve.

This recipe yields 6 (first-course) or 4 (main-course) servings.

Comments:  "I had a delightful dinner at Andiamo! Ristorante while on vacation in San Diego," writes Laverne Smith of Seattle, Washington.  "Could you get their recipe for fettuccine carbonara?  It was the best pasta Iíve ever had."

Prepare the sauce while the pasta is cooking to ensure that the fettuccine will be hot when the sauce is finished; the heat of the pasta cooks the raw eggs that are tossed with it.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  fresh basil leaves - (packed -- abt 6 oz)
     3/4           cup  olive oil (preferably extra-virgin)
     1/3           cup  pine nuts
  3        tablespoons  walnuts
  2                     garlic cloves
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese - -- (abt 3 oz)
  8             ounces  green beans -- trimmed, halved
  8             ounces  white potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  12            ounces  fettuccine
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Blend basil, 1/4 cup oil, pine nuts, walnuts and garlic cloves in processor until finely chopped.  Add grated Parmesan cheese.  With machine running, gradually blend in remaining 1/2 cup oil.  Set pesto aside.

Cook green beans in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.  Using 4- to 5-inch-diameter strainer, transfer beans to large bowl.

Return cooking water to boil.  Add white potatoes and boil until tender, about 7 minutes.  Remove potatoes with same strainer and transfer to bowl with beans.

Return cooking water to boil.  Add fettuccine to same pot.  Boil until pasta is just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.  Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup cooking water.

Return green beans, white potatoes and cooked pasta to pot.  Add pesto and toss to coat.  Gradually add enough reserved cooking water to coat pasta with moist sauce.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  While staying at the Hotel Villa Flori, which overlooks Italy's Lake Como, I had an outstanding pasta with a chunky pesto sauce," says Patty Owens of Walnut Creek, California.  "Is there any chance the chef would share the recipe?"

This pesto sauce includes walnuts, a variation on the classic recipe.  To give the dish a creamy quality, add some of the pasta cooking water to the sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  sugar
  2 1/2           cups  water
     3/4           cup  sliced almonds - (abt 3 oz)
  6              large  egg whites
                        Vanilla Custard Sauce -- (see recipe)

Stir 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup water in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves.  Increase heat to high and boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 8 minutes.

Remove from heat and mix in 2 cups water (mixture will bubble vigorously).  Stir over high heat until any hard caramel bits dissolve.  Boil until syrup is reduced to 1 cup, about 15 minutes.  Set aside.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter rimmed baking sheet.  Toss almonds with 2 tablespoons caramel syrup in bowl to coat.  Spread almond mixture on prepared sheet.  Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Cool.  Maintain oven temperature.  (Caramel syrup and almond mixture can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and store at room temperature.)

Spray 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan with nonstick vegetable oil spray.  Coat pan lightly with sugar.  Using electric mixer, beat egg whites on high speed in large bowl to soft peaks.  Gradually beat in 1 cup sugar.  Beat until stiff and glossy.  Transfer meringue to prepared pan.

Bake until top is puffed and golden brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.  Turn meringue out onto lightly oiled baking sheet.  Let stand 15 minutes.  Using serrated knife, cut meringue into 1-inch-thick slices.

Spoon Vanilla Custard Sauce onto plates.  Top with meringue slice, then drizzle with caramel sauce.  Sprinkle with caramelized almonds and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  "Mimosa, a delightful French bistro in Los Angeles, has a catchy motto: 'No Truffles, No Caviar, No Bizarre Concoctions,'" says Bob Woods of Garden Grove, California.  "The food is spectacular, and the setting is lovely.  After dinner one evening, I had a slice of meringue with custard sauce, caramel sauce and candied almonds, a dessert called Œle Flottante."

Mimosa's version of this classic French dessert is impressive in presentation and taste.  Note that you can prepare the caramel sauce, the custard and the almonds a day ahead.  Be sure to reserve the egg yolks for use in the custard sauce.

Comments:  &quot;Mimosa, a delightful French bistro in Los Angeles, has a catchy motto: &apos;No Truffles, No Caviar, No Bizarre Concoctions,&apos;&quot; says Bob Woods of Garden Grove, California.  &quot;The food is spectacular, and the setting is lovely.  After dinner one evening, I had a slice of meringue with custard sauce, caramel sauce and candied almonds, a dessert called Œle Flottante.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mimosa&apos;s version of this classic French dessert is impressive in presentation and taste.  Note that you can prepare the caramel sauce, the custard and the almonds a day ahead.  Be sure to reserve the egg yolks for use in the custard sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Brie wedges - (2 oz ea)
     1/3           cup  walnuts
     1/3           cup  almonds
     1/3           cup  pecans
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
                        Purchased jalapeÒo jelly
                        French-bread baguette -- cut 1/2"-thk slices

Freeze Brie for 30 minutes.  Finely chop all nuts and sesame seeds in food processor.  Transfer to medium bowl.  In another medium bowl, whisk eggs and cream to blend.

Remove cheese from freezer.  Dip each wedge into egg mixture and then into nut mixture, turning to coat and pressing gently to adhere.  Transfer to plate; cover with plastic and refrigerate until very cold, at least 45 minutes.  (Can be made 6 hours ahead.  Keep refrigerated.)

Pour enough peanut oil into heavy large skillet to reach depth of 1 1/2 inches.  Heat over medium-high heat to 350 degrees.  Working in 2 batches, fry Brie until deep golden brown, turning occasionally with metal spatula, about 3 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain.

Serve with purchased jalapeÒo jelly and baguette slices.

This recipe yields 8 appetizer servings.

Comments:  "One of the most unusual restaurants in our area is Kemo Sabe," says Laura Bates of San Diego, California.  "Co-chef and co-owner Deborah Scott combines influences from around the world to create interesting dishes -- including the restaurantís signature appetizer of fried Brie with jalapeÒo jelly.  Iíd love to serve it to my friends."

Place a small bowl of jalapeÒo jelly on a platter, and surround it with fried Brie wedges and French bread slices for a lovely presentation.  Chef Scott makes her own jalapeÒo jelly; the purchased kind is an easy substitute.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  11       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
     3/4           cup  whipping cream -- plus
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
     2/3           cup  diced crystallized ginger

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly butter baking sheet.  Blend flour, sugar, baking powder and lemon peel in processor.  Add butter and cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal.

Transfer mixture to large bowl.  Make well in center; add 3/4 cup cream.  Using fork, stir until just moist.  Mix in ginger.  Transfer dough to floured surface and gently knead until smooth, about 8 turns.

Divide dough in half; pat each portion into 3/4-inch-thick round.  Cut each round into 6 wedges and transfer to prepared baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart.  Brush tops with remaining 2 tablespoons cream.

Bake scones until light brown, about 18 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool completely.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.  Rewarm in 350 degrees oven before serving.)

This recipe yields 12 scones.

Comments:  "While visiting Los Angeles recently," says Katherine Mollen of New York, New York, "I made sure to get to La Brea Bakery.  The ginger scones were the best I've ever had.  Since there's nothing that comes close here in New York, I'd like to try to make them at home."

Comments:  &quot;While in Sarnia, Ontario, on business, I stayed at the Village Inn and had dinner at its restaurant, Monetís Table,&quot; says Melanie Cooke of Calgary, Alberta.  &quot;I thought I was being adventurous when I ordered the mussel appetizer my first night there.  Obviously Iíd lost my sense of adventure when I went back the second night and ordered it again.&quot;

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  vegetables oil
  4             pounds  oxtails - (to 4 1/2 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste

  2                     carrots -- chopped
  2                     leeks, white and pale green parts only -- chopped
  1                     onion chopped
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1             bottle  dry red wine - (750 ml)
  12                    fresh thyme sprigs
  12                    fresh parsley sprigs
  8                     whole cloves
  4                     bay leaves
  5               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over high heat.  Season oxtails with salt and pepper.  Add to Dutch oven and cook until brown on all sides, about 12 minutes.  Transfer oxtails to platter.

Add celery, carrots, leeks, onion and garlic to pot and sautÈ until golden brown, about 8 minutes.  Arrange oxtails over vegetables.  Add wine, thyme, parsley, cloves and bay leaves.  Boil until liquid is reduced by half, about 15 minutes.  Add stock.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat.  Cover Dutch oven tightly and simmer until meat is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours.

Remove oxtails from cooking liquid.  Tent with foil to keep warm.  Strain cooking liquid.  Skim fat from surface and reserve.

Transfer 2 tablespoons skimmed fat to heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add flour and stir until mixture browns, about 10 minutes.  Whisk in cooking liquid.  Simmer until sauce thickens enough to coat back of spoon and is reduced to 2 cups, stirring frequently, about 45 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Return oxtails to sauce, cover and refrigerate.)

Rewarm oxtails in sauce over low heat.  Transfer to large bowl and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This main dish, made by chef Bryan Webb of Hilaire in London; is terrific over mashed potatoes.

Combine chicken stock, oyster sauce, plum sauce, mirin, orange juice, chili-garlic sauce and kaffir lime leaves in heavy small saucepan over medium-high heat.  Simmer until sauce is reduced to 1 cup, whisking occasionally, about 25 minutes.  Whisk in apple cider vinegar and sugar.  Remove from heat.  (Sauce can be prepared 3 days ahead.

Bake until thermometer inserted into center registers 150 degrees, about 10 minutes.

Bring sauce to boil.  Add butter one piece at a time, whisking just until melted before adding next piece.  Transfer 2 pork medallions to each of 6 plates.  Drizzle sauce around pork.  Top with Crispy Fried Leeks, if desired.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  whole milk
  1                cup  water
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  2 1/4           cups  yellow cornmeal
  1                cup  grated smoked Gouda cheese - (abt 4 oz)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  olive oil -- or more if needed
                        All-purpose flour
                        Roasted Red Pepper Ketchup -- (see recipe)

Lightly oil 13- by 9-inch metal baking pan.  Bring milk, 1 cup water and butter to boil in heavy large saucepan.  Gradually whisk in cornmeal.  Reduce heat to low and cook until polenta is very thick and starts to pull away from sides of pan, stirring often, about 8 minutes.

Remove from heat.  Stir in cheese, basil and thyme.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Immediately transfer polenta to prepared baking pan, spreading evenly to cover.  Refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1 hour.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and keep refrigerated.)

Cut polenta lengthwise in pan into three 3-inch-wide rectangles.  Cut each rectangle crosswise into 3/4-inch-wide strips.  Set polenta strips aside.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Heat 1/2 cup oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Place flour in pie plate.  Lightly coat polenta strips with flour; shake off excess.  Working in batches, fry polenta strips until golden brown on all sides, adding more oil if necessary, about 5 minutes.

Using slotted spoon, transfer fries to paper towels and drain.  Place fries on baking sheet and keep warm in oven while cooking remaining batches.  Transfer fries to large platter and serve with Roasted Red Pepper Ketchup.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  olive oil -- or more if needed
  1                cup  chopped shallots - (abt 3 lge)
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1                jar  capers - (4 oz) -- drained, chopped
  2             pounds  skinless salmon fillets -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces, any bones removed
  3               cups  fresh breadcrumbs made from French bread
  2              large  eggs -- beaten to blend
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  10                    hamburger buns -- split, toasted
                        Mayonnaise
                        Lettuce leaves
                        Tomato slices

Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add shallots and sautÈ until translucent, about 4 minutes.  Increase heat to medium-high.  Add white wine, lemon juice and drained capers and cook until almost all liquid evaporates, about 12 minutes.  Transfer shallot mixture to large bowl.  Refrigerate until shallot mixture is well chilled, about 1 hour.

Using on/off turns, coarsely grind salmon fillets in processor.  Add ground salmon to shallot mixture.  Mix in fresh breadcrumbs, beaten eggs, dill, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper.  Form salmon mixture into 10 patties, dividing equally.  (Salmon patties can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Transfer to baking sheet, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.)

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, add salmon patties to skillet and cook until patties are golden brown and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side, adding more oil to skillet as needed.

Serve salmon burgers on toasted hamburger buns with mayonnaise, lettuce leaves and tomato slices.

This recipe yields 10 burgers.

Comments:  "We enjoyed everything about The Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills -- the location, the rooms and the terrific restaurants.  The last time I stayed there, I had the most delicious salmon burger at the Roof Garden," says Diana Goldstein of Washington, D.C..  "Now that I've had this version, I may never go back to beef burgers."

<DirT>
Serve salmon burgers on toasted hamburger buns with mayonnaise, lettuce leaves and tomato slices.

Comments:  &quot;We enjoyed everything about The Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills -- the location, the rooms and the terrific restaurants.  The last time I stayed there, I had the most delicious salmon burger at the Roof Garden,&quot; says Diana Goldstein of Washington, D.C..  &quot;Now that I&apos;ve had this version, I may never go back to beef burgers.&quot;

  4                     salmon fillets with skin - (6 to 7 oz ea)
                        === DRESSING ===
  6        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  oriental sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped peeled fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  sugar
                        === RICE ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                cup  basmati rice
  1                cup  water
     2/3           cup  canned unsweetened coconut milk
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For Salmon:  Mix first 7 ingredients in small bowl to blend.  Place salmon fillets, skin-side down, on rimmed baking sheet.  Sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons spice mixture over each fillet.  Cover with plastic and refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight.

For Dressing:  Whisk vinegar and next 5 ingredients in small bowl to blend.

For Rice:  Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add rice and sautÈ until rice begins to turn opaque, about 2 minutes.  Stir in 1 cup water and coconut milk and bring to boil.  Cover and reduce heat to low; cook until rice is cooked through and liquid is absorbed, about 18 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add salmon fillets, flesh-side down, to skillet.  Sear until brown and crisp, about 3 minutes.  Turn fillets over and sear skin side until salmon is just cooked through, about 3 minutes.

Spoon rice onto plates, dividing equally.  Top each serving with seared salmon fillet, then Thai Vegetables.  Drizzle dressing around and serve immediately, passing extra dressing separately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "I have just returned from London, where I stayed at the beautiful Lanesborough hotel across from Hyde Park," writes Marjorie Wordingham of Mequon, Wisconsin.  "I had the most delicious salmon with Thai-style vegetables and rice at its restaurant, The Conservatory."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR SHRIMP BROTH ===
  1              pound  uncooked large shrimp
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     carrots -- chopped
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1                     leek, white and pale green parts only -- chopped
     1/2                fennel bulb -- chopped
  10             large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  5              large  fresh tarragon sprigs
  5                     fresh basil sprigs
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/8      teaspoon  five-spice powder
  4               cups  bottled clam juice
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2              large  tomatoes -- chopped
     1/4           cup  brandy
                        === FOR SOUP ===
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
     1/2           cup  chopped carrot
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  2                     bay leaves
  1                cup  French green lentils
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Make Shrimp Broth:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Peel and devein half of shrimp.  Reserve peeled shrimp for soup.  Place shells and remaining shrimp on heavy large baking sheet.  Roast until shells begin to brown, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.

Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add carrots and next 8 ingredients and sautÈ until vegetables begin to brown, about 15 minutes.  Add roasted shrimp and shells, clam juice, wine, tomatoes and brandy.  Simmer 30 minutes.  Cool 5 minutes.  Strain broth into heavy large saucepan, pressing hard on solids.  Boil broth until reduced to 4 cups, if necessary.

Make Soup:  Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add carrot, onion and bay leaves and sautÈ until vegetables begin to brown, about 10 minutes.  Add shrimp broth and lentils.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Cover and simmer until lentils are tender, about 45 minutes.

Transfer 1 1/2 cups soup to blender and puree until smooth.  Return to saucepan.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Bring to simmer before continuing.)

Add reserved shrimp to soup; simmer until cooked through, about 4 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Ladle soup into bowls.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  At Aubergine, one of London's most stylish restaurants, this soup is whimsically called a "capuccino."  Chef Gordon Ramsey tops it with a rich broth that has been foamed with butter.  This simpler version (minus the frothy "cap") is equally delicious.

  4              large  egg whites
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  1 1/4           cups  chilled whipping cream
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract

                        Powdered sugar
  1              Whole  strawberries -- (optional)

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.  Line 15- by 10- by 1-inch baking sheet with waxed paper, extending 2 inches over ends of pan.  Butter waxed paper.

Beat egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add 1 1/4 cups sugar, beating until meringue is stiff and shiny.  Spread meringue evenly in prepared baking sheet.

Bake until pale golden, about 8 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees.  Bake until meringue is slightly firm to touch on top but soft inside, about 8 minutes longer.  Remove baking sheet from oven.  Run knife around pan sides to loosen meringue.  Turn out onto sheet of waxed paper.  Carefully peel off waxed paper.  Cool meringue 25 minutes.

Whip cream and vanilla in medium bowl to stiff peaks.  Mix sliced strawberries and preserves in another medium bowl.  Spoon strawberry mixture over meringue, leaving 1-inch border on all sides.  Spread whipped cream over strawberry mixture.  Starting at 1 long side, gently roll up meringue jelly-roll style, enclosing filling.  Place roulade, seam-side down, on platter.  Refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.

Dust roulade with powdered sugar.  Cut into slices.  Transfer to plates.  Garnish with whole strawberries, if desired.  Serve roulade chilled.

     1/2           cup  chilled whipping cream
  8              large  egg yolks
     1/3           cup  sugar -- plus

  3        tablespoons  water

  2        tablespoons  instant espresso powder
  2                     containers mascarpone cheese - (8 oz ea) -- see * Note
     1/2           cup  orange juice
  3        tablespoons  Grand Marnier or other orange liqueur
  1         tablespoon  grated orange peel
                        === FOR EXPRESSO SYRUP ===
     1/2           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  4          teaspoons  instant espresso powder

                        Cocoa powder

* Note:  Italian cream cheese available at Italian markets and many supermarkets.  If unavailable, blend 3/4 pound cream cheese with 6 tablespoons whipping cream and 1/4 cup sour cream.

Make Parfaits:  Beat cream in small bowl until stiff peaks form.  Cover; chill.  Combine 4 yolks, 1/3 cup sugar, 3 tablespoons water, liqueur and espresso powder in medium metal bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not let bowl touch water).  Using handheld mixer, beat mixture until thickened and thermometer registers 175 degrees, about 5 minutes.

Combine remaining 4 yolks, orange juice, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, Grand Marnier and orange peel in another medium metal bowl.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not let bowl touch water).  Using handheld mixer fitted with clean dry beaters, beat yolk mixture until thickened and thermometer registers 175 degrees, about 7 minutes.  Remove from over water; continue beating until mixture cools, about 6 minutes.  Fold in second container of mascarpone, then remaining whipped cream.

Spoon 1/4 cup espresso mousse, then 1/4 cup orange mousse into each of four 10-ounce goblets.  Repeat layering with remaining mousse mixtures.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Make Espresso Syrup:  Stir 1/2 cup water, sugar and espresso powder in small saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Refrigerate until cold.

Dip 1 biscotti halfway into espresso syrup.  Insert syrup-coated section into 1 parfait.  Repeat with remaining biscotti and syrup.  Sprinkle cocoa over parfaits.

Categories    : First Course                    Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  Parmesan cheese
  2                     lemons -- halved
  8                     artichokes - (abt 9 to 12 oz ea)
  28                    baby carrots - (abt 4 bunches) -- greens trimmed
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  24                    cherry tomatoes - (abt 1 lb) -- halved
  12            ounces  button mushrooms -- halved
  1            package  frozen baby peas - (10 oz) -- thawed
  1            package  frozen baby lima beans - (10 oz) -- thawed
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar

Using vegetable peeler, cut Parmesan into thin shavings.  Set aside.

Squeeze juice from lemons into large pot; add lemons.  Fill pot with water.  Cut stem and top 1/3 from 1 artichoke.  Starting at base, bend leaves back and snap off where they break naturally; continue until all tough outer leaves have been removed.  Using small sharp knife, trim outside of base until smooth and no dark green areas remain.

Cut artichoke lengthwise into quarters.  Cut out choke from quarters.  Cut each quarter in half, making 1/2-inch wedges.  Place artichoke pieces in lemon water.  Repeat with remaining artichokes.  Cover pot and bring to boil.  Boil artichokes until tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain; set aside.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Cook 28 baby carrots in large pot of boiling water 5 minutes.  Drain carrots well.  (Carrots can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add tomatoes and mushrooms.  SautÈ until tomatoes and mushrooms release juices, about 8 minutes.  Add artichokes, carrots, baby peas and lima beans.  Cook until lima beans and peas are tender and juices thicken slightly, stirring often, about 10 minutes.  Add 1/4 cup butter and stir until melted.  Season vegetables to taste with salt and pepper.

Transfer ragout to large bowl.  Toss with balsamic vinegar and sprinkle with Parmesan shavings.

This recipe yields 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  Also nice as a meatless entrÈe -- with some crusty French bread, of course.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks)
  8             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  5              large  eggs
  5              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Frangelico Ice Cream -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter six 6-ounce (3/4-cup) soufflÈ dishes or custard cups.  Stir butter and chocolate in medium saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth.  Cool to room temperature.

Using electric mixer, beat eggs, yolks and sugar in large bowl until foamy and pale, and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes.  Add flour; beat until just blended.  Stir in chocolate.  Pour into prepared dishes.

Place dishes on baking sheet.  Bake until cakes are firm around edges but still move slightly in center when shaken, about 12 minutes (do not overbake).  Cool 5 minutes, then invert onto serving plates.  Serve warm with ice cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "When my daughter and son-in-law took me to Bridges in nearby Danville for my birthday, they told me the restaurant was in the movie Mrs. Doubtfire," says Merrybell Loesel of Walnut Creek, California.  "I was even more impressed by dessert than I was by the restaurant's claim to fame -- the chocolate pudding cake defies description."

These individual cakes have a soft, pudding-like center.  If youíre short on time, substitute purchased vanilla or coffee ice cream: Soften it, and stir in some Frangelico -- a hazelnut liqueur made in Italy -- before serving.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  2               cups  sliced celery
  1                cup  sliced shallots
     3/4           cup  chopped onion
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3               cups  sliced stemmed fresh shiitake mushrooms - -- (abt 6 oz)
  3               cups  sliced crimini mushrooms - (abt 6 oz)
  3               cups  sliced oyster mushrooms - (abt 4 1/2 oz)
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  dry Sherry
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  8               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Melt 6 tablespoons butter in large pot over medium-high heat.  Add celery, shallots, onion and garlic and sautÈ until onion is translucent, about 8 minutes.  Add all mushrooms and sautÈ until beginning to soften, about 4 minutes.  Add white wine and Sherry.  Boil until liquid is reduced to glaze, about 6 minutes.

Mix remaining 2 tablespoons butter and 1/4 cup flour in small bowl until smooth paste forms.  Add flour paste to mushroom mixture in pot; stir until mixture melts and coats vegetables.  Gradually mix in stock.  Bring to boil, stirring frequently.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until mushrooms are tender, stirring often, about 10 minutes.  Stir in cream.  Season with salt and pepper.

Working in batches, puree soup in blender or processor until smooth.  Return soup to pot.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm over medium-low heat before serving.)  Ladle soup into bowls and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  "My husband and I ate dinner at the Dilworthtown Inn, a colonial-style restaurant in West Chester, Pennsylvania," writes Judy Kamp of Oxford, Pennsylvania.  "Iíd love to know how to make the creamy mushroom soup we both had to start the meal."

Melt 6 tablespoons butter in large pot over medium-high heat.  Add celery, shallots, onion and garlic and sautÈ until onion is translucent, about 8 minutes.

Mix remaining 2 tablespoons butter and 1/4 cup flour in small bowl until smooth paste forms.  Add flour paste to mushroom mixture in pot; stir until mixture melts and coats vegetables.  Gradually mix in stock.  Bring to boil, stirring frequently.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until mushrooms are tender, stirring often, about 10 minutes.  Stir in cream.  Season with salt and pepper.
