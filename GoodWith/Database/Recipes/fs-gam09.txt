  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Many people who hunt regularly and put
                        up meat for later use like to make some
                        jerky.  It's an excellent way to preserve
                        meat, it's nutritious, and it  tastes good

   Most jerky is made from relatively fresh large chunks of meat that can be cut into strips for drying.  Because these strips shrink considerably as the meat dries, it usually takes a good-sized piece of meat to make a piece of jerky that's anything bigger than a "tidbit."

   One of the problems with making this type of jerky is that it is often tough.  Chewy jerky isn't all that bad, especially if you don't have much and you want it to last.  Stringy leg muscle jerky is like one of those all day suckers we used to buy as kids to tasted great, lasted forever, but you had to be careful with your front teeth.

   The method of making jerky described here changes all that.  It tastes so good and it's so easy to eat, you can hardly keep enough hidden away to have with an occasional beer.  If the kids find the hidden cache, it's gone!  But that's okay, because jerky is a whole lot better for them than cookies anyway.

   The following steps are meant to be guidelines.  After you go through the drill once, you will find it easy to innovate to meet your personal tastes.

1. Prepare the Meat for Grinding 
   ï This is an excellent way to use up old steaks, stew meat, or roasts that somehow got lost in the bottom of the freezer.  Take out and partially thaw about five pounds of meat.  Meat is easier to trim when it still has some crystallized ice in it.  Trim off all freezer burn material, gristle, fat, sinew, and bone.  You want to end up with only clean, lean meat.

2. Weigh the Meat 
   ï This is important for adding the right amount of seasoning.  Five pounds is a convenient batch to work with and if you screw up you haven't lost a lot of meat.  Five pounds divided in half also fits nicely on two standard cookie sheets (12 by 18 inches).

3. Grind the Meat 
   ï Cut meat into one-inch cubes and run through the coarse (5/16-inch holes) plate of a grinder.  A food processor is a good alternative if you don't have a grinder.

4. Add Spices 
   ï Everyone has their own idea of what is "too salty," "too spicy," or "too peppery."  The following recipe is a good starter.  After the first batch, you will know if it is right for you.  If not to change it.  For each pound of meat add:

     1 teaspoon curing salt 
     = (no iodine and definitely not sea salt) 
     1 teaspoon liquid smoke 
     1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 
     1/4 teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper

   ï Make sure your hands are clean (including under the fingernails), dump the powder and liquid into the bowl of ground meat, and "goosh" it all together.  Kids love this part, because it's just like making mud pies!

5. Regrind the Meat 
   ï Run the mixed material through the fine (3/16-inch holes) plate on the grinder.  If you leave the mixture coarse, some of the pieces could be a little tough and the meat tends not to stick together as well in a flat sheet as when it is finely ground.  However, you don't want to grind it so fine that it looks like "liver paste."

6. Press Meat onto Cookie Sheet 
   ï Use nonstick cookie sheets or spray regular cookie sheets with nonstick cooking oil.  Put enough meat (approximately 2 1/2 pounds) on the sheet and press out so that you have a layer about 1/4-inch thick (about halfway on the sheet's lip).

7. Partially Dry the Meat 
   ï Either place the sheet of meat in an oven turned to very low heat or situate a fan to blow across the meat.  We prefer the fan method to start the drying process because there is no chance of "cooking" the meat and essentially turning it into a thin flat meatloaf!  In about 2 hours, the meat can be slid off the cookie sheet onto a countertop or table.

8. Cut Meat into Strips 
   ï Carefully cut the meat into strips of the desired length.  We usually divide the sheet lengthwise and then cut each half into strips about 1 inch wide and 6 inches long.  You can use either a sharp knife or scissors.

9. Flavoring and Final Drying 
   ï If you want a barbeque flavor or some other special aroma associated with your jerky, now is the time to add these ingredients.  Just lightly brush your special sauce or paste-type flavoring on the strips. 
   ï Place the strips on food dehydrator trays to finish the drying process.  A dehydrator works much better than a fan or oven because you can attain just the right "chewiness" for you.  Generally, an overnight stint in a good dehydrator is sufficient.

10. Storage 
   ï When the meat is dried to your satisfaction, it is best to store it in the freezer.  If you can, vacuum pack the strips in small packages to do it.  They will stay fresh a lot longer.  Otherwise, put the jerky in sealed plastic bags and freeze.  Dried and stored properly, your jerky will keep almost indefinitely.

Comments:  This is really the neatest way to make jerky since someone invented sliced bread.  You can make up a batch in the evening and it will be dried and ready to eat by morning.  It's delicious, nutritious, and makes a great snack for hunting and fishing.  If your first batch isn't quite what you expected, don't worry, the dogs will still think it's terrific.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     hare -- dressed, skinned,
                        and cut in serving-size pieces
     1/4           cup  diced bacon or salt pork
  3        tablespoons  bacon fat
     1/2           cup  flour -- seasoned with
                        Salt and pepper -- to taste
  1                can  condensed tomato soup
  4               cups  hot water
  2          teaspoons  dry onion flakes
  1           teaspoon  sugar

Heat the fat in Dutch oven with the salt pork or bacon.  Dredge meat in seasoned flour, and sear well on all sides in the hot fat.

Blend tomato soup in hot water and add to meat.  Add onion flakes and sugar.  If necessary, add water to just cover everything.  Cook all day at low heat.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Snowshoe and tundra hare are delicious if properly and promptly prepared  --  a process that begins in the field.  Always wear gloves to gut and skin hares.  If you plan to freeze the meat, dry the pieces before wrapping.  Use a double layer of wrapping or two heavy-duty freezer bags to prevent punctures from bone ends, which can lead to freezer-burned meat.

  1                cup  clams - (to 1 1/2)
  6               cups  assorted fish - (2 1/2 lbs)
                        = (halibut, salmon, cod, rockfish to
                        whatever's in the freezer!)
  1                cup  shelled crab - (to 2)
  5                     strips bacon
  2                     onions -- chopped fine
  2                     celery stalks -- chopped fine
  6             medium  potatoes - (to 8) -- peeled, cut small
  2               cans  chicken broth
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

  1                cup  milk
  8        tablespoons  flour

Cook clams in liquid (water or clam juice) for several hours until tender.  Cool and chop.

                   Baked Shad Fillets With Sorrel Sauce

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Salt Water)               Main Dish
                Shad

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
     1/4         pound  sorrel
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE FISH ===
  2                     boned shad fillets - (abt 3/4 lb ea)
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  4        tablespoons  heavy cream

Make the Sauce:  Trim the tough stems from the sorrel and shred the leaves fine, setting aside a little for garnish.  Wash the leaves and put them in a saucepan.  There will be enough water clinging to the leaves to cook the sorrel.  Over medium heat, cook the sorrel for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring constantly, until it is soft and wilted and forms a puree.

In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a boil and let it simmer for 2 or 3 minutes to reduce it slightly.  Stir in the sorrel puree and simmer for another minute or two.  Strain the sauce, stir in the chives, and season the sauce with some salt and pepper.

For the Fish:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Season the fish on both sides with salt and pepper.  Butter a shallow casserole and lay the fish in it in one layer, skin down.  Dot the fish with butter and spoon on the cream.  Bake the fish for 8 minutes, then turn on the broiler and broil it for 4 minutes.

Reheat the sauce and put it in a sauce-boat.  Serve the fish from the casserole, garnished with some of the reserved and finely shredded sorrel, and spoon some sauce over each serving.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Description:
  "The tang of sorrel complements the rich flavor of shad.  You can cook
  some shad roe in the baking pan along pan along with the fish; it will
  be done at the same time."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  beaver meat
  2             medium  onions -- diced
  1                     celery stalk -- diced
  2        tablespoons  Worchestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  prepared mustard
  1                cup  catsup
  1                cup  water
  2        tablespoons  vinegar
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper

Thinly slice meat across grain.  Brown meat with onion and celery.  Add remaining ingredients and simmer for 1 hour.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  The valuable pelt of the beaver was the impetus for exploring a continent.  But in some parts of Alaska, the beaver has always been valued more as food than clothing.  Higher in food energy and protein than beef but lower in fat, beaver meat is well worth bringing home from the trapline.

  1              pound  bear meat - (to 1 1/2)
     1/2         ounce  Morton's smoke-flavored sugar cure - -- (to 3/4)
                        === BEANS ===
  1              pound  small white beans (dry)
  2          teaspoons  dry mustard
  1         tablespoon  salt
  3             medium  onions -- diced
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  molasses
  2        tablespoons  pickle juice or vinegar -- mixed with
                        a little cinnamon and cloves
                        Bear meat -- prepared as above

Prepare bear meat ahead of time as follows: Take 1 to 1 1/2 pounds of clean meat with some bone left in.  Best parts are from the hindquarter or front shoulders.  Cut 1 to 2 inches thick.

Use 1/2 ounce of Morton's smoke-flavored sugar cure for each pound of bear meat.  Rub cure in well and place meat in refrigerator for 1 to 2 weeks, depending on thickness.

Remove meat from refrigerator and soak in lukewarm water for about an hour to remove excess surface salt.  Pat dry and return to the refrigerator for another 2 days.

At this point you can either put the meat in the beans (see below) or smoke in your smokehouse to desired taste and then put in the beans.

Prepare beans as follows:  Soak beans overnight.  Drain and rinse.  Cover beans with water, and mix in all ingredients.  Bake 6 to 8 hours at 250 degrees with the lid on.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Recent changes in regulations require hunters in most parts of the state to salvage the meat of Spring black bears.  What do you do with that bear meat when you get it home?  Here's one suggestion.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ROE FILLING ===
  1             medium  pair shad roe - (7 to 8 oz)
  1         tablespoon  soft unsalted butter
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  pureed garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
                        === SHAD ===
  2                     boned shad fillets - (3/4 lb ea)
                        = (they'll be cut down the middle to
                        remove the small bones, leaving two
                        flaps that can be opened out)
                        Nonstick spray -- as needed
                        === CRUMB TOPPING ===
  1                cup  fresh white bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  capers -- minced
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Make the filling:  Using scissors, carefully split the membrane around the roe and spread the roe open.  Using a teaspoon, gently scrape all the eggs away from the membrane and put them in a bowl.  Gently stir to combine the roe, butter and seasonings.

Season the fish on both sides with salt and pepper.  Spray the bottom of a shallow baking pan with nonstick spray and lay the fish in the pan, skin-side down.  Fold open the sides of fillets and gently spread half of the roe filling in a thin layer over each fillet.  Fold the sides of the fish over the filling.

Put the bread crumbs in a bowl and combine them with the capers and melted butter.  Pat half the mixture over each fish and bake for 20 minutes.  Transfer the fish to a warm platter and serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  pheasant
                        Your favorite marinade -- as needed
  1              large  onion
                        = (preferrably Vidalia)
  3                     peppercorns - (to 4)
     3/4           cup  either dry hard cider, beer spiked with
                        a bit of apple brandy, fresh cider, or
                        white wine
                        Flour -- as needed
                        Water -- as needed
                        Rendered salt pork, bacon fat, or
                        olive oil

Bone a large pheasant, and cut the thigh and breast meat into 2-inch chunks.  Save the wings and drumsticks.  Marinate the thigh and breast meat for 24 hours in 1/2 cup marinade in a zip lock bag.  Force the air out of the bag, seal, and refrigerate until ready to use.

Make a reduction with the pheasant drumsticks, wings, and a few chunks of onion.  Brown everything well with a bit of fat in a very hot skillet.  Deglaze the skillet with a bit of wine or cider, scraping the bottom with a spatula.  Add a few peppercorns and a few cups of water, then boil until reduced to 1/2 cup.  Strain and set aside.

Peel, core, and coarsely chop 2 medium apples, along with a large onion (Vidalia if possible).  Drain the marinated pheasant meat, and save some of the marinade.  Dredge the meat in white flour and sautÈ to golden brown in either rendered salt pork, bacon fat, or olive oil.

Remove the meat, and sautee the onions until they are soft and translucent.  Add the apples, then add about 1/4 cup (or to taste) of the remaining marinade, along with 1/2 cup of either dry hard cider, beer spiked with a bit of apple brandy, fresh cider, or white wine.  Add the demi-glace reduction, along with the browned meat.

Cover and simmer slowly on low flame or in 350 degree oven, until pheasant is tender and the apples are well-cooked.  Serve with a good, crusty European style bread and a cheap Montepulciano red wine.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                             Breast Of Grouse

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 3     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Grouse                          Main Dish
                Upland Birds

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     breasts of grouse
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/2                glass tart jelly
                        = (apple -- gooseberry, etc.)
  5             ounces  dry sherry
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream - (to 4)
                        Paprika -- to taste

Saute breasts in butter until nearly tender, about 15 minutes, add jelly and wine.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Cook, covered, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove breasts to a platter.

Add cream and a dash of paprika to the gravy.  Taste for seasoning and if necessary add salt and pepper.  Pour gravy over meat.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Comments:  The Blue Grouse (or hooter) is the largest upland game bird in Alaska, attaining weights of 3 1/2 pounds.  The Blue Grouse hunting season ends on May 15.

Meat of young grouse is more tender than that of adults, making them very desirable.  It isn't the meat of the adult birds which at times is tough, but rather the membrane covering each muscle bundle.  This can be completely removed with the aid of a sharp knife and by peeling it off with the fingers.  The method is similar to that employed when skinning an animal.

Mention of only breast meat does not mean that the other meat is not good.  The giblets are very tasty.  The legs are full of sinewy little bones and are a bit discouraging to eat as drumsticks.  However, they, along with the neck and giblets, are good when pressure cooked together for soups and stews.

Description:
  "April is a great time to get out in the woods, enjoy the rush of
  spring, and to if you're lucky enough to live within their range to
  listen to the "hooters" calling.  Even luckier is the hunter who can
  bag an unwary hooter for the pot."

Categories    : Main Dish                       Partridge
                Upland Birds

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Ptarmigan breasts
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  2        tablespoons  parsley
  1                can  cream of mushroom soup
  1                can  water
     1/4           cup  sherry
                        Fresh sliced mushrooms

Place ptarmigan breasts in slow cooker.  Add chopped onion, parsley, cream of mushroom soup, water, sherry and fresh sliced mushrooms.  Slow cook until tender.  Add more water as needed.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Ptarmigan hunting is fun.  You never know what to expect from one trip to the next.  In the fall you tramp through colorful thickets of willow and dwarf birch, your dog nosing coveys of brown birds out of the brush while you mop your brow and wish you hadn't put on a sweater.

Late in September, after facing a strong, cold wind for several fruitless hours, you top out on a rocky ridge and suddenly find yourself surrounded by several hundred stretch-necked, pinto-patterned ptarmigan.

You hang up your shotgun for five months, only to be tolled into the hills again by the bright blue days of March.  Warmly clad in parka and mukluks, you snowshoe across narrow alpine valleys following meandering trails of three-pronged ptarmigan tracks across the brilliant snow.

                Wild Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Wild turkey steaks -- see * Note
                        Butter -- as needed
                        Pomegranate molasses -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  Turkey steaks are made by cutting across the breast, against the grain, instead of filleting it.  Each steak should be about one inch thick.  This cut is best made with a professional meat saw, and some friendly butchers will cut the steaks for you if you are a regular customer.  Not that cutting against the grain makes an entirely different meat from the same breast cut into fingers with the grain.

Preheat the broiler, and adjust the rack so it is four inches from the heat source.  Melt a little butter and mix in an equal amount of pomegranate molasses, making enough for a basting sauce.

Salt and pepper the turkey steaks, place them in a broiling pan, and broil for three minutes on each side.  Baste the top side, and broil for another minute.  Turn, baste, and broil a little longer, until the turkey is done.  Don't overcook.

Serve hot with rice and steamed vegetables or perhaps broiled eggplant.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  The pomegranate molasses or syrup used in this recipe is a popular condiment in Azerbaijan and other countries of the Caucasus, as well as in the Middle East.  The last bottle I found was imported from Lebanon.  If you can't find the stuff, as use any good sweet-and-sour basting sauce suitable for chicken.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     turkey frame -- (see comments)
  2                     squirrels
                        = (or 1 cottontail)
     1/2         pound  salt pork
  2               cups  fresh or frozen baby lima beans
  2               cups  fresh or frozen whole kernel corn
  4              large  tomatoes -- chopped
  2              large  potatoes -- diced
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3                     bay leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Red-pepper flakes -- to taste
                        = (or freshly-ground black pepper)

Brown the salt pork in a skillet until most of the grease has fried out.  Add the onions, and cook five minutes.  Drain off the excess grease, and set the skillet aside.

Disjoint the turkey frame and the squirrels or rabbits.  Put the pieces into a large pot or Dutch oven.  Add the bay leaves.  Barely cover with water, bring to a boil, cover tightly, and simmer gently (do not boil) for an hour, or until all the meats are tender.  Add more water from time to time if needed.

If the turkey gets tender first, take it out a piece at a time and pull the meat from the bones.

When all the meat pieces have been boned, add the meat back to the pot, along with the livers, diced salt pork, and sautÈed onions.  Season with salt and red-pepper flakes or black pepper.

Add the rest of the vegetables, bring to a boil, and simmer for about 20 minutes or until the vegetables are tender, stirring a time or two and adding a little hot water if needed.

Serve the stew hot in bowls, along with crusty bread or cornpone.  Be prepared to dish up seconds.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This great game stew, created along the Atlantic seaboard, uses small game and fowl and native Indian vegetables such as beans, corn, potatoes, Jerusalem artichokes, and so on.  I like to make it with a breasted turkey -- that is, the whole bird minus the breast fillets.  The giblets can also be used in the stew.  This recipe makes a complete meal for home or camp.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  caribou steak - (to 3)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Bread crumbs -- as needed
     1/2           cup  fat
     1/4           cup  cranberry relish or currant jelly
                        === CRANBERRY CHUTNEY ===
  1              pound  fresh cranberries
  2               cups  water
  2               cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  vinegar
  1                cup  seeded raisins
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
     1/4      teaspoon  powdered ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Rub meat with salt and pepper.  Roll in bread crumbs.

Melt fat in skillet; fry steaks until well browned on both sides.  Place on hot platter.

Make gravy using drippings in pan and cranberry relish or currant jelly.

Cranberry Chutney:  Pick over cranberries, discarding soft ones.  Wash.  Bring water and sugar to a boil.  Add cranberries and all remaining ingredients.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, until berries have popped -- about 10 minutes.  Cool.  Serve warm or cold as a relish for wild game.  (Makes 1 quart)

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Most hunters agree that October bulls are less palatable than bulls taken earlier in the year or cows, calves or yearlings taken any time.  So for the best eating, avoid rutting bulls, and with one million caribou in Alaska, there are plenty of choices.

Ah, the Christmas goose -- a glistening golden brown bird brimming with roasted chestnuts, flanked by colorful winter fruits on a silver platter.  If this is your vision of a Christmas goose, you'll need to stop by the meat market and purchase a big, fat farm-raised bird.  Wild geese don't look or taste like their domestic cousins.  The wild meat is darker and much leaner.  It still tastes great, but only if it has been handled with a little care and consideration.

Let's start by removing the legs at the body.  We're going to cook those at least two hours longer than the body.  Rub the legs with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, place them in a roasting pan and throw in some chopped celery, carrots, onion and garlic.  Now add enough chicken broth and/or dry white wine to almost cover the legs.  Cover with foil and place in a preheated 425 degree oven for one hour.  Then, flip them over, replace cover and cook for another hour.  Check them for doneness.  The meat should start to pull away from the bone with minimal effort.  If not, stick them back in the oven, making sure that there's still about an inch or so of liquid in the pan, and keep cooking until tender.  When ready, carefully remove the legs from the pan and set aside.  Discard the stuff left in the pan.

Repeat the process for the body.  Start by rubbing with olive oil, you know, just like the legs.  Place them in a roasting pan, breast-side down, with fresh chopped celery, etc. and add about one to two inches of chicken stock and/or dry white wine.  Cut a few wedges from an apple and place under the breasts to keep it from falling over onto its side in the pan.  Cover with foil or lid and place in a preheated 325 degree oven for about twenty-five minutes or, and this is really important, the internal temperature of the breast is 130 degrees.  After about fifteen minutes into the cooking, add the cooked legs to the pan and replace foil or lid.  When done (130 degrees), remove the goose parts and let stand for a few minutes.

Now, it's gravy time.  Pour the contents of the pan through a colander and into a saucepan.  Bring liquid to a boil.  Add some sliced mushrooms, herbs, finely diced vegetables, etc. if you like.  Thicken gravy with a mixture of equal parts cornstarch and cold water.  Add a little at a time while stirring until thickened.  Season with salt and pepper.

To serve, remove the whole breast halves from the carcass.  Slice and arrange on a platter with the legs.  Garnish with apples and oranges.  Serve with gravy on the side.

                Wild Duck

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  water
  1           teaspoon  sesame-seed oil
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  12                    scallions
                        === MANDARIN PANCAKES ===
  2               cups  sifted all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  boiling water
  1         tablespoon  sesame-seed oil - (to 2)
                        === DUCK/GOOSE ===
  1                     duck (or goose)
  5               cups  water - (to 6)
     1/4           cup  honey
  4             slices  peeled fresh ginger - (1" dia -- 1/8" thk)
  2                     scallions, including the green tops -- cut 2" lengths

Prepare the Sauce:  Make sauce by combining hoisin sauce, water, sesame-seed oil and sugar in small pan and stir to dissolve sugar.  Bring to a boil then simmer for 3 minutes and cool.

Prepare scallion brushes by cutting scallions to 3-inch lengths and trimming roots.  Stand each scallion on end and make four intersecting cuts 1 inch deep into stalk; repeat at other end.  Place scallions in ice water and refrigerate until cut parts curl into brushlike fans.

Prepare the Mandarin Pancakes:  Sift flour in mixing bowl; make a well in the center and add 3/4 cup of boiling water.  Using a wooden spoon, gradually mix flour and water together until a soft dough is formed.  Knead gently for 10 minutes on a lightly floured surface.  Cover with damp towel and let rest for 15 minutes.

Roll dough to about 1/4-inch thickness.  With a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter (or glass) cut as many circles of dough as possible.  Arrange circles side by side; brush half the circles lightly with sesame-seed oil and, sandwich-wise, place un-oiled circles on top.  With a rolling pin, flatten each sandwiched pair into a 6-inch circle, rotating the sandwich an inch or so in a clockwise direction as you roll so the circle keeps its shape, and turning it once to roll both sides.  Cover pancakes with a dry towel.

Set a heavy skillet on high heat for 30 seconds.  Reduce heat to medium and cook pancakes, one at a time, in ungreased pan.  Turn them over as they puff up and little bubbles appear on the surface.  Regulate heat so pancakes become specked with brown after cooking about 1 minute on each side.  As each pancake is finished, gently separate the halves and stack them.  Serve at once or wrap in foil and refrigerate or freeze for later use.  To reheat, steam for 10 minutes or warm (still wrapped in foil) in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes.

Preparing the Duck/Goose:  Wash the duck with cold water and pat dry inside and out.  Suspend with a cord tied around loose neck skin (or under wings) in a cool airy place for 3 hours to dry the skin (train a fan on the bird to speed drying).

In a wok or large cassarole, combine water, honey, ginger root and cut scallions; bring to a boil over high heat.  Holding the duck by the cord, lower it into the boiling liquid, using a spoon to turn the duck from side to side until thoroughly moistened.  Remove the duck (discard liquid) and rehang in cool place to dry for 2 to 3 hours.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Untie duck and cut off any loose neck skin.  Place duck, breast-side up, on a rack and set in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes a pound.  Lower heat to 300 degrees, turn duck on its breast and roast 10 minutes a pound.  Then raise heat to 375 degrees, return duck to original position and roast for a final 10 minutes a pound.

Using a small sharp knife and your fingers, remove the crisp skin from the breast, sides and back of duck.  Cut skin into small rectangles and arrange in a single layer on a heated platter.  Carve the wings, drumsticks and all meat away from the carcass.  Slice meat into small pieces and arrange with wings and drumsticks on another heated platter.

Traditionally, Crispy Duck is served as follows.  Place platters of duck, heated pancakes, bowl of sauce, and scallion brushes on the table.  Each guest spreads a pancake flat on a plate, dips a scallion in the sauce and brushes the pancake with it.  The scallion is placed in the middle of the pancake with a piece of duck skin and a piece of meat on top.  The pancake is folded over about 1 inch to enclose the filling, and the whole rolled into a cylinder that can be picked up and eaten with the fingers.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  duck breasts
  1                cup  boneless pork shoulder
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/3           cup  finely-diced yellow onion
  1                     celery stalk -- finely diced
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, diced fine
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  orange juice
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
  1                     egg
                        Vegetable oil -- for sautÈing

Place duck and pork shoulder in a food processor and grind thoroughly.  Place ground mixture in a large bowl.

Heat butter in a skillet and sautÈ onion, celery, jalapeÒo and garlic until onion is translucent.  Add orange juice and cook until liquid reduced by one-half.  Add pepper and salt to taste.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Add mixture to bowl with ground duck, etc.  Add egg and mix thoroughly with your hands.

Form meat into egg-sized balls and then press into patties.  Add enough oil to just coat the bottom of a skillet over medium heat.  When oil is hot, add patties and sautÈ on each side until well-browned and cooked throughout.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  By request from Jeff Smalley of Auburn, Alabama.  Jeff wants to know what to do with all of the coots, spoonbills and mergansers he shoots.  I use the recipe for widgeon, gadwall, etc.  This makes a great breakfast sausage.

Heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet.  Add cakes and lightly brown on first side, about 4 minutes.  Turn cakes over carefully with a spatula and cook for 3 minutes more or until cakes or just cooked throughout.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe works great with any kind of fish or a combination of fish, but I prefer those varieties, which are flaky rather than firm.  Striped bass, panfish, catfish and lingcod fillets are exceptional when formed into cakes.

It is important to shred the fish fillets into quarter-sized flakes before molding the fish cakes.  You can either break the fillets apart with your fingers or use the tines of a fork to rake through the fish.  Make certain that you firmly squeeze the water out of the fish before adding to the fish cake mixture, particularly if the fish has been previously frozen.  The fish cake mixture will be moister than what you may be accustomed to, but then so will the cooked cakes.  If they are a bit dry, add some additional mayonnaise or beaten egg.  If they are just too wet to stick together, add some more breadcrumbs.

Don't heat the pan up too much or the cakes will burn.  Also, resist the urge to play with your food and turn the delicate cakes over too many times.  Brown on one side and then carefully flip over and brown the other side.  If you need to make a big batch of the fish cakes, lightly brown them on both sides and then keep warm on a sheet pan in a low heat oven.  Serve with your favorite tartar sauce, aioli, cocktail sauce or a white wine and butter sauce.

                                Fish Tacos

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Salt Water)               Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        Juice of 2 limes
     1/2           cup  orange juice
  2             ounces  tequila
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground chili powder
  1              pound  fresh fish fillets
     1/4           cup  diced red onion
  8             medium  flour tortillas -- warmed
  2               cups  shredded romaine or iceberg lettuce
  1                cup  grated jack cheese
  1                     ripe avocado -- diced
  1                cup  diced fresh tomato

In a large bowl, combine first 7 ingredients.  Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Remove fish from marinade and discard marinade.  Cook fish either on barbecue, in skillet or under broiler.

Break cooked fish apart into small chunks.  Place an equal portion of fish into each tortilla.  Top with remaining ingredients.

This recipe yields 4 servings, 8 tacos.

Comments:  During the hot summer months, I probably eat more fish tacos than any other single dish.  Firm-fleshed fish such as salmon, swordfish, snapper and striped bass may be easily grilled outdoors.  The more delicate and smaller fish may either be pan-seared in a hot skillet with a tablespoon or two of olive oil or broiled in the oven.

This is a great recipe to try on someone who prefers not to eat fish.  The flavor is not unlike a taco made from seasoned chicken.  The recipe specifies warm soft flour tortillas, but crispy corn tortilla shells work well also.  Do be careful not to overcook your fish.  Overcooked fish always tastes dry and often rubbery.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     wild turkey
  4            gallons  peanut oil
                        Cajun rub -- (optional)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Turkey-Foot Gravy -- (see recipe)
                        = (or your favorite giblet gravy)

In a large, tall cooker, heat the oil to 375 degrees, preferably with the aid of a grease thermometer.  Pluck and draw the turkey, then sprinkle it inside and out with salt and pepper, with Cajun rub, or with a combination.

When the oil is hot, lower the bird into it carefully.  Turn the heat up until the oil comes back to 375.  Then adjust the heat and fry the bird three or four minutes per pound, until is golden brown.

Carefully remove the bird, and let it drain before serving.  It will continue to cook on the inside for several minutes, while the eating table is readied.

Place the bird on a large platter and set it in the middle of the table, to be carved and served along with dressing, giblet gravy, steamed vegetables, homemade biscuits, cranberry sauce, and all the trimmings.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  If you want an especially attractive platter, pluck some quail, sprinkle them with salt and pepper, dust with flour, and fry them up after the turkey is done, or cook them separately.  Put the turkey in the center of the platter and the fried quail all around, perhaps with a sprig or two of green stuff stuck in here and there.

                        Peanut oil -- for deep frying
                        Flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

To prepare the turkey fingers, fillet out both side of the breast, cutting close on either side of the breast, cutting close on either side of the breastbone.  Slice each fillet into fingers, lengthwise.  I prefer to leave the skin on the breasts, but suit yourself.  For even cooking, the fingers should be about one inch thick in the middle and fairly uniform.  I like to cook with tongs so that each piece can be taken out individually when done.

Rig for deep frying, heating at least three inches of oil to 375 degrees.  While waiting, sprinkle each turkey finger with salt and pepper.

Put a little flour in a brown bag.  Shake the turkey fingers in the flour, shake off the excess, and fry a few at a time until each piece is golden brown.  drain and cook another batch.  Serve hot.

I like these fried turkey fingers with mashed potatoes and green peas, along with sliced tomatoes and steamed vegetables.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Recipe By     :Jim Zumbo
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Big Game                        Elk
                Main Dish                       Venison


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  elk steak
     1/3           cup  peeled ginger root in 1/8"-thk slices
  2             medium  onions -- sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     3/4           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil - (to 3)
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch

Cut elk steaks, across the grain, into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Layer venison, sliced onions, garlic, and 1/4 cup ginger root in glass bowl.  Combine soy sauce and sugar, and pour liquid over meat.  Cover and refrigerate 45 minutes to one hour.

Heat oil and cook 5 to 6 slices of ginger root until browned and flavor is released into the oil.  Remove and discard these ginger slices.

Drain the majority of soy sauce from the meat-and-onion marinade.  Add meat, onions, garlic, and ginger slices to oil in skillet.  SautÈ 2 to 3 minutes, then sprinkle cornstarch over meat and stir.  Continue cooking until meat is completely cooked.  Add additional soy sauce to taste.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Taste the soy sauce.  Brands vary, and if the soy sauce is very salty, reduce the marinating time to 30 minutes.  The ginger root is cut in 1/8-inch slices so that it can be easily removed before serving by those who find it too pungent.  You may want to reduce the amount and dice it, or keep it as is if you love the flavor as I do.

Description:
  "This is my all-time favorite recipe, originally developed for
  extra-gamey deer.  If you want a fool proof recipe, this is it, simply
  because of the potent flavorings."

                              Good Luck Duck

Recipe By     :Scott Leysath
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Waterfowl
                Wild Duck

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried black-eyed peas
  2             quarts  water
  1                     smoked ham hocks - (to 2)
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2         tablespoon  butter
  1              large  onion -- diced
  2                     celery stalks -- diced
  2             medium  carrots -- diced
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, minced
  3               cups  diced (1/2") boned skinned duck breast
  1               dash  Worcestershire sauce
  2               cups  diced tomato -- (canned or fresh)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Tabasco sauce -- to taste

Combine peas and water in a large stockpot.  Bring to a boil and then turn off the heat and let stand for 1 hour.

Bring to a boil again, then reduce heat to simmer.  Add ham hocks and salt and cook until peas are tender.  Remove hocks, pick meat off and return meat to peas.

While peas are simmering, heat the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat and sautÈ onion, celery, carrots and jalapeÒo pepper until soft.  Add duck and brown evenly.  Season with Worcestershire sauce.  Add to peas with tomato and heat to warm.  Season with salt, pepper and Tabasco.  Good luck!

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  I don't know how it got started, but someone long ago decided that it is important to eat black-eyed peas first thing on New Year's Day.  It's supposed to bring good luck.  So here's a recipe that just might tip the scales of fortune your way this year.  For extra flavor, you may wish to throw an oven-browned duck carcass or two into the pot while the black-eyed peas are cooking.  If you want to save some time, you can use either fresh or canned black-eyed peas.  Did you know that there are over 7,000 different varieties of black-eyed peas?  Do you care?

     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon
                        === FOR THE SPLAT ===
  1                     lemon
  2                     fresh rosemary springs - (ea abt 4" long)
  1                     garlic clove -- sliced paper-thin
  2          teaspoons  finely-minced fresh red hot pepper
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Prepare the Splat:  Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Peel the zest from the lemon, using a vegetable peeler, and finely julienne.  Juice the lemon.  Combine the lemon zest and juice, rosemary, garlic, hot pepper, salt and oil in a heatproof bowl.

Start a fire in a grill.  Grill the tuna for 2 minutes on each side, until pink inside.

Serve immediately with Tomato Splat.

Description:
  "Even though the ostrich is a bird, its red meat tastes more like beef
  than chicken.  Be careful not to overcook it."

Even though the ostrich is a bird, its red meat tastes more like beef than chicken.  Be careful not to overcook it.

Categories    : Rabbit / Hare                   Small Game


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     hare -- cut serving size
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Paprika -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  minced onion
     1/2           cup  red wine
  1                can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
  1                cup  sour cream
  1               dash  Worcestershire sauce

Sprinkle serving size pieces with salt, pepper, and paprika.

In a separate container, mix red wine, cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, and minced onion.

Put the hare in a crockpot or Dutch oven and pour the sauce over it.  Cook all day at low heat.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Snowshoe and tundra hare are delicious if properly and promptly prepared -- a process that begins in the field.  Always wear gloves to gut and skin hares.  If you plan to freeze the meat, dry the pieces before wrapping.  Use a double layer of wrapping or two heavy-duty freezer bags to prevent punctures from bone ends, which can lead to freezer-burned meat.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  artichoke hearts - (14 oz) -- non marinated
  1                can  chopped green chilies - (4 oz)
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  2               cups  grated cheddar cheese
  1                cup  cleaned Dungeness crab meat - (to 2)
                        A few drops of Tabasco sauce

Chop artichokes and mix all other ingredients together.  Bake in a 350 degree oven until bubbly, or heat in a small crock pot and serve with crackers.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  June is a good month to put out a few crab rings or pots as you head for that favorite fishing spot.  And even if you don't limit out on salmon, there's no better way to end a day than sitting around the back deck with friends or family to cooking, picking and eating fresh crab.  Yummy!  If you have any leftovers (and for this appetizer you may want to set some aside), try this recipe.

  1             medium  hare -- jointed
  4             ounces  rindless bacon
  4             ounces  chopped smoked ham
  6                     shallots -- finely copped
  2              small  onions -- coarsely chopped
     5/8           cup  dry red wine
     5/8           cup  good stock
                        Juice of one seville orange
                        = (or the juice of 1/2 lemon and
                        of 1/2 a sweet orange)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground mace
     1/4      teaspoon  grated lemon peel
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  4        tablespoons  plain flour -- for thickening
  4        tablespoons  butter -- for thickening
     1/2          pint  hare's blood -- (optional)

Put the bacon, ham, shallots and onions well mixed together into a basin and add the wine, stock and orange juice, the herbs spices and the lemon peel.

Season the jointed hare with salt and pepper and put into the mixture.  Cover the basin with a foil lid.

Put the basin in a pan with enough water to reach 3/4 of the way up the sides and bring this to the boil.  Simmer on a low heat for four hours, adding more water as necessary to maintain the level.

Remove the pieces of hare and keep them warm on a serving dish.  Allow the stock to cool and then lift the fat from the top.

Thicken the sauce with butter and a little flour or use the hare's blood if you wish.  (To do this you mix it with a teaspoon of flour to prevent it curdling and stir the blood into the juices.  Heat gently -- too fast and the blood will curdle).

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  monkfish -- cut 2" steaks
                        Juice of 2 lemons
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground white pepper
  8                     fresh sage leaves
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  unseasoned bread crumbs -- more or less

Place the steaks in a shallow dish and marinate in lemon juice and pepper for at least 1 hour, but not longer then 2 hours.

Combine the sage leaves, garlic, and kosher salt in a mortar, and use a pestle to grind into a paste.

Melt the butter with the olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat.  Very slowly add the sage paste, stirring constantly.

When the paste is well integrated with the oil and butter, take the monkfish steaks from the marinade (reserve the marinade) and coat them with the breadcrumbs, pressing firmly to make sure the crumbs adhere to the fish.

Cook slowly over medium heat, turning once, until golden, 4 minutes on each side.  Place on a warm platter.

Add the marinade to the skillet and stir to incorporate with the remains of the fish.  Cook for 7 to 8 minutes over low heat to thicken it slightly into a sauce.  Pour over monkfish and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pheasant -- cut in pieces
  1           teaspoon  monosodium glutamate
     1/4           cup  flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/4           cup  sour (or sweet) cream - (to 1/2)
     1/4           cup  cooking fat
                        === OPTIONAL ===
  1                can  mushrooms - (3 1/2 oz)
  2        tablespoons  chopped onion

Mix seasonings with flour.  Dredge pieces of pheasant in seasoned flour, and, if convenient, allow them to (dry on a rack approximately 1/2 hour.

Heat 1/4-inch layer of cooking fat in skillet to 340 to 360 degrees, or until a drop of water just sizzles.  Brown the pheasant pieces evenly and slowly in the heated fat.  Avoid crowding the pieces in the skillet and turn them as necessary, using a kitchen tongs to avoid piercing the coating.

Allow 15 to 20 minutes for browning.  Remove browned pieces from the skillet and place one layer deep in a shallow casserole.  If desired, add mushrooms and chopped onion which has been browned in the fat in the skillet.  Drizzle 1 to 2 tablespoons of sour or sweet cream (or 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon milk) over each of the browned pheasant pieces in the casserole.

Bake in a 325 degree oven 45 to 60 minutes or until fork tender.  Do not cover young bird.  An older bird may be baked covered until tender, then uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes to recrisp.  If needed, turn once or twice during cooking so that the pieces cook and crisp evenly.  Add more cream if the meat gets dry.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Variations:  When pheasant pieces are evenly browned, reduce beat in skillet (about 220 degrees).  Cover and cook until fork tender (20 to 40 minutes).  Add small portions of liquid at a time, and turn as necessary for uniform cooking.  Uncover last 10 to 15 minutes to recrisp).  If desired, prepare gravy with pan drippings.  Sprinkle dehydrated onion soup generously over browning meat instead of using fresh chopped onion.

Comments:  A popular method for preparing pheasant, this recipe may be used for older birds, and the young birds, too.

  1                     young pheasant
     1/4           cup  flour

     1/4           cup  butter

Use breast and thighs only.  With a sharp knife, cut meat from each side of breast bone, making 2 steaks.  Split thigh to remove bone.  Pound steaks to even thickness.  Mix salt, pepper, oregano and basil with flour.  (Variation: substitute 1 teaspoon paprika for basil and oregano.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    wild or farm-raised quail or
                        other small game birds - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- necks removed
  3        tablespoons  Coriander-Fennel Rub -- (listed below)
                        = (or seasoning of choice)
                        Polenta -- (listed below)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              clove  garlic clove -- chopped
                        Fresh rosemary or parsley sprigs -- for garnish
                        === CORIANDER-FENNEL RUB ===
  1         tablespoon  fennel seeds
  1         tablespoon  coriander seeds
  1         tablespoon  coarse salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === POLENTA ===
  4               cups  homemade chicken stock
                        = (or reduced-sodium chicken broth)
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
     1/2           cup  semolina -- see * Note
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

* Note:  Semolina is a finely ground durum (hard wheat).  If you wish, substitute another 1/2 cup of cornmeal for the semolina.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Grease a 9- by 9-inch baking dish.

Season birds with rub.  Set aside while you prepare the polenta.  Pour polenta into baking dish.

In a large skillet, heat oil and garlic over medium-high heat.  Add birds; thoroughly brown on all sides.  Remove pan from the heat.  Let birds cool until they can be handled without burning your fingers.

Arrange quail in a circle by taking each bird and standing it upright in the polenta, breast meat facing out.  Gently push the bird down into the polenta until it can stand by itself.  Put the next bird alongside the first and repeat for the remaining quail.

Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the juices run a rosy color when a bird is poked with a fork (do not overcook).  Garnish with sprigs of fresh rosemary or parsley.

For the Coriander-Fennel Rub:  Put fennel and coriander seeds in a small pan over high heat.  Toast for 2 to 3 minutes, until seeds turn a deep golden brown.  Put seeds in a food processor fitted with a steel blade; process until finely ground.  Mixture does not have to be perfectly smooth.  Combine with salt and peeper.  Store in an airtight jar.  (Makes 1/4 cup)

For the Polenta:  Heat stock and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat until almost boiling.  Reduce the heat to a simmer.  Combine cornmeal and semolina; slowly stir into hot stock, stirring constantly with a wire whisk.  To avoid lumps, continue stirring until mixture begins to thicken, 24 to 25 minutes.  Remove from heat; stir in the cheese and butter.  Season with salt, if necessary.  For quail roasted in polenta, immediately pour polenta into the prepared baking dish.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  ground venison
  2                     yellow onions -- diced
     1/2         pound  ground beef suet
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
  1                     large can tomato sauce
  5          teaspoons  salt
  2 1/2      teaspoons  Liquid Smoke
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped small red chilies

Mix all ingredients in a non-metal bowl.  Refrigerate for 3 days, thoroughly mixing each day with hands.  On the fourth day divide mixture into 5 parts.  Knead and form into long, thin logs about 12 inches long.

Place logs on cookie sheet and bake at around 165 degrees.  (Many ovens don't show temperatures below 200 degrees.  Estimate and use your judgment.)  After 5 hours, turn logs over and cook 5 hours more.

Remove from oven and roll in paper towels to remove excess grease.  Cool, wrap in foil, and keep in refrigerator.

This recipe yields five 12-inch logs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     young pheasant
                        Salt -- as needed
  8             slices  salt pork or bacon
     1/4           cup  oil

Rub cavity of pheasant with salt.  Smoked salt may be used with bacon slices if desired.  Shape or plump bird.  Stuff with favorite dressing if desired.  Completely cover breast and all meaty portions with strips of salt pork or bacon.  Tie in place.  Place bird breast-side up on a rack in a shallow roasting pan.  Pour 1/4 cup oil over bird.

Roast in 400 degree oven.  Do not cover.  Baste with oil if necessary, and turn if necessary for even browning.  Roasting time about 50 to 60 minutes depending upon size of bird and degree of doneness desired.  Pheasant need not be well done.  Too long a cooking period should be avoided.

If dressing has been used, avoid letting it stand in bird cavity for any period of time after meat is cooked.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  This method has been developed for birds that have been skinned, as many pheasants are dressed this way.  The high oven temperature and continuous basting from the salt pork or bacon slices helps to keep the meat juicy.

                              Salmon Gravlax

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Salt Water)               Salmon
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     filleted salmon side - (2 to 4 lbs) -- skin removed
     1/4           cup  Kosher salt
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  freshly-cracked black pepper
  1              bunch  fresh herbs -- chopped
                        = (dill, tarragon, basil, parsley or mix)
  2                     lemons -- thinly sliced
  2                     limes -- thinly sliced

Combine salt, sugar and pepper and herbs.  Spread one-half of the salt, sugar and herb mixture over the bottom of a glass, plastic or ceramic baking dish.  Place the salmon side on top of the mixture.  Distribute the remaining mixture evenly over the top of the salmon.  Arrange lemon and lime slices over mixture.

Cover with a double layer of foil.  Put a board on top and about 4 pounds of cans or bricks on the board.  Leave in the refrigerator for 3 days, turning the salmon and basting with the juices twice daily.

After 3 days, pour off the juices and pat the fish gently with paper towels.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Once cured, the salmon can be refrigerated for a week or two or tightly wrapped and frozen.  Use it on salads, benedicts or as a great appetizer with some mustard sauce and crackers.  If you have ever purchased "lox-style" or gravlax salmon, you will appreciate how thinly it is sliced before packaging.  Commercial processors use a multi-bladed instrument to do the slicing.  Don't feel bad if your home version is a little rough around the edges.

Lox-style salmon is actually cold smoked, but the smoky flavor is much more subtle than traditional American hot-smoked salmon.  Gravlax is historically prepared with salt, sugar and dill.

Description:
  "Preparing this cured salmon delicacy is remarkably easy, but it takes
  a few days.  Play around with the recipe by adding your own blend of
  herbs, garlic, onions, pepper, spices and citrus fruits."

                        Breasts, thighs and legs of 2 scoters
                        = (or other seaducks)
                        Flour -- as needed
     1/8         pound  butter
  6              small  onions
  5                     carrots -- cut 1" sections
  5                     tomatoes -- peeled, diced
                        = (or canned equivilant)
  1              pinch  marjoram
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     bay leaves
  1              quart  water
  3        tablespoons  wine or cider vinegar

Remove all the orange fat along with any bloodshot areas and clotted blood from the meat.  Soak overnight in salt water.  Drain, dry, and cut pieces of duck in bite-sized chunks.

Dredge in flour and saute in butter until browned.  Add all other ingredients and cook slowly for 2 hours.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Alaska's seaducks include scoters, oldsquaws, eiders, mergansers and harlequin ducks.  Although generally less sought after than the puddle ducks, such as mallards, pintails, and teal, when properly prepared seaducks are every bit as tasty.  A bowl of "sea duck stew" will make a believer out of anyone.

Recipe By     :Marianne McNair
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3            gallons  littleneck clams in shell
                        = (abt 7 pints, canned)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Half-pint canning jars
                        Pressure canner
                        Smoker (such as a Little Chief)
                        Smoking chips

Gather about 4 gallons of littleneck clams.  Keep them in salt water for a couple of days, changing the water every day.

Place them on a grill or barbecue and cook until they open.  This tends to make your barbecue a bit messy.  Remove meat.

Or, place the clams in a large pot 1/4 full of boiling water and steam them open.  Remove meat.

The mesh, or gap, on the racks of the smoker needs to be small enough that the clams can't fall through.  Some people use stainless steel or aluminum screens.  Others simply cover the racks with aluminum foil and punch holes through it.

Place clams fairly densely on racks.  Use your favorite smoking chip (we use alder) and smoke for 1 to 2 hours.  One hour gives a very light smoke flavor.  The clams are already cooked, this step is simply to add flavor.  Do not over smoke or the clams will dry out and become chewy.

Get out the instructions for your pressure canner.  Place smoked clams in canning jars (we find 1/2-pint jars work best) and cover with a vegetable oil (we use olive oil).  Place the caps on and then pressure can according to the instructions on your canner.  Remove from canner and enjoy.  The smoked flavor of the clams intensifies as the jars age.

These clams should be moist and smoky.  They can be used as appetizers on crackers, in poultry dressings, or in soups such as split pea or clam chowder.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Caution:  Remember, Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) is always a concern whenever you eat wild harvested clams or mussels.

Description:
  "May is generally considered the last best chance to gather clams, and
  the first week of the month has some great clamming tides."

<DirS>
<DirT>
Gather about 4 gallons of littleneck clams.  Keep them in salt water for a couple of days, changing the water every day.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place them on a grill or barbecue and cook until they open.  This tends to make your barbecue a bit messy.  Remove meat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Or, place the clams in a large pot 1/4 full of boiling water and steam them open.  Remove meat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
The mesh, or gap, on the racks of the smoker needs to be small enough that the clams can&apos;t fall through.  Some people use stainless steel or aluminum screens.  Others simply cover the racks with aluminum foil and punch holes through it.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place clams fairly densely on racks.  Use your favorite smoking chip (we use alder) and smoke for 1 to 2 hours.  One hour gives a very light smoke flavor.  The clams are already cooked, this step is simply to add flavor.  Do not over smoke or the clams will dry out and become chewy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Get out the instructions for your pressure canner.  Place smoked clams in canning jars (we find 1/2-pint jars work best) and cover with a vegetable oil (we use olive oil).  Place the caps on and then pressure can according to the instructions on your canner.  Remove from canner and enjoy.  The smoked flavor of the clams intensifies as the jars age.
</DirT>
<DirT>
These clams should be moist and smoky.  They can be used as appetizers on crackers, in poultry dressings, or in soups such as split pea or clam chowder.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields ?? servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Caution:  Remember, Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) is always a concern whenever you eat wild harvested clams or mussels.
</DirT>
</DirS>
<Desc>
May is generally considered the last best chance to gather clams, and the first week of the month has some great clamming tides.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  venison/elk
  1                cup  finely-chopped fresh onion
     1/4    tablespoon  minced fresh garlic

  1 1/2           cups  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  mustard
  1                cup  molasses
  3        tablespoons  freshly-ground blach pepper
  3        tablespoons  really-hot hot sauce

Mix all the ingredients and let stand for 2 hours stirring occasionally.  Then add venison/elk.  Let marinate for 2 to 3 days.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Grouse breasts -- skinned, cleaned
                        Butter -- as needed
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Several garlic cloves -- to taste
  1                cup  sherry wine
  1                cup  chicken broth
                        Mushrooms -- fresh or canned
                        Fresh lemon slices
                        Chopped fresh or dried parsley

Brown the grouse in butter and olive oil.  Transfer to casserole.

In remaining fat, saute mushrooms and several cloves of garlic.  Deglaze pan with sherry and chicken broth; pour over grouse breasts.  Cover with the mushrooms, lemon slices, a handful of parsley.

Cover the casserole and bake in a 300 degree oven for 3 hours, adding more broth or wine if necessary.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  Alaska boasts four species of grouse  --  sharp-tailed, blue, ruffed and spruce.  The hunting season for all of these upland gamebirds stretches from August through March, or later in some parts of the state.  The fall, however, is when most grouse are harvested for food or sport.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5            gallons  pure water
  3             pounds  unsulphured molasses - (to 6)
  1            package  yeast
  1              quart  Sitka or white spruce needles or tips

Boil about one gallon of water for at least 30 minutes, then steep the needles or tips for about half an hour.  Drain out the needles and add 3 to 6 pounds of unsulphured molasses to the spruce-flavored water, depending on taste.  (Optional: Adding 3 pounds of Blue Ribbon hop-flavored malt at this point will improve the taste but is not part of the original recipe.)

Add water to make 5 gallons.  Cool the mixture to about 70 degrees and add yeast.  Keep the mixture at about 70 degrees for several days, then move it to a cooler spot (about 50 degrees ) until fermentation stops.  The process will take 10 to 14 days, sometimes longer.

When fermentation ceases, the beer is ready to bottle or drink, but will improve if it is allowed to age in the bottle.  (Note: The alcohol content varies between 6 and 9 percent, depending on the amount of molasses.)

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  shoulder roast
  1                cup  rice
  2        tablespoons  fat
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1                     green pepper -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  quartered (or canned) tomatoes
  1           teaspoon  salt

Bone shoulder to make a pocket for the stuffing.

Cook rice in boiling salted water.

Melt fat in heavy pan or skillet, add bay leaves, chopped onion and green pepper.  Cook slowly until tender.  Remove the bay leaves.  Add tomatoes and salt, cook 5 minutes more.  Mix rice and tomatoes together.

Fill the pocket with rice mixture, fasten with skewers, place on rack with the fat side up and roast in a slow oven (325 degrees ) for 2 1/2 hours.  Do not cover.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  In most of Alaska, Dall sheep season opens on the 10th of August, and wild sheep offer some of the finest game meat you'll ever eat.  Don't forget the B-B-Q sauce when you head out for that fall hunt.  Barbeque those sheep ribs in camp over an open fire, and make your hunt even more memorable.

Did you know that... A roast should not be cooked cold.  Let the meat stand for at least an hour at room temperature.  Brush with oil before and during roasting and the juices will be sealed in.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     set wild turkey giblets -- see * Note
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  1                     celery rib -- chopped
  1                     hard-boiled egg -- chopped
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/4           cup  flour
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Water -- as needed

* Note:  Wild turkey giblets make a very good gravy.  When field-dressing the bird, remove the liver, gizzard, and heart, throwing out any damaged parts.  Split the gizzard and turn it inside out, removing the contents.  Include the feet, neck, head and wing tips along with the giblets.

Wash the giblets; set the liver aside.  Put the rest into a pot, cover with water, and simmer for one hour, or until the gizzard is tender.  Add a little water from time to time, just enough to keep the giblets covered, and add the liver 15 minutes before the end of the cooking time.

Remove the giblets, discarding the feet and wing tips.  Pull the meat from the rest and chop it, along with the brains.  Return the copped meats back to the pot.  Bring to a new boil, cover, reduce the heat to very low, and simmer for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, mix the flour with a little water, making a paste.  Heat the butter in a large skillet.  SautÈ the onion, celery, and parsley for five minutes, then slowly stir in the flour paste with a wooden spoon.  Slowly stir in the broth.  Add the chopped giblets.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Cook and stir until the gravy is the consistency you like, adding more water if needed.  Stir in the chopped egg.

Serve hot in a gravy boat, along with fired or baked turkey, dressing, and all the trimmings.  Save leftover gravy for serving over rice, mashed potatoes, or biscuit halves.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                     red onion -- diced
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  4        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  3               cups  red wine
  4        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  4        tablespoons  tomato paste
  4               cups  low-sodium chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne peper
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  canola oil
  1                cup  diced bacon
  2             pounds  venison stew meat -- trimmed, and
                        finely diced
  2               cups  cooked black beans

In a large pot over medium heat, melt the butter and saute the onions and garlic, stirring occasionally, until soft, 3 to 4 minutes.  Stir in the brown sugar and cook until onions and garlic brown slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the red wine, vinegar, tomato paste and chicken stock along with the cumin, cayenne, chili powder, cilantro and salt.  Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, 30 to 35 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a large fry pan over high heat, warm the oil and fry the bacon until it browns, 2 to 3 minutes.  Push bacon to the side of the pan, add the venison and season with salt.  Brown the meat, stirring occasionally, until any liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes.  Add black beans and toss mixture together.

Transfer the meat and bean mixture to sauce and stir.  Bring to a simmer and cook until the chili has thickened, about 20 minutes.  Check seasoning and adjust as needed.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                Shad

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              whole  shad - (4 to 5 lbs) -- cleaned, scaled
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  onion -- sliced
  3              large  baking potatoes -- peeled, sliced thin
  2                     bay leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme - (to 3)
                        = (or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme)
  5             slices  thick-sliced bacon - (to 6)
                        = (enough to wrap the fish completely)
  4               cups  milk
  2               cups  chicken stock

Preheat oven to 275 degrees.

Rinse the fish well inside and out and dry it with paper towels.  Season it with salt and freshly ground pepper.

In a flameproof baking pan large enough to hold the fish, make a bed of the sliced onion and potatoes, the thyme and the bay leaves.  Season with salt and pepper.

Wrap the fish in the bacon slices and lay it on the vegetables.  Pour in the milk and chicken stock.

Using 2 or 3 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil, cover the pan completely, tucking the foil tightly around the edges of the pan so no seam can escape.  Put the pan over a burner on the stove and bring the liquid to a boil.  If you see any steam escaping from the pan, tighten the seal, using additional foil if necessary, until no steam escapes.

Place the pan in the oven and let the fish bake for 6 to 7 hours.  Using a large serving spoon, cut the fish into serving pieces.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  stew meat -- cut 1" cubes
  3        tablespoons  flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
  3        tablespoons  cooking oil
  2               cups  apple cider or apple juice
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice - (to 2)
  3                     potatoes -- peeled, quartered
  4                     carrots quartered
  2                     onions sliced
  1              stalk  celery sliced

Dredge meat in mixture of flour, salt, pepper, thyme.  In 4 1/2-quart Dutch oven, brown the meat, half at a time, in the hot oil.  Drain off all the fat.  Return all the meat to the Dutch oven.

Stir in apple cider or apple juice and lemon and 1/2 cup water; cook and stir until mixture boils.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer about 1 1/4 hours or until meat is nearly tender.

Stir in vegetables.  Cook 30 minutes more or until vegetables are done.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  February is a good time to clean out the freezer.  A piece of deer, caribou, sheep, moose, bear -- even rabbits, ground squirrels, or most any critter -- can be cut up for stew meat.  While winter rages outside, follow this recipe for a savory reminder of last fall's hunt.

  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  4                     boned trout -- skin on, and
                        the heads removed

Light grill, using plenty of charcoal.  If using firewood, add it, and let wood and charcoal burn for about an hour, or until most of the firewood is burned up.  If using wood chips, soak them at least 20 minutes; then, add to the coals after they are completely gray.  Let chips burn for 10 minutes.  Move charcoal and wood to one side of grill for indirect grilling.

Meanwhile, prepare vinaigrette.  In a blender, puree chervill, parsley, shallot, lemon juice, and vinegar with 1/2 cup olive oil.  Transfer mixture to a small bowl, and stir in remaining oil, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste.

Sprinkle inside of trout with remaining salt and pepper to taste.  Spoon about half of the vinaigrette on trout, inside and out.  Rub vinaigrette into fish.  Cover trout, and refrigerate for 15 to 30 minutes.

Spray one side of a 15 inch-square piece of foil with cooking spray.  Cover the side of grill that has no charcoal underneath with the foil, sprayed-side up.  Place fish on foil, and cover grill.  Check fish after 10 minutes.  (It does not have to be turned.)  It's done when flesh is opaque and skin is crisp.  Serve immediately, with remaining vinaigrette as sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Description:
  "We don't live in Alaska so we can stay indoors.  June is a great time
  to get out and get a boat  --  for some halibut fishing.  But even if
  you buy your halibut at the local market, get outdoors and stoke up
  the grill for a real treat."
