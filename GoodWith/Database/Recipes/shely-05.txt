  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fresh fennel bulb - (abt 1 lb)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2              small  garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     strip orange rind - (1" long)
     1/2      teaspoon  dry fennel seeds
     1/4           cup  anise flavored liquor such as Pernod
  1                cup  chopped peeled seeded chopped tomato
                        = (if using fresh; will need 3/4 lb)
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless skinless bluefish fillets
  1              small  yellow bell pepper -- seeded, and cut
                        into 1/4" dice for garnish
                        Snipped chives for garnish -- (optional)

Discard the feathery green tops of the fennel, core and cut the bulb into 1-inch pieces.  Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 9-inch skillet.  Add the fennel, garlic, orange rind, fennel seeds, liquor, salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer, over medium heat for 10 minutes.

After 10 minutes add the tomatoes, recover and simmer for 10 minutes longer.  Remove the cover and check the liquid in the pan.  If there is a good deal remaining, evaporate it until the mixture look syrupy.  Remove the orange rind.  Turn the heat off and stir in the butter.  Season to taste with salt and pepper; cool to room temperature.

Season the bluefish fillets with salt and pepper, and set them, skin-side down in a generously buttered baking/serving dish large enough to hold the fillets in a single layer.  Spoon the cooled vegetable mixture over the fish, cover with foil and store in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours.

To bake and serve, remove the fish from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and bake 20 to 25 minutes covered with foil until the center no longer looks translucent but opaque.  Remove from oven and serve; garnish with yellow bell pepper and chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Discard the feathery green tops of the fennel, core and cut the bulb into 1-inch pieces.  Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 9-inch skillet.  Add the fennel, garlic, orange rind, fennel seeds, liquor, salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer, over medium heat for 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
After 10 minutes add the tomatoes, recover and simmer for 10 minutes longer.  Remove the cover and check the liquid in the pan.  If there is a good deal remaining, evaporate it until the mixture look syrupy.  Remove the orange rind.  Turn the heat off and stir in the butter.  Season to taste with salt and pepper; cool to room temperature.

Season the bluefish fillets with salt and pepper, and set them, skin-side down in a generously buttered baking/serving dish large enough to hold the fillets in a single layer.  Spoon the cooled vegetable mixture over the fish, cover with foil and store in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To bake and serve, remove the fish from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and bake 20 to 25 minutes covered with foil until the center no longer looks translucent but opaque.  Remove from oven and serve; garnish with yellow bell pepper and chives.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     portions washed salad greens, like mesclun
                        with vinaigrette
                        = (or 2 Granny Smith apples, cored and
                        cut into wafer thin rounds)
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
     1/4           cup  flour
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  1 1/2           cups  fresh white bread crumbs
  8                     disks of fresh goat's cheese
                        = (each 1 1/2" round by 1/2" thk)

Prepare dinner plates with a bed of dressed mesclun salad or apple slices.

In a deep pot, slowly heat to 350 degrees enough vegetable oil to completely submerge the disks when deep fried.  While this is heating up, set flour, egg and bread crumbs in a 3 separate shallow plates; dip each disk of cheese in flour, then in beaten egg and finally in fresh bread crumbs, making sure breading completely adheres to all surfaces leaving no cheese exposed.

With a slotted spoon or skimmer, lower the breaded cheese into the oil.  Do not overcrowd or the temperature of the oil will be lowered considerably and the cheese will be greasy.  Fry for 45 seconds only or until the crust is deep golden brown.  Briefly drain on absorbent towels and serve immediately on garnished plates.

Variations:  You can marinate the goats' cheese first in a mixture of olive oil, crushed black peppercorns, herbs and garlic.  Pat dry before breading.

Mix some ground pecans or walnuts with bread crumbs.

Before breading, sandwich an anchovy fillet or chopped canned green chilies between two 1/4-inch rounds of mozzarella.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  rotelle
                        = (or other short shaped pasta)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     3/4         pound  chorizo -- thinly sliced
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
     1/2         pound  fresh mushrooms -- stemmed, and
                        caps thinly sliced
  2                     red bell peppers -- julienned very thin

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  buttermilk -- plus more if needed
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  minced red bell pepper
  1            package  frozen corn kernels - (10 oz) -- thawed
  2                     eggs -- separated
  1                     scallion -- finely sliced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Blend the cup of buttermilk and corn oil together.  Add the cornmeal and steep it to soften for 15 minutes while you get all the other ingredients together.

Meanwhile sift the flour with the baking powder, baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

Combine the bell pepper, with corn kernels, egg yolks and scallion and season with freshly ground black pepper.

Right before you begin to make the pancakes, combine the buttermilk and cornmeal mixture with the bell pepper, corn and scallion mixture and stir well.

Whip the egg whites until stiff but not dry.  Preheat the griddle.  With a few swift strokes fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients (add more buttermilk if needed) and fold in the egg whites.  Drop about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Serve with ham steaks.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Michele Urvater
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped (1 cu
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  2               cups  chicken broth
  4               cups  water
  1                     large bunch fresh cilantro -- rinsed
  1            package  frozen corn kernels - (10 oz) -- thawed
  1                can  black beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  1         tablespoon  lime juice - (to 2)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  sour cream, regular or low fat - (optional
  2        tablespoons  pimento -- cut thin strips

Heat olive oil in a saucepan.  When hot, add the onion, cover and cook over low heat for 5 minutes or until tender.  Add the garlic and cumin and saute for 10 seconds to release their aroma.  Add the broth and water and bring to a simmer.

While the liquid is coming to a simmer, with a knife separate the cilantro leaves from the stems.  If you wish, wrap the stems well with string and add to the broth to infuse the liquid with more cilantro flavor.  When the liquid is at a simmer, add the corn and beans and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes just to heat the ingredients well.

Meanwhile chop the cilantro leaves (you need anywhere from 1/2 to 1 cup of chopped leaves).  Add the cilantro leaves and immediately remove the soup from the heat.  Discard the cilantro stems.  Add the lime juice and season to taste with salt and cayenne pepper.  Ladle the soup out and garnish each portion with sour cream and garnish the sour cream with pimento.

Variation:  to turn this into a main course soup, add 12 ounces of strips of raw chicken when you add the beans and corn.  Or add 12 ounces chopped cleaned shrimp after you have added the beans and corn and cook for 2 minutes to cook through.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Heat olive oil in a saucepan.  When hot, add the onion, cover and cook over low heat for 5 minutes or until tender.  Add the garlic and cumin and saute for 10 seconds to release their aroma.  Add the broth and water and bring to a simmer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the liquid is coming to a simmer, with a knife separate the cilantro leaves from the stems.  If you wish, wrap the stems well with string and add to the broth to infuse the liquid with more cilantro flavor.  When the liquid is at a simmer, add the corn and beans and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes just to heat the ingredients well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile chop the cilantro leaves (you need anywhere from 1/2 to 1 cup of chopped leaves).  Add the cilantro leaves and immediately remove the soup from the heat.  Discard the cilantro stems.  Add the lime juice and season to taste with salt and cayenne pepper.  Ladle the soup out and garnish each portion with sour cream and garnish the sour cream with pimento.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Variation:  to turn this into a main course soup, add 12 ounces of strips of raw chicken when you add the beans and corn.  Or add 12 ounces chopped cleaned shrimp after you have added the beans and corn and cook for 2 minutes to cook through.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     kirby cucumbers - (to 6) -- peeled
                        = (or a seedless cucumber)
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped mint - (to 2)

Run a good vegetable peeler down the sides of the cucumber, lengthwise to create long thin strips; keep on turning the cucumber; you'll be left with an inner core which is basically seeds and which you should discard.

Heat the cucumber curls in the melted butter for 30 seconds to a minute.  Remove from heat.  Season with salt and pepper; dust with mint.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             pounds  short ribs
                        = (have butcher cut them into
                        serving sized pieces)
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cups  red wine
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated ginger
  2                     bay leaves
  6        tablespoons  molasses
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
                        === VEGETABLES ===
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  flour
  1                cup  finely-diced onion
     1/2           cup  finely-diced celery
     1/2           cup  finely-diced carrots
     1/2           cup  finely-diced turnips
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
  2               cups  beef broth
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === COATING ===
     1/2           cup  prepared chili sauce
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  white horseradish
     1/2           cup  dry white bread crumbs

Place short ribs in non-corrodible vessel.  Combine ingredients for marinade and pour over ribs; marinate, covered, for 24 hours in the refrigerator, turning them once.  Remove from marinade; pat dry and reserve marinade for later.

Heat oil in an 8-quart casserole, wide enough to accommodate the ribs in a single layer.  While the oil is heating up, dredge short ribs in flour and shake off excess.  Sear them for 5 minutes a side or until they are golden brown all over.  Remove them to a plate.

In the remaining oil saute the onions, celery, carrots, and turnips for 10 minutes, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon.  Add the chili powder, tomato paste, broth and reserved marinade and boil, over medium heat for 5 minutes or until slightly reduced.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Return the short ribs to the casserole and cover.  Braise over low heat for 1 hour and 45 minutes or until fork tender.  Remove the short ribs from the sauce and place them on a large baking pan.  Strain the sauce, through a sieve into a medium saucepan.  Skim off the fat, season to taste with salt and pepper and keep warm, over low heat.  Reheat ribs in sauce.

Second time around:  Preheat the broiler.  Combine all the coating ingredients and spread them over the short ribs.  Broil short ribs, 4 inches away from heat source, for 3 to 4 minutes or until lightly browned.  Serve immediately with sauce.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                           Exotic Lamb Burgers

Recipe By     :Michele Urvater
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  ground lamb
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon - (to 1/2)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  soft fresh goat's cheese
                        = (or cream cheese if for kids)
  2        tablespoons  chopped chives
                        Roughly-chopped fresh mint or cilantro -- for garnish
                        Finely-minced hot jalapeÒo pepper -- (optional)

In a mixing bowl combine the ground lamb with the cinnamon and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Saute a bit of the mixture to taste if seasoning is right or not.

Mix the goat's cheese with the chives.

Divide the lamb into 4 portions and shape each one into a patty.  Press your thumb in the center to create a pocket in the burger.  Take about a tablespoonful of the cheese mixture and set it in the indentation.  Enclose the lamb patty around the cheese to enclose it completely.  Either grill, broil or saute them for about 4 minutes a side.

To serve, spread some cole slaw in the center of a dinner plate and spread around.  Center lamb over cole slaw and dust top with mint or cilantro and jalapeÒo pepper, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  small zucchini -- trimmed, washed,
                        and grated coarsely
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  5              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/2           cup  milk
     3/4         pound  feta cheese -- crumbled pea-sized
     1/4           cup  chopped Italian parsley
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill
     1/4           cup  toasted bread crumbs
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Melted butter - (abt 1/4 lb) -- for brushing phyllo
     3/4         pound  phyllo leaves

Set zucchini in a colander, sprinkle with salt and drain for 1 hour.  Squeeze out excess moisture from zucchini then cook it for a few minutes in olive oil.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside to cool slightly.

In a mixing bowl combine the eggs with the milk, feta cheese, parsley, dill, and bread crumbs.  Add the cooked zucchini and adjust the seasoning, using lots of pepper.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 9- by 13-inch deep baking pan.  Layer a sheet of phyllo so that it overlaps baking pan and extends beyond the rim.  Brush the sheet very lightly with melted butter and cover with another phyllo sheet.  Continue this way until half of the phyllo has been used.

Add the zucchini and spread it out evenly.  Fold overhanging phyllo up over the squash filling and brush with melted butter.  Lay remaining phyllo leaves on top, again brushing melted butter between the layers.

Brush top well with butter, score top layers with a sharp knife and bake for an hour.  Cool and serve with a green salad or a vegetable salad of green beans, tomatoes and olives.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Recipe By     :Michele Urvater
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     leeks, white and green parts -- cleaned, sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/2        medium  cabbage -- shredded finely
  6               cups  water or homemade chicken broth
  2                     zucchini -- trimmed, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/2" half-moons
     1/2         pound  green beans -- cut 1" lengths
                        = (or "haricots verts" cut in half)
     1/2           cup  orzo
                        = (or other small shaped pasta)
  1            package  frozen "petite" peas - (10 oz) -- thawed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped mint
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives
  1         tablespoon  chiffonade of basil
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Freshly-grated Parmesan or Romano cheese
                        Pesto or other herb paste

In a large soup pot, heat the vegetable oil.  Add the leeks, cover and cook for a couple of minutes until they begin to soften.  Add the garlic and cabbage, 1 cup of the water, cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the cabbage has wilted.  Add the remaining water, zucchini and green beans, cover and simmer for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are somewhat tender.

Add the pasta, cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until the pasta is tender.  (At this point check the level of liquid; if the soup seems somewhat thick, just add more water to bring the level of the liquid back up to where it was at the beginning of cooking time.)

Add the peas and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes to heat through.  Season carefully with salt and pepper.  Remove the soup from the heat and stir in the fresh herbs.  Serve with 1 or 2 of the garnishes, according to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Add the pasta, cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until the pasta is tender.  (At this point check the level of liquid; if the soup seems somewhat thick, just add more water to bring the level of the liquid back up to where it was at the beginning of cooking time.)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs -- beaten lightly
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

                        leaves, dill, tarragon or cilantro

In a food processor combine the flour, salt, eggs, oil and 1/4 cup water; process until dough begins to form a ball.  Add more water, only if needed, 1 teaspoon at a time.  Process 30 seconds more to knead.  Remove dough from processor and rest, covered with inverted bowl, at room temperature for 1 hour.

Divide dough into 4 pieces.  Set rollers of pasta machine at widest setting.  Flatten 1 piece of dough into a rectangle (cover other pieces with inverted bowl).  Lightly dust rectangle with flour and feed through rollers.  Fold rectangle in half and feed through rollers 6 to 8 more times, folding in half each time and dusting lightly with flour to keep it from sticking to machine.  Turn dial down one notch and feed the dough to last setting.  Repeat with other 3 pieces.

Cut sheets of dough into equal lengths.  Cover surface of one sheet with fresh herb leaves (stems removed).  Top with second dough sheet.  With lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough sheets to seal.  With pastry wheel or knife, cut dough into large shapes and dust very lightly with flour.  Transfer to parchment lined baking sheet and dry slightly.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        recipe  Herb Pasta Dough -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  sea scallops
                        Flour -- for dredging
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  softened unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
     1/2           cup  Sercial Madeira
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
                        Fresh lemon juice -- to taste
                        Sweet paprika -- to taste
                        Herb sprigs for garnish -- if desired

Transfer pasta dough to floured baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap.

Dredge scallops in flour, shaking off excess, and season with salt and pepper.  In skillet set over moderately-high heat melt 1 tablespoon of the butter with the oil and heat until hot.  Add the scallops and saute until golden and just firm.

Transfer to a plate, add the shallots to the skillet and cook 1 minute.  Add the Madeira and reduce by half.  Add the cream and reduce until lightly thickened.  Stir in mustard, lemon juice, paprika and salt and pepper to taste.

In a saucepan of boiling salted water cook the pasta shapes until "al dente", drain and toss with remaining butter.

Add scallops to sauce and simmer until heated through.  Spoon scallop mixture onto serving plates, mounding it in the center of the plate, and drape the pasta shapes over.  Garnish with the herb sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  oregano
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2         pound  ground lean beef
  3               cups  spaghetti sauce
  1                can  chopped green chilies - (4 oz)
     1/4           cup  salsa - (to 1/2)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  5                     instant lasagne sheets - (to 6)

  1                cup  shredded Monterey Jack cheese
                        = (or sharp cheddar cheese)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a skillet heat the olive oil.  Saute the onion for 5 minutes or until tender, then add the garlic, spices, herbs and ground beef and saute until the meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.  Remove to a bowl and add the spaghetti sauce, green chilies and salsa and season well to taste with salt and pepper.

Soak the lasagne sheets in hot water.  As they soften remove them from the bowl and pat them dry.

Spoon 1/2 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9-inch square baking pan and top with a sheet of lasagne.  Spread the pasta with dabs of ricotta and some meat sauce.  Sprinkle with some Monterey Jack cheese.  Repeat the layering until you have used all the ingredients, ending with a sheet of lasagne, completely covered with the sauce (even the corners).

Bake, covered, for 30 minutes.  Uncover and bake for 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the oven and let the lasagne set for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

     1/4           cup  olive oil

  4                     green onions -- trimmed, and
                        thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  finely-sliced pitted oil cured olives
  1                cup  finely-chopped marinated artichoke hearts
                        Crushed red pepper flakes -- to taste
  8                     flour tortillas
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        Vegetable oil -- to cook the quesadil
     1/4           cup  toasted pine nuts

In a mixing bowl combine the tomatoes, basil, olive oil and season to taste with balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.

In a mixing bowl combine the mozzarella cheese, ricotta, green onion, olives and artichoke hearts; season with salt and crushed red pepper flakes.

Spread some mixture on one half of each tortilla, leaving about 1/4-inch between the filling and the edge of the tortilla.  Fold each tortilla in half.  Fry the tortillas in a little bit of vegetable oil for about a minute a side until golden and cheese has melted; keep warm in low oven until ready to serve.  Top with tomatoes and basil and pine nuts.

Alternate way to do is to preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Spread stuffing over entire surface of tortillas without folding them.  Set them on a baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes or until cheese has melted.  Fold over and serve with topping.

Especially good for children:  Set aside some plain mozzarella mixed with ricotta and fill the kids tortillas with this rather than the more elaborate filling.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Top with tomatoes and basil and pine nuts.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Alternate way to do is to preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Spread stuffing over entire surface of tortillas without folding them.  Set them on a baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes or until cheese has melted.  Fold over and serve with topping.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Especially good for children:  Set aside some plain mozzarella mixed with ricotta and fill the kids tortillas with this rather than the more elaborate filling.

                              Lemon Pudding

Recipe By     :Michele Urvater
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  4              large  eggs -- separated
  1 1/4           cups  milk
  1              pinch  salt
     1/3           cup  flour
                        Grated zest of 1 lemon
     1/2           cup  lemon juice

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter a 2-quart shallow dish such as 9-inch square baking pan and set aside.

Beat the butter until soft then gradually add the sugar, beating until well blended.  Beat in the yolks one at a time, then add the milk, salt, flour, lemon zest and juice and beat to mix thoroughly.  (Don't worry if the mixture looks curdled).

Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they form soft peaks.  Then lighten the lemon egg mixture with 1/4 of the beaten egg whites, then fold the remaining egg whites into this lightened batter.

Turn this mixture into the prepared baking pan and set it in a larger baking pan.  Pour in enough boiling water to come half way up the sides of the baking dish with the pudding and bake for 50 minutes to an hour.

The custard will separate into a soft custard-like mixture on the bottom and a cakier spongy like texture on the top.  (If the top begins to brown after 35 minutes of baking loosely cover the top with buttered foil.)

Serve warm or chilled with or without whipped cream.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  celery seed
  1           teaspoon  cumin seed
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  1                cup  plain yogurt
  1                cup  seeded cucumbers in 3/4" half-moons

Whisk in the sugar and yogurt.  Add the cucumbers and cabbage and toss well to combine.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Right before serving, give the cole slaw a toss, taste and season with salt and a dash of cayenne pepper.  If it does not taste "tangy" enough, add drops of white wine vinegar and keep on tasting.

Cut off stem and with a sharp knife trim the base so artichokes sit flat.  Make a cut across the top of the leaves, parallel to the base.  With scissors, trim the leaves so they have straight edges.

To cook conventionally, bring a large shallow pan of salted water to a boil.  Submerge artichokes, cover tops with a heat-proof heavy plate to keep them submerged and cook for 35 to 45 minutes or until a leaf in middle can be pulled out easily.  Drain them upside down so water runs out.

To cook in microwave, wrap each one individually in microwavable plastic wrap and set them in a round plate.  Microwave for 10 minutes or until a center leaf can be pulled out easily.  Remove plastic wrap (carefully; it will be hot).

Serve as is, with each person pulling out a leaf and dipping it in melted butter, or remove cone of inner leaves in one fell swoop and reserve them for later.  With a small spoon scoop out choke.  Replace cone of leaves, upside down and serve with melted butter seasoned with lemon or vinaigrette.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  1             ounces  unsweetened chocolate
     1/4           cup  milk
  2                     egg yolks
  3                     egg whites
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sugar
  4                     ramekins - (1/2-cup capacity) -- buttered, and
                        dusted with additional granulated sugar

Whip cream with confectioners' sugar and refrigerate.  Drain raspberries from their syrup and puree until smooth in food processor; force them through a sieve to remove seeds and fold puree into whipped cream; refrigerate.

In a saucepan, melt 2 kinds of chocolate and milk over very low heat, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl; cool slightly.  Whisk egg yolks into chocolate, one at a time, working fast so that they do not curdle.

Beat egg whites to soft peak stage.  Add sugar and beat until stiff but not dry.  Fold a quarter of whites into chocolate mixture to lighten it and fold lightened mix back into whites.  Spoon into ramekins and bake for 10 to 12 minutes; molten puffs should remain moist in center.

To serve: bring them to the table; break each one open with a spoon and add raspberry cream in the center of each puff.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Michele Urvater
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  flour -- measured after sifti
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  melted butter
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten, plus
  1                     egg yolk
  1                cup  milk -- plus
  2        tablespoons  milk

Resift flour with sugar, baking powder and 3/4 teaspoon of salt.  Combine melted butter, egg and yolk and whisk in milk.  Preheat the griddle.

With a few swift strokes fold the wet ingredients into the dry ones.  Do not overmix; keep the batter lumpy so they will turn out light.

Cook the pancakes on the griddle, using a scant 1/4 cup for each pancake.  Turn them over when bubbles form over the entire surface of the pancake and cook for a few minutes on the other side.

Serve hot with maple syrup.  For dinner, serve hot with a saute of apples and raisins and along with either slices of bacon or topped with cottage or ricotta cheese.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     boneless pork loin cutlets -- trimmed of fat,
                        and no more than 1/2" thick
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  green olive paste
  1         tablespoon  lime or lemon juice
  1                cup  dry bread crumbs -- or more if needed
  2                     eggs -- lightly beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water
                        Vegetable oil -- as needed

Lightly pound pork cutlets between plastic wrap to thin them out and season with salt and pepper.  Mix the green olive paste with lime juice and spread each cutlet with some of this mixture.  Dip the slices on both sides in bread crumbs, then in egg and in bread crumbs again, making sure all sides are well coated.

With the dull edge of a chef's knife, score the coating in a criss cross pattern and let the slices stand, on a rack, at room temperature for 30 minutes to an hour to let coating set up.  (While this is setting up, make your "Carrot Puree With Vanilla" side dish, see recipe.)

In a deep skillet heat 1-inch of vegetable oil to 375 degrees.  Deep fry cutlets, olive coated side up, for 2 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through.  Remove the meat with a spatula and drain on paper towels.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  vermicelli noodles
  1                     small piece sharp white cheddar cheese (ab
  1                     small piece brie cheese (abt 1/4 cup diced
  1         tablespoon  dry white wine - (to 2)
     1/2           cup  ricotta cheese
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Finely-sliced fresh chives or scallion
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil, add noodles and cook until done about 6 to 7 minutes or according to package directions.  Meanwhile, finely dice your cheddar and brie into 1/4-inch cubes.  Combine the cheeses with the white wine and ricotta in the top of a double boiler or in a microwave proof container that is large enough to accommodate the cooked pasta.  If you are using a double boiler, melt the cheese while the pasta is cooking, if you are using a microwave you can wait until the pasta is done.

When the pasta is done, drain, pat dry, and toss it with the melted cheese.  Or if you are using a microwave oven, heat the cheese for 1 minute.  Whisk it vigorously and return it to the microwave for 20 seconds.  Add the drained pasta to the melted cheese, right in the microwave dish, and toss.  Season with lots of freshly ground pepper and scallion.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

                  Pasta With Saffron Shrimp And Scallops

Recipe By     :Michele Urvater
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta
                Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  butter
  4        tablespoons  finely-minced shallots
  1              large  carrot -- finely minced
  1                     celery stalk -- finely minced
  1           teaspoon  saffron -- dissolved in
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  fish stock
                        = (or 1/4 cup clam juice mixed
                        with 3/4 cup chicken broth)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8             ounces  peeled deveined shrimp -- cut 1" pieces
  8             ounces  scallops -- foot removed, and
                        sliced horizontally
  1              pound  tomatoes -- seeded, diced fine
  1              pound  black fettucine
  1                cup  thawed frozen petite peas -- warmed in microwave

The day before the party, make the base for the pasta seafood topping.  Melt the butter in a skillet.  When the foaming subsides, add the shallots, carrot and celery.  Cover and cook over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes or until very tender and almost dissolved in butter.  (If at any time the vegetables begin to stick to the skillet, add a tablespoonful of water or wine.)

Uncover the skillet, add the saffron and white wine and boil over high heat until almost all of the wine has evaporated.  Add the fish stock and simmer for 5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper (do in advance up to this point.)

Boil the pasta until al dente.  While this is cooking, add the heavy cream to the skillet and simmer again until the sauce is slightly thickened.  Add the shrimp and scallops and simmer just until the seafood is cooked through.  Add the tomatoes and simmer just for a minute to warm them through without really cooking them.  Adjust the seasoning.

Drain the pasta and portion it out among 6 warm pasta bowls.  Ladle the saffron seafood sauce over the top and garnish with warm microwaved peas.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

The day before the party, make the base for the pasta seafood topping.  Melt the butter in a skillet.  When the foaming subsides, add the shallots, carrot and celery.  Cover and cook over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes or until very tender and almost dissolved in butter.  (If at any time the vegetables begin to stick to the skillet, add a tablespoonful of water or wine.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Uncover the skillet, add the saffron and white wine and boil over high heat until almost all of the wine has evaporated.  Add the fish stock and simmer for 5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper (do in advance up to this point.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Boil the pasta until al dente.  While this is cooking, add the heavy cream to the skillet and simmer again until the sauce is slightly thickened.  Add the shrimp and scallops and simmer just until the seafood is cooked through.  Add the tomatoes and simmer just for a minute to warm them through without really cooking them.  Adjust the seasoning.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain the pasta and portion it out among 6 warm pasta bowls.  Ladle the saffron seafood sauce over the top and garnish with warm microwaved peas.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  quinoa - (2 1/4 cups)
  2 1/2         quarts  water
                        Salt -- to taste

Set quinoa in a bowl of cold water and wash it by rubbing it between your hands.  Drain and repeat the process until the water is clear.

Transfer the rinsed quinoa to a saucepan and cover with water and some salt.  Bring the liquid to a boil, lower the heat and boil, uncovered, for 10 minutes or until all the grains are translucent.  Take care not to overcook.

Drain the quinoa immediately but do not cool under cold water or the grain will be waterlogged.  If not eating right away, transfer the quinoa to a cloth lined baking pan and fluff up with two forks to help cool the grain a little faster.

This recipe yields 7 cups.

           Portobello And Zucchini Sandwiches With Tomato Salsa

Recipe By     :Michele Urvater
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  zucchini -- cut into 1/4"-thk
                        vertical strips
     1/2           cup  vinaigrette
  4                     portobello mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  green or black olivada (olive paste)
     1/2           cup  robiolla or soft fresh goat's cheese
                        === TOMATO SALSA ===
  2                     ripe tomatoes -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/4" cubes
  2        tablespoons  vinaigrette
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Snipped chives
                        Sliced pitted cured black olives

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Marinate the zucchini in vinaigrette for 10 minutes at least.

Remove the portobello stems.  Then, very carefully, slice them in half horizontally so you end up with two 8 large rounds.  Set the rounds on a baking sheet and spread each round with some olivada and about a tablespoon of cheese.  Add the marinated zucchini strips to the baking sheet and roast for 10 minutes.

Remove the mushrooms and zucchini from the oven and assemble.  Set a portobello round on the bottom of a dinner plate and top with zucchini, cover with another portobello round and cover with zucchini.  Garnish the top and sides with Tomato Salsa, chives and black olives slices.

Tomato Salsa:  Combine the tomatoes with vinaigrette and spoon salsa over and around portobello mushroom sandwiches.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 2 dinner servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  wheat berries
  2             quarts  water

Set the wheat berries in a sauce pan, cover with the water and soak overnight.  The following day boil the berries in the same water for 20 minutes, if you want them parboiled only (to cook later on in casseroles or soups) or for 1 hour if you want them fully cooked.

Drain well and cool thoroughly.  Transfer the cooked wheat berries to a glass jar and store them in the refrigerator for 4 days.  Store them in the freezer only if you are going to use them in soups, stews or casseroles.  The freezer softens their texture and makes them less chewy.

This recipe yields 4 cups.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     skinless salmon fillets - (abt 6 to 8 oz e
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  instant mashed potato potato buds
                        = (or potato flakes)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter

Run your fingers over the salmon and, with tweezers, remove any stray bones.  Combine the lemon juice and olive oil and rub this into the salmon and season the fillets lightly with salt and pepper.  Dip the salmon in the potato flakes, patting them down to make sure they stick.

Heat the butter and oil in a non stick skillet.  Saute the salmon for 2 minutes a side or until golden; the insides should be a trace underdone.  Serve with lemon wedges over endive salad or with buttered cucumbers in tarragon.

An alternative way to cook these is to preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  Coat with cooking spray a wire rack set over a baking pan.  Set the fillets on the prepared rack and bake for 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Run your fingers over the salmon and, with tweezers, remove any stray bones.  Combine the lemon juice and olive oil and rub this into the salmon and season the fillets lightly with salt and pepper.  Dip the salmon in the potato flakes, patting them down to make sure they stick.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the butter and oil in a non stick skillet.  Saute the salmon for 2 minutes a side or until golden; the insides should be a trace underdone.  Serve with lemon wedges over endive salad or with buttered cucumbers in tarragon.
</DirT>
<DirT>
An alternative way to cook these is to preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  Coat with cooking spray a wire rack set over a baking pan.  Set the fillets on the prepared rack and bake for 10 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  sliced mushrooms
  3        tablespoons  flour
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1 1/2           cups  liquid
                        = (1/2 cup each of fish and
                        chicken stock and milk)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

                 Smoked Salmon On Toast Or Jicama Hearts

Recipe By     :Michele Urvater
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            slices  sandwich bread - (very thin)
                        = (or substitute jicama slices)
  4        tablespoons  melted butter
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice - (to 2)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  12                    thin slices smoked salmon
  1         tablespoon  finely-snipped dill leaves
  1         tablespoon  chive "batons"
                        = (chives cut into 2" lengths)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  With a biscuit cutter or heart shaped cutter, cut out heart shapes (can be done in advance).  Brush melted butter on both sides of the bread and set them on a baking sheet.  Bake for 15 minutes or until toasts are golden brown; remove and set aside.

(Or, for low cal alternative, cut wide thin slices of jicama, then cut out heart shapes from those; can be done in advance, and kept in dampened cloth in the refrigerator.)

Combine olive oil and lime juice and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Set two "heart" shaped toast points or jicama slices in middle of a dinner plate.  Heart points should meet in center and overlap each other slightly.  Roll up or drape a slice of smoked salmon in the middle of each heart and brush with olive oil and rice vinegar dressing.  For a professional looking presentation, scatter dill and chives over everything; including the plate.  At last minute, coarsely grind fresh pepper over the top.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  fine linguine
  2             quarts  salted water
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped bacon or pancetta
                        = (or 2 tbspns olive oil)
  4                     scallions -- thinly sliced
  8             ounces  fresh asparagus - (to 12) -- peeled, and
                        cut diagonally into 1/2" slices
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  crumbled fresh goat's or farmer's cheese
  2        tablespoons  sliced pitted cured black olives

Drain the pasta (reserving a tablespoonful of cooking water) and portion it into pasta bowls.

Add the water, lemon juice and butter to the asparagus skillet and swirl the ingredients around until the liquid and butter form a little emulsion.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and spoon over the pasta.  Garnish with cheese and olives.

                   Steamed Couscous, The Authentic Way

Recipe By     :Michele Urvater
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  couscous
  2               cups  chicken broth
  3               cups  water
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin

Set couscous in a bowl and pour 2 quarts water over it.  Swish around and drain water off.  Spread couscous grain in a baking pan and leave them to swell for 10 minutes.  Rub couscous between your wet hands to break up lumps.  Let stand another 10 minutes.

Combine the broth, water, cinnamon stick, ginger and cumin in the bottom of a couscousiere.  Secure the top of the couscousiere to the bottom with a dampened piece of cheesecloth, lightly dusted with flour and large enough to go around the rim of the top.  When the liquid comes to a boil, slowly dribble 1/4 of the swollen couscous into steamer, forming them into a mound.  Steam uncovered for 5 minutes, then add the remaining couscous.  Steam over low heat, uncovered, for 20 minutes.

Remove the top of the couscousiere (if the liquid in the bottom seems low, add some more water or broth) and dump the couscous into a large shallow pan and spread it out with a rubber spatula.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup cold water and 1/2 teaspoon salt over the couscous.  Break up lumps by lifting couscous and stirring the grains with a fork.  Lightly oil your hands and rework grains, rubbing them through your fingertips, to keep them separate.  Dry for 10 minutes.  (Can do in advance up to this point and keep until the final steaming with a damp cloth over top).

Return the dried couscous to the top of the couscousiere (resealing it with cheesecloth again) and dribble couscous in as before, in a soft mound.  Steam uncovered for 20 minutes more.  Serve with "Chick Pea Stew" (see recipe) and garnish with sliced toasted almonds.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        Stove Top Fresh Tuna Stew

Recipe By     :Michele Urvater

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1                     onion -- finely sliced
  1              large  garlic clove -- sliced
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                can  anchovies - (2 oz) -- minced
  4               cups  chopped seeded tomatoes
     1/2           cup  roasted red peppers (from the jar) -- cut 1/4" strips
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh tuna -- cut 1" dice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  nonpareil capers
  1         tablespoon  slivered Nicoise black olives
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves - (packed) -- cut with scissors
     1/2           cup  toasted pine nuts -- for garnish

In a deep skillet heat the olive oil.  Add the onion and saute for a few minutes.  Add the garlic and 2 tablespoons of the wine.  Cover and cook for a few minutes or until tender.  Add the anchovies and remaining wine and evaporate until reduced by half.

Add the tomatoes and roasted peppers and simmer, over very low heat, uncovered while you start the rice and carrots.

When the rice and carrots are almost done, add the tuna to the tomatoes, cover and simmer 2 to 3 minutes just to warm through (you want the interior rare or the dish will taste as if you used canned tuna).

Uncover the skillet, add the capers and black olives and adjust the seasoning.  Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the basil.  Serve over "Yellow Rice And Carrots" (see recipe) and garnish with pine nuts.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a deep skillet heat the olive oil.  Add the onion and saute for a few minutes.  Add the garlic and 2 tablespoons of the wine.  Cover and cook for a few minutes or until tender.  Add the anchovies and remaining wine and evaporate until reduced by half.

Add the tomatoes and roasted peppers and simmer, over very low heat, uncovered while you start the rice and carrots.

When the rice and carrots are almost done, add the tuna to the tomatoes, cover and simmer 2 to 3 minutes just to warm through (you want the interior rare or the dish will taste as if you used canned tuna).

     1/2           cup  dry white wine

In a casserole (large enough to hold artichokes in a single layer) render the pancetta until crisp.  Add the mushrooms and saute for a couple of minutes.  Cover and cook until tender.  Add the garlic and herbs and saute for a minute.  Add the bread crumbs and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Remove the stuffing from the casserole and set aside.

Add vegetable oil the casserole and saute the onion and carrot for 5 minutes.  Stuff the raw artichokes with the mushroom mixture and set them over the vegetables.  Add the white wine, and bring it to a boil.  Cover the casserole and simmer over very low heat for 1 1/2 hours or until tender.

Remove artichokes from heat and reduce the liquid over high heat until concentrated; season to taste with salt and pepper and spoon over artichokes.

An alternative way of doing this is to use precooked artichokes and simmer them, stuffed, for 30 minutes to heat and cook the stuffing.

                        === HORSERADISH GARLIC MAYONNAISE ===
  2                     garlic cloves -- roughly chopped
  1         tablespoon  prepared white horseradish - (to 2)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  minced parsley

Bring lots of salted water to a boil in a pot large enough to hold the beef.  (If it does not fit, cut the fillet of beef in half.)  Add the meat and cover the pot so that the water returns quickly to the boil.  When the water is back at a boil, uncover the pot and boil the beef anywhere from 14 to 17 minutes depending upon how rare you like it.

While the beef is boiling, in another saucepan cook the potatoes in salted water for 20 minutes or until just tender.  In a third shallow saucepan or in a Chinese style bamboo steamer, cook the carrots and leeks, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes or until just tender.

To serve, remove the beef from the water and let it rest for 10 minutes.  Remove the strings, slice, and serve half of it (reserve half for another dinner) with Horseradish Garlic Mayonnaise and surrounded by half of vegetables (saving half for "Second Time Around Vegetable Soup", see recipe.)

Horseradish Garlic Mayonnaise:  In a blender combine the garlic, horseradish, olive oil, and vinegar and process until smooth.  Transfer to a mixing bowl and add mayonnaise.  Season to taste with salt, fold in the parsley and serve with beef.  (Makes about 1 cup)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  1                     teaspoon dried rosemary or thyme -- tied in cheesecloth
  1                can  tuna fish - (6 1/2 to 7 oz)
                        = (preferably imported from Italy and
                        preferably packed in olive oil)
  2             ounces  flat anchovy fillets, packed in olive oil -- (1 small can)
  3        tablespoons  nonpareil capers - (to 4)
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice - (to 4)
  1                cup  mayonnaise
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the veal in a casserole large enough to accomodate it.  Add the wine and enough water to cover the veal by 1/2 inch.  Remove veal and set aside.  Add vegetables and bouquet garni to the water and bring the liquid to a boil.  Return the meat to the simmering water, cover and cook gently for about 1 1/2 hours or until the veal is cooked through.

Remove the veal from the heat and let it cool in its own liquid, remove it from the liquid and the veal is ready.  (Boil the remaining liquid down by half and use as you would broth.)  Remove strings and thinly slice.

In a food processor puree until creamy the tuna fish, anchovies, capers, vegetable and olive oils.  Add lemon zest and 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice (add more if you wish).  Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and fold in the mayonnaise and season very well with salt and pepper.

Spread bottom of a shallow non-metal dish with a layer of tuna sauce.  Arrange some veal slices, in a single layer, end to end, over the tuna sauce.  Cover first layer of veal again with tuna sauce.  Build up a second layer of veal and cover with sauce again.  End with a generous layer of sauce, (making sure veal is entirely covered so that it does not dry out).  Cover with plastic and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Serve chilled with steamed haricot verts (French green beans) or asparagus along with wedges of ripe tomato, halved pitted black olives, snipped chives and chopped parsley.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                        === TOMATO SALSA ===
  1                     Haas avocado -- pitted, peeled,
                        and cut into 1/4" dice
  2                     vine ripened tomatoes -- seeded, and

Place flour, eggs and bread crumbs in 3 separate shallow plates.  Season veal with salt and pepper.  Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Dredge veal in flour and shake off excess.  Then dip floured veal in eggs and then in bread crumbs; set crumbed mixture on a rack for coating to set.

In a large skillet heat 1/4-inch deep vegetable oil.  When hot, add the veal without crowding in a batch and cook for 3 minutes a side.  With a slotted spatula transfer the veal to a baking sheet.  Set first batch in oven to keep warm.  Repeat with a second or third batch until all the veal is done.

Keep the veal warm in the low oven while you eat your first course.  When ready to eat, center greens on a dinner plate.  Cut veal into strips on the diagonal and pile in the center.  Garnish with Tomato Salsa.

Tomato Salsa:  Combine all of the ingredients and spoon over sliced Wiener Schnitzel.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)
