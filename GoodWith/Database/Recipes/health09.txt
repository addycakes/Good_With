  2        tablespoons  Kraft Non-Fat Grated Cheese Topping
                        = (or other brand)
  12            ounces  uncooked whole-wheat spaghetti
  28            ounces  canned diced tomatoes with

  16            ounces  canned tomato sauce

In a large bowl, combine beans, tomato, onion and celery.  Gently stir in vinegar and sprinkle with parsley; season to taste with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 cup per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 2

Comments:  A sweet, just-picked tomato is key to this refreshing salad.  It's not tomato season?  Use grape tomatoes (which are always sweet) instead.

Flavor Booster:  Add a piquant accent to this recipe with the addition of 1 tablespoon of capers.  The tiny nonpareil capers that are firm and slightly crisp work well in this salad.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  sugar -- divided
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
  8        tablespoons  reduced-calorie margarine -- chilled, cut up
  8        tablespoons  fat-free margarine, tub-variety -- chilled
  5               cups  blueberries
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
  2          teaspoons  lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1              large  egg white

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine flour, 1 teaspoon of sugar, salt and both margarines; mix with a fork (or both hands) until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 4 tablespoons of cold water and mix until dough can be formed into a ball, adding more water if necessary.  Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and divide into two equal portions; roll each portion into a 12-inch round crust.  Press one crust into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie plate, allowing dough to hang over sides; set aside.

In a large bowl, combine blueberries, 1/3 cup of sugar, cornstarch, zest and vanilla; toss to combine and spoon mixture into pie crust.  Place second pie crust on top of blueberries and pinch two crusts together to form a seal.  Using two fingers, pinch around edges to form a decorative rim.

Whisk together egg white and 1 tablespoon of cold water; brush mixture over surface of pie and sprinkle with remaining teaspoon of sugar.  Prick top crust all over with a fork or sharp knife to allow steam to escape during cooking.

Transfer pie to a baking sheet, Bake until crust is golden and filling is bubbling out of holes, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Cool on a rack, about 10 minutes, before slicing into 10 pieces.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  We lightened up the crust of this classic summer dessert with a few baker's tricks.  It tastes so great that you'll barely notice the difference.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh broccoli -- ends trimmed,
                        cut into spears with 2 or 3 florets each

  3        tablespoons  fat-free sour cream

Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in a large skillet.  Place broccoli on steamer basket and set over water.  Cover and steam until crisp-tender, about 8 to 10 minutes; drain.

In a medium bowl, whisk dressing and sour cream together until smooth.

Arrange broccoli spears on a serving plate with a bowl of dipping sauce in center.  (Note: Consider making the dipping sauce for the kids with reduced-fat sour cream and dressing instead of fat-free.)

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 3 spears with 2 tablespoons of sauce per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 1

Comments:  Kids will happily eat their veggies with this sweet dipping sauce on the side.  You can prepare their portion using reduced-fat versions of sour cream and dressing instead of fat-free.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           servings  olive oil cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1              pound  fresh lump crabmeat -- jumbo
  2        tablespoons  uncooked quick oats
     1/4           cup  roasted red peppers -- diced
                        = (from a water-packed jar)
  2        tablespoons  fat-free mayonnaise
  2          teaspoons  Creole or Cajun seasoning -- divided
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     3/4           cup  uncooked quick oats

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.

In a large bowl, combine crabmeat, 2 tablespoons of oats, peppers, mayonnaise, 1 teaspoon of seasoning and mustard; mix gently to combine, being careful not to break up crabmeat lumps.

In a shallow dish, combine remaining 3/4 cup of oats and remaining teaspoon of seasoning.

Shape crab mixture into 4 equal patties, about 1-inch thick each.  Transfer crab cakes to oat mixture and turn to coat both sides.  Transfer crab cakes to prepared baking sheet and coat surfaces with cooking spray.

Bake until crab cakes are firm to the touch and golden brown, about 15 minutes.  (Note: These are tasty plain but you can jazz them up with a sauce made from fat-free mayonnaise spiked with horseradish.)

This recipe yields 4 servings; 1 cake per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  These slightly spicy, crisp crab cakes are flavorful winners thanks to fat-free mayonnaise, roasted red peppers, Dijon mustard and Cajun seasoning.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, combine crabmeat, 2 tablespoons of oats, peppers, mayonnaise, 1 teaspoon of seasoning and mustard; mix gently to combine, being careful not to break up crabmeat lumps.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a shallow dish, combine remaining 3/4 cup of oats and remaining teaspoon of seasoning.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Shape crab mixture into 4 equal patties, about 1-inch thick each.  Transfer crab cakes to oat mixture and turn to coat both sides.  Transfer crab cakes to prepared baking sheet and coat surfaces with cooking spray.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake until crab cakes are firm to the touch and golden brown, about 15 minutes.  (Note: These are tasty plain but you can jazz them up with a sauce made from fat-free mayonnaise spiked with horseradish.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings; 1 cake per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  These slightly spicy, crisp crab cakes are flavorful winners thanks to fat-free mayonnaise, roasted red peppers, Dijon mustard and Cajun seasoning.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           servings  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  4              large  egg whites
     1/3           cup  Splenda No Calorie Sweetener
  1           teaspoon  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  water -- boiling
  1             medium  pineapple -- cubed
  2             medium  mangoes -- cubed
  1             medium  papaya -- cubed
  2        tablespoons  spearmint in thin strips
                        = (abt 8 large leaves)
  1             medium  lime -- cut in half

Preheat oven to 250 degrees.  Very lightly coat 2 nonstick baking sheets with cooking spray.

Blend egg whites, Splenda, vinegar and hot water together at high speed until soft, white peaks form, about 5 minutes.

Spoon egg white mixture by half cupfuls onto prepared baking sheets.  Using the back of a spoon, spread out and smooth mixture into eight 6- to 8-inch circles, no more than 1-inch thick each.  Cook for about one hour and ten minutes, until crisp.  Allow to cool completely on wire rack.  (Note: These are very fragile.  Handle very delicately.)

While pavlovas cook, make fruit topping.  Combine pineapple, mango, papaya and mint in a large bowl.  Squeeze juice of both lime halves over fruit mixture and gently stir fruit until ingredients are just combined.  Allow fruit to macerate for 30 minutes.

When pavlovas are cool, gently mound about 3/4 cup of fruit filling on top of each pavlova.

This recipe yields 8 servings; 1 pavlova per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 1

Comments:  Our sweet meringue base is topped with a delicious mix of Caribbean-inspired fruits.  Not a baker?  Skip the pavlova and enjoy the wonderful fruit salad on its own.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  peanut oil
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  uncooked boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut 1" cubes
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  canned reduced-sodium chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce
  2             medium  celery stalk -- chopped
  8             ounces  canned bamboo shoots -- drained
  8             ounces  canned water chestnuts -- sliced, drained
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cornstarch
  2               cups  cooked white rice -- kept hot
  1 3/4         ounces  dry-roasted cashews -- chopped

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add garlic and cook 1 minute.  Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper and add to skillet.  Cook until browned on all sides, stirring frequently, about 4 minutes.

Add 1 cup of broth, soy sauce, celery, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts to chicken and bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes.

Dissolve cornstarch in remaining 1/2 cup of broth.  Add cornstarch mixture to skillet and simmer until sauce thickens, stirring constantly, about 1 minute.

To serve, divide rice among 4 shallow dishes.  Spoon chicken mixture onto rice and sprinkle with cashews.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 cup of chicken, 1/2 cup of rice and 1 1/2 tablespoons of cashews per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 8

Comments:  This Chinese restaurant staple gets a lot of its sky-high fat content from oil.  We lightened it significantly but kept all its flavor and great crunch.

Flavor Booster:  In place of the bamboo shoots and water chestnuts, add 2 cups chopped fresh baby bok choy.  The tender greens will cook with the chicken in 5 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              small  uncooked red potatoes -- diced
  2            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/2           cup  chopped scallions
                        = (use both green and white parts)
     1/3           cup  water
  1                     chicken bouillon cube without MSG
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
     3/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  12             large  egg whites
  4             ounces  Kraft Free Singles American Cheese -- thinly sliced or
                        shredded
                        = (or other brand)

Place potatoes in a medium saucepan and pour over enough water to cover them.  Set pan over high heat and bring to a boil.  Boil until potatoes are fork-tender, about 8 minutes; drain.

Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and set pan over medium-high heat.  Add potatoes, scallions, 1/3 cup of water, bouillon cube, vinegar and paprika; bring to a simmer.  Cook until liquid is absorbed (or evaporates) and potatoes are golden, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  Remove potatoes from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Coat a second large nonstick skillet with cooking spray (or spoon potatoes onto a serving plate, cover to keep warm, and reuse skillet) and set pan over medium-high heat.  Add egg whites and cheese and cook until whites are cooked through, stirring frequently, about 3 to 5 minutes; season to taste with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1/2 cup of eggs and 1/2 cups of home fries per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  These easy, cheesy scrambled eggs are made lighter with fat-free cheese and egg whites.  And with chicken bouillon and red wine vinegar, the home fries are melt-in-your-mouth delicious.

Place chicken on prepared baking sheet and lightly coat surface with cooking spray; bake 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, combine tomato sauce, tomato and remaining teaspoon of oregano.  Set pan over medium heat and bring to a simmer.  Simmer 10 minutes; remove from heat and stir in basil.

Remove chicken from oven (keeping oven at 400 degrees) and top each chicken breast with 1/4 cup of sauce and 1/4 cup (1 ounce) of cheese.  Return pan to oven and bake until cheese is melted and golden, about 7 to 10 minutes more.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 1 piece per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  Enjoy this Italian classic again!  It has a crunchy oat topping that's kicked up with seasonings, baked until golden, and then smothered with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  tomatoes -- cut into chunks
                        = (abt 8 cups)
  4               cups  fat-free chicken broth -- reduced-sodium
  3              large  onions -- cut into chunks
                        = (abt 3 cups)
     1/4           cup  canned tomato paste
  3              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
  1 1/2       teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2 1/2           cups  buttermilk
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh dill leaves -- stems removed

In a large pot, bring tomatoes, broth, onions, tomato paste, garlic, salt and pepper to a boil over medium-high heat.  Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer until onions are tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from heat; cool slightly.

Using a slotted spoon, lift solids from pot and transfer to a food processor or blender (you'll need to do this in a few batches); puree until smooth.  Or puree soup in pot with an immersion blender.

Pour pureed ingredients into a large bowl along with any liquid left in pot; stir in buttermilk and dill.  Refrigerate until chilled (can be refrigerated for up to 5 days).

This recipe yields 8 servings; about 1 1/2 cups per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 1

Comments:  Naturally low-in-fat buttermilk gives this soup its creamy texture. Serve it as a refreshing side to our Tuscan Tuna and Grilled Vegetable Wraps (see recipe).

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  4             ounces  lean corned beef -- diced (abt 1 cup)
  10            ounces  frozen corn kernels
  45            ounces  canned cream of potato soup
                        = (made with fat-free milk)
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste

Coat a large soup pot with cooking spray and set over medium heat.  Add onion and sautÈ until soft, about 5 minutes.  Stir in thyme, corned beef and corn; cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes more.

Stir in potato soup and bring to a simmer.  Let simmer for 5 minutes and season to taste with pepper.

This recipe yields 6 servings; about 1 heaping cup per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  Corned beef has so much flavor that a little bit goes a long way.  Use some of your St. Patrick's Day leftovers to give this chowder a full, hearty flavor.

Flavor Booster:  Fennel seed, with a flavor similar to rye, is a wonderful complement to corned beef.  Add 1/2 teaspoon fennel seed with the potato soup and reduce the thyme by half.

     1/2           cup  uncooked yellow cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  table salt
     1/2      teaspoon  celery seed
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  fat-free skim milk
  2            serving  cooking spray

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Mix cornmeal, paprika, thyme, salt, celery seeds, onion powder, garlic powder and pepper together in a shallow soup bowl.  Pour milk into another shallow soup bowl.

Coat a large nonstick baking sheet with cooking spray.  Dredge fillets first in milk, then in cornmeal mixture, coating both sides and pressing cornmeal mixture gently to adhere.  Place coated fillets on baking sheet and lightly spray each with cooking spray.

Bake until cooked through, about 15 minutes.  Let stand at room temperature 2 minutes before serving.  Serve with lemon wedge.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 1 fillet and 1/4 of asparagus per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  For a down-home dinner at its simplest, serve this dish over mesclun greens tossed with a little rice vinegar.  Now that's Southern hospitality!

              Crab Meat-Stuffed Shrimp With A Soy-Ginger Dip

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  shrimp - (abt 12 extra-large) -- peeled, deveined,
                        and tails kept on
  8             ounces  lump crabmeat -- picked through to
                        remove any shells
  2              large  egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh ginger root -- divided
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh cilantro -- divided
  2          teaspoons  minced scallions -- divided
  2 1/3    tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce -- divided
     1/2           cup  uncooked cornmeal
  2           servings  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/2      teaspoon  Splenda No Calorie Sweetener
  2        tablespoons  water

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Slice each shrimp almost all the way through.  Place shrimp on a flat surface, cut-side down, and press down on each with your hands so shrimp flatten out a little.

Combine crab, egg whites, garlic, and 1 teaspoon each of ginger, cilantro, scallion and soy sauce in a medium bowl; thoroughly mix together.  Spoon about 2 heaping teaspoons of crab mixture onto each shrimp (cut side of shrimp should be facing down) and mold into a mound with wet hands; set aside.

Place cornmeal in a shallow bowl.  Place shrimp in cornmeal and sprinkle with cornmeal to coat both sides.

Coat a nonstick cookie sheet with cooking spray.  Arrange shrimp on cookie sheet and lightly coat with cooking spray.  Cook for 4 minutes; turn broiler on high.  Broil 4 inches from broiler until shrimp begin to brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine remaining 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, remaining teaspoons of ginger, cilantro and scallion, Splenda and water in a cup; stir to combine and serve with shrimp.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 3 shrimp and about 1 1/4 tablespoons of dipping sauce per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  This take on traditional Chinese stuffed, fried shrimp has all the flavor but almost none of the fat.  It has a wonderful texture thanks to an oven-crisped cornmeal coating.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  orange juice
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
  2             pounds  raw boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut 32 chunks
  12            medium  jalapeno peppers -- halved lengthwise,
                        and seeded (do not touch seeds with bare
                        hands)
  2           servings  olive oil cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)

Combine orange and lemon juices, oil, garlic, cumin, paprika, salt and oregano in a resealable plastic food storage bag.  Add chicken and peppers; seal bag and turn to coat.  Place bag on a plate on the bottom shelf in refrigerator and marinate for 2 to 8 hours.

Preheat grill or grill pan.  Thread chicken and pepper halves onto 8 metal or wooden skewers, using 4 pieces of chicken and 3 pieces of pepper per skewer; coat with cooking spray.  (Note: If you're using wooden skewers, soak them in water 30 minutes before use to prevent charring.)

Grill skewers, turning often, until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 6 to 8 minutes; serve immediately.  Leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.

This recipe yields 8 servings; 1 skewer per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  Serve these Cuban-influenced skewers a dozen different ways.  For starters, try them with our Grilled Summer Vegetables, or top them with our Tropical Fruit Salsa.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  reduced-calorie pancake syrup
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  ground cloves
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  table salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2 1/2         pounds  lean pork tenderloin
                        = (use two 1 1/4-lb pieces)

Combine syrup, dry mustard, cloves, ginger, salt, cinnamon, and pepper in a large zip-close plastic bag.  Trim pork of all visible fat and cut each tenderloin in half widthwise.  Add tenderloins to plastic bag, squeeze out air and seal bag; turn to coat tenderloins.  Place bag on a plate and refrigerate on bottom shelf, turning bag occasionally, at least 2 hours or overnight.

Preheat broiler.  Place tenderloins in a roasting pan and pour marinade over them.  Broil 5 inches from heat until pork reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees, about 6 minutes per side.  Let stand at room temperature 5 minutes before slicing.

This recipe yields 8 servings; about 4 ounces of meat per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  Who needs a fattening Easter ham?  The spices in this low-fat pork tenderloin make it taste just as good!  Marinate it overnight for an even deeper flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4           servings  olive oil cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  2             medium  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 8 wedges each
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt -- or more to taste
                        = (enough for potatoes and fish)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to more taste
                        = (enough for potatoes and fish)
  20            ounces  uncooked cod - (four 5 oz fillets)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  fat-free skim milk
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2           cup  seasoned bread crumbs
  4        tablespoons  red wine vinegar

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Coat 2 large baking sheets with cooking spray.

Place potato wedges on one baking sheet and lightly coat with cooking spray; season to taste with salt and pepper.  Bake until golden brown and tender, about 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, season both sides of cod to taste with salt and pepper.  Place flour in a shallow dish; add fish fillets and turn to coat.

In a separate shallow dish, whisk together milk and mustard; add flour-coated fillets and turn to coat.  Place bread crumbs in another shallow dish; add fillets and turn to coat.

Transfer fish to second prepared baking sheet and lightly coat with cooking spray.  Bake fish until fork-tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Serve fish and potato wedges with vinegar on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 1 fillet, 4 potato wedges and 1 tablespoon of vinegar per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  You've probably shunned this dish for ages ó and rightly so.  But bake, don't fry, and you can put this favorite back on the menu.

Flavor Booster:  Give fish and chips a Creole accent by serving with remoulade sauce instead of the vinegar on the side.  Here's a quick, light version of the Louisiana classic: Combine 1/3 cup of fat-free mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons of sweet pickles, 1 tablespoon of mustard and a dash of hot red pepper sauce.  Makes 8 (1-tablespoon) servings.  (Adds 0 PointsÆ Value per serving.)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  40            medium  marshmallows
  3        tablespoons  margarine
  7               cups  Post Fruity Pebbles
                        = (or other brand)
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1           teaspoon  mini chocolate chips
  3             pieces  licorice rope -- cut 8 pieces each

Place marshmallows and margarine in large nonstick pot.  Cook over medium heat until marshmallows melt, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes; remove from heat.  Quickly pour cereal into pot and stir until cereal is coated with marshmallow mixture.

Coat a 13- by 9-inch pan with cooking spray.  Spoon cereal in pan and press down with greased hands (coat hands with cooking spray) to form a smooth layer; refrigerate until firm, about 1 1/2 hours.

Using a 3-inch rabbit-shaped cookie cutter, cut bunny shapes down the length of the pan to form 2 rows of 6 bunnies each; remove bunnies from pan and using a 1-inch round cookie cutter, cut 12 circles out of scraps for tails.

To decorate each bunny, use chocolate chips for eyes and press licorice strings into side of bunny's face for whiskers.  Press tail into one side of the bottom of bunny.  (Note: If not serving immediately, refrigerate or freeze.)

This recipe yields 12 servings; 1 bunny per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  Kids of all ages will love these festive bunnies!  Wrap them up in colored plastic wrap and tuck them into your loved ones' Easter baskets.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  uncooked red potatoes -- unpeeled
                        = (abt 14 small potatoes)
  3             ounces  Canadian-style bacon -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped (1/2 cup)
  2          teaspoons  arrowroot
  1             packet  Splenda No Calorie Sweetener
  1           teaspoon  table salt
     1/2      teaspoon  celery seed
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     2/3           cup  water
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
  1              whole  hard-boiled egg
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley

Place potatoes in a large saucepan; add enough water to cover potatoes.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain potatoes and allow to cool.  Cut potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick slices; set aside.  (Note: Can't find red petite potatoes?  Use four medium-size spuds instead.  Just cook them covered for about 20 to 25 minutes; cool, peel and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices.)

Meanwhile, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until slightly brown, about 5 minutes.  Remove from skillet; set aside.

Add oil to pan and cook over medium heat until sizzling.  Add onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.  Stir in arrowroot, Splenda, salt, celery seed, dry mustard and pepper; cook about 1 minute.  Add water and vinegar; stir and cook until thick and bubbly, about 1 minute.  Stir in potatoes and bacon; toss to mix.  Cook, stirring gently, until mixture is heated through, about 1 to 2 minutes more.  Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with egg and parsley.

This recipe yields 8 servings; about 1/2 cup per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 2

Comments:  Potato salad can mean so much more than just relish and mayonnaise.  This German classic is bursting with flavor thanks to Canadian bacon, dry mustard, cider vinegar and egg.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16            ounces  canned chickpeas -- drained, rinsed
  2          teaspoons  garlic-flavored olive oil
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper -- or to taste
  1              small  shallot -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  fat-free chicken broth
                        = (or water)
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh chives
  9              large  sweet red peppers
                        = (or 18 small yellow and red baby bell
                        peppers)

Preheat grill to medium-high heat.

Combine chickpeas, oil, cayenne pepper, shallot, salt, black pepper and broth in a blender container; purÈe.  Stir in chives; set aside.

Thread whole peppers lengthwise onto long metal skewers.  Place on hot grill and cook until peppers are slightly blackened, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Remove peppers from heat and pull peppers off skewers.  Slice tops off peppers; halve lengthwise (and core if necessary).

Spoon 1/2 tablespoon of bean puree into each baby pepper half (or 1 tablespoon if using large peppers).  (Note: For an attractive party presentation, spoon bean puree into a tube with a cake decorating tip and pipe into each pepper half.  Also, decorate a serving platter of the stuffed peppers with fresh chives, Italian parsley, thyme or rosemary sprigs.)

This recipe yields 9 servings; 4 filled, small pepper halves (or 2 large halves) per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 2

Comments:  Finger foods reach new heights with these adorable stuffed baby peppers. Hollowed-out cherry tomatoes are an attractive serving option, too.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1           teaspoon  decaffeinated instant coffee powder
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cinnamon - (optional) -- or to taste
     2/3        ounces  fat-free sugar-free instant
                        chocolate pudding mix
                        = (use half a 1.4 ounces package)
  1 1/2            cup  fat-free skim milk
  2              large  bananas -- cut into a
                        total of 12 chunks
  12            medium  strawberries -- hulled

Coat grid of grill with cooking spray.  Preheat grill to medium.

Combine coffee powder, cinnamon, pudding mix and milk in a tall pitcher.  Blend with a whisk or immersion blender until mixture is frothy; set aside.  The mixture will firm up as it stands.  (Note: Vary the taste of the sauce by adding a few drops of rum extract in place of the coffee powder if desired.)

Alternate threading 3 banana chunks and 3 strawberries onto each of 4 metal skewers.  Place fruit skewers on grill and cook, turning once, just long enough so that grill marks appear on fruit, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Remove fruit from skewers and divide among 4 plates.  Top each serving with about 1/4 cup of chocolate sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 2

Comments:  Our coffee-cinnamon accented sauce is a delicious complement to grilled fruit.  This recipe is a tasteful ending to any summer soiree.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatballs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dried bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  1% low-fat milk
  1              pound  raw lean ground beef
     3/4        ounces  grated romano cheese - (abt 1/4 cup)
  2              large  egg whites
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
  2           teaspoon  dried parsley
  2           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1             medium  sweet red pepper -- cut sixteen chunks
  1             medium  onion -- cut sixteen 1" pcs

Soak eight 10-inch skewers in water to prevent them from burning on grill.

In small bowl, mix bread crumbs and milk; set aside 5 minutes.  Heat grill.

In food processor, combine beef, cheese, egg whites, garlic, herbs, salt and pepper.  Strain bread crumbs and squeeze lightly to extract excess milk.  Add to beef mixture and process just until blended.

With moistened hands, shape mixture into 16 meatballs, about 2 inches in diameter.  Holding two skewers at a time, alternately thread 4 chunks of red pepper, 4 chunks of onion and 4 meatballs onto parallel skewers, beginning with pepper.  Repeat with remaining skewers.

On lightly oiled grill, cook kebabs for 8 to 10 minutes, rotating about every 2 minutes to cook evenly.  Meatballs should be just cooked through, but not overcooked.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 7

Comments:  These kebabs are best made outdoors on a grill, but they can also be broiled for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  pineapple
  1                cup  plain fat-free yogurt
  5                     leaves basil -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-grated ginger root
  3           teaspoon  Splenda No Calorie Sweetener -- or to taste

Soak 4 bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes (or use metal skewers).  Preheat broiler, grill or stovetop (for grill pan).

Categories    : Main Dish                       Mushrooms

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  portobello mushrooms - (abt 1 lb) -- stems removed,
                        minced and reserved
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
     1/2        medium  sweet red pepper
     1/2        medium  yellow pepper
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1 1/2           cups  canned white beans -- drained, rinsed
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  3             medium  garlic cloves - (or to taste) -- finely minced
  3             medium  scallions -- chopped
  1              large  tomato -- seeded, chopped
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh sage or rosemary
  1           teaspoon  table salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper -- or to taste

Preheat grill (or grill pan) to medium.

Combine 1 tablespoon of oil and vinegar together in a cup; brush mixture over top of mushroom caps and let sit 5 to 10 minutes to release juices.

Grill mushrooms, stem-side down, brushing with any extra oil mixture/juices, until slightly tender, about 5 to 8 minutes.  Turn mushrooms over and grill until tender, about 5 to 8 minutes more.

Meanwhile, lightly spray pepper halves with cooking spray; grill, skin-side down, until skin starts to blister; coarsely chop.

Place peppers in a medium bowl.  Add beans, minced mushroom stems, remaining tablespoon of oil, lemon juice, garlic, scallions, tomato, sage, salt and black pepper; toss well to coat.

Reduce grill heat to low or move mushrooms to higher rack level.  Spoon vegetable mixture into mushroom caps.  Cover loosely with aluminum foil and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 1 filled mushroom per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  Piled up high, this nutrient-packed meal will really fill you up.  Vary the types of beans each time you make it ó Great Northern, flageolet, navy and pinto are all tasty.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lean beef round -- sliced 3/4" thick
                        = (use top round cut)
     1/2           cup  fat-free Italian salad dressing
                        = (or fat-free vinaigrette dressing)
  2              large  sweet red peppers
  1              small  garlic clove -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  capers
  1             medium  shallot -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
  2        tablespoons  fat-free Italian salad dressing
                        = (or fat-free vinaigrette dressing)
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)

Place steak in shallow bowl, cutting in half if necessary to fit in one layer; pour on 1/2 cup of dressing and baste to cover steak.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 to 8 hours.

Meanwhile, prepare roast pepper dressing.  Place whole peppers on top of gas stove over open flame (or place over hot grill).  Char peppers on all sides using a long-handled fork to turn, about 5 minutes total; remove from heat.  Place peppers in plastic or paper bag, seal shut and set aside for 1 hour.  Remove peppers from bag and scrape off skin with paring knife; core peppers and cut into chunks.

Place peppers, garlic, capers, shallot, basil, 2 tablespoons of salad dressing, salt and black pepper in a blender; purÈe.

Coat grid of grill with cooking spray, place grid on grill and heat.

To cook steak, drain off and discard dressing-marinade.  Pat steak with paper towels to remove excess moisture.  Grill until well browned outside and medium-rare inside, about 3 to 5 minutes per side, or longer for desired doneness; remove from grill immediately.  Cut steak across grain into thin strips to serve.  (Note: The dressing can be made up to a day in advance and kept refrigerated.)

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 3 ounces of meat and 1/3 cup of roast pepper dressing per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  Our homemade roasted pepper dressing has a bit of a kick thanks to capers.  It adds a zesty flavor to steak.

  1         tablespoon  honey
  6                     average shelled hazelnuts -- peeled, and
                        coarsley chopped
  2        tablespoons  uncooked old fashioned oats
  1           teaspoon  butter
  4          teaspoons  brown sugar - (unpacked)
  2        tablespoons  pear nectar

Preheat grill.

Peel, halve and core pear.  Cut a small slice off the rounded side of each pear half so halves will stand on grill.  Set pear halves on grill, flat-side down; brush with honey.  Grill 10 minutes on each side, brushing occasionally with honey.

While pears are grilling, make filling.  In a small pan, stir together hazelnuts and oats over medium heat until lightly toasted.  Stir in butter until it melts.  Remove from heat; stir in sugar and nectar.

When pears are hot and tender, spoon filling into centers and serve.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  If you can't find very ripe pears for this recipe, substitute peaches or plums.  To peel hazelnuts, toast them until the papery outer skins crack, cool, then rub gently between your fingers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              small  zucchini -- halved lengthwise
  2             medium  yellow peppers -- quartered
  2             medium  sweet red peppers -- quartered
  2             medium  vidalia onions -- cut 1/2"-thk slices
  2           servings  olive oil cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  snipped fresh chives

Preheat grill or grill pan.  Place vegetables on a cutting board and coat with cooking spray.

Grill vegetables, turning often, until lightly charred and tender, about 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove to cutting board.  Cut zucchini and bell peppers into bite-size chunks.  Separate onions into rings.

Place cooked vegetables in a large bowl and sprinkle with salt, pepper and chives; toss lightly.  Serve warm or cold.  Store leftovers for up to 4 days in the refrigerator.

This recipe yields 8 servings; about 1 cup per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 0

Comments:  We give this classic summer dish an even fresher taste by adding snipped chives.  Enjoy the veggies with our Cuban Chicken Skewers (see recipe) or in our tasty Tuscan Tuna Wraps (see recipe).

Flavor Booster:  For an aromatic vegetable mix, thread vegetable chunks on fresh rosemary branches that have been soaked in cold water.  Cut the zucchini and onion into chunks, not slices.  Grill as the recipe directs.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  tomatoes -- cut into chunks
                        = (2 ripe Beefsteak tomatoes)
  1                cup  fresh parsley leaves
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2             medium  garlic cloves
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- divided
  1 1/4         pounds  swordfish fillets, abt 1" thk -- cut into 24 chunks
  1             medium  yellow pepper -- cut into 24 chunks
  1             medium  red onion -- cut 6 wedges,
                        and each wedge halved to yield 12 pieces
  1             medium  zucchini -- halved lengthwise,
                        and then cut crosswise to yield 12 pieces
  2                cup  cooked whole-wheat couscous -- kept hot

Preheat grill or grill pan.

Meanwhile, to make sauce, place tomatoes, parsley, 1 tablespoon of oil, garlic, oregano and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a food processor; pulse until finely chopped and set aside.

Thread 2 pieces each of swordfish and yellow pepper, and 1 piece each of onion and zucchini onto each of twelve 8-inch metal skewers.  (Note: If you're using wooden skewers, soak them in water 30 minutes before use to prevent charring.)  Brush kabobs with remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper.

Grill skewers, turning as needed, until lightly charred and fish is just cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 3 kabobs, 1/2 cup of couscous and about 1/2 cup of sauce per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 8

Comments:  Use ripe beefsteak tomatoes to give this unusually delicious, Sicilian sauce the best flavor.  Fresh tuna or halibut may be substituted for the swordfish if you prefer.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  boneless skinless chicken thighs -- cut into 32 chunks
                        = (abt 4 pieces per thigh)
  1 1/4           cups  plain fat-free yogurt -- divided
  2        tablespoons  Tandoori spice mix
     1/2           cup  diced cucumber -- English variety
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh mint leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
  1             medium  red onion -- cut into 16 wedges
  2           servings  olive oil cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  2               cups  cooked couscous -- whole-wheat variety

Put chicken, 1/2 cup of yogurt and tandoori spice mix in a resealable plastic food storage bag.  Seal bag and turn to mix and coat.  Place bag on a plate and refrigerate on lowest shelf for at least 1 hour or up to 8 hours.

Meanwhile, to make sauce, stir remaining 3/4 cup of yogurt, cucumber, mint and salt together in a small bowl until blended; refrigerate until ready to serve.

Preheat grill.  Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade.  Thread chicken and onion wedges onto 8 metal skewers, using 4 pieces of chicken and 2 pieces of onion per skewer.  (If using wooden skewers soak them in water 30 minutes before use to prevent burning.)  Coat chicken and onions with cooking spray.

Grill skewers, turning often, until chicken is no longer pink in center, about 7 to 9 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 2 skewers, about 1/4 cup of sauce and 1/2 cup of couscous per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 6

Comments:  Mix it up a little and surprise your guests with these well-seasoned skewers instead of plain old burgers.  Bottled tandoori spice mix makes prep work a snap (just ease up on the amount if you can't stand too much heat).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  diced papaya
  1                cup  diced mango
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped red onion -- divided
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped green pepper -- divided
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro

     1/3           cup  ketchup
  1         tablespoon  jerk seasoning -- Jamaican-variety
  1              large  egg
  1              pound  uncooked ground turkey breast

To prepare salsa, combine papaya, mango, 1/4 cup each of red onion and green pepper, cilantro and lime juice in a medium bowl; set aside.  (Note: You can make the salsa up to 1 day in advance.)

To prepare burgers, combine remaining 1/2 cup of red onion, remaining 1/4 cup of green pepper, oats, ketchup, jerk seasoning and egg in a large bowl; mix until well combined.  Add turkey; mix thoroughly.  Divide turkey mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a 1-inch-thick patty; cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 20 minutes.

Preheat broiler.  Broil burgers until cooked through, flipping once, about 20 to 25 minutes total.  Serve each with about a heaping 1/3 cup of salsa.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  These Caribbean-inspired burgers also taste great made with ground chicken breast or extra-lean ground beef.  They'll be a welcome addition to your July 4th gathering.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3          teaspoons  canola oil
  1 1/2         pounds  scallops - (abt 20 sea scallops) -- patted dry with
                        paper towel
  1             medium  onion -- cut in half and
                        then thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  shiitake mushrooms -- stems discarded,
                        and caps sliced
  1         tablespoon  freshly-grated ginger root
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1                cup  shredded carrots
  1                cup  mung bean sprouts
  2        tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1             medium  scallion -- sliced for garnish
     1/4           cup  shredded carrots -- for garnish

Heat 2 teaspoons of oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add scallops in a single layer and cook until bottoms are browned, about 2 minutes.  Flip and cook until bottoms are browned and scallops are just cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes more; remove to a plate.

Heat remaining teaspoon of oil in same skillet.  Add onions and stir-fry until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.  Add mushrooms and stir-fry until mushrooms and onions are almost tender, about 2 minutes.

Stir in ginger and garlic and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Stir in carrots, bean sprouts and any juices that have accumulated on scallop plate; stir-fry until carrots and sprouts have softened slightly, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat and stir in soy sauce and lemon juice.

To serve, spoon 1/2 cup of vegetable mixture onto each of 4 plates.  Top each with 5 scallops.  Garnish with remaining scallion and carrot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 8

Comments:  The secret to perfectly browned scallops is to pat them dry before sautÈing.  Try this recipe with shrimp instead of scallops, or a combination of the two.

Heat 2 teaspoons of oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add scallops in a single layer and cook until bottoms are browned, about 2 minutes.  Flip and cook until bottoms are browned and scallops are just cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes more; remove to a plate.

Heat remaining teaspoon of oil in same skillet.  Add onions and stir-fry until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.  Add mushrooms and stir-fry until mushrooms and onions are almost tender, about 2 minutes.

Stir in ginger and garlic and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Stir in carrots, bean sprouts and any juices that have accumulated on scallop plate; stir-fry until carrots and sprouts have softened slightly, about 1 minute.  Remove from heat and stir in soy sauce and lemon juice.

To serve, spoon 1/2 cup of vegetable mixture onto each of 4 plates.  Top each with 5 scallops.  Garnish with remaining scallion and carrot.

Comments:  The secret to perfectly browned scallops is to pat them dry before sautÈing.  Try this recipe with shrimp instead of scallops, or a combination of the two.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     3/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic salt
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper -- or to taste
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice -- divided
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken thighs -- about 6 thighs
  1 1/2         medium  mangoes - (or 1 large) -- diced
  1 1/2         medium  shallots - (or 1 large) -- finely chopped
  1 1/2         medium  jalapeno peppers - (or 1 large) -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced - (do not touch seeds with
                        bare hands)
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh cilantro
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste

Preheat grill to medium heat.

Combine cinnamon, allspice, thyme, garlic salt, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper and 1 tablespoon of lime juice on a plate; mix to a paste.  Brush both sides of chicken with seasoning paste; set aside for 10 minutes to allow flavors to blend.

Meanwhile, combine mango, shallot, jalapeÒo, cilantro, remaining tablespoon of lime juice and 1/8 teaspoon of salt in a bowl.

Place chicken on preheated grill. Grill for 10 minutes; flip over and grill until cooked through, about 6 minutes more.  Cut each chicken thigh in half to serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 3 pieces of chicken (1 1/2 thighs total) and about 1/2 cup of salsa per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  Get crafty with leftovers!  If you're only cooking for 2 people, still make this recipe for 4 servings.  Then combine the leftover chicken with 2 cups of arugula and 1 cup of cooked asparagus for an entrÈe salad another night.

     1/2      teaspoon  garlic salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pound  boneless skinless turkey breast -- cut 1" chunks
  1             medium  garlic clove -- minced
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  14 1/2        ounces  canned diced fire-roasted tomatoes with
                        green chilies -- undrained
  15            ounces  canned black beans -- drained, rinsed
  2               cups  canned chicken broth
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  cilantro -- fresh, minced

Combine allspice, cayenne, ginger, garlic salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper in a medium bowl.  Add turkey and toss to coat; set aside for 15 minutes.

Place turkey in a 5-quart slow cooker; add any spices remaining in bowl.  Add garlic, onion, tomatoes, beans, broth, salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon of pepper; stir.  Cover and cook on LOW setting for 6 to 7 hours.  Stir in lime juice and cilantro; let sit for 5 minutes for flavors to blend.

  16            ounces  fat-free canned refried beans
  3             medium  Haas avocados -- finely mashed

                     Lemon-Ginger Passover Asparagus

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  asparagus -- tough ends snapped o
  2        tablespoons  fat-free chicken broth
                        = (use a highly-flavored broth if
                        possible)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated ginger root
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  minced scallions
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Bring 1 to 2 inches of water to a boil in a medium skillet.  Place asparagus in skillet, reduce heat to medium and cook until asparagus are crisp-tender, about 6 to 8 minutes; drain well.

Place asparagus in a large glass bowl.  Combine broth, ginger, lemon juice, scallion, salt and pepper together in a cup; pour over asparagus.  Set aside for 30 minutes to marinate.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 1/4 of asparagus per serving.

Comments:  This lemon-ginger marinade is also excellent with broccoli rabe, a bold-tasting member of the broccoli family.  Cook it as you would the asparagus.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     dried ancho peppers -- stems removed,
                        and seeds shaken out
  2               cups  water
  8              large  garlic cloves -- not peeled
  1         tablespoon  chopped canned chipotle peppers
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped (1 1/2 cups)
  2        tablespoons  canned tomato paste
  1 1/2         pounds  lean beef round -- cut 1 1/2" cubes
  2              large  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces - (abt 1 cup)
  12             small  uncooked new red potatoes -- scrubbed, not
                        peeled, halved
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt

Cut open ancho chilies with kitchen scissors so they lay flat.  Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and toast chilies, pressing them flat with a spatula, for 30 seconds per side.  Place chilies in a large bowl with water; set aside.

Add garlic to same skillet and roast in its skin, letting skin blacken, turning as needed, about 4 to 5 minutes.  When garlic is cool enough to handle, remove skin.

Remove chilies from water and reserve liquid.

Place soaked chilies, chipotle, peeled garlic and 3/4 cup of reserved water in a blender container.  Blend on high, pulsing on and off, to make a smooth sauce.  Add more water as necessary to make a loose sauce; set aside until ready to use.

Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cook until onions begin to brown, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Add tomato paste and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more.  Pour chile-garlic sauce over onions and stir to combine.

Add beef, carrots and potatoes to pot; stir.  Cover and cook for 30 minutes; remove cover and stir.  (If stew seems dry, add a 1/4 cup more water.)  Season with cumin, cinnamon and salt; stir, reduce heat to low, place cover back on pot and cook until potatoes and carrots are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes more.

This recipe yields 6 servings; about 1 1/2 cups per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 8

Comments:  This chile-garlic sauce is so good that you'll want to scoop it up with the stew's potatoes.

  1              large  sweet potato -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  14 1/2        ounces  canned diced fire-roasted tomatoes -- undrained
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice

Turn on a stovetop burner and place poblano chile over open flame; carefully turn to char on all sides.  Place poblano in a plastic or paper bag; close bag and set aside 10 minutes to steam.  Rub poblano skin off with hands under cold running water; core, seed and dice poblano.  (Note: If you have an electric range, broil poblano on high, 3 inches from flame, turning occasionally, until charred on all sides.  Follow remaining directions above.)

Place pork in a 5-quart slow cooker.  Add broth, sweet potato, onion, poblano chile, tomatoes, cumin, salt and pepper; stir.  Cover and cook on LOW setting for 6 to 7 hours.  Add lime juice and stir well.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 1/2 cups per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  Ready for Cinco de Mayo?  Turn up the heat in this Mexican stew by stirring in a quarter- to half-cup of your favorite salsa just before serving.  Then add a dollop of fat-free sour cream as a garnish to cool the palette.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pieces  corn on the cob -- shucked, and
                        split in half
     1/4         pound  uncooked string beans -- trimmed

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  grape tomatoes -- halved
                        = (opt for small tomatoes)
     3/4        medium  jalapeÒo pepper - (or 1 small) -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped red onion
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  1 1/4      teaspoons  table salt -- or to taste
  1 1/4      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper -- or to taste
  1         tablespoon  mint leaves -- fresh, chopped
  1              pound  uncooked boneless skinless chicken breasts -- thinly sliced
                        into about 8 pieces
  1            serving  lemon-flavored cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/2        medium  lemon -- cut into 4 wedges

To prepare salsa:  Combine tomatoes, jalapeÒo, onion, vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper in a small bowl; sprinkle on mint and set aside while preparing chicken.

Sprinkle each slice of chicken breast with 1/8 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon of pepper.  Coat a large heavy-bottomed ridged grill pan with cooking spray.  Heat over medium-high heat for 1 minute.

Arrange chicken in single layer on pan.  Cook over medium-high heat until chicken turns white around edges, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Flip and cook second side until chicken is cooked through, about 1 to 2 minutes more.  (Note: Cut back on prep time by purchasing thinly sliced chicken breast from your supermarket meat case.)

Arrange chicken in overlapping slices on a serving plate; spoon on salsa and garnish with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 3 ounces of chicken and 1/2 cup of salsa per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 3

Comments:  For a fruity variation on this savory salsa, substitute 2 cups of sliced fresh strawberries for the tomatoes.  Just be sure the strawberries are very juicy and sweet.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/8      teaspoon  table salt
  3        tablespoons  reduced-calorie margarine -- stick-variety
  2        tablespoons  reduced-fat peanut butter
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1              large  egg white
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2           servings  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)

Combine flour, baking soda and salt in a small bowl; mix well and set aside.

Combine margarine and peanut butter in a mixing bowl; beat on medium speed until blended and smooth.  Gradually add both sugars and beat until blended; add egg white and vanilla and beat until smooth.  While beating on low speed, gradually add flour mixture and mix until just blended.

Transfer dough to a large piece of plastic wrap and roll into an 8-inch log.  Wrap log in plastic wrap and freeze for 2 hours.  (Note: You can make the cookie dough up to 3 days in advance and freeze until ready to bake.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat 2 large baking sheets with cooking spray.

Remove cookie dough from freezer and slice crosswise into about twenty-four 1/3-inch-thick slices; place slices 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets.  Bake until golden around edges, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool completely.

This recipe yields 24 servings; 1 cookie per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 1

Comments:  Who says peanut butter's off-limits on a diet?  Our freezer cookies are such a treat, they'll easily become a family favorite.

Flavor Booster:  Browned margarine has a nutty flavor that enhances a peanut butter cookie.  Melt the margarine in a small skillet until it sizzles and just begins to brown.  Remove from heat and freeze for 20 minutes, or until firm, before using in recipe.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pancakes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
  1              large  egg yolk
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest -- finely grated
  1                cup  buttermilk
  2              large  egg whites
     3/4          cups  raspberries
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/4           cup  reduced-sugar raspberry jam
  1                cup  fat-free vanilla yogurt

Sift together flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.  Whisk together egg yolk, zest and buttermilk in a small bowl; set aside.

Beat egg whites with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.

Stir buttermilk mixture into flour mixture; fold in egg whites and raspberries.

Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and warm over medium heat.  Ladle 3 tablespoons of batter onto hot skillet to make each hotcake.  Cook until bottom is set and golden brown, about 2 minutes; flip and cook until firm, about 2 to 3 minutes more.  Set aside and keep hot.  Repeat with remaining batter.

Serve hotcakes topped with raspberry jam and yogurt.

This recipe yields 4 servings; three 3-inch hotcakes, 1/4 cup of yogurt and 1 tablespoon of jam per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  Our hotcakes are as light as air.  The trick?  Taking the time to beat the egg whites separately.

  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  1              pound  snapper fillets -- four 4-oz pieces
  2           teaspoon  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped (1 1/2 cups)
  1              large  green pepper -- chopped (abt 1 cup)

                         Rhubarb Upside-Down Cake

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 18    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar - (unpacked)
  1 1/3           cups  rhubarb -- cut 1/2" pieces
  18 1/4        ounces  unprepared yellow cake mix
  2          teaspoons  orange zest
  1         tablespoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
     1/2           cup  fat-free creamer
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  fat-free egg substitute
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Place butter in a 9- by 13-inch nonstick baking pan and put in oven to melt.  Remove from oven and sprinkle brown sugar evenly over melted butter; spread rhubarb evenly over sugar.  (Note: If using frozen rhubarb, do not defrost.)

In a large bowl, whisk together cake mix, zest, ginger and cinnamon; add juice, creamer, oil and egg substitute.  Beat on low for 30 seconds.  Increase mixer to medium and beat for 2 minutes more.  (Note: If you do not get 1/2 cup of orange juice from your orange, make up the remainder with extra creamer.)

Pour cake mix batter over rhubarb and carefully smooth top with back of a wooden spoon.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Loosen cake sides by running a knife around edges.  Turn upside down onto a cooling rack set over a sheet pan to catch any drippings.  Cool to room temperature, sprinkle with powered sugar and slice into 18 pieces.

This recipe yields 18 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  Fresh rhubarb is a delicious spring treat.  But frozen rhubarb works well in this recipe, too, so you can enjoy this scrumptious cake all year long.

Place butter in a 9- by 13-inch nonstick baking pan and put in oven to melt.  Remove from oven and sprinkle brown sugar evenly over melted butter; spread rhubarb evenly over sugar.  (Note: If using frozen rhubarb, do not defrost.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, whisk together cake mix, zest, ginger and cinnamon; add juice, creamer, oil and egg substitute.  Beat on low for 30 seconds.  Increase mixer to medium and beat for 2 minutes more.  (Note: If you do not get 1/2 cup of orange juice from your orange, make up the remainder with extra creamer.)

<DirT>
Pour cake mix batter over rhubarb and carefully smooth top with back of a wooden spoon.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Loosen cake sides by running a knife around edges.  Turn upside down onto a cooling rack set over a sheet pan to catch any drippings.  Cool to room temperature, sprinkle with powered sugar and slice into 18 pieces.

This recipe yields 18 servings.

Comments:  Fresh rhubarb is a delicious spring treat.  But frozen rhubarb works well in this recipe, too, so you can enjoy this scrumptious cake all year long.

              Roasted Onion, Chickpea And Wheat Berry Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  uncooked wheat berries
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  2              large  onions -- coarsely chopped
  2               cups  canned chickpeas -- drained, rinsed
     1/3           cup  vegetable broth
  1           teaspoon  table salt -- or to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper -- or to taste
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh parsley, cilantro or mint
                        = (or a combination of all 3)

To prepare wheat berries, place berries in a bowl and pour in enough water to cover them by several inches; let soak for at least 12 hours.

Next, heat 4 cups of water to boiling in a medium saucepan.  Drain wheat berries and add to saucepan; simmer gently until wheat berries are tender, about 45 to 60 minutes.  Or skip soaking the wheat berries and increase the simmering time to about 2 hours; drain water from pan.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat a 9- by 13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.

Add onions to pan and roast, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 30 minutes.  Add wheat berries, chickpeas and broth to onions; season with salt and pepper.  Roast, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes more.

Garnish with parsley before serving.  (Note: Can be served hot or cold.)

This recipe yields 6 servings; about a heaping 3/4 cup per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  This wheat berry salad, with a nutty taste and a chewy, wild rice texture, is delicious served hot as a side dish or cold as a grain salad.  The sweetness of the roasted onions lends an especially nice flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  reduced-calorie mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
  3        tablespoons  water
  1             medium  scallion -- minced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
  15            ounces  canned black beans -- rinsed, drained

  1             medium  sweet red pepper -- cut thin strips
  8               cups  romaine lettuce in thick shreds

To make dressing, whisk mayonnaise, cilantro, water, scallion, lime juice, sugar and chili powder together in a small bowl until smooth.  Transfer to a jar or a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate until ready to use.

In a large bowl or food storage container, layer remaining ingredients in order listed.  Cover and refrigerate.  (Note: Storing this salad in layers instead of tossing it immediately and keeping the dressing separate helps to keep the salad fresh.  It can be stored up to 4 days in the refrigerator.)

To serve, spoon salad ingredients into a bowl, shake dressing and then drizzle over salad; toss.

This recipe yields 8 servings; about 2 cups of salad and 1 1/2 tablespoons of dressing per serving.

Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  1              large  garlic clove -- chopped
  12            ounces  uncooked boneless skinless chicken breasts -- four 3-oz pieces
  15 1/2        ounces  canned black beans -- drained, rinsed
  1             medium  sweet red pepper -- chopped
  1                cup  cherry tomatoes -- cut in half each
  3             medium  scallions -- sliced
  1               head  romaine lettuce -- sliced 1/2" pieces
  4             ounces  canned green chili peppers -- drained, diced
  1                cup  Stonyfield Farm All Natural Fat-Free
                        Plain Yogurt
  1         tablespoon  cilantro
  1              bunch  watercress -- tough stems removed
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1              small  garlic clove

Combine lime juice, cumin, 2 tablespoons of chopped cilantro and chopped garlic in a large resealable plastic bag.  Add chicken, seal bag and shake to coat chicken.  Allow to marinate for at least 15 minutes at room temperature or up to overnight in refrigerator.

Preheat broiler or grill to medium-high heat.  Remove chicken from bag and discard marinade.  Grill chicken until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes per side; set aside until ready to assemble salad.

Combine beans, red pepper, tomatoes and scallions in a medium bowl.  Divide lettuce among 4 bowls or plates and top each with 1/4 of bean mixture.

To make dressing, combine remaining ingredients in a blender or food processor; blend until smooth, about 3 to 4 minutes.

Slice cooled chicken on the diagonal and divide among salads.  Drizzle each serving with 1/2 cup of dressing.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  The fresh, bold flavors in this entree salad are perfect for a Mother's Day luncheon.  The creamy dressing is so good that you'll want to make twice the amount for a veggie dip later in the week.

  2 1/2    tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  4          teaspoons  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  diet ginger ale

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  uncooked lean ground beef (with 7% fat)
  4        tablespoons  minced red onion
  2        tablespoons  reduced-sodium teriyaki sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/2           cup  ketchup
     1/8                sun-dried hot chile pepper - (or to taste) -- minced
  1              large  tomato -- sliced
  4              large  Romaine lettuce leaves

In a large bowl, combine beef, onion, teriyaki sauce, salt and black pepper.  Mix well and shape mixture into four patties about 1-inch thick each.

Coat a large nonstick skillet or stove-top grill pan with cooking spray and set pan over medium-high heat.  When pan is hot, add burgers and cook until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes per side.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix together ketchup and chilies.

Serve each burger with 1/4 each of tomato slices, lettuce and ketchup.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 4

Comments:  As if the teriyaki and sweet onions aren't a great enough addition to these lean beef burgers, the bold taste of chile-spiked ketchup really kicks them into high gear.

To serve, place 1 cup of lettuce on each of 4 plates.  Top each with 1 burger, 2 tablespoons of salsa, 1 onion slice, 1/4 of avocado and 1 tablespoon of remaining cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  Liven up your celebrations with our Southwest-influenced burgers.  They're fabulous made with lean ground turkey, too.

                         Texas-Style Barley Salad

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  water
     3/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/2           cup  uncooked barley
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  canned drained and rinsed black beans
     1/2           cup  halved grape tomatoes
                        = (or quartered cherry tomatoes)
     1/2        medium  Hass avocado -- diced
     1/4           cup  frozen corn kernels -- thawed
                        = (or drained canned corn)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4           cup  sliced scallions

Bring 3 cups of water and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Add barley; cover and simmer until tender, about 30 to 35 minutes.  Drain and cool.

Meanwhile, whisk together lime juice, 2 tablespoons of water, oil, cumin, pepper and remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt in a medium bowl.  Add barley, beans, tomatoes, avocado, corn, cilantro and scallions; toss to mix and coat.  Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate up to 1 day.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 1/4 cups per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  This colorful salad is also excellent made with brown rice instead of barley.  We spooned it into a hollowed-out pepper for a special presentation but tomato halves are just as attractive.

Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  extra-firm tofu -- cut six 1/2" slices
  2            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
  3        tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger root
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh garlic
  1              ounce  green hot chili peppers - (1 small pepper) -- thinly sliced
                        = (or red Thai variety)
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced shiitake mushrooms
  1              small  sweet red pepper -- sliced 1/4" pieces
  1                cup  uncooked string beans -- trimmed, and
                        cut in half
  2        tablespoons  teriyaki sauce
     1/4           cup  fresh Thai or Italian basil -- torn, plus
                        a few leaves whole for garnish
  2        tablespoons  thinly-sliced scallions on diagonal -- for garnish
  2               cups  cooked brown rice -- kept hot

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Place tofu slices on several layers of paper towels.  Cover with more paper towels and top with a cookie sheet.  Place several heavy objects (like a can or heavy pots or pans) on cookie sheet to press out water from tofu for 30 minutes.

Coat cookie sheet with cooking spray.  Cut tofu into cubes to yield 9 cubes per slice.  Place on cookie sheet and brush with 2 tablespoons of soy sauce.  Coat tofu with cooking spray and place in oven.  Roast for 25 minutes, remove from oven and set aside.

Heat oil in a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat.  Add ginger, garlic and chili; cook until fragrant, about 10 to 15 seconds.  Add mushrooms, cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add peppers and string beans; increase heat to high and cook until vegetables are cooked but still crisp, about 5 minutes.

Add remaining tablespoon of soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, basil and roasted tofu.  Cook to warm through, about 1 minute.  Garnish with scallions and basil.  Serve with rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings; about 1 3/4 cups of tofu mixture and 1/2 cup of rice per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 6

Comments:  If you think tofu has no taste, think again!  We pressed out its water and then roasted it with soy sauce to create a wonderful dense texture and a delicious, smoky flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  table salt -- divided
  1                cup  uncooked whole-wheat couscous
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  canola oil
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin

     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh red onion

Bring 1 cup of water and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to a boil in a small saucepan; remove from heat.  Add couscous; cover and let stand until water is absorbed and couscous is tender, about 5 minutes.  Fluff couscous with a fork; cool to room temperature.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry
                Turkey

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  green cabbage head
  12            ounces  uncooked ground turkey breast
     1/2           cup  diced onion
     1/2           cup  cooked brown rice -- regular or instant
  1              large  egg
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  table salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  28            ounces  canned diced tomatoes
  1                cup  fat-free reduced-sodium chicken broth

Remove 8 outer leaves from cabbage and place leaves in a large stockpot.  Add enough water to cover and set pan over high heat.  Bring water to a boil and boil 10 minutes, until leaves are pliable and soft.  Drain and when leaves are cool enough to handle, cut off thickest part of vein from bottom of leaves, leaving leaf intact.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine turkey, onion, rice, egg, garlic powder, cinnamon, salt and black pepper.  Mix until well blended.

Place a small amount of turkey mixture (enough to fit in the palm of your hand) onto center of each leaf.  Fold in sides of leaves and then roll up tightly from one end to other, making sure filling is fully covered by leaf.

Pour a small amount of tomatoes into bottom of stockpot (enough to cover bottom with a thin layer).  Place cabbage rolls in stockpot (pack rolls tightly to prevent opening during cooking) and pour over remaining tomatoes and chicken broth.  Set pan over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat to low, cover pan and simmer 45 minutes more.  Remove from heat and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings; 2 stuffed leaves and about 1/4 cup of sauce per serving.

PointsÆ Value: 5

Comments:  Garlic and cinnamon add savory flavor to this classic Polish recipe.  We used lean ground turkey instead of ground beef to improve its nutrition profile.  It's a delicious way to use up any leftover St. Patrick's Day cabbage.

If you do not have enough of the Grilled Summer Vegetables recipe (you need about 2 cups chopped vegetables for the wraps), make it from scratch.  If you do have enough, omit the first 8 ingredients on this recipe list and skip to step 2.

Once you have the grilled vegetables recipe made or the leftovers on hand, combine 2 cups chopped vegetables with the beans, tuna, parsley, olives, vinegar, salt and pepper in a medium bowl; mix well.

Lay tortillas on a flat surface and top with arugula.  Place 1 cup of vegetable-tuna mixture in a horizontal strip down the center of each tortilla.  Fold in bottom ends of tortillas, roll up sides and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

PointsÆ Value: 6

Comments:  Make great use of leftovers by combining our Grilled Summer Vegetables (see recipe) with tuna in this perfect picnic wrap.

  1            serving  cooking spray
                        = (5 one-second sprays per serving)
     1/2           cup  diced onions
  2               cups  sliced button mushrooms
                        = (or cremini mushrooms)
  2             medium  garlic cloves -- minced
  16            ounces  chopped frozen spinach -- thawed
  15            ounces  fat-free ricotta cheese
  1                cup  Kraft Free Shredded Mozzarella Cheese - -- (abt 4 oz)
                        = (or other brand)
  1              large  egg white
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  14            ounces  canned tomato sauce
  14            ounces  canned diced tomatoes with
                        basil, garlic and oregano
  8             ounces  uncooked whole-wheat lasagna noodles - -- (9 noodles)
  2        tablespoons  Kraft Non-Fat Grated Cheese Topping
                        = (or other brand)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and set pan over medium-high heat.  Add onion, mushrooms and garlic; sautÈ until mushroom liquid cooks off, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Add spinach; cook until liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes more.  Remove skillet from heat and transfer mixture to a large bowl.  Add ricotta, mozzarella, egg white and nutmeg; mix well to combine.
