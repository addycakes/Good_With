  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  Mori-Nu silken style tofu -- firm or extra firm
  1 1/3           cups  unbleached cane sugar
     1/3           cup  Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  1                cup  vegan chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds
                        Safflower oil -- for oiling pan

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a non-stick 9- by 13-inch baking pan, and set aside.

In a large bowl, place the flour, baking powder, and salt, stir well to combine, and set aside.

In a food processor, place the tofu, and process for 1 minute to form a smooth puree.  Add the sugar, Spectrum Spread, vanilla, and almond extract, and process an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until very smooth and creamy.

Add the tofu mixture to the dry ingredients and stir well to combine.  Fold in the chocolate chips and almonds, and transfer the mixture to the prepared baking pan.

Bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown on top and an inserted toothpick comes out clean.  Allow to cool completely before cutting into 24 bars.

This recipe yields one 9- by 13-inch pan or 24 bars.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  rolled oats
  1                cup  raw wheat germ
  1                cup  sliced almonds
  1                cup  raw sunflower seeds
     1/2           cup  flax seeds
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/2           cup  apple juice
     1/4           cup  blackstrap molasses
     1/4           cup  safflower oil
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  1           teaspoon  almond extract

Line two cookie sheets with pieces of parchment paper and set aside.

In a large bowl, place the rolled oats, wheat germ, almonds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg, and toss well to combine.

In a small bowl, place the remaining ingredients, and stir well to combine.  Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and stir well to thoroughly moisten the dry ingredients.

Transfer the granola mixture to the prepared cookie sheets, evenly dividing it between the two pans, and spreading it to form a single layer.  Bake at 300 degrees for 20 minutes.

Remove the cookie sheets from the oven, stir the granola mixture, spread it out to form a single layer again, and bake the granola mixture an additional 20 minutes.

Remove the cookie sheets from the oven, stir the granola mixture, spread it out to form a single layer again, switch the placement of the cookie sheets on the racks, and bake the granola mixture an additional 20 minutes.

Repeat the stirring and spreading procedure, as needed, until the granola mixture is dry and golden brown.  Remove the cookie sheets from the oven and set the granola aside to cool completely.

Transfer the granola to an airtight container and can store at room temperature for 4 to 6 weeks.

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

Comments: for a wheat-free variation, oat bran can be substituted for the wheat germ in the recipe.  Also dried fruits of choice may be added to cooled granola before storing.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2           cups  dried apricots -- diced
  1                cup  dates -- pitted, diced
     3/4           cup  orange juice
     1/3           cup  Sucanat
  3        tablespoons  orange zest
     1/8      teaspoon  ground ginger
                        === BASE ===
     3/4           cup  Sucanat
     3/4           cup  Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1 1/2           cups  rolled oats

Lightly oil (or spray with oil) a 9- by 13-inch baking pan and set aside.

Begin by preparing the Filling:  In a small saucepan, combine all of the filling ingredients and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until thickened, about 7 to 10 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool completely.

To prepare the Base for the bar cookies:  In a medium bowl, stir together the Sucanat and Spectrum Spread.  Add the flour, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon, and stir until well blended.  Add the oats and stir well to combine.

Transfer half of the base mixture to the prepared pan.  Using your hands, press firmly to flatten the mixture to cover the bottom of the pan.  Spread the cooled apricot-date filling over the base, then sprinkle the remaining base mixture over the filling, and pat it down lightly.

Bake at 400 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned.  Allow to cool for 5 minutes.  While still warm cut into 36 equal bars and remove them from the pan.  Store in an airtight container.

This recipe yields one 9- by 13-inch pan or 36 bars.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  sweet potatoes -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame oil - (to 4)
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin

Transfer to a large platter for service.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 2/3           cups  blueberries
     1/3           cup  unbleached cane sugar
  4          teaspoons  whole wheat flour
  4          teaspoons  lemon juice
     1/8      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2        recipe  Whole Wheat Turnover Pastry Dough -- (see recipe)
                        = (enough for 9 turnovers)

In a small bowl, place the blueberries, sugar, flour, lemon juice, and ginger, and toss gently to combine.

Prepare the dough for the turnovers.  Then cut the 5-inch and 6-inch circles of dough as described in the turnover pastry dough recipe.

On each of the prepared 6-inch circles of dough, place 3 tablespoon of the blueberry filling.  Wet the edges of the circles of dough with water, place the 5-inch circles of dough on top of the filling, press down around the edges of the dough to seal, and crimp the edges with a fork.

Use a spatula to carefully transfer the turnovers to a non-stick cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly browned.

Serve the turnovers hot or cold.  Allow them to cool completely on a rack before wrapping them individually in aluminum foil to preserve freshness.  They can also be frozen in an airtight container after baking for later use.

This recipe yields nine 6-inch turnovers.

Variation:  Other fruits and flavorings can be substituted for the blueberries such as, strawberries, raspberries, peaches, plums, apples, cherries, or vanilla, almond, maple, or mint as flavorings etc.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  broccoli -- washed well
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                can  water chestnuts - (6 oz) -- drained well
     3/4           cup  orange juice
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  tamari
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch or arrowroot
  1           teaspoon  toasted sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  unbleached cane sugar
  2        tablespoons  orange zest

Begin by cutting the tops off the broccoli, then cut them into small florets, and set aside.  Peel the stems of the broccoli, removing and discarding any tough parts; cut the stems in half lengthwise, and then thinly slice them.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        recipe  Whole Wheat Calzone Dough -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  walnuts
  2               cups  small broccoli florets
  1                cup  diced seeded red pepper
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  nutritional yeast flakes
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  dried dillweed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare the Whole Wheat Calzone Dough according to the recipe instructions through the rolling out procedures.  Cover the 4 rolled out calzones with a clean towel so that they won't dry out while preparing the filling.

In a non-stick skillet, place the walnuts, and cook over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant.  Transfer the toasted walnuts to a small bowl and set aside to cool completely.

In the same skillet, saute the broccoli and red pepper in the olive oil for 2 minutes to soften.  Roughly chop the cooled walnuts.  Add the walnuts, along with the remaining ingredients, to the skillet.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and saute the mixture an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until the vegetables are crisp tender.  Remove the skillet from the heat, set aside, and allow the mixture to cool slightly.

Divide the filling evenly among the rolled out calzones, placing it on one half of each circle of dough and leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge.  Brush a little water around the edge of each circle of dough.  Fold the dough over to enclose the filling, crimp the edges closed with your fingers, and then fold up the edges 1/2-inch to form a decorative border.

Transfer the filled calzones to a non-stick cookie sheet and bake at 450 degrees for 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Allow the calzones to cool for a few minutes before serving.  Can be served warm, cold, or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 4 calzones.

In a colander, toss together the grated butternut, red skin potatoes, parsnips, shallots, and 1 teaspoon salt, and place the colander over a large bowl to drain for 15 minutes.  Squeeze the grated vegetables with your fingers to help remove any excess moisture in the vegetables.  Drain off the watery liquid from the vegetables but reserve the starch from the vegetables that has settled to the bottom of the bowl.

Add the grated vegetables to the vegetable starch, along with the remaining ingredients, toss well to combine, and set aside for 5 minutes.

Cover the bottom of a large non-stick skillet with safflower oil and place it over medium heat.  When the oil is hot, using a 1/4-cup measuring cup, drop 4 portions into the skillet, and flatten them slightly with the back of a spatula to ensure even cooking.  Cook the pancakes over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until golden brown.  Carefully flip over the vegetable pancakes and cook an additional 3 minutes or until golden brown on the other side.

Transfer the browned vegetable pancakes to a cookie sheet and place them in a 200 degree oven to keep them warm while cooking the remainder of the vegetable pancakes.  Serve them with your choice of tofu sour cream, applesauce, or maple syrup.

This recipe yields 24 pancakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BROWNIE BASE ===
     1/3           cup  vegan chocolate chips
     3/4           cup  Veganized Powdered Sugar -- (see recipe)
     2/3           cup  Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine
  1         tablespoon  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
     1/8      teaspoon  peppermint extract
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === CANDY CANE FROSTING ===
     1/3           cup  vegan cream cheese
     1/4           cup  Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine
     1/8      teaspoon  peppermint extract
  3 1/2           cups  Veganized Powdered Sugar -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  chopped peppermint candy canes

Begin by preparing the brownie base.  Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a 9- by 13-inch baking pan and set aside.

In a double boiler or in the microwave, melt the chocolate chips, and set aside to cool.

In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, Spectrum Spread, soy milk, vanilla, and peppermint extract until light and fluffy.  Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into the wet ingredients, and whisk until well combined.  Add the melted chocolate chips and whisk until just blended.

Transfer the batter to the prepared pan.  Bake at 325 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.

Allow the brownie base to cool completely.  While it is cooling, prepare the frosting.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the vegan cream cheese, Spectrum Spread, and peppermint extract until light and fluffy.  Add the Veganized Powdered Sugar and beat until smooth and creamy.  Add the chopped candy canes and whisk until just blended.  Spread the frosting evenly over the cooled brownie base and place in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes.

Cut with a very sharp warm knife into 48 bars.  Best when served within 1 to 2 days of preparing.  Store in an airtight container with waxed paper between the layers.

This recipe yields one 9- by 13-inch pan or 48 bars.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  cannellini beans -- sorted, rinsed
  1                     bay leaf
  1         tablespoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  rubbed sage
                        Water -- as needed
  3               cups  diced onion
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes -- (optional)

In a large pot, place the cannellini beans, bay leaf, thyme, and sage, add enough water to cover the beans by two inches, and bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until beans are tender.

Drain any extra cooking liquid from the beans and save for use in soups or stews.  Return the cooked beans to the pot, remove the bay leaf and discard it, and set beans aside.

In a non-stick skillet, saute the onion in olive oil for 7 minutes or until lightly browned.  Add the garlic and saute an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until both are tender.

Add the sauteed onion mixture and remaining ingredients to the cooked beans, and stir well to combine.  Taste and adjust seasonings, if needed.  Add a little of the cooking liquid, if desired, for a moister product.  Transfer to a large bowl for service.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  dried cherries
     1/2           cup  apple juice
     1/2           cup  walnuts -- roughly chopped
                        === CRUST ===
  3        tablespoons  vegan margarine
  2        tablespoons  apple juice
  2        tablespoons  maple sugar crystals or
                        unbleached cane sugar
                        = (or white sugar from sugar beets)
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/2           cup  whole wheat flour
  2        tablespoons  oat bran
  2        tablespoons  wheat germ or wheat bran
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
                        Safflower oil -- for oiling pan
                        Veganized Powdered Sugar II -- (see recipe)

In a small saucepan, place the dried cherries and apple juice, and set aside to soak for 20 minutes.

Place the saucepan over low heat and simmer the mixture for 10 minutes.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to cool for 5 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor, and process for 1 to 2 minutes or until smooth.  Add the walnuts, pulse a few times to combine, and set mixture aside.

To prepare the Crust:  In a medium bowl, place the margarine, apple juice, sugar, vanilla, and almond extract, and stir until smooth.  Add the remaining ingredients and stir well to form a crumb-like dough.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or mist with oil) a 9-inch square baking pan.  Place 3/4 cup of the crust mixture in the prepared pan, and using your hands, press it firmly to cover the bottom of the pan.  Bake at 325 degrees for 15 minutes.  Remove the pan from the oven and allow it to cool for 3 minutes.

Carefully spread the cherry filling over the prepared crust, and then sprinkle the remaining crust mixture over the top of the cherry filling.  Return the pan to the oven and bake an additional 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown on top.  Allow the bars to cool completely before cutting into 16 pieces.  Sprinkle a little Veganized Powdered Sugar II over the tops of the bars before serving.

This recipe yields one 9-inch pan or 16 pieces.

Comments:  To create other variations of the bars, you can substitute other dried berries or fruits for the dried cherries in the filling.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  hazelnuts
  2               cups  whole-wheat pastry flour
  1                cup  unbleached flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  maple syrup
     2/3           cup  safflower oil -- divided
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  2               cups  vegan chocolate chips

Place the hazelnuts on a cookie sheet and bake at 325 degrees for 15 minutes or until fragrant.  Remove the hazelnuts from the oven and increase the temperature of the oven to 350 degrees.

Allow the hazelnuts to cool slightly, then place them on a towel, enclose them with the towel, and rub the hazelnuts with the towel to loosen their skin.  Transfer the hazelnuts to a cutting board, roughly chop them, and set aside.

In a large bowl, stir together both types of flour, baking powder, and salt.  In a small bowl, place the maple syrup, 1/2 cups safflower oil, vanilla, and almond extract, and whisk well to combine.  Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir well to combine.  Fold the chopped hazelnuts into the dough.

Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper and set one aside for later use.  On the remaining cookie sheet, shape the dough into two logs that are 2 1/2 inches wide.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until golden brown and feel firm and dry.  Remove them from the oven and allow them to cool slightly.

When cool enough to handle, transfer the logs to a cutting board, and cut diagonally into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Divide the slices between the two cookie sheets, standing them upright, and spacing them an inch apart.  Bake an additional 15 to 20 minutes or until dry and crisp.  Allow cookies to cool.

While the cookies are cooling, prepare the chocolate coating.  In the top of a double boiler, place the chocolate chips and remaining 2 tablespoon safflower oil, and cook over low heat until chocolate chips have melted.  Stir the melted chocolate chip mixture until smooth.

Dip one of the cut sides of each biscotti into the melted chocolate and then place them chocolate-side up on a rack.  When you have finished coating all of the biscotti, place the rack in the refrigerator to allow the chocolate coating to harden fully.  Store the biscotti in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 20 to 24 biscotti.

                Vegan                           Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  unbleached flour
  1           teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  water
  1         tablespoon  Ener-G Egg Replacer
     1/2           cup  Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine
     1/2           cup  unbleached cane sugar
  1         tablespoon  soy milk
                        = (rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
                        Veganized Powdered Sugar -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  vegan chocolate chips
     1/2           cup  raspberry, cherry, or red currant jelly

In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt, and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the water and egg replacer, and whisk vigorously for 1 minute or until very frothy (almost like beaten egg whites).  Add the Spectrum Spread, sugar, soy milk, and vanilla, and stir until light and fluffy.

Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, and stir until well combined.  Cover and chill for several hours or overnight.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.  Transfer the chilled dough to a floured work surface and divide into thirds.  Work with one-third of the dough at a time and keep the remainder chilled until ready to use.

Roll out the dough to 1/2-inch thickness.  Using a 3-inch star-shaped cookie cutter, cut the dough into an even number of stars, and using a 1-inch round cookie cutter, cut a circle out of the center of half of the stars.  Using a spatula, transfer the cookie stars to the prepared cookie sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart.

Bake the cookies at 425 degrees for 3 to 5 minutes or until set and the edges are lightly browned.  Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheets for several minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.

Repeat the rolling, cutting, and baking procedures with the remaining cookie dough.  Lightly sprinkle Veganized Powdered Sugar over the star cookies with the holes in the center.

In a double boiler, place the chocolate chips, cook over medium heat until the chips begin to melt, and then stir until smooth.

To assemble each cookie:  Place 1 teaspoon of the melted chocolate chip mixture in the center of the solid star cookies, gently working the melted chocolate chip mixture to the edges of the cookies.  Place 1 teaspoon raspberry jelly in the center of the chocolate covering, carefully placing a sugar coated star cookie on top, so that the jelly shows through the cut out circle and the points of the star are lined up.  Allow cookies to sit until the melted chocolate hardens.  Store in an airtight container and place waxed paper between the layers of cookies.

This recipe yields 4 dozen.

In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, combine the water and egg replacer, and whisk vigorously for 1 minute or until very frothy (almost like beaten egg whites).  Add the Spectrum Spread, sugar, soy milk, and vanilla, and stir until light and fluffy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, and stir until well combined.  Cover and chill for several hours or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.  Transfer the chilled dough to a floured work surface and divide into thirds.  Work with one-third of the dough at a time and keep the remainder chilled until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roll out the dough to 1/2-inch thickness.  Using a 3-inch star-shaped cookie cutter, cut the dough into an even number of stars, and using a 1-inch round cookie cutter, cut a circle out of the center of half of the stars.  Using a spatula, transfer the cookie stars to the prepared cookie sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the cookies at 425 degrees for 3 to 5 minutes or until set and the edges are lightly browned.  Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheets for several minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Repeat the rolling, cutting, and baking procedures with the remaining cookie dough.  Lightly sprinkle Veganized Powdered Sugar over the star cookies with the holes in the center.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a double boiler, place the chocolate chips, cook over medium heat until the chips begin to melt, and then stir until smooth.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble each cookie:  Place 1 teaspoon of the melted chocolate chip mixture in the center of the solid star cookies, gently working the melted chocolate chip mixture to the edges of the cookies.  Place 1 teaspoon raspberry jelly in the center of the chocolate covering, carefully placing a sugar coated star cookie on top, so that the jelly shows through the cut out circle and the points of the star are lined up.  Allow cookies to sit until the melted chocolate hardens.  Store in an airtight container and place waxed paper between the layers of cookies.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  warm water
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
     1/2           cup  Sucanat -- divided
                        = (or brown sugar from sugar beets)
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached flour
     1/2           cup  soy flour
  3        tablespoons  arrowroot
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
     1/8      teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4           cup  vegan tofu sour cream
     1/4           cup  non-hydrogenated vegan margarine -- divided

Line two cookie sheets with pieces of parchment paper and set aside.

In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the warm water and yeast, stir to dissolve the yeast, and set aside until bubbly, about 10 to 15 minutes.

In a small bowl, place 1/3 cup of Sucanat and cinnamon, stir well, and set aside.

In a large bowl, place the flour, soy flour, the remaining Sucanat, arrowroot, salt, and baking soda, and stir well to combine.  Add the yeast mixture, sour cream, and 2 tablespoons of the margarine, and stir well to form a soft dough.

Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead, adding additional flour if needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Roll the dough into a 24- by 6-inch rectangle.

Spread the remaining 2 tablespoons of margarine over the entire surface, sprinkle the reserved Sucanat-cinnamon mixture lengthwise over one half of the dough, and then fold the other half of the dough over to enclose the cinnamon filling.  Using your fingers, gently press around all the edges to seal.  Using a sharp knife or pastry wheel cutter, cut the dough into 24 1-inch strips.

To shape the twists:  Hold one of the cut strips at both ends, twist in opposite directions, place on the prepared cookie sheets, and press both ends of the twist to the parchment paper to help them keep their shape.

Repeat the shaping procedure for the remaining strips and space them 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets.  Cover the cookie sheets with clean towels, place in a warm place, and set them aside to rise for 1 hour.

Carefully remove the towels and then bake at 375 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  Store completely cooled cinnamon twists in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  walnuts
     3/4           cup  dates -- pitted
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
  1 3/4           cups  shredded coconut -- divided

     3/4           cup  Sucanat
                        = (or brown sugar from sugar beets)
     1/3           cup  apple juice or water
  3        tablespoons  lecithin granules
                        Safflower oil -- for oiling sheets

In a food processor, place the walnuts, and process for 30 to 60 seconds to finely grind them.  Transfer the ground walnuts to a medium bowl.

Place the dates in the food processor, process them for 30 to 60 seconds to finely grind them, and add the ground dates to the ground walnuts.  Add the cinnamon and ginger to the bowl and toss all of the ingredients together.

Place 3/4 cup of the coconut and 1/3 cup rolled oats in a bowl, toss them together, and set aside.  Add the remaining coconut and rolled oats, along with the remaining ingredients, to the walnut mixture, and stir well to combine.

Using your hands, roll the mixture into 1-inch balls, and then roll the balls in the reserved coconut-rolled oats mixture to thoroughly coat them on all sides.  Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or mist with oil) two non-stick cookie sheets.

Working in batches, place the coconut-coated balls on the prepared cookies sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart, and bake them at 350 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes or until the coconut is golden brown.  Allow the cookies to cool completely on the cookie sheets.  Repeat the baking procedure for the remaining coconut-coated balls.  Store the cookies in an airtight container.

This recipe yields 3 to 3 1/2 dozen.

Rinse the saucepan.  Then in the same saucepan, place the carrots and water, and bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes or until the carrots are tender.  Drain any remaining water from the carrots and transfer the cooked carrots to a glass bowl.

Pour the sugar-vinegar mixture over the carrots, add the chopped parsley, and toss gently to combine.  Allow the flavors to blend for at least 10 minutes before serving.  Serve hot, at room temperature, or chill overnight for added flavor.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  red skin potatoes -- washed well,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
                        Water -- as needed
  2               cups  diced red onion
  1                cup  diced shallot
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  garlic -- minced
  1                cup  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
     1/3           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a large pot, place the cubed potatoes, cover them with water, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender.

Meanwhile, in a non-stick skillet, saute the red onion and shallot in olive oil for 7 to 10 minutes or until lightly browned and very soft.  Add the garlic and saute an additional 2 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.

When the potatoes are tender, drain them, reserving the cooking liquid for making soup or for use in another dish, and return the cooked potatoes to the pot.  Add the sauteed vegetables and remaining ingredients to the potatoes.

Using a potato masher, roughly mash all of the ingredients together, making the mixture as smooth or chunky as desired.  Taste and add additional salt or pepper, if desired.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  pine nuts
  2               cups  vegetable stock
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  saffron threads
     1/2           cup  diced onion
     1/2           cup  diced seeded red pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  long-grain rice -- rinsed
     1/2           cup  frozen peas -- thawed
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley

Place the pine nuts on a non-stick cookie sheet and bake at 325 degrees for 3 to 5 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant.  Remove the cookie sheet from the oven, transfer the toasted pine nuts to a small bowl, and set aside.

In a small saucepan, place the vegetable stock, salt, pepper, and saffron, and bring to a simmer.

In a medium saucepan, saute the onion and red pepper in olive oil for 3 to 5 minutes until soft.  Add the garlic and saute an additional 1 minute.

Add the rice, stir well so that the grains of rice are thoroughly coated with the olive oil, and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until the rice is translucent.  Add the simmering broth to the rice mixture and stir well to combine.  Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 15 minutes or until all of the liquid is absorbed.

Remove the saucepan from the heat, leave covered, and set aside for 5 minutes to allow the rice to steam.  Fluff the rice with a fork.  Add the toasted pine nuts, peas, and parsley, and gently stir them into the rice.  Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed.  Transfer to a bowl or platter for service.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  If you are unable to obtain saffron threads, substitute 1/4 teaspoon turmeric for the saffron threads in the recipe, to achieve the same golden color in the pilaf.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  beets -- peeled, and
                        cut into wedges
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  6              large  garlic cloves - (to 7) -- unpeeled

Lightly oil a 9- by 13-inch casserole dish.  Place the beets in the bottom of the casserole dish and drizzle the olive oil over them.  Sprinkle the chopped thyme, salt, red pepper flakes, and pepper over the top, and lightly toss the beets to evenly coat them with the oil and seasonings.  Spread them out to evenly distribute them in the casserole dish.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, stir, and bake an additional 20 minutes.

Add the cloves of garlic to the pan and bake an additional 20 to 30 minutes or until the beets are tender and the garlic is soft.  Remove the cloves of garlic from the pan, and when cool enough to handle, peel them.

Place the garlic cloves in a small bowl and mash them with a fork.  Remove some of the oil that collected on the bottom of the pan, add it to the mashed garlic, and stir to form a smooth puree.  Pour the mixture over the beets and toss well to combine.  Transfer to a large bowl for service.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Lightly oil a 9- by 13-inch casserole dish.  Place the beets in the bottom of the casserole dish and drizzle the olive oil over them.  Sprinkle the chopped thyme, salt, red pepper flakes, and pepper over the top, and lightly toss the beets to evenly coat them with the oil and seasonings.  Spread them out to evenly distribute them in the casserole dish.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, stir, and bake an additional 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the cloves of garlic to the pan and bake an additional 20 to 30 minutes or until the beets are tender and the garlic is soft.  Remove the cloves of garlic from the pan, and when cool enough to handle, peel them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the garlic cloves in a small bowl and mash them with a fork.  Remove some of the oil that collected on the bottom of the pan, add it to the mashed garlic, and stir to form a smooth puree.  Pour the mixture over the beets and toss well to combine.  Transfer to a large bowl for service.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Water -- as needed
  1                cup  whole raw almonds
  2             pounds  green beans -- ends trimmed,
                        and strings removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley
  2          teaspoons  freshly-chopped thyme

Begin by blanching the almonds.  In a small saucepan, place 3 inches of water, and bring to a boil.  Add the almonds and cook for 1 minute.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside for 3 minutes to cool.

Remove the almonds from the water, squeeze each almond between your thumb and forefinger to remove the skin, and set them aside for 5 minutes to dry and cool.  Using a sharp knife, split the almonds in half lengthwise, and set aside.

Place the green beans in a large steamer basket and steam for 3 to 5 minutes or until tender.  Transfer the steamed green beans to a large bowl.  Season the green beans to taste with salt and pepper, toss gently, and set aside.

In a non-stick skillet, place the olive oil and halved almonds, and cook the mixture over medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes or until the almonds are golden brown.  Remove the skillet from the heat, add the remaining ingredients, and stir well to combine.

Pour the hot almond mixture over the green beans and toss well to thoroughly coat the beans with the mixture.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  whole grain bread or bread of choice
  1             recipe  Creamy White Uncheez Sauce or
                        Non-Dairy Swiss Style Cheese -- sliced or shredded

Cook each sandwich for 2 to 3 minutes or until lightly browned on the bottom, carefully flip over, and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until lightly browned on the remaining side.

Transfer the grilled cheese sandwiches to a cutting board and if using the Creamy White Uncheez Sauce, allow to cool 1 minute before cutting in half for service.  Repeat the cooking procedure for the remaining sandwiches.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variation:  Add fresh or sauteed vegetables such as onions, tomatoes, peppers, spinach, mushrooms, or sprouts when assembling the grilled cheese sandwiches, for added flavor.

  2               cups  diced onion
  2        tablespoons  safflower oil -- divided
  1 1/2           cups  diced seeded green pepper
     1/4           cup  diced seeded jalapeÒo pepper

In the same skillet, saute the tempeh in the remaining 1 tablespoon safflower oil for 7 to 8 minutes or until lightly browned.  Add the tamari and saute an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until all of the liquid is absorbed.  Remove the skillet from the heat.

When the beans are tender, remove the bay leaf and discard it.  Transfer the beans to a 2 1/2-quart ovenproof casserole dish or Dutch oven.  Add the reserved sauteed vegetable and tempeh mixtures, along with the remaining ingredients, and stir well to combine.

Cover the casserole dish with a lid or aluminum foil.  Bake at 300 degrees for 1 hour, remove the lid or aluminum foil, and bake an additional 30 minutes.  Serve hot or cold.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  sourdough bread
  4          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  2                     Granny Smith or Golden Delicious apples -- unpeeled, cored,

                        triangular pieces

Place the slices of sourdough bread on a cutting board and cut each slice diagonally in half.  Transfer the bread triangles to a non-stick cookie sheet and place them under the broiler to lightly toast the bread on one side.

Remove the cookie sheet from the oven, flip over the slices of bread so that the untoasted side is facing up, and allow them to cool slightly.

Cut each quarter of apple into 4 slices and set aside.

To assemble the melts:  On each of the untoasted sides of bread, spread 1/2 teaspoon of the mustard, place 4 slices of apple fanning them out slightly to cover the bread, lay 2 tablespoons of the sprouts over the apples, and top with a triangle of soy cheese.

Place the cookie sheet back under the broiler and broil an additional 3 to 4 minutes or until the cheese is well melted.  Serve 2 melt triangles per person.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  navy beans -- sorted, rinsed
  6               cups  water
  1                     bay leaf
  2               cups  finely-diced onion
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2               cups  sweet apple cider
                        = (or apple juice)
  2               cups  diced unpeeled apple
     1/2           cup  golden raisins

  1           teaspoon  curry powder

In a large pot, combine the beans, water, and bay leaf, and bring to a boil.  Allow the beans to boil for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to medium, and cook the beans for 1 to 2 hours or until tender.

Meanwhile, in a non-stick skillet, saute the onion in the olive oil for 5 minutes or until soft and slightly browned.  Add the garlic and saute an additional minute.  Remove from the heat and set aside.

When the beans are tender, drain them, saving their cooking liquid for making soup, and discard the bay leaf.  Transfer the beans to a 2 1/2-quart casserole dish or Dutch oven.  Add the reserved onion mixture, the remaining ingredients, and stir well to combine.

Cover the casserole dish with a lid or aluminum foil.  Bake at 300 degrees for 1 hour, remove the lid or aluminum foil, and bake an additional 30 minutes.  Serve hot or cold.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     Italian rolls or Sesame Seed Buns -- (see recipe)
                        = (or other rolls of choice)
  6                     romaine lettuce leaves -- washed, patted dry
                        = (or other lettuce of choice)
  1 1/2           cups  sliced red onion
  2               cups  julienned green pepper
  2               cups  sliced peeled cucumber

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  finely-diced onion
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-diced carrot
     1/2           cup  finely-diced red pepper
     1/2           cup  finely-diced zucchini
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1 1/2       teaspoon  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  rubbed sage
  2               cans  Roman beans - (15 oz ea) -- drained, rinsed
  3        tablespoons  tamari
                        = (or soy sauce or Bragg Liquid Aminos)
  3        tablespoons  ketchup
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  rolled oats (not instant)
                        Olive oil -- for oiling skillet
  8                     Sesame Seed Buns -- (see recipe), split
                        = (or whole grain buns)
                        Lettuce, onion, and tomato slices
                        = (or other toppings of choice)
                        Condiments of choice

In a non-stick skillet, saute the onion in the olive oil for 1 minute over medium heat.  Add the carrot, red pepper, and zucchini, and saute an additional 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, basil, oregano, and sage, and saute an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until the vegetables are lightly browned.  Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.

In a large bowl, place the Roman beans, and using a potato masher or spoon, roughly mash the beans.  Add the tamari, ketchup, mustard, salt, and pepper, and stir well to combine.  Add the sauteed vegetables, fold them into the bean mixture, then add the oats, and stir thoroughly to combine.  Wipe out the non-stick skillet with a clean, lint-free towel, and reuse for cooking the burgers.

Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Using a plastic 1/2-cup measuring cup, portion out 8 burgers onto the parchment paper, and press the burgers with a burger press or your hands to flatten them slightly.  Chill the burgers for 30 minutes.

Using a little olive oil, lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) the non-stick skillet.  In batches, cook the burgers until well browned on each side, about 3 to 5 minutes per side.  Add more oil to the pan, if needed, to prevent the burgers from sticking.  Serve on buns with your choice of toppings and condiments.

This recipe yields 8 burgers.

Comments:  You can make these burgers in larger batches, pre-cook them, and freeze them for later use.  Then simply reheat them in the oven or in a nonstick skillet until heated through.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  13              cups  water -- divided
  1                cup  dry baby butterbeans -- sorted, rinsed
  8             ounces  baby pearl onions
  2             pounds  green beans -- washed, and
                        ends trimmed
     1/3           cup  thinly-sliced garlic
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  tamari
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a pot, combine 10 cups water and the butterbeans, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until the beans are just tender.  Drain the cooked butterbeans, reserving the cooking liquid for making soups, and set aside the drained beans.

Meanwhile, in a saucepan, bring the remaining 3 cups water to a boil.  Add the pearl onions and cook them in the boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes to loosen the skin.  Drain the pearl onions and set aside to cool.

When the pearl onions are cool enough to handle, peel off the outer layer from each and discard it.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a 15- by 10-inch baking dish.  Layer the green beans, pearl onions, garlic, thyme, and salt, and then drizzle the olive oil over the top and toss gently to combine.  Bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes.

Remove the pan from the oven, add the cooked butterbeans, toss gently, and bake an additional 8 to 10 minutes or until the green beans are crisp-tender.

Remove the pan from the oven, drizzle the remaining ingredients over the top of the vegetables, toss gently, and transfer to a large bowl for service.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    garlic cloves - (to 14) -- unpeeled
  4             pounds  potatoes (preferably yukon golds) -- peeled, and
                        cut into cubes
     2/3           cup  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2         tablespoon  freshly-snipped chives
                        Paprika -- for garnish

Place the unpeeled garlic cloves in a pie pan and bake at 450 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until cloves are soft.  Remove the pie pan from the oven and set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, in a large pot, place the cubed potatoes, cover them with water, and cook over medium heat for 20 minutes or until tender.  Drain the potatoes, saving the cooking liquid for use in the mashed potatoes, and the remaining cooking liquid can be used in soups or sauces.

Transfer the drained potatoes to a mixer (or return to the large pot if using a hand mixer or potato masher) and set aside for 5 minutes to dry.

Using your fingers, squeeze the cloves of garlic from their skins, and place them in a small bowl.  Using a fork, mash the cloves of garlic to form a paste.

Add the mashed garlic, soy milk, sprinkle with a little salt and white pepper, and whip the potatoes until smooth.  Add a little of the reserved potato cooking liquid, if needed, to achieve a creamy consistency.  Taste and adjust seasonings, as needed.

Transfer the mashed potatoes to a large bowl, sprinkle with the snipped chives and a little paprika before serving.

This recipe yields 2 quarts or 6 to 8 servings.

  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Safflower oil -- for frying

In a large bowl, place all of the shredded vegetables, green onion, and parsley, and toss well to combine.  In a small bowl, place the water and egg replacer, and whisk vigorously together for 1 to 2 minutes or until very frothy.  Add the egg replacer mixture, along with the remaining ingredients, and toss well to combine.

In a non-stick skillet, place 1 tablespoon safflower oil, and place the skillet over medium heat.  Using a 1/4-cup measuring cup, carefully place portions of the vegetable mixture into the hot oil.  Using a spatula, gently flatten them into thin patties.  Cook the patties over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown and crispy around the edges.  Carefully flip over the patties and cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown and crispy around the edges.  Drain the vegetable pancakes on a clean, lint-free towel, or natural unbleached paper towels.

Cook the remaining vegetable mixture, in batches, following the same cooking procedure, and adding additional safflower oil, as needed, to prevent sticking.  Transfer the finished root vegetable and potato pancakes to a non-stick cookie sheet, and place them in a 250 degree oven to keep warm while cooking the remaining pancakes.  Serve them plain, or with your choice of tofu sour cream, Lemon-Dill Tofu Cream, or Sauteed Maple Apples (see recipes).

This recipe yields 20 to 24 pancakes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  finely-diced onion
     3/4           cup  finely-diced carrot
     1/2           cup  finely-diced celery
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  red skin potatoes -- scrubbed well,
                        and cut into 1/2" cubes
     1/2           cup  finely-diced zucchini
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  3        tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  nutritional yeast flakes
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2        recipe  Whole Wheat Turnover Pastry Dough -- (see recipe)
                        = (enough for 9 turnovers)

In a non-stick skillet, saute the onion, carrot, and celery in olive oil for 3 minutes.  Add the potatoes, zucchini, and garlic, and saute an additional 8 to 10 minutes or until vegetables are tender.  Add the fresh herbs, nutritional yeast, salt, and pepper, and stir well to combine.  Taste, adjust seasonings as needed, and set aside to cool.

Prepare the dough for the turnovers.  Then cut the 5-inch and 6-inch circles of dough as described in the turnover pastry dough recipe.  On each of the prepared 6-inch circles of dough, place 1/3 cups of the vegetable filling.  Wet the edges of the circles of dough with water, place the 5-inch circles of dough on top of the filling, press down around the edges of the dough to seal, and crimp the edges with a fork.

Use a spatula to carefully transfer the turnovers to a non-stick cookie sheet, and bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly browned.

Serve the turnovers hot or cold.  Allow them to cool completely on a rack before wrapping them individually in aluminum foil to preserve freshness.  They can also be frozen in an airtight container after baking for later use.

This recipe yields nine 6-inch turnovers.

Variation:  Other vegetables may be used in the turnovers such as, peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, peas, greens, beans, etc.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  1 1/2           cups  shredded vegan soy cheese -- cheddar flavor
     1/2           cup  tofu sour cream
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  prepared horseradish
  1 1/4         pounds  beets -- peeled, diced small
  1 1/2           cups  diced onion
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  maple syrup or brown rice syrup
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped dill
  2        tablespoons  freshly-snipped chives
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === GARNISHES ===
                        Tofu sour cream
                        Freshly-snipped chives

In a large pot, place the cubed potatoes, cover with water, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.  Drain the potatoes, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid, and return the potatoes to the pot.  Add the soy cheese, tofu sour cream, mustard, horseradish, and some of the reserved cooking liquid, and mash until smooth and creamy with a potato masher or whip with an electric mixer.  Allow the mixture to cool.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.  Place a star tip in a large pastry bag.  Transfer some of the potato mixture to the pastry bag.  To form each "nest": in a spiral pattern, pipe a 4-inch circle, then pipe a decorative border all around the inside edge of the circle, and leave the center empty to form a cavity to hold the filling.  Chill the potato nests while preparing the filling.

In a saucepan, place the diced beets, cover with water, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until beets are tender.  Drain well and set aside.

In the same saucepan, saute the onion in olive oil, for 5 to 7 minutes or until lightly browned and soft.  Add the beets and saute an additional 3 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients, stir well to combine, and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes or until the sauce is reduced to a glaze on the beets.  Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.  Cover, remove from the heat, and set aside.

Remove the potato nests from the refrigerator and allow them to warm up for 5 minutes.  Then in batches, place each of the cookie sheets under the broiler for 4 to 5 minutes to lightly brown the tops of each potato nest.  Carefully fill each of the browned potato nests with the warm beet filling.

Using a spatula, transfer the nests to a large platter for service.  Serve one potato nest per person.  Individual servings can be garnished with a dollop of tofu sour cream and a few snipped chives, if desired.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  The potato nests can be preshaped and chilled ahead of time.  The beet filling can also be prepared ahead but should be kept separately.  Allow both of them to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes, then simply fill the nests and place them under the broiler for 5 to 7 minutes or until lightly browned on top.

<DirT>
In a large pot, place the cubed potatoes, cover with water, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.  Drain the potatoes, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid, and return the potatoes to the pot.  Add the soy cheese, tofu sour cream, mustard, horseradish, and some of the reserved cooking liquid, and mash until smooth and creamy with a potato masher or whip with an electric mixer.  Allow the mixture to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) two non-stick cookie sheets and set aside.  Place a star tip in a large pastry bag.  Transfer some of the potato mixture to the pastry bag.  To form each &quot;nest&quot;: in a spiral pattern, pipe a 4-inch circle, then pipe a decorative border all around the inside edge of the circle, and leave the center empty to form a cavity to hold the filling.  Chill the potato nests while preparing the filling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a saucepan, place the diced beets, cover with water, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until beets are tender.  Drain well and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the same saucepan, saute the onion in olive oil, for 5 to 7 minutes or until lightly browned and soft.  Add the beets and saute an additional 3 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients, stir well to combine, and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes or until the sauce is reduced to a glaze on the beets.  Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.  Cover, remove from the heat, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the potato nests from the refrigerator and allow them to warm up for 5 minutes.  Then in batches, place each of the cookie sheets under the broiler for 4 to 5 minutes to lightly brown the tops of each potato nest.  Carefully fill each of the browned potato nests with the warm beet filling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a spatula, transfer the nests to a large platter for service.  Serve one potato nest per person.  Individual servings can be garnished with a dollop of tofu sour cream and a few snipped chives, if desired.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  The potato nests can be preshaped and chilled ahead of time.  The beet filling can also be prepared ahead but should be kept separately.  Allow both of them to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes, then simply fill the nests and place them under the broiler for 5 to 7 minutes or until lightly browned on top.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  sesame seeds -- divided
  6               cups  unbleached flour - (to 7) -- divided
     1/4           cup  unbleached sugar
  2           packages  active dry or quick rise yeast
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/3           cup  Spectrum Spread non-hydrogenated margarine
  1                cup  warm water -- (120 to 130 degrees)
  1                cup  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
                        Safflower oil -- for oiling bowl and
                        cookie sheets
                        Cold water -- for brushing on
                        tops of buns

In a small bowl, place 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, and set aside.

In an upright mixer or food processor, place the remaining sesame seeds, 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, and salt, and pulse a few times to combine.  Add the Spectrum Spread and pulse a few times to combine.  Add the warm water and soy milk and blend for 1 minute.

Add 2 cups flour, blend for 1 to 2 minutes to fully incorporate it, then add an additional 2 cups flour, and blend 1 to 2 minutes or until the dough comes together to form a ball.

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface, knead in the remaining 1 cup flour, as needed, to form a dough that is smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Drizzle a little safflower oil into a large bowl, transfer the ball of dough to the bowl, and roll the dough around the inside of the bowl to thoroughly coat it with the oil.  Cover the bowl with a towel and place it in a warm place to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

Using a little safflower oil, lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) two non-stick cookie sheets, and set aside.  Punch down the dough.  Transfer the dough to a work surface, divide it into 18 equal pieces, and roll each into a ball.

Transfer the balls of dough to the prepared cookie sheets and press dough on each, slightly, to flatten.  Brush the tops of each with a little cold water and sprinkle with the reserved sesame seeds.  Cover them with towels and leave to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

Bake at 375 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly browned on the bottom and top.  Remove the buns from the cookie sheets and allow them to cool on a rack.  Use as buns for your favorite veggie burgers or sandwiches, or as rolls.

This recipe yields 18 buns.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR DOUGH ===
  1                cup  warm water
  1            package  dry active yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  unbleached cane sugar
  3               cups  whole-wheat flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === FOR FILLING ===
     1/3           cup  pine nuts
     1/2           cup  diced shallots
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             pounds  escarole -- washed well,
                        and roughly chopped
  1                cup  black olives -- pitted
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
  2        tablespoons  capers
  2          teaspoons  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  nutritional yeast flakes
                        Olive oil for oiling surfaces
                        Soy milk -- (optional)

Begin by preparing the dough.  In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar.  Stir, and set aside for 10 minutes or until foamy.

In a large bowl, place the flour and salt, and stir well to combine.  Add the yeast mixture and oil to the flour mixture, and stir well to form a dough.  Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for 5 to 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic.

Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, turn the dough to coat with the oil, and flip it over once to oil the top.  Cover the bowl with a damp cloth, place in a warm place, and allow the dough to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

While the dough is left to rise, prepare the filling.  In a dry non-stick skillet, place the pine nuts and cook over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant.  Transfer the toasted pine nuts to a small bowl and set aside.

In the same non-stick skillet, saute the shallots and garlic in olive oil for 2 minutes to soften.  Add the escarole and saute for 5 to 6 minutes or until wilted.

Roughly chop the black olives.  Add the chopped olives, reserved pine nuts, and the remaining ingredients, except the nutritional yeast, and stir well to combine.  Continue to cook the mixture an additional 5 minutes or until the escarole is tender.  Remove from the heat, stir in the nutritional yeast, and set aside to cool.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a 9-inch springform pan and set aside.  When the dough has doubled in bulk, punch it down, turn it out on to a work surface, and knead it lightly.  Remove 1/3 of the dough and set aside.  Roll out the 2/3 portion of dough to form a 14-inch circle.  Carefully transfer the dough to the prepared springform pan, and ease it into the bottom and up the sides of the pan.  Spread the cooled filling evenly over the dough.  Roll out the remaining 1/3 of dough to form a 10-inch circle.  Carefully place the circle over the filling.

Moisten the edges of the top piece of dough with a little water and pinch the edges of the two layers of dough together to seal in the filling.  Roll the edges of dough downward to form a decorative border all around the outer edge of the pie.

Using a fork or sharp knife, decoratively make slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.  Using your fingers, lightly brush the top with a little additional olive oil or soy milk.  Bake at 375 degrees for 45 to 55 minutes or until lightly browned on top.

Allow to cool for 5 minutes and then remove the ring from the springform pan.  Transfer to a large plate or platter and cut the pie into 8 wedges.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields one 9- by 13-inch pie or 8 wedges.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Green Onion Cornbread -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  diced onion
  1 1/2           cups  diced celery -- including the green
                        leafy tops
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced green onion
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped thyme
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped sage
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  nutritional yeast flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  vegetable stock - (to 3/4)

Add cornbread cubes, parsley, nutritional yeast flakes, salt, and pepper, and toss gently to combine.  Add enough of the vegetable stock to the stuffing to moisten but not make it soggy.  Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.

Transfer the stuffing to the prepared pan.  Cover and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  If you like the top of your stuffing crisp, remove the foil and bake an additional 5 to 10 minutes or until lightly browned on top.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  4               cups  water
  2               cups  long-grain brown rice -- rinsed
  1 1/2           cups  diced onion
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  sliced mushrooms

Add the Non-Dairy Alfredo Sauce, soybeans, and peas.  Reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients and stir well to combine.

Fluff the brown rice with a fork.  Top individual servings of rice with a generous amount of the Soybean a la Florentine sauce mixture.  The sauce can also be used to top other grains, pasta, mashed potatoes, biscuits, or toasts.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  spaghetti squash
  1 1/2           cups  diced Roma tomatoes
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped basil
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped Italian parsley
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped oregano
  2        tablespoons  nutritional yeast flakes
                        = (or soy parmesan cheese)
  1 1/2     tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes

Cut the spaghetti squash in half, remove the seeds, and discard them.  Using a fork, rake the surface of each of the squash halves to separate the flesh into long strands that resemble spaghetti.  Remove the strands of squash, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the inner edge of the squash halves to form a shell, and transfer the strands to a bowl.  Add the remaining ingredients to the spaghetti squash and toss gently to combine.

Place the squash shells in a large baking dish, cut-side up, and refill each squash half with the filling.  Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.  Bake at 375 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.  Carefully transfer the spaghetti squash halves to a large platter for service.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Water -- as needed
  1              pound  asparagus -- tough ends trimmed
  1 1/2           cups  baby carrots -- cut diagonally in
                        half lengthwise
  8             ounces  sugar snap peas
  8             ounces  pearl onions
  1              pound  fresh fava beans -- shelled
  1                cup  thinly-sliced well-washed leeks
  1                cup  diced seeded orange or yellow pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1                cup  summer squash -- halved lengthwise,
                        and sliced
  1                cup  zucchini -- halved lengthwise,
                        and sliced
  1                cup  cut corn
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  Herbes de Provence
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Begin by preparing the asparagus: fill a large saucepan half full with water, place it over high heat, and bring to a boil.  Slice the asparagus spears diagonally into 1-inch pieces and place them in a fine mesh strainer.  Place the strainer in the boiling water and cook the asparagus in the water for 2 minutes to blanch them.  Remove the strainer from the water and set the asparagus aside.

Place the baby carrots in the mesh strainer, place it in the boiling water, and cook the carrots in the boiling water for 2 minutes to blanch them.  Add the carrots to the asparagus.

Repeat the same blanching procedure for the sugar snap peas and pearl onions, use a paring knife to peel off the outer skin of the pearl onions, and then add both of them to the other blanched vegetables.

Place the fava beans in the mesh strainer, place it in the boiling water, and cook for 10 minutes.  Remove the fava beans from the boiling water, discard the water or save for use in soups or sauces, and set the fava beans aside separately to cool.

When the fava beans are cool to the touch, using your fingers, peel away the outer skin and then add the fava beans to the other blanched vegetables.

In a large non-stick skillet, saute the leeks and orange/yellow pepper in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil for 3 minutes to soften.  Add the summer squash, zucchini, corn, and garlic, and saute an additional 2 minutes.

Add the blanched vegetables, along with the remaining olive oil and other ingredients, season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir well to combine.  Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer the mixture for 3 minutes to blend the flavors.

Transfer the vegetable mixture to a large bowl or platter for service.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                Sprouted Rice With Asparagus And Mushrooms

Recipe By     :Beverly Lynn Bennett

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegan
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  wild rice
  1                cup  brown rice
                        Water -- as needed
  8             ounces  asparagus -- stems trimmed
  8             ounces  cremini -- stems trimmed
                        = (or other mushroom of choice)
  1                cup  diced seeded red pepper
     3/4           cup  diced celery
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
     1/3           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
  3        tablespoons  freshly-chopped dill
     1/2           cup  Garlic And Herb Marinade -- (see recipe)
  5          teaspoons  Dijon or brown mustard
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preparing this recipe takes some pre-planning because the wild and brown rice need to be soaked for several days.

Begin by placing the wild rice and brown rice in a fine mesh colander and rinse them well with cold water.  Transfer the rinsed rice to a medium bowl and add enough water to cover the rice by an additional one inch.  Set the bowl aside and leave the rice to soak at room temperature for 24 hours.

Drain the soaking rice in a fine mesh colander, rinse the rice with cold water, and leave it to drain.  Return the rice to the bowl, cover it with enough water to cover the rice by an additional one inch, and then set aside at room temperature for an additional 24 hours.  Repeat the soaking, rinsing, and soaking procedure for 72 or more hours or until the rice has softened and started to split.

When the rice has begun to split and it is tender enough to eat, transfer it to the fine mesh colander, drain it well.  Transfer the rice to a large bowl and set it aside while preparing the vegetables.

Using a vegetable peeler, peel the stems of the asparagus, and then thinly slice the asparagus on the diagonal.  Add the asparagus to the bowl of rice.  Cut the mushrooms in half lengthwise, then thinly slice them, and add them to the bowl of rice.  Add the red pepper, celery, green onion, parsley, and dill, and toss gently to combine.

In a small bowl, place all of the remaining ingredients, and whisk well to combine.  Pour the wet ingredients over the rice mixture and toss thoroughly to coat the mixture with the dressing.  Taste and adjust the seasonings, to taste.  Set the mixture aside for 15 to 20 minutes to allow the flavors to blend and then toss again just before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Begin by placing the wild rice and brown rice in a fine mesh colander and rinse them well with cold water.  Transfer the rinsed rice to a medium bowl and add enough water to cover the rice by an additional one inch.  Set the bowl aside and leave the rice to soak at room temperature for 24 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain the soaking rice in a fine mesh colander, rinse the rice with cold water, and leave it to drain.  Return the rice to the bowl, cover it with enough water to cover the rice by an additional one inch, and then set aside at room temperature for an additional 24 hours.  Repeat the soaking, rinsing, and soaking procedure for 72 or more hours or until the rice has softened and started to split.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the rice has begun to split and it is tender enough to eat, transfer it to the fine mesh colander, drain it well.  Transfer the rice to a large bowl and set it aside while preparing the vegetables.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a vegetable peeler, peel the stems of the asparagus, and then thinly slice the asparagus on the diagonal.  Add the asparagus to the bowl of rice.  Cut the mushrooms in half lengthwise, then thinly slice them, and add them to the bowl of rice.  Add the red pepper, celery, green onion, parsley, and dill, and toss gently to combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, place all of the remaining ingredients, and whisk well to combine.  Pour the wet ingredients over the rice mixture and toss thoroughly to coat the mixture with the dressing.  Taste and adjust the seasonings, to taste.  Set the mixture aside for 15 to 20 minutes to allow the flavors to blend and then toss again just before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  multigrain tempeh - (8 oz ea) -- cut into cubes
  1 1/2           cups  diced onion
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- divided
  8             ounces  portabello mushrooms -- finely diced
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2          teaspoons  dried basil
  2          teaspoons  dried rosemary -- crushed a bit
                        with your fingers
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  whole-wheat flour
     1/4           cup  tamari
                        = (or Bragg Liquid Aminos)
                        Safflower oil -- for frying
  8                     whole-grain buns -- split
                        Lettuce, onion and tomato slices, or
                        other toppings of choice
                        Condiments of choice

Place the cubes of tempeh in a steamer basket, steam for 15 minutes, and set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, in a non-stick skillet, saute the onion in the olive oil for 3 minutes to soften.  Add the mushrooms and saute an additional 3 to 5 minutes or until the onions are lightly browned.  Add the balsamic vinegar, stir well, and saute an additional 2 minutes.  Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.

Using your fingers, crumble the steamed tempeh into a bowl.  Add the sauteed onion-mushroom mixture, basil, rosemary, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, and pepper to the tempeh, and stir well to combine.  Add the flour, tamari, and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and stir well to combine.

Line a large cookie sheet with waxed paper.  Using a plastic 1/2-cup measuring cup, portion out 8 burgers on to the waxed paper, and press the burgers with a burger press or your hands to flatten them slightly.  Chill the burgers for 1 hour.

Lightly oil a non-stick skillet with a little safflower oil.  In batches, cook the tempeh portabello burgers until well browned on each side, about 5 to 7 minutes per side.  Add more oil to the pan, if needed, to prevent the burgers from sticking.  Serve on whole grain buns with your choice of toppings and condiments.

This recipe yields 8 burgers.

Comments:  You can make these burgers in larger batches, pre-cook them, and freeze them for later use.  Then simply reheat them in the oven or in a nonstick skillet until heated through.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm tofu
     2/3           cup  soy milk
                        = (or rice milk or other non-dairy milk)
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1                cup  whole-wheat flour
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
     1/4           cup  nutritional yeast flakes
  1         tablespoon  dried parsley
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Wrap the block of tofu in a clean, lint-free towel, place it in a colander, and place the colander in the sink.  Place a plate over the towel-covered tofu, then a heavy can or other weight on top, and leave to press for 30 minutes.

Remove the tofu from the towel, cut into 1-inch cubes, and set aside.  Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a non-stick cookie sheet and set aside.

In a small bowl, whisk together the soy milk and lemon juice, and set aside for 10 minutes to thicken.

Place the flour on a large plate and toss the tofu cubes in the flour to thoroughly coat them.  Remove the cubes of tofu from the flour and set aside.

Add the remaining ingredients to the flour, stir well to combine, and set aside.

Dip the floured tofu cubes into the soymilk mixture and then toss them with the seasoned flour mixture.

Place the tofu cubes on the prepared cookie sheet and spacing them so that they aren't touching.  Bake at 400 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned, flip over the tofu cubes, and bake an additional 10 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned all over.

Serve with a mixture of maple syrup and mustard, ketchup, or other dipping sauce of choice.  Transfer any of the seasoned flour mixture that remains, to an airtight container, and store in the refrigerator for another use, or use as seasoned crumbs in your favorite recipe.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Variation:  For a spicier version, add 2 teaspoons chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and serve with barbecue sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  vegetable broth -- divided
  1                cup  pearl barley -- rinsed, drained
     3/4           cup  millet -- rinsed, drained
     3/4           cup  quinoa -- rinsed, drained
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced green onions
  1                cup  diced onion
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  12            ounces  baby bella mushrooms -- washed well,
                        halved, and sliced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame oil
  6               cups  spinach -- triple washed,
                        stemmed, and roughly chopped
     1/3           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped thyme
  2        tablespoons  tamari
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper

In a saucepan, place 3 cups vegetable stock and pearl barley, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 to 50 minutes or until barley is tender.  Remove from heat, drain off any excess water, and set aside.

Meanwhile, in another saucepan, place the remaining vegetable stock, millet, quinoa, and salt, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes or until the grains are tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed.  Drain off any excess water, leave the grains in the saucepan covered, and let sit for 5 minutes to allow the grains to steam.

In a large non-stick skillet, saute the green onions and onion in olive oil for 5 minutes to soften.  Add the mushrooms and saute an additional 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and sesame seeds, and saute an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.

Add the toasted sesame oil and all three cooked grains to the skillet, and saute for 3 minutes to heat through.  Add the remaining ingredients and continue to saute until the spinach wilts.  Taste and adjust the seasonings, as needed.  Transfer the pilaf to a large bowl for service.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

              Twice-Baked Potatoes With Apple And 'Cheddar'

Recipe By     :Beverly Lynn Bennett
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegan
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  russet potatoes -- scrubbed well
  1                cup  finely-diced red onion
     1/2           cup  finely-diced shallots
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  finely-diced Granny Smith apple
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped sage
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  shredded cheddar style soy cheese

Prick each of the potatoes in a few places and bake at 400 degrees for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until soft.  Remove the potatoes from the oven and allow them to cool for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a non-stick skillet, saute the red onion and shallots in the olive oil for 5 to 7 minutes or until soft.  Add the diced apple and saute an additional 3 to 4 minutes or until the apple is tender.  Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a large casserole dish and set aside.

When the potatoes are cool to the touch, cut each one in half lengthwise, and use a spoon to scoop out the inside of the cooked potatoes into a bowl while keeping the potato skin shells intact.  Place the potato skin shells in the greased casserole dish and set aside.

Using a fork or potato masher, mash the cooked potatoes to desired creaminess.  Add the reserved apple mixture, parsley, sage, dry mustard, salt, and pepper, and stir well to combine.  Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.

Evenly divide the mashed potato filling among the potato skin shells.  Using a fork, rake the surface of the filling, and then sprinkle 2 tablespoon of the shredded soy cheese over each one.

Bake the filled potatoes at 400 degrees for an additional 15 minutes or until the cheese is well melted and bubbly.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

                        Twice-Baked Sweet Potatoes

Recipe By     :Beverly Lynn Bennett
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegan
                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  sweet potatoes -- washed well,
                        do not peel
  3        tablespoons  maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  orange juice
  2          teaspoons  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  Sucanat

Using a fork, pierce the skins of the sweet potatoes in several places.  Place an oven-proof rack on a cookie sheet and place the sweet potatoes on the rack.  Bake at 400 degrees for 60 to 75 minutes or until soft when gently squeezed.  Remove the cookie sheet from the oven and leave the sweet potatoes on the rack to cool.

When they are cool enough to handle, cut each one in half lengthwise.  Using a spoon, carefully scoop out the cooked flesh into a food processor, leaving the skin intact to form a shell, and set skins aside.

Add the maple syrup, orange juice, ginger, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt to the food processor, and puree for 2 to 3 minutes or until very smooth and creamy.

Lightly oil (or spray with a light mist of oil) a large cookie sheet or baking pan, and place the reserved sweet potato skins in the pan.  Refill the skins with the puree mixture, evenly dividing it among the skins, and then swirl the top of each filled skin decoratively with the back of a spoon.

In a small bowl, stir together the remaining cinnamon and Sucanat.  Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the top of each refilled skin.  Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until heated through.

Using a spatula, carefully transfer the halves to a large platter for service.  Serve one Twice-Baked Sweet Potato half per person.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  The Twice Baked Sweet Potatoes can also be pre-assembled, brought to room temperature for 10 minutes, and then baked as directed above.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     flour tortillas - (8" dia)
                        = (choice of white, whole wheat, or
                        flavored)
  1 1/3           cups  White Bean And Roasted Vegetable Spread -- (see recipe)
  4                     loose-leaf lettuce leaves -- washed, patted dry
                        = (or lettuce of choice)
  3                     Roma tomatoes -- each sliced 4 pieces
     3/4           cup  shredded zucchini
     3/4           cup  shredded summer squash
     3/4           cup  shredded carrot
  1                     cucumber -- peeled, and
                        sliced thin

Place the tortillas flat on a cutting board; place 1/3 cup of the spread on each tortilla, and spread within 1-inch of its edges.  Place 1 lettuce leaf in the center of each tortilla so that a little of it hangs out the top edge.

For each tortilla: on top of the lettuce place 3 slices of tomato, 3 tablespoons shredded zucchini, 3 tablespoons shredded summer squash, 3 tablespoons shredded carrot, and in rows, 6 slices of cucumber.

Fold the bottom of the tortilla up to the center of the tortilla, then fold in each side, one overlapping the other to enclose the vegetables, and secure the wrap with a toothpick.

                Vegetarian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1            package  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz)
  1 3/4           cups  whole-wheat flour
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        Olive oil -- as needed

In a food processor, place the warm water, olive oil, and yeast, and process for 30 seconds to combine.  Allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes or until foamy.

Add both types of flour and salt, and process an additional 1 minute or until the dough comes together to form a ball.  Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead the dough for 5 to 7 minutes or until smooth and elastic.

Lightly oil a large bowl with a little olive oil, transfer the ball of dough to the bowl, and roll the dough around the inside of the bowl to thoroughly coat it with the oil.  Cover the bowl with a clean towel, place it in a warm place, and leave the dough to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

After the dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough, and turn it out onto a floured work surface.  Knead the dough a few times, place the bowl over the top of the dough, and leave it to rest for 20 minutes.

Divide the dough into 8 pieces.  Using a rolling pin, roll out each piece of dough to form a 6-inch circle.  Place filling of choice on one half of each circle of dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge.  Brush a little water around the edge of each circle of dough.  Fold the dough over to enclose the filling, crimp the edges closed with your fingers, and then fold up the edges a 1/2-inch to form a decorative border.

Transfer the filled calzones to a non-stick cookie sheet and bake at 450 degrees for 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Allow the calzones to cool for a few minutes before serving.  Can be served warm, cold, or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 calzones.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  whole-wheat flour
     1/4           cup  safflower oil
     1/2           cup  water
     1/3           cup  soy milk
  3        tablespoons  maple syrup
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt

In a large bowl, place the flour and drizzle in the oil.  Using your fingers, work the two together until it forms a crumbly mixture.  In a small bowl, place the remaining ingredients, and whisk well to combine.  Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, mix well, and with your hands form it into a ball of dough.

Transfer the dough to a floured surface.  Divide the dough in half.  Roll out one half of the dough thinly, cut eighteen 5-inch circles, and set them aside.  Gather up the scraps, add the scraps to the remaining half of dough, roll out the dough thinly, and cut eighteen 6-inch circles.

Fill the 6-inch circles of dough with up to 1/3 cup of desired filling.  Wet the edges of the circles of dough with water, place the 5-inch circles of dough on top of the filling, press down around the edges of the dough to seal, and then crimp the edges with a fork.

Use a spatula to carefully transfer the filled turnovers to 2 non-stick cookie sheets and bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly browned.

Serve the turnovers hot or cold.  Allow them to cool completely on racks before wrapping them individually in aluminum foil to preserve freshness.  They can also be frozen in airtight containers after baking for later use.

This recipe yields dough for eighteen 6-inch turnovers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
                        = (or vegetable stock)
     1/2           cup  long-grain brown rice -- rinsed
     1/2           cup  wild rice -- rinsed
     1/3           cup  white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  fresh cut corn
                        = (or frozen thawed)
  1                can  pinto or red beans - (15 oz) -- rinsed, drained
     1/2           cup  finely-diced seeded green pepper
     1/2           cup  finely-diced seeded red pepper
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced green onion
     1/2           cup  freshly-chopped cilantro
     1/2           cup  toasted pumpkin seeds
  1                can  chopped green chiles - (4 oz) -- drained
  6                     kaiser rolls
                        = (or other large rolls)
  1                cup  shredded vegan "mozzarella cheese"

In a medium saucepan, place the water, and bring to a boil.  Add the brown and wild rice, cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 45 minutes.

Remove the saucepan from the heat, leave covered, and set aside for 5 minutes to allow the rice to steam.  Transfer the rice to a large bowl, fluff with a fork, and allow to cool for 20 minutes.

In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, cumin, salt, and pepper.  Pour the mixture over the rice and toss gently to combine.  Add all of the remaining ingredients, except the kaiser rolls and vegan cheese, and toss gently to combine.

To assemble the sandwiches, begin by slicing the top 1/3 off each of the kaiser rolls, and set the tops aside.  Using your fingers, remove some of the bread from the inside of each roll, leaving a 1/2-inch border from the crust edge (save the kaiser roll trimmings for use as breadcrumbs in another recipe).

Divide the rice mixture evenly among the 6 kaiser rolls and then sprinkle each with some of the shredded vegan cheese.  Replace the tops of each kaiser and transfer them to a large platter for service.

This recipe yields 6 sandwiches.

In a medium saucepan, place the water, and bring to a boil.  Add the brown and wild rice, cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 45 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the saucepan from the heat, leave covered, and set aside for 5 minutes to allow the rice to steam.  Transfer the rice to a large bowl, fluff with a fork, and allow to cool for 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, cumin, salt, and pepper.  Pour the mixture over the rice and toss gently to combine.  Add all of the remaining ingredients, except the kaiser rolls and vegan cheese, and toss gently to combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To assemble the sandwiches, begin by slicing the top 1/3 off each of the kaiser rolls, and set the tops aside.  Using your fingers, remove some of the bread from the inside of each roll, leaving a 1/2-inch border from the crust edge (save the kaiser roll trimmings for use as breadcrumbs in another recipe).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the rice mixture evenly among the 6 kaiser rolls and then sprinkle each with some of the shredded vegan cheese.  Replace the tops of each kaiser and transfer them to a large platter for service.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 sandwiches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  vegetable stock -- divided
     1/3           cup  pine nuts
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  1                cup  finely-diced shallot
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1              pound  peeled winter squash -- cut 1" cubes
                        = (such as acorn, butternut,
                        buttercup, kabocha, etc.)
  3        tablespoons  freshly-chopped sage
  1 1/2           cups  Arborio rice
     1/2           cup  white wine
                        = (or white grape juice)
  2        tablespoons  Bragg Liquid Aminos
                        = (or tamari)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  soy parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  freshly-chopped parsley

In a medium saucepan, place the vegetable stock, and bring it to a simmer over low heat.

In a large saucepan, place the pine nuts and 2 tablespoon olive oil, and cook over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until pine nuts are lightly browned.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the pine nuts from the olive oil, place them in a small bowl, and set aside.

In the hot olive oil, saute the shallot and garlic for 3 to 4 minutes or until soft.  Add the cubed winter squash and sage, and saute for 3 minutes or until the sage is fragrant.

Add 1 1/2 cups of the hot vegetable stock to the saucepan, cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes or until the winter squash is tender.  Remove the lid and allow any remaining liquid in the pan to cook off.

Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and Arborio rice to the saucepan, and saute for 1 minute to coat the rice with the olive oil.  Add the reserved toasted pine nuts, white wine, Bragg Liquid Aminos, salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until all of the liquid is absorbed.

Add 1/2 cups of the hot vegetable stock to the saucepan, and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until all of the stock is absorbed.  Continue adding the vegetable stock in 1/2 cups increments, while stirring frequently, until all of the stock is incorporated and the rice is creamy and slightly al dente.

Add the soy parmesan cheese and parsley, and stir well to combine.  Taste and adjust the seasonings as necessary.  Individual servings can be topped with additional soy parmesan cheese, if desired.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  zucchini -- halved lengthwise,
                        and seeded
  1              pound  summer squash -- halved lengthwise,
                        and seeded
  2                     hot red peppers -- stemmed, seeded
  1                     red pepper -- stemmed, seeded
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
     1/3           cup  freshly-chopped basil
     1/3           cup  freshly-chopped parsley
                        Olive oil -- as needed

Begin by cutting the zucchini and summer squash into strips that are 3 inches long and 1/4-inch thick.  Cut the hot red peppers and the red pepper into thin strips that are 3 inches long.  Place all of the vegetables in a colander, sprinkle with the coarse salt, and place the colander over a bowl.  Allow the vegetables to drain overnight.  Using a towel, wipe the salt from the vegetables.

Sterilize three 8 ounces jars and their lids by boiling them in a large pot of water for 15 minutes.  Using tongs, remove the jars and lids from the water and place on a dry surface.

For each jar, arrange the strips of vegetables upright in the jars, alternating the vegetables as you fill for a pretty presentation.  Divide the chopped herbs evenly between the jars and fill the jars with enough olive oil to completely immerse the vegetables.

Wipe clean the rims and seal with their lids.  Label and date the jars.  Store jars in the refrigerator.  Serve as part of an antipasto platter, add to salads or sandwiches, or on bread.

This recipe yields three 8-ounces jars.
