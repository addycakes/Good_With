  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  pollock fillets -- thawed if necessary
  1         tablespoon  cracked black pepper
  2             ounces  canola oil -- divided
  12            ounces  pepper Jack or Jack cheese -- grated
     1/2                red bell pepper -- cut into strips
     1/2                green bell pepper -- cut into strips
  1             medium  red onion -- cut into strips
  6                     flour tortillas - (12" dia)
  1 1/2           cups  salsa
     3/4           cup  pineapple chunks
  2 1/2      teaspoons  finely-chopped fresh cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Mix salsa, pineapple chunks and 1/2 teaspoon cilantro together; taste, adding salt and pepper as needed.  Hold aside, chilled. 

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Mix 1 ounce oil, the cracked pepper and a pinch of salt in a bowl.  Add the pollock fillets; toss to coat. 

Heat an oven-proof saute pan.  Sear the pollock fillets in the hot saute pan for 30 seconds on each side.  Place the entire pan in the oven and cook 10 minutes; remove pan from the oven.  Flake fillets into a large bowl. 

Return the saute pan to the stove.  Add bell pepper and onion strips; cook over medium-high heat until lightly browned.  Place pepper and onion strips in bowl with pollock flakes.  Add remaining cilantro and mix well, adding salt and pepper to taste. 

The tortillas will be folded over.  With this in mind, sprinkle 2 ounces of cheese onto the lower half of each tortilla.  Top with 2 to 3 ounces of pollock and pepper mixture.  Fold over tortillas and fry in the remaining oil until the cheese melts and the tortilla is crisp on both sides, turning once. 

To serve, cut each quesadilla into 3 wedges and place on a plate with 3/4 cup of chilled salsa mixture. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon steaks or fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- skin and bones
                        removed
  2               cups  Champagne
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
  4             slices  red onion
  1         tablespoon  capers -- optional
  4             sprigs  fresh tarragon

  1            package  hot roll mix
  1 1/4            cup  hot water
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  ricotta cheese
  1                cup  grated mozzarella cheese
  1            package  cream cheese - (8 oz) -- softened
     1/2         pound  crab meat
  4                     green onions -- chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- minced fine
  1          small can  chopped olives

In large bowl, combine flour mixture and yeast from hot roll mix.  Stir in water and oil until moistened.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface.  With greased hands, shape into ball and knead dough 3 minutes or until no longer sticky.  Divide dough into 10 equal parts and cover loosely with plastic wrap and cloth towel. 

In medium bowl, combine remaining ingredients and mix well.  On lightly floured surface, roll each ball of dough to an eight inch circle.  Spoon 1/3 cup filling over half of dough to within 1 inch of the edge.  Brush edge with water.  Fold dough in half over filling, press edges to seal and flute decoratively. 

Place on greased cookie sheet, and brush with oil.  Bake 400 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, or until brown. 

This recipe yields 10 calzone. 

Variation:  Turn the calzone from a main dish to an appetizer by wrapping 1 tablespoon of the filling in fillo dough wrappers.

  5               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  butter-flavored crisco
     3/4           cup  ice cold water
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  margarine
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
     3/4           cup  converted rice
     1/2           cup  chopped parsley
  2               cans  red salmon - (15 1/2 oz ea) -- drained, and
                        liquid reserved
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  margarine
  2        tablespoons  flour
                        Reserved salmon juice -- plus enough
                        Evaporated milk -- to make 1 1/2 cups
  8             ounces  cooked small shrimp
     1/2      teaspoon  dill weed
     1/4      teaspoon  Johnny's season salt
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1                     green olive slice for eye
  1                     lemon
                        Fresh parsley -- for garnish

Pastry:  Toss flour with spoon and lightly measure leveling off each cup.  Combine flour and salt in large bowl.  With pastry blender cut in shortening to size of small peas.  Add cold water, tossing with a fork until pastry clings together.  Press firmly into a ball and divide in half. 

Filling:  In 2 quart saucepan, melt margarine and saute onion until clear.  Add rice, stirring to coat.  Add 1 1/2 cup water, cover and steam over low heat until tender, about 20 minutes.  Stir in parsley, cool, cover and chill.  Remove backbone and skin from canned salmon and break into large flakes. 

Sauce:  Make a roux with margarine and flour.  Stir in liquid and cook over medium heat stirring constantly until thickened.  Stir in dill weed, season salt and shrimp.  Cool. 

To assemble:  Draw a fish shape on light cardboard to fit diagonally on a large baking sheet.  Roll out pastry and cut out fish shape.  Place on sheet.  Spread rice mixture over pastry within 1 inch of edge.  Arrange fish over rice.  Spoon sauce over salmon.  Roll out remaining pastry to cover and gently place over fish.  Moisten edge with ice water and press top crust to seal.  Cut excess pastry from around edge. 

Create fish scales by pressing with fork.  Using a knife, cut in slit for mouth and x for eye.  With scissors, make rows of snips 1 inch apart along back toward tail.  Brush with beaten egg. 

Bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes, then at 375 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes until golden brown.  Slide off end of tray onto serving platter.  (May need to cool slightly to firm crust before moving.)  Garnish with lemon slice twists and parsley and place green olive slice for eye. 

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

                        === BLUE CRAB STUFFING ===
  1              pound  blue crab meat
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1                cup  chopped celery
  1                     chopped green pepper
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1                cup  butter
  2               cups  soft bread crumbs
  3                     eggs -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper

Remove scales, head and viscera from flounder.  Rinse then cut flounder, using a sharp knife, lengthways down the middle of itís dark side.  (A flounder has one dark side and one light side and the backbone goes down the middle of the flat side.)  The cut should be as deep as the back bone will allow.  Tilt knife sideways and cut horizontally along each side of the backbone to make two pockets. 

Prepare Florida Blue Crab Stuffing:  Remove pieces of shell or cartilage from crab meat.  Cook onion, celery, green pepper and garlic in butter until tender, but not brown.  Add remaining ingredients; mix well.  (Makes stuffing for six 3/4-pound flounder or one 4-pound flounder) 

Place fish on an oiled baking pan and loosely fill both pockets with Blue Crab Stuffing.  Brush flounder with oil, making sure the fins are well coated.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes or until the fish flakes easily. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  pollock fillets
     1/4           cup  fine-diced bacon
     1/2           cup  small-diced celery
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  5             ounces  soda crackers -- crumbled
     1/4           cup  egg substitute or 1 whole egg
     1/2           cup  low fat mayonnaise
                        Hot pepper sauce -- to taste
                        Worcestershire sauce -- to taste

     1/3           cup  diced fresh papaya
                        Oil, as needed

Season the pollock fillets with Old Bay Seasoning, pepper and Worcestershire.  Lightly oil a shallow baking dish, place the pollock fillets in the pan and cover with 1/2 cup of water or white wine.  Cover with foil and place in a preheated 400 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove and chill in the cooking liquid. 

Saute the bacon; pour off most of the fat, add the garlic and celery and saute for 2 minutes.  Place celery mixture in a large mixing bowl.  Add the cracker crumbs, egg substitute and mayonnaise.  Toss, adding the pollock (flaked) and the poaching liquid.  Add hot pepper sauce, Old Bay Seasoning, salt and pepper to taste. 

Form into 12 cakes (2 to 3 ounces each) and griddle-fry until golden brown and crisp on both sides.  Mix the papaya and chutney together. 

To serve, place 3 ounces of chutney mix in the center of 4 serving plates; surround with 3 pollock cakes. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  halibut fillet
                        (or 6 halibut steaks)
  2        tablespoons  butter or margarine - (to 3 tbspns) -- cut up
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice - (to 3 tbspns)
                        === HERB MIX #1 ===
  1           teaspoon  onion flakes -- rehydrated, drained
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  marjoram leaves
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === HERB MIX #2 ===
     1/2           cup  rice chex -- crushed finely
     1/2           cup  instant potato flakes
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated P -- armesan cheese
  1           teaspoon  sweet basil
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  parsley flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika

Wipe fish with a damp cloth, dot with butter, and sprinkle lemon juice over all.  Use either of the spice mixes shown below. 

Using Herb Mix No. 1:  Prepare onions and sprinkle over the top of the fish.  Combine the remaining herbs/spices and sprinkle on halibut.  Let stand for 10 minutes to absorb the flavors.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. 

Using Herb Mix No. 2:  Mix all ingredients together well.  Sprinkle over fish; use only enough to lightly cover fish or it will taste dry.  (The remaining mix will store well in a tightly covered jar in the refrigerator.)  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.  Do not overbake or it will dry out.  Serve garnished with lemon wedge and parsley sprigs. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  bacon -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1             medium  green pepper -- chopped
     1/4         pound  hot reindeer Polish sausage -- cut 1/4" slices
     1/4         pound  regular reindeer Polish sausage -- cut 1/4" slices
  1         tablespoon  parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme
                        Lemon pepper seasoning -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  beef or chicken broth
  1               dash  Tabasco sauce
  1 1/4           cups  long-grain rice
  1 1/2           cups  fresh or frozen shrimp -- cooked

Saute bacon, garlic, onion and green pepper 2 to 3 minutes in large skillet or kettle.  Add hot and regular sausages.  Saute until onion is translucent but not golden. 

Add parsley, thyme, lemon pepper, salt and pepper.  Add broth and Tabasco sauce; bring to a boil and boil five minutes. 

Add rice, cover and simmer 20 minutes until rice is tender but not mushy.  Stir in shrimp and heat until just heated through. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Serve with a cool, tangy coleslaw and plenty of cold beer -- or something else to quench the fire!  Those with timid palates may want to substitute regular sausage for the hot; those with cast-iron palates can use all hot sausage or add Tabasco sauce to taste.  This recipe is moderately hot.

                             Octopus Tidbits

Recipe By     :Pat of Kodiak, AK
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  octopus meat
  2                     eggs
  2          teaspoons  dill weed
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped onion
     1/2           cup  breadcrumbs
     1/4           cup  melted butter or margarine

Boil fresh octopus for at least 10 minutes.  Remove skin.  The skin and suckers will "slip" off the tentacles when it is cooked.  Prepare cooked octopus for tidbits by grinding as you would hamburger.  Once is sufficient.  No further tenderizing is necessary. 

Mix ingredients together.  Form into balls no larger than 1 inch in diameter.  Roll in bread crumbs to coat.  Pan fry in butter or margarine until golden brown.  Garnish with lemon, lime, tomatoes or lettuce. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  These delicious tidbits are wonderful for fancy buffets, freeze well, and make a hit at any and every party.  Great for the gourmet, and good for home.  It is difficult to say how many this serves, as some people love it and gobble them all up, and others only eat a few if they know what they are eating.  For a main meal, it should serve four.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  sockeye salmon - (4 to 5 lbs)
  1                     lemon -- sliced
  1              strip  bacon
     1/2           cup  light Karo syrup
  1                cup  ketchup
  1             medium  onion -- sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder

Remove head and tail from salmon and fillet.  Place one-half skin-side down on a large sheet of foil in a baking pan.  Add spices and layer with lemon, onion, and bacon. 

Mix syrup and ketchup; pour half of this mixture over the fillet.  Place second fillet flesh-side down over the first; pour rest of sauce over all. 

Seal with the foil and bake 30 to 40 minutes at 400 degrees.  Fish will flake easily with a fork in the thickest part when it is done.  Do not overbake. 

Serve hot; oven baked potatoes or corn would make a good accompaniment with a green salad. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

             Pan-Seared Alaska Salmon With Orange Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon fillets or steaks - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- thawed if necessary
  1                cup  orange juice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  red onion -- minced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  lime juice
  1           teaspoon  Honey-Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2           cup  fat-free Italian salad dressing
  4          teaspoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Sauce:  Cook orange juice in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until it is reduced to the consistency of syrup (makes about 1/4 cup); let cool slightly. 

Place onion, lime juice, mustard and chili powder in a blender; add cooled syrup.  Blend 30 seconds.  Then, with blender running, slowly drizzle in the salad dressing so that the mixture emulsifies. 

Pan-Seared Salmon:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly season the salmon fillets or steaks with salt and pepper.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon fillets or steaks - (6 to 8 oz ea) -- thawed if necessary
  10                    oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped

                         Salmon Scampi With Wine

Recipe By     :Willard of Ward Cove, AK

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  salmon fillets
  2        tablespoons  bacon drippings
  6        tablespoons  butter or margarine
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed and minced
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  thyme leaves
  1           teaspoon  whole tarragon
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  dry Marsala wine

Trim fillets to 1 1/2-inch pieces of uniform thickness.  In frying pan, slowly cook 1 to 2 strips of bacon, or enough to yield 2 tablespoons drippings.  Remove bacon and use for another dish. 

Saute the salmon in the bacon drippings over medium heat, turning gently.  Remove to a baking dish and keep warm.  Deglaze pan with a little of the wine and scrape the residue from the pan over the fish. 

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt the butter and add the garlic and spices.  Cook, stirring over medium-low heat, for 2 to 3 minutes to extract the flavors.  Remove from heat and add the wine and lemon juice.  Pour this sauce over the fish.  Bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. 

Serve over rice, spooning pan juices over all.  Garnish with lemon wedges and finely chopped parsley. 

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings. 

Variation:  Substitute dry white wine for the Marsala for a lighter, less rich dish.
