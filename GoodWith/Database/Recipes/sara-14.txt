  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  finely-ground California walnuts -- plus
  9             pieces  California walnut -- for garnish
  1         tablespoon  melted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  5             ounces  soft goat cheese such as Montrachet
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chives -- plus additional
                        chives for garnish
  1           teaspoon  finely-diced red bell pepper

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and butter 18 gem tins (2 tablespoons each). 
In a medium bowl, combine the bread crumbs, ground California walnuts, the melted butter, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and stir until thoroughly combined.  Spoon a heaping teaspoon of the walnut mixture into each mold and press down into the bottom of the molds. 
With an electric mixer beat the cream cheese until fluffy.  Add the goat cheese and beat until creamy.  Add the egg and beat until well combined.  Add the chives, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. 
Divide the goat cheese mixture between the molds and smooth the tops.  Set a walnut piece on top of nine of the cheesecakes.  Top the remaining cheesecakes with the diced red peppers. 
Bake until puffed, about 15 minutes.  Let the cheesecakes cool on a rack for 5 minutes, then unmold.  Garnish with chives and serve warm. 
This recipe yields 6 servings as an hors d'oeuvre.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4         pounds  boiling potatoes
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  7               cups  water
  2               cups  Italian bread in 1/2" cubes -- toasted lightly
  4          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  1              pound  broccoli rabe -- discard coarse stems
                        cut into 1" florets, peel and slice thin
                        the remaining stems

Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces.  In a 4-quart saucepan boil potatoes, garlic, and water, skimming froth, until potatoes are very tender, about 15 minutes. 
Set broiler rack about 1-inch from heat and preheat broiler. 
While potatoes are boiling, in a bowl, sprinkle bread with oil and salt to taste and toss.  On a baking sheet arrange bread in one layer as close together as possible and sprinkle with half of Parmesan.  Broil bread until Parmesan is melted, about 1 minute. 
Transfer potatoes with a slotted spoon to a bowl, reserving cooking liquid in pan, and with a potato masher, mash coarse.  Stir potatoes and broccoli rabe into reserved cooking liquid and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until broccoli is tender, about five minutes. 
Stir in remaining Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste.  Serve soup with croutons. 
This recipe yields about 8 cups, serving 4.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  sifted flour
     3/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter -- cut into slim pats
     1/2         pound  Parmesan cheese -- freshly, and
                        finely grated

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine the flour, cayenne, and salt in a large shallow bowl.  With a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the mixture is the texture of coarse meal.  Add the cheese and rub into the flour-butter mixture gently with your fingertips until a small bit of dough, when pinched together, will hold its shape. 
Roll into 3/4-inch balls, place 1 1/2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets, then flatten into rounds 1/4-inch thick by pressing with a flat-bottomed glass that has been dipped into flour.  (You'll have to keep dipping the glass into flour to keep the dough from sticking to it.) 
Bake uncovered 10 to 12 minutes until pale tan.  Transfer the wafers at once to wire racks to cool, then store airtight. 
This recipe yields 6 1/2 dozen.

        Chicken Breasts Chasseur - (Supremes De Volaille Chasseur)

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     bone-in chicken breasts with skin -- (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1             medium  carrot -- chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
  2               cups  brown veal stock
  2               cups  sliced button mushrooms
  2                     shallots -- minced
  2        tablespoons  cognac
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh tarragon

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
Season the chicken with the salt and pepper.  Warm 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat.  Carefully, lay the chicken breasts, skin-side down, in the pan.  Sear for 3 minutes, or until the skin has nicely browned.  Transfer the chicken, skin-side up, to a nonstick jelly-roll pan.  Reserve the saute pan. 
Bake the chicken for 20 minutes, or until the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced with a knife. 
While the chicken is cooking, remove most of the fat from the saute pan.  Add the carrots and onions to the pan.  Saute over medium heat for 3 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to caramelize.  Add the stock and raise the heat to high.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium.  Simmer for 10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half.  Strain through a fine sieve into a small bowl; skim off any fat that rises to the surface. 
Warm the remaining 1 teaspoon oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and shallots.  Saute for 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are golden.  Season with the salt.  Remove the pan from the heat and add the cognac.  Carefully ignite the cognac with a long match.  Allow the flame to burn out, then add the wine.  Return the pan to the heat. 
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half.  Add the reserved stock and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Stir in the tarragon.  Taste and adjust the seasoning. 
Remove the skin from the chicken breasts.  Carefully cut the breast meat from the breast bone and then cut each breast, on the diagonal, into 2 pieces.  Place a divided chicken in the center of each of 4 warm dinner plates. 
Or, place Parsleyed Noodles on 4 dinner plates.  Top each with a chicken breast and the mushroom sauce.  Sprinkle with the Sauteed Carrots And Celery Root.  Remove and discard the skin from the chicken before eating. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season the chicken with the salt and pepper.  Warm 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat.  Carefully, lay the chicken breasts, skin-side down, in the pan.  Sear for 3 minutes, or until the skin has nicely browned.  Transfer the chicken, skin-side up, to a nonstick jelly-roll pan.  Reserve the saute pan. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the chicken for 20 minutes, or until the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced with a knife. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the chicken is cooking, remove most of the fat from the saute pan.  Add the carrots and onions to the pan.  Saute over medium heat for 3 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to caramelize.  Add the stock and raise the heat to high.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium.  Simmer for 10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half.  Strain through a fine sieve into a small bowl; skim off any fat that rises to the surface. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Warm the remaining 1 teaspoon oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and shallots.  Saute for 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are golden.  Season with the salt.  Remove the pan from the heat and add the cognac.  Carefully ignite the cognac with a long match.  Allow the flame to burn out, then add the wine.  Return the pan to the heat. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half.  Add the reserved stock and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Stir in the tarragon.  Taste and adjust the seasoning. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the skin from the chicken breasts.  Carefully cut the breast meat from the breast bone and then cut each breast, on the diagonal, into 2 pieces.  Place a divided chicken in the center of each of 4 warm dinner plates. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Or, place Parsleyed Noodles on 4 dinner plates.  Top each with a chicken breast and the mushroom sauce.  Sprinkle with the Sauteed Carrots And Celery Root.  Remove and discard the skin from the chicken before eating. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                     Coconut Pineapple Creme Caramel

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Razz's Restaurant & Bar
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         quart  half-and-half
  6             ounces  fresh coconut meat
                        (or 4 ounces coconut flakes)
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        (or 2 vanilla beans, split and scraped)
  8              whole  eggs
  4                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar - (to 3/4 cup) -- or to taste
  2               cans  coconut milk - (13 oz ea)
                        === CARAMEL ===
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
  1                cup  crushed pineapple

Start by making the caramel.  In saucepan cook the sugar and water on top of stove until it starts caramelizing, changing color.  When it becomes dark golden, add the crushed pineapple carefully because it will splatter.  (Sometimes it is better to heat the crushed pineapple prior to incorporating it into the sugar.)  When completely incorporated pour into a 9-inch cake pan and set aside to cool.  It will appear to be very soft candy. 
Make custard mix by heating half-and half-with the coconut and the vanilla, if using the bean.  Right before it starts to boil, pull off the heat and combine with the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, vanilla extract and coconut milk. 
Pour into cake pan that has been coated with the caramel and cook in a water bath in a 325 degree oven until it sets or feels firm (approximately 1 1/2 hours).  Cool in refrigerator for 24 hours. 
To serve, place the serving platter on top of the cake pan and turn the custard over, lifting the pan off. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  4          teaspoons  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Wash the figs well, then divide into eighths, cutting from the stem to within about 3/8-inch of the bottom, so that you can spread the wedges out like petals. 
On each of 4 salad plates, arrange 5 to 6 slices of prosciutto spoke-fashion to resemble flower petals.  Drizzle lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with pepper.  Place a fig in the center of each; then spread the wedges out like opening flowers. 
Let stand at room temperature 1 to 2 hours; then serve at the start of an elegant meal. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Julia Child
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  shelled hazelnuts
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2         stick  unsalted butter
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  egg whites
  4        tablespoons  all- purpose sifted flour - (level)
  1         tablespoon  dark Jamaican rum
                        A little soft butter

Place hazelnuts in a roasting pan and toast for 10 to 15 minutes in a pre-heated 350-degree oven.  (Hazelnuts are toasted to give additional flavor and to help loosen outside skin.)  Rub by small handfuls in a towel to remove skins.  When cool, grind 1/3 of them roughly in a blender or food processor and set aside in a small bowl.  Grind the rest of them with the sugar, and reserve for the following cookie mixture. 
Cookie Mixture:  Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees, and set rack in middle level.  Cream the butter in a mixing bowl (if chilled, cut into pieces and beat with a wooden spoon in a metal bowl over warm water; if it softens too much, then beat over cold water until a creamy mass.)  Blend in the sugar and hazelnut mixture, the salt, and the cream.  Add the egg whites, stirring only enough to blend.  Sift and fold in the flour by thirds, then fold in the rum.  Mixture should look like a heavy batter. 
Baking:  Drop a 2 tablespoon blob of cookie mixture on a buttered cookie sheet, and spread it out, into a 4 1/2-inch circle with the back of a tablespoon.  Form 1 or 2 more cookie shapes, leaving a good inch between them.  Sprinkle a pinch of chopped hazelnuts over each.  Cookies are done when 1/4 inch around edges is lightly browned. 
Set cookie sheet on open oven door and let cool a few seconds.  One at a time gently slither spatula or pancake turner under a cookie all around to loosen it, lift it off, turn it upside down on your work surface, and roll it around the metal or paper horn.  Rapidly repeat with the other cookies -- leaving them on the oven door keeps them pliable until you are ready to roll them. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  ground cooked lamb
     1/2           cup  cooked rice
     1/2           cup  raisins
     1/4           cup  chopped mint
     1/4           cup  toasted pine nuts
  2              large  eggs -- beaten slightly
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cloves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  minced onions
     1/2         stick  butter
  6                     phyllo pastry sheets
     1/4           cup  olive oil

In a large bowl combine all the stuffing ingredients, except the onions and butter.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  In a skillet, cook onions in the butter over moderate heat, stirring for 3 minutes.  Add the onion mixture to the bowl of stuffing ingredients and combine. 
Preheat oven to 425 degrees and lightly grease a large shallow baking pan. 
Stack phyllo between 2 sheets of wax paper and cover with a dry kitchen towel.  On sheet of parchment or wax paper, place sheet of phyllo, long side nearest you.  Brush lightly with oil.  On this, layer and brush 5 more sheets of phyllo in the same manner.  (Oiled phyllo stack should be 6 sheets thick.) 
Spread filling in a 3-inch-wide strip, mounding it on phyllo, 4 inches above the bottom, leaving a 2-inch border at each end.  Using parchment to help roll, lift bottom 4 inches of pastry over filling, folding in ends, and tightly roll up strudel.  Carefully transfer strudel, seam-side down, to a baking pan and lightly brush with oil. 
Bake strudel in middle of oven 25 minutes, or until golden.  Cool strudel to warm in pan on a rack.  Cut strudel into 1-inch slices with a serrated knife and serve slices warm. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  unblanched almonds
  1 1/2           cups  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper

Blanch the almonds 1 1/2 minutes in boiling water; drain.  Plunge into cold water, then slip off the skins.  Spread the almonds out on several thicknesses of paper toweling and pat dry.  Transfer to fresh paper toweling and let dry 24 hours. 
Heat the oil in a 10-inch iron skillet over moderate heat about 2 minutes or until an almond, dropped into the oil, sizzles gently.  Add half of the almonds to the oil and saute, stirring often, 4 to 5 minutes over moderately-low heat until the color of light caramel.  Dump the almonds into a colander set over a heatproof bowl; shake to drain off as much oil as possible, then drain on paper toweling. 
Return the oil to the skillet and fry and drain the remaining almonds the same way.  Sprinkle with salt and cayenne and toss well; store in an airtight canister.  Note: the sauteeing oil can later be used to dress vegetables or salads. 
This recipe yields 1 pound.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  sliced yellow onions
  4        tablespoons  olive oil - (to 6 tbspns)
                        Chilled pie crust dough -- (see below)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano, thyme,
                        or mixed dried herbs
  2               cans  flat anchovy fillets packed in oil -- (2 oz ea)
  24                    black olives (Mediterranean)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4         sticks  chilled unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  chilled lard or shortening
  5        tablespoons  iced water - (to 8 tbspns)

Dough:  Measure the flour and salt into the processor.  Quarter the chilled butter lengthwise, cut crosswise into 3/8 pieces, and add to the bowl along with the chilled lard or shortening, cut into small pieces. 
Turn machine on and off 4 or 5 times to break up the fat.  Measure out 5 tablespoons iced water, turn the machine on, and pour it in.  Turn machine on and off 5 or 6 times, and dough should begin to mass on blade; if not, dribble in another tablespoon water and repeat.  Repeat again if necessary.  Dough is done when it has begun to mass; it should not be overmixed.  Remove dough to your work surface. 
With the heel, not the warm palm of your hand rapidly and roughly smear dough out 6 to 8 inches on your work surface by 3 spoonful bits, to make a final blending of fat and flour.  If pastry seems stiff, sprinkle on droplets more water as you smear.  It should be pliable, not damp and sticky.  Knead and press it rapidly into a rough cake, flour lightly, and wrap in a sheet of plastic or put in a plastic bag.  Chill for 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before using, which will allow dough to relax while the flour particles absorb the liquid. 
Cook the onions slowly in 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a roomy covered frying pan or saucepan, stirring frequently, until they are soft and thoroughly tender, but not browned -- 20 minutes or more. 
Meanwhile, butter the bottom (not the sides) of the jelly-roll pan.  Rapidly roll out the chilled dough into a rectangle 1/8-inch thick, and larger and wider than the pan.  Fit it into the pan, and neatly trim off the overhanging edges.  Fold edges of dough down against bottom all around; press a decorative border into them with the tines of a table fork.  Prick inside surface of dough all over with 2 forks, to keep it from rising up during baking.  Cover and refigerate until you are ready to continue. 
When onions are tender, season carefully with salt and pepper, and either let them cool or stir over cold water until cool.  Spread them over the inside surface of the dough. 
Baking:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  While the oven is pre-heating, arrange a diagonal design of anchovies, over the onions with black olives at strategic intervals.  Sprinkle the cheese over the onions and the design, and dribble on a tablespoon of olive oil.  Bake in lower third level of oven for 25 to 30 minutes until pastry has browned and is beginning to shrink from the sides of the pan. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

Dough:  Measure the flour and salt into the processor.  Quarter the chilled butter lengthwise, cut crosswise into 3/8 pieces, and add to the bowl along with the chilled lard or shortening, cut into small pieces. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Turn machine on and off 4 or 5 times to break up the fat.  Measure out 5 tablespoons iced water, turn the machine on, and pour it in.  Turn machine on and off 5 or 6 times, and dough should begin to mass on blade; if not, dribble in another tablespoon water and repeat.  Repeat again if necessary.  Dough is done when it has begun to mass; it should not be overmixed.  Remove dough to your work surface. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
With the heel, not the warm palm of your hand rapidly and roughly smear dough out 6 to 8 inches on your work surface by 3 spoonful bits, to make a final blending of fat and flour.  If pastry seems stiff, sprinkle on droplets more water as you smear.  It should be pliable, not damp and sticky.  Knead and press it rapidly into a rough cake, flour lightly, and wrap in a sheet of plastic or put in a plastic bag.  Chill for 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before using, which will allow dough to relax while the flour particles absorb the liquid. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the onions slowly in 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a roomy covered frying pan or saucepan, stirring frequently, until they are soft and thoroughly tender, but not browned -- 20 minutes or more. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, butter the bottom (not the sides) of the jelly-roll pan.  Rapidly roll out the chilled dough into a rectangle 1/8-inch thick, and larger and wider than the pan.  Fit it into the pan, and neatly trim off the overhanging edges.  Fold edges of dough down against bottom all around; press a decorative border into them with the tines of a table fork.  Prick inside surface of dough all over with 2 forks, to keep it from rising up during baking.  Cover and refigerate until you are ready to continue. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When onions are tender, season carefully with salt and pepper, and either let them cool or stir over cold water until cool.  Spread them over the inside surface of the dough. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Baking:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  While the oven is pre-heating, arrange a diagonal design of anchovies, over the onions with black olives at strategic intervals.  Sprinkle the cheese over the onions and the design, and dribble on a tablespoon of olive oil.  Bake in lower third level of oven for 25 to 30 minutes until pastry has browned and is beginning to shrink from the sides of the pan.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  quinoa (small disk-shaped seeds)
  1 1/2           cups  cooked black beans -- rinsed, if canned
  1 1/2    tablespoons  red-wine vinegar
  1 1/2           cups  cooked corn (cut from abt 2 large ears)
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped green bell pepper
  2                     pickled jalapeÒo chilies -- seeded, minced
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh coriander
                        === FOR DRESSING ===
  5        tablespoons  fresh lime juice -- or to taste
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  ground cumin -- or to taste
     1/3           cup  olive oil

In a bowl wash quinoa in at least 5 changes cold water, rubbing grains and letting them settle before pouring off most of water, until water runs clear and drain in a large fine sieve. 
In a saucepan of salted boiling water cook quinoa 10 minutes.  Drain quinoa in sieve and rinse under cold water.  Set sieve over a saucepan of boiling water (quinoa should not touch water) and steam quinoa, covered with a kitchen towel and lid, until fluffy and dry, about 10 minutes (check water level in kettle occasionally, adding water if necessary). 
While quinoa is cooking, in a small bowl toss beans with vinegar and salt and pepper to taste.  Transfer quinoa to a large bowl and cool.  Add beans, corn, bell pepper, jalapeÒo, and coriander and toss well. 
Make dressing:  In a small bowl whisk together lime juice, salt, and cumin and add oil in a stream, whisking. 
Drizzle dressing over salad and toss well with salt and pepper to taste.  Salad may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring salad to room temperature before serving. 
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose bleached flour
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  baking powder
  7        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter
  1                     egg
                        === WHITE CHOCOLATE FILLING ===
     2/3           cup  heavy whipping cream
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  8             ounces  white chocolate -- cut into 1/4" pieces
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Raspberries
                        Blueberries

To mix the dough in the food processor, place flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in work bowl fitted with metal blade.  Pulse 3 or 4 times to mix.  Cut butter into 7 or 8 pieces and add to work bowl.  Pulse about 12 to 15 times, until mixture is reduced to a fine powder, do not allow to become pasty.  Add egg and continue to pulse until dough forms a ball.  Remove dough from work bowl to lightly floured work surface and pat dough into a 5-inch disk.  Use immediately, or wrap in plastic and chill until firm before using. 
To make a free-form tart crust, roll dough to a 12-inch disk and transfer it to a parchment or foil-lined cookie sheet or the back of a jelly-roll pan.  Using a plate or cardboard disk as a pattern, trim the dough to an even 12-inch diameter.  Fold under about 1/2-inch of dough at the edge of the disk of dough, then flute the edge as if it were a pie, to make the edge stand up (use the thumb and index finger of one hand on the outside of the tart shell and the index finger of the other hand on the inside and pinch gently from the outside while pressing lightly from the inside) repeat all around the edge of the crust.  Pierce the dough with a fork before baking. 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees and set a rack in the middle level.  Place pan in oven and lower heat to 350 degrees.  Bake for about 20 minutes, checking once or twice.  When baked, remove pan from oven to a rack to cool. 
To make the white chocolate filling, bring the cream and butter to a boil in a saucepan.  Remove from heat and add the white chocolate.  Let stand 3 minutes, then whisk smooth.  Pour the ganache into a bowl and refrigerate until it thickens to spreading consistency, then whip briefly by machine until aerated.  Use immediately. 
To fill the shell, spread half the white chocolate filling on the baked dough.  Then use concentric circles of raspberries, blueberries and white chocolate filling piped in stars with a star tube. 
This recipe yields 1 tart.

Fold under about 1/2-inch of dough at the edge of the disk of dough, then flute the edge as if it were a pie, to make the edge stand up (use the thumb and index finger of one hand on the outside of the tart shell and the index finger of the other hand on the inside and pinch gently from the outside while pressing lightly from the inside) repeat all around the edge of the crust.  Pierce the dough with a fork before baking.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees and set a rack in the middle level.  Place pan in oven and lower heat to 350 degrees.  Bake for about 20 minutes, checking once or twice.  When baked, remove pan from oven to a rack to cool. 
</DirT>

To make the white chocolate filling, bring the cream and butter to a boil in a saucepan.  Remove from heat and add the white chocolate.  Let stand 3 minutes, then whisk smooth.  Pour the ganache into a bowl and refrigerate until it thickens to spreading consistency, then whip briefly by machine until aerated.  Use immediately. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To fill the shell, spread half the white chocolate filling on the baked dough.  Then use concentric circles of raspberries, blueberries and white chocolate filling piped in stars with a star tube.

This recipe yields 1 tart.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     fresh corn ears
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  milk
     2/3           cup  cornmeal
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1 1/2           cups  Colby Cheddar cheese in 1/2" cubes

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Rub the corn with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Arrange the corn on a baking sheet and roast, turning once, for 15 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, cut the kernels from the cob. 
Lower the oven to 375 degrees.  Butter a 1-quart souffle dish or glass baking dish.  In a medium saucepan, heat the milk until just boiling.  Slowly add the cornmeal, whisking constantly.  Cook the mixture, whisking, until thick and smooth, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to a bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Let cool slightly.  Stir in the egg yolks and mustard and combine well.  Stir in the corn and Colby cheese. 
In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until they just hold stiff peaks.  Gently fold egg whites into cornmeal mixture until just combined.  Pour batter into prepared dish and bake in middle of oven until just puffed and golden, about 40 minutes. 
This recipe yields 4 side dish servings.

                          Spanish Potato Omelet

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes                      Omelets


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  olive oil
  4              large  potatoes -- peeled, cut 1/8" slices
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
  4              large  eggs
  1          small jar  roasted red peppers -- julienned

Heat the oil in a 9-inch skillet and add the potato slices one at a time so they don't sitck together.  Alternate layers of potato with the onion slices and salt the layers lightly.  Cook slowly over medium heat (the potatoes will really boil in the oil rather than fry), lifting and turning the potatoes occasionally, until they are tender but not brown.  The potatoes should remain separated, not in a "cake."  Drain the potatoes in a colander, reserving about 3 tablespoons of the oil.  (The onion and potato give the oil a wonderful flavor, so save the rest for some other use.)  Wipe out the skillet, scraping off any stuck particles.  (If this is difficult to do, wash the skillet.  It will be used again to set the omelet and must be completely clean to avoid sticking.) 
Meanwhile, in a large bowl beat the eggs with a fork until they are slightly foamy.  Salt to taste.  Add the potatoes and julienned red peppers to the beaten egg, pressing the potatoes down with a pancake turner so that they are completely covered by the egg.  Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes. 
Heat 2 tablespoons of the reserved oil in the skillet until it reaches the smoking point.  (It must be very hot or the eggs will stick.)  Add the potatoes, pepper and egg mixture, spreading it out rapidly in the skillet with the aid of a pancake turner.  Lower the heat to medium-high and shake the pan often to prevent sticking.  When the eggs begin to brown underneath, invert a plate of the same size over the skillet and flip the omelet onto the plate.  Add about 1 tablespoon more oil to the pan, then slide the omelet back into the skillet to brown on the other side. 
Lower the heat to medium and flip the omelet two or three more times (this helps to give the omelet a good shape while it continues to cook), cooking briefly on each side.  It should be juicy within.  Transfer to a platter and cool, then cut in thin wedges. 
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        === WATERMELON SALSA ===
  2        tablespoons  diced red onion
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  red wine
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  finely-diced watermelon
     1/4      teaspoon  chives
     1/4      teaspoon  black sesame seeds
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SPICY GLAZE ===
  1                cup  honey
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce
  1        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  cumin
  1        tablespoons  curry
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Make the salsa:  Marinate the onion, red wine vinegar, red wine, and sugar for about an hour.  Drain liquid from the onions.  Combine onions with the remaining ingredients and chill. 
Make the glaze:  Combine all the glaze ingredients and bring to a slow simmer for ten minutes. 
Divide the salsa among 4 dinner plates.  Brush the spicy glaze on the skin side of the salmon fillets, turn over and put a very heavy coating on top.  Set aside. 
Heat a heavy-bottomed saute pan over medium heat.  Add enough of the vegetable oil to film the bottom of the saute pan.  Place the salmon fillets in the pan topside down and cook until the fish is glazed and mahogany brown.  Flip and cook on the skin side for 3 to 6 minutes until the fillets are medium-rare.  Remove from heat and place on top of salsa.  Sprinkle with a little coarse ground pepper. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2           cup  fresh chervil tops (or fresh oregano)
                        === SHALLOT-CITRUS VINAIGRETTE ===
  3        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2          teaspoons  grained Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  honey -- or to taste
  2        tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
  1        tablespoons  blood orange juice
                        (or use regular orange juice)
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
     1/2           cup  olive oil

Divide the greens between 6 or 8 individual salad plates and place the watermelon pieces on top.  Sprinkle with the reserved sesame seeds and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  minced onions
     2/3           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  1                cup  water
     3/4         pound  lean ground beef
     3/4         pound  lean ground pork
  2              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  beef stock

In a small, heavy skillet over medium-high heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter.  Add the onions and saute, stirring often until soft, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside. 
In the large bowl of an electric mixer, combine the bread crumbs and water.  Let stand until soft, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the reserved onions along with the beef, pork, egg yolks, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and allspice.  Beat on low speed until smooth.  Turn the mixer to high speed and beat until the mixture is light in color and fluffy, about 10 minutes.  Using 2 spoons dipped in cold water, shape the meat into 1-inch balls. 
In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 4 tablespoons butter.  Cook the meatballs in batches of about 15 to 20 at a time and brown on all sides.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain briefly on paper towels before removing to a warmed serving platter.  Cover to keep warm. 
When all the meatballs are cooked, reduce the heat to low and add the flour to the skillet.  Cook, stirring, until lightly browned.  Slowly add the beef stock.  Cook, whisking, until the gravy is thick and smooth.  Strain, if desired.  Pour the gravy over the meatballs and serve hot. 
This recipe yields about 90 meatballs.

Categories    : Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FISH MOUSSE ===
  1 1/2         pounds  fillet of sole or flounder
     1/2         pound  scallops -- washed, drained
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2               cups  bread crumbs
  2               cups  heavy cream - (to 3 cups)
  4        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Freshly-grated white pepper -- to taste
                        Nutmeg -- to taste
                        === WATERCRESS AND SALMON GARNISH ===
  1        large bunch  fresh watercress
  4                     scallions - (to 5)
  2 1/2    tablespoons  butter - (to 3 tbspns)
     1/4         pound  smoked salmon

Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees and place a roasting pan half full of water in it, for baking the terrine.  Cut a piece of waxed paper a little larger all around than the terrine, and a piece of aluminum foil slightly larger than that.  Butter one side of the waxed paper. 
Pull the tender leaves and top stems off the watercress (you may save the rest for watercress soup), and chop them very fine, mince with the white and tender green of the scallions; saute slowly in 2 tablespoons butter for a minute or so, until limp.  Set aside in a bowl.  Look over the salmon to be sure there are no bones. 
Cut fillets into 2-inch pieces and puree with the scallops, using the steelblade.  Remove cover and add the eggs, salt, bread crumbs, 2 cups cream, the lemon juice, 10 grinds of pepper, and nutmeg.  Puree for 30 seconds or so.  Remove cover; scrape and stir contents about, and puree longer if not smooth.  When you spoon a little up, mousse should hold its shape softly -- if you think it could take more cream, start the machine again, and add more in a thin stream, checking that you have not softened the puree too much.  Remove cover, and taste carefully for seasoning -- it should seem a little oversalted and overseasoned if you are to serve it cold, since the seasonings will become less strong once a mousse is cooked and cooled. 
Assembling the terrine:  (The mousse is arranged in layers in the terrine: plain mousse; green; plain mousse; salmon; ending with plain mousse.  Some of the plain mousse is blended with the watercress and with the salmon; otherwise the layers would separate when the mousse is sliced.) 
Spread a layer of plain mousse in the terrine, filling it by 1/4.  Smooth out with the back of a soup spoon dipped in cold water.  Stir a dollop of mousse into the watercress (about twice the amount of mousse to cress) and spread into terrine, smoothing it also with a wet spoon.  Spread on another layer of plain mousse, and then remove all but a large dollop of mousse from the processor bowl.  Place salmon in processor with the remaining mousse and puree for several seconds until smooth; spread the salmon in the terrine, and top with a final layer of plain mousse, filling the terrine to the top.  Cover with waxed paper, buttered-side down, then wax-paper and foil should not come too far down sides of mold, or water from baking pan may seep into mousse. 
Assembled terrine should be baked promptly, since raw fish deteriorates rapidly even under refrigeration. 
Baking:  1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.  As soon as possible, set the terrine in the pre-heated oven in the pan of hot water.  When mousse starts to rise above rim of terrine, after an hour or more, it is almost done -- and not until then.  It is done at an interior temperature reading of 160 degrees.  Can be served hot or cold. 
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.
