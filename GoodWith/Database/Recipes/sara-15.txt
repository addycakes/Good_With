                           Apple Cake In A Jar

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy Riki Senn at Greenbriar
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes                           Canning
                Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  allspice
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  2          teaspoons  baking soda
     2/3           cup  vegetable shortening
  2 1/3           cups  sugar
  4                     eggs
  2               cups  applesauce
  1                cup  chopped walnuts

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease twelve 1/2-pint wide-mouth canning jars with a paper towel dipped in shortening. 
Sift flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and baking soda into a large bowl.  Using the electric mixer and a medium mixing bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar on low speed, then increase to medium speed to mix well.  While the mixer is running, add the eggs, one at a time.  Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir in the applesauce.  With a large spoon, stir in the sifted flour mixture and the walnuts. 
Pour the batter into a measuring cup with a spout; pour the batter neatly into the greased jars.  Fill the jars halfway full.  Place the filled jars on the sheet tray and bake on the center rack of the oven for 45 minutes.  When done, the top of the cake will spring back when pressed with a finger, and the sides will have come away from the jar. 
Remove from oven and let cool 10 to 15 minutes.  Cake will still be warm, but not hot.  Place a circle of waxed paper on top of the jar and seal with the jar lid.  Pack carefully so as not to break the glass. 
This recipe yields 12 cakes.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Elizabeth Guittar
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  high-quality bacon strips
  1            package  grissini-style bread sticks - (lg pkg)
  1                box  dark brown sugar

Cut bacon strips in half and lay them out on a cutting board.  Break the bread sticks into 4-inch lengths.  Sprinkle the bacon with brown sugar so that the bacon is completely coated.  Press the sugar onto the bacon with your fingers.  Continue to sprinkle sugar and press it on until no more sugar will adhere. 
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Set a rack over a foil-lined baking sheet.  Roll the bacon strips, sugar-side in, around the bread sticks in a spiral fashion.  Be sure to begin as close to the bread stick edge as possible and roll very tightly.  Place seam-side down on the rack.  Bake about 20 minutes, but watch carefully so that the sugar doesn't burn in the last minutes of cooking. 
Remove them from the oven and let rest for an hour on the rack to become firm.  (To prepare ahead and freeze, bake the sticks half way, freeze on a baking sheet, and store in the freezer in a plastic bag.  To serve, bake the sticks for the remaining 10 minutes.) 
This recipe yields ?? servings. 
Comments:  Elizabeth advises using very good bacon and making several batches at a time as they go very quickly!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              slice  whole-wheat toast
                        (or a thin slice of toasted bagel)
     1/2      teaspoon  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  low-fat cottage cheese
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  nonfat or low-fat buttermilk,
                        or half-and-half, or cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the oven to 325 degrees.  If using toast, cut a hole in the center about the size of an egg yolk.  Butter the bread slice and spread it with cottage cheese.  Place it in a small baking dish.  Break the egg over the hole in the bread slice.  Spoon the buttermilk over the egg.  Bake until the white is set and the yolk firm but not solid, about 8 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper. 
This recipe yields 1 serving.

  2             sprigs  tarragon -- leaves picked,
                        and coarsely chopped (2 tspns)
  2             sprigs  Italian parsley -- leaves picked,
                        and coarsely chopped (2 tbspns)
  4             ounces  peeled raw Maine shrimp or raw scallops
                        or cooked crabmeat or lobster meat -- cut into 1/2" dice
                        Kosher or sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2                     live hard shell select lobsters -- (1 1/2 to 2 lbs ea)
  3             ounces  Ritz crackers, common crackers, oyster
                        crackers, or dried corn bread -- crumbled

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. 
Melt 8 tablespoons butter in a 9-inch skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until soft but not browned.  Stir in the tarragon and parsley.  If using raw shrimp or scallops, add them with the herbs and cook for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.  If using cooked lobster or crabmeat, remove the pan from the heat as soon as you stir in the herbs, let cool, and then add the lobster or crabmeat.  Season with salt and pepper. 
With a cleaver of chef's knife, split the lobsters in half lengthwise.  Remove and discard the head sac and intestine.  Remove the tomalley and the roe if present and place in a small bowl.  Break into small pieces using a fork.  With the back side of a knife, crack the center of each claw on one side only.  Season the lobsters lightly with salt and pepper.  On a large roasting pan or baking sheet, place the halves together to resemble a butterfly. 
The tomalley and roe are optional for the stuffing.  If you want to include them, mix them into the seafood mixture.  Gently fold the crumbled crackers into the mixture.  Divide the mixture evenly between 2 lobsters.  If you are serving 1 lobster per person, spread the stuffing over the center so that the lobsters look whole again.  Do not pack the stuffing tightly, or it will affect the even baking of the lobster.  Brush the 3 tablespoons melted butter over the exposed meat tail, stuffing and claws.  Bake until the lobster is cooked through and the stuffing is crisp and golden.  Bake 17 minutes for a 1 1/2 pound lobster and 24 minutes for a 2-pound lobster. 
This recipe yields 2 lobsters.

  8                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1                     onion -- minced

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4            cup  lukewarm water -- divided
  1         tablespoon  yeast
  3               cups  flour -- plus extra
                        for kneading dough
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  Parmesan cheese
  1 1/2      teaspoons  garlic powder
  1                cup  lukewarm water
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

Mix yeast and 1/4 cup lukewarm water in a small bowl.  Let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes.  The yeast will dissolve and become foamy. 
Put the flour, salt, sugar, Parmesan cheese and garlic powder into the bowl of a food processor.  Press the pulse button a few times to mix everything together. 
Mix the dissolved yeast mixture with remaining 1 cup lukewarm water.  Turn the food processor on.  Pour the water and yeast into the food processor through the hole in the top.  Let the machine run until the dough makes a ball.  If the dough is too sticky to make a ball, add a little more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it forms a ball.  Take the dough out of the processor and knead on a floured countertop until the dough is very smooth. 
Pour one tablespoon of olive oil into a medium bowl and swirl it around until the bowl is coated.  Place dough ball into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Place in a warm, draft-free place.  The dough should rise (grow) until it is twice as big as when you put it in the bowl.  This should take about 1 hour. 
Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl.  Using your fist, press all the air out of the dough.  The dough is now ready to roll out and prepare according to the pizza recipe directions.  (Note: You can wrap your dough in plastic wrap and keep it in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours before making pizza.) 
This recipe yields dough for 2 medium pizza crusts.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  top round London Broil -- trimmed of fat
  3        tablespoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  onion powder

Cut meat into strips a little less than 1/4-inch thick.  Place strips in a shallow bowl.  Combine salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small bowl.  Rub spice mixture into strips.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and marinate for 48 hours in the refrigerator. 
Remove a rack from the oven.  Preheat the oven to 115 degrees.  Remove the strips from the marinade and lay them directly on the oven rack so that air can circulate around them.  Line the bottom of the oven with aluminum foil to catch the drippings.  Place the rack in the oven, leaving it partially open to maintain a constant temperature of 110 to 115 degrees.  Leave the jerky in the oven until well dried, 6 to 8 hours. 
Note:  The USDA recommends cooking the beef jerky at 160 degrees for the first 4 hours and then reducing the temperature to 130 degrees during the dehydrating process. 
This recipe yields approximately 1 pound dried jerky.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  barley malt syrup
                        (may substitute maple syrup)
     1/4           cup  mixed fruit juice concentrate
                        (may substitute orange juice
                        or apple juice concentrate)
  5               cups  rolled oats
  1                cup  raisins

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a large saucepan, combine the honey, barley malt syrup and fruit juice concetrate.  Heat over medium heat until you can stir the mixture easily, but before it starts to boil, about 5 minutes. 
Place the oats in a large mixing bowl.  Add the honey mixture and stir rapidly and thoroughly to coat the oats.  Spread them in a thin, even layer on a large nonstick baking sheet (you may need two).  Place it in the oven and bake until the granola is crisp, no more than 15 minutes.  Watch carefully, or the granola may burn. 
Remove the baking sheet to a cooling rack.  Let the granola cool thorougly on the baking sheet.  Place the granola in a large bowl, break up any large chunks, stir in the raisins and transfer to a tightly covered container. 
This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a large saucepan, combine the honey, barley malt syrup and fruit juice concetrate.  Heat over medium heat until you can stir the mixture easily, but before it starts to boil, about 5 minutes.

Place the oats in a large mixing bowl.  Add the honey mixture and stir rapidly and thoroughly to coat the oats.  Spread them in a thin, even layer on a large nonstick baking sheet (you may need two).  Place it in the oven and bake until the granola is crisp, no more than 15 minutes.  Watch carefully, or the granola may burn. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the baking sheet to a cooling rack.  Let the granola cool thorougly on the baking sheet.  Place the granola in a large bowl, break up any large chunks, stir in the raisins and transfer to a tightly covered container.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2            cup  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  5        tablespoons  frozen butter -- cubed
     1/4           cup  frozen shortening -- cut large chunks
  5        tablespoons  ice water
  4               cups  blueberries
  4        tablespoons  butter -- diced
  2               cups  sugar

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Lightly grease an 8- by 8-inch baking pan. 
In the work bowl of a food processor, combine the flour and salt.  Quickly cut the butter and shortening into the dry mixture until the size of small peas.  Dribble in the ice water a little at a time and process quickly to moisten the mixture until it starts to come together.  This pastry can be made ahead of time and refrigerated between two sheets of waxed paper until ready to use. 
Roll out the pastry into a large sheet, approximately 20 by 12 inches.  Lay into the prepared baking dish, gently tucking it into the corners and allowing the extra to hang over the sides. 
Spread the blueberries evenly in the baking dish.  Dot with the diced butter.  Sprinkle with 1 1/2 cups of the sugar.  Flip the overhanging pastry over the blueberries to make a top.  If pieces break off, just set them on top.  The cobbler should look rustic.  Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup sugar over the pastry. 
Place in preheated oven and immediately reduce heat to 425 degrees.  Bake for 45 minutes, until dough is golden brown and berry juice bubbles up. 
Serve with warm vanilla ice cream. 
This recipe yields 1 cobbler.

Rub the whole garlic clove over both sides of the lamb and put the lamb in a shallow glass or ceramic dish.  Pour the marinade over the meat and turn it several times to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours.  About 30 minutes before grilling, remove the meat from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature. 
Prepare a charcoal or gas grill arranging the coals for indirect cooking.  Lightly spray the grill rack with vegetable oil cooking spray.  The coals should be hot.  Lift the lamb from the marinade, scrape off the excess marinade, and season both sides with salt and pepper.  Discard the marinade.  Combine the oil and crushed garlic in a small bowl for brushing on the meat. 
Sear the lamb over the hot coals for about 5 minutes on each side, brushing with the olive oil and garlic mixture several times; continue brushing the lamb with the remaining olive oil and garlic mixture during the first 20 minutes of grilling. 
Move the lamb to the cooler part of the grill, cover, and cook for about 10 minutes.  Turn the meat over, cover, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes longer for medium-rare meat, or until cooked to desired doneness.  An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the meat should register 140 degrees for rare meat and 145 to 150 degrees for medium-rare.  Let the lamb rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE BATTER ===
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  3                     eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  3                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  milk or buttermilk
  4               cups  pitted sour cherries
                        === CRUMB TOPPING ===
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  brown sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  1 1/2         sticks  unsalted butter -- melted

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 10- by 15-inch jelly roll pan and line the bottom with a sheet of parchment or waxed paper. 
In a large mixer bowl, beat the butter and sugar until soft and light.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition.  Beat in the vanilla.  Sift together the flour and baking powder and stir into the batter in three additions, alternating with the yolks and milk, beginning and ending with the flour. 
Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.  Scatter the cherries evenly over the batter, pressing them in gently. 
For the crumbs, mix the flour, sugars, cinnamon and nutmeg in a bowl.  Melt the butter and stir it in evenly.  Rub the mixture to coarse crumbs by hand.  Scatter the crumbs over the berries as evenly as possible. 
Bake the cake about 40 minutes until batter is firm and crumbs are well colored.  Cool the cake in the pan on a rack.  Cut the cooled cake into twenty four 3-inch squares.  Remove the squares from the pan to a platter. 
This recipe yields 24 servings.

In a large mixer bowl, beat the butter and sugar until soft and light.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition.  Beat in the vanilla.

     Cotelettes D'agneau A La Provencale - Lamb Chops Provence-Style

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     lamb chops from the rib
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped scallions
  2        tablespoons  chopped mushrooms
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  dry crumbs of French bread
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  champagne or other dry white wine
     1/2           cup  consomme
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2        tablespoons  dry crumbs of French bread
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallots
  2          teaspoons  chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  chopped scallions
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     orange

Trim fat from the chops.  In a shallow baking dish, whisk together olive oil, basil, parsley, scallions, mushrooms, salt and pepper.  Marinate chops for half an hour, turning once.  Without removing the marinade ingredients from the surface of the chops, coat them with breadcrumbs.  Broil the chops, not too closely to the heat, for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, or until the crumbs are nicely browned and the chops are pink on the inside. 
Meanwhile prepare the sauce:  Cook the wine and consomme in a saucepan.  Knead together the butter and crumbs, shallots, parsley, scallions, salt and pepper.  Add this mixture to the simmering liquid, stirring.  Continue to simmer the sauce, stirring occasionally, until some of the liquid evaporates and the sauce thickens.  Just before serving, stir in the zest of 1/4 orange and 2 to 3 tablespoons orange juice.  Serve in a sauceboat with lamb chops. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place couscous and salt in a stainless steel or glass mixing bowl.  Place chicken stock and apple juice in a small saucepan and heat to a rolling boil.  Alternately, place chicken stock and apple juice in a microwave safe container and microwave on high until boiling rapidly.  Pour boiling liquid over couscous.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let stand 5 minutes or until all liquid is absorbed.  Remove plastic wrap and fluff couscous with two forks.  Spread couscous on a baking sheet and place in refrigerator to cool completely. 
Combine remaining salad ingredients.  Taste and season with salt and pepper.  When couscous is cold, combine with mixed salad ingredients.  Add dressing and toss to coat thoroughly. 
This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  double-acting baking powder
  3        tablespoons  sugar -- if desired
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  heavy cream
                        Milk -- for brushing tops
                        of biscuits

Into a bowl sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt, add the cream, and stir the mixture until it just forms a dough.  Gather the dough into a ball, knead it gently 6 times on a lightly floured surface, and roll or pat it out 1/2-inch thick. 
Cut out as many rounds as possible with a 2 1/2-inch round cutter dipped in flour and transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet.  Gather the scraps, reroll the dough, and cut out more rounds in the same manner until there are 10 in all. 
Brush the tops of the rounds with the milk and bake the biscuits in a preheated 425 preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until they are pale golden.  Transfer the biscuits to a rack and let them cool for 5 minutes. 
This recipe yields 10 biscuits.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  heavy cream
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  1              pinch  salt
  8                     egg yolks
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  16         teaspoons  turbinado sugar -- for glazing

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. In a medium saucepan cook the cream with the vanilla bean and salt over moderate heat until the surface begins to shimmer. 
In a large heatproof bowl, blend the egg yolks and granulated sugar with a wooden spoon.  Slowly add the hot cream mixture, stirring gently.  Strain the custard into a large measuring cup; skim off any bubbles. 
Arrange 8 shallow 4 1/2-inch wide ramekins in a roasting pan.  Slowly pour the custard into the ramekins, filling them almost to the top.  Set the roasting pan in the center of the oven and carefully pour in enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins.  Cover the pan loosely with foil and bake for about 1 hour, or until the custards are firm at the edges, but still a bit wobbly in the center.  (If using deeper 3/4-cup ramekins, bake the custards for about 20 minutes longer and reduce the sugar topping to 1 teaspoon per custard.) 
Transfer the ramekins to a wire rack to cool completely.  Cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 3 hours or up to 2 days. 
Preheat the broiler.  Set the ramekins on a baking sheet and blot the surfaces of the custards to remove any condensation.  Using a small sieve, sift 2 teaspoons of the turbinado sugar over each custard in a thin, even layer.  Broil the custards as close to the heat as possible until the sugar is evenly caramelized, 30 seconds to 2 minutes.  Let cool slightly and serve at once. 
This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    fingerling or creamer potatoes - (2/12 to
                        3 oz ea)
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              large  Portobella mushrooms - (1 lb total)
  6             ounces  Crescenza or other flavorful melting
                        cheese
  2               cups  young peppery greens - (lightly packed)
                        (greens such as watercress, upland cress
                        and/or arugula)
                        Rice Vinegar And Sesame Vinaigrette -- see * Note
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Red and yellow peppers -- diced tiny, blanched
                        Basil oil or fruity olive oil

* Note:  see the "Rice Vinegar And Sesame Vinaigrette" recipe which is included in this collection. 
Scrub the potatoes well, pat dry and then lightly coat with olive oil and a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper.  Roast potatoes in a preheated 375 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until just cooked through.  Cool and quarter lengthwise. 
Remove stem and scrape black gills from the portabellas.  Brush with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Grill, pan grill or roast until just cooked through.  Cool and slice each mushroom into 12 thick slices. 
To construct a stack, lightly oil a baking sheet and arrange 4 quarters of potato interspersed with 3 slices of mushroom side by side in the same direction.  Top with a half ounce or so of cheese and then arrange another layer at right angles to the first.  Finish with a top layer of potatoes and a dollop of cheese.  Construct 3 more stacks in the same manner. 
When ready to serve place baking sheet in a preheated 400 degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes to heat vegetables through and barely melt the cheese. 
While vegetables are heating toss the greens with Rice Vinegar And Sesame Vinaigrette.  Place a stack on a heated plate and top with a quarter of the dressed greens.  Scatter the diced peppers around and drizzle the plate with the basil oil.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

 Crispy Potato Spring Rolls With Tuna Sushi In A Lemon Thyme Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Anthony Ambrose
Serving Size  : 20    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  ground pink peppercorns
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
     1/2           cup  honey
  1 1/2           cups  olive oil
     1/2         bunch  lemon thyme
  1              pound  Yukon Gold potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              ounce  julienne of sun dried tomatoes
  4                     green onions, green parts only -- cut 5" long pieces
  4                     rice paper wrappers - (12")
  3             ounces  #1 sushi grade yellowfin tuna -- cut 5" long bars

Make the vinaigrette:  In a bowl, whisk together lemon juice, pink pepper, white pepper, and salt.  Whisk in honey.  Drizzle in olive oil in a slow stream to emulsify.  This is a temporary emulsification and needs to be whisked just before serving. 
In a heated pan with olive oil saute the potatoes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover the pan and roast until potatoes are tender.  Add sun-dried tomatoes to the pan.  Transfer mixture to a bowl.  With a hand-held masher, mash the mixture until fluffy.  Check for seasoning.  Place the potatoes mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a round tip. 
To hydrate the rice paper wrappers, fill a large bowl with warm water.  Place the wrappers in water for about 3 minutes until soft. 
Remove one wrapper at a time from the water, lay out on a flat surface, and blot with a paper towel.  Pipe a 5-inch strip of mashed potatoes in the center of the wrapper.  Lay a tuna bar and a piece of scallion evenly next to the potato.  Roll into a spring roll. 
In a very hot pan with oil saute the spring rolls quickly, browning all sides.  Cook on very high heat, making sure not to cook the tuna. 
Cut each spring roll into 5 pieces.  Brush with olive oil.  Drizzle with the vinaigrette and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 20 pieces.

Make the vinaigrette:  In a bowl, whisk together lemon juice, pink pepper, white pepper, and salt.  Whisk in honey.  Drizzle in olive oil in a slow stream to emulsify.  This is a temporary emulsification and needs to be whisked just before serving. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a heated pan with olive oil saute the potatoes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover the pan and roast until potatoes are tender.  Add sun-dried tomatoes to the pan.  Transfer mixture to a bowl.  With a hand-held masher, mash the mixture until fluffy.  Check for seasoning.  Place the potatoes mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a round tip.

<DirT>
To hydrate the rice paper wrappers, fill a large bowl with warm water.  Place the wrappers in water for about 3 minutes until soft. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove one wrapper at a time from the water, lay out on a flat surface, and blot with a paper towel.  Pipe a 5-inch strip of mashed potatoes in the center of the wrapper.  Lay a tuna bar and a piece of scallion evenly next to the potato.  Roll into a spring roll. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a very hot pan with oil saute the spring rolls quickly, browning all sides.  Cook on very high heat, making sure not to cook the tuna. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut each spring roll into 5 pieces.  Brush with olive oil.  Drizzle with the vinaigrette and serve immediately. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 20 pieces.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  eggs
  2               cups  small new potatoes - (abt 10)
  2               cups  cherry tomatoes
  2                     celery stalks -- trimmed, minced
  1              small  Granny Smith apple -- minced
  2        tablespoons  slivered toasted almonds
     1/4           cup  raisins
                        === DRESSING ===
  1              small  garlic clove -- grated
  1         tablespoon  grated peeled fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  honey
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
     2/3           cup  plain nonfat yogurt
  1         tablespoon  curry powder

To hard boil eggs, place them on the bottom of a deep saucepan.  Add enough water to cover.  Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat.  Cover the saucepan and remove from the heat.  Let the eggs sit for 15 minutes.  Drain and let cool water run over them to stop the cooking process. Peel. 
To boil potatoes, fill a medium saucepan with enough water to cover them.  bring to a boil over high heat.  Add the potatoes, cover the pan, and lower the heat to medium.  Boil until the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.  Drain and let cool. 
Make the dressing:  in a medium mixing bowl, stir together the garlic, ginger, cilantro, lemon juice, honey, mustard, yogurt and curry powder.  
Chop the hard-boiled eggs and place them in a salad bowl.  If the potatoes are larger than walnuts, cut them into halves or quarters before adding them to the bowl.  Similarly, if the cherry tomatoes are larger than walnuts, cut them into halves or quarters before adding them to the bowl, too.  Toss in the celery, apple, almonds and raisins. 
Pour the dressing over the salad and mix gently but thoroughly.  Cover and chill before serving, about 2 hours. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Cheese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  3                egg  yolks
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                cup  freshly-grated imported Swiss Gruyere
                        cheese -- (abt 1/4 lb)
  1                cup  freshly-grated imported Swiss Emmentaler
                        cheese -- (abt 1/4 lb)
  2                     eggs -- beaten together with
     1/3           cup  milk
  1                cup  dried bread crumbs
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying

In a heavy 3- to 4-quart saucepan melt the butter over moderate heat.  When the foam begins to subside, stir in 3/4 cup of the flour and mix well.  Add the milk in a stream whisking constantly.  Cook over high heat until the sauce comes to a boil and thickens.  Simmer for another 10 minutes on low heat, whisking often. 
Take the pan off the heat and beat in the egg yolks, one at a time, using a wooden spoon.  Season with the salt and pepper.  Add the grated cheese and mix well.  Pour into a greased baking dish (8- by 6-inches) and spread into a 1/2-inch thick layer.  Use a spatula to smooth the top.  Allow to cool to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 8 hours, or overnight, until firm. 
Using a pastry wheel or a sharp knife, cut the mixture into 2-inch squares and transfer them to a sheet of waxed paper.  Dip each square into the remaining flour and coat completely.  Shake off excess flour and dip into the egg wash, followed by the bread crumbs.  Pat the square gently with a spatula to help the crumbs adhere.  Repeat with all the squares and place them on a baking sheet.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, until the coating is firm. 
In a deep fryer or heavy saucepan, heat 2 to 3 inches of oil until it reaches 375 degrees.  Preheat the oven to its lowest temperature.  Line a baking dish with paper towels and set in the middle of the oven. 
Deep-fry the squares 3 or 4 at a time, turning them with a slotted spoon for about 5 minutes, until golden brown on both sides.  As they brown, transfer them to a baking dish in the oven to keep them warm while you deep-fry the rest.  Serve at once as a first course or an accompaniment to the drinks. 
This recipe yields 12 squares.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  heads and bones from black bass,
                        red snapper, or halibut
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
  1             medium  onion -- peeled, and
                        very thinly sliced
     1/4         small  fennel bulb -- very thinly sliced
  1                     leek -- very thinly sliced
  15                    white peppercorns
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1              sprig  fresh Italian parsley
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  dry white wine
  3               cups  water

Remove the gills and eyes from the fish, or have your fish store do it.  Cut the heads and bones across into 4-inch pieces.  Put them in a shallow pan and cover with cold water.  Let stand for 1 hour, changing the water twice.  Drain. 
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat.  Add the onion, fennel, leek, peppercorns, salt, parsley and bay leaf.  Turn the heat to medium-low and cook until the vegetables are softened but not browned, about 4 minutes.  Add the fish bones and cook, stirring from time to time, until the bones and any flesh around the bones turn from translucent to white, about 12 minutes.  Add the wine and water and bring to a boil.  Boil for 10 minutes, skimming off the foam as it rises to the top.  Remove from the heat and let rest for 10 minutes. 
Strain the fumet through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing firmly on the solids to extract as much of the flavorful liquid as possible.  If you have more than 3 cups of fumet, place the liquid in a clean saucepan and boil until reduced to 3 cups.  Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 2 months. 
This recipe yields 3 cups.

Remove the gills and eyes from the fish, or have your fish store do it.  Cut the heads and bones across into 4-inch pieces.  Put them in a shallow pan and cover with cold water.  Let stand for 1 hour, changing the water twice.  Drain. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat.  Add the onion, fennel, leek, peppercorns, salt, parsley and bay leaf.  Turn the heat to medium-low and cook until the vegetables are softened but not browned, about 4 minutes.  Add the fish bones and cook, stirring from time to time, until the bones and any flesh around the bones turn from translucent to white, about 12 minutes.  Add the wine and water and bring to a boil.  Boil for 10 minutes, skimming off the foam as it rises to the top.  Remove from the heat and let rest for 10 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain the fumet through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing firmly on the solids to extract as much of the flavorful liquid as possible.  If you have more than 3 cups of fumet, place the liquid in a clean saucepan and boil until reduced to 3 cups.  Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 2 months.

  2            bunches  young watercress -- thick stems discarded
  8             ounces  Panela cheese -- cut 8 even slices
                        Well-seasoned flour
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- until frothy
     2/3           cup  dry breadcrumbs, Panko preferred
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  tiny cherry-type tomatoes

Add lemon juice to pan and swirl over high heat to slightly thicken.  Season with salt and pepper and spoon over cress.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  6              large  Italian frying peppers -- stemmed, seeded,
                        but left whole
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- to taste
  1                     Italian bread loaf, 14" to 16" long

In a large, deep skillet set over moderate heat, heat the oil.  Add the peppers and salt and pepper to taste, and fry, turning frequently, until the peppers are browned and soft.  As the peppers soften, gently crush them into the oil with the back of a large spoon and continue to fry until they're very soft, 6 to 8 minutes. 
Transfer the peppers to a bowl and let them cool to room temperature.  Season with additional salt and pepper and, if desired, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. 
Split the loaf in half lengthwise leaving one side hinged, and remove some of the inner crumb.  Spoon the peppers with some of their liquid onto the Italian loaf and cut into 4 sandwiches. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  poblano peppers
  1              large  red bell pepper
  1             medium  red onion -- peeled, quartered
  1                     serrano chile - (to 2) -- stemmed, seeded
  4                     tomatillos -- husks removed,
                        and cut in half
  2             medium  ripe Roma tomatoes
  8             ounces  Bellwether Carmody -- sliced thinly
                        (or other flavorful melting cheese)
     1/4           cup  roughly chopped cilantro leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Black Bean Salsa -- see * Note
                        Avocado slices -- for garnish
                        Cilantro sprigs -- for garnish
                        Crisp tortilla chips -- for serving

* Note:  See the "Black Bean Salsa" recipe which is included in this collection. 
Char the peppers over a gas flame or under a broiler and then scrape off the blackened skin (do not wash).  Remove and discard the seeds and stems and cut into large dice and set aside. 
Grill or roast the onion, serrano chile and tomatillos until lightly colored and chop coarsely.  Remove core and seeds from tomatoes and cut into small dice. 
Arrange half the sliced cheese in the bottom of 4 individual earthenware dishes and scatter all of the vegetables over the top.  Sprinkle half the cilantro over this and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Place remaining cheese over all and top with remaining cilantro.  This can all be done up to a day ahead and refrigerated until ready to serve. 
To serve:  Place the filled dishes in a hot (425 degree) oven for 6 to 8 minutes or until cheese is nicely melted and just beginning to color.  Top with a tablespoon or two of the Black Bean Salsa and garnish with the avocado and cilantro sprigs.  Serve immediately with crisp tortilla chips if desired. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                        === FOR DRESSING ===
     2/3           cup  regular or low-fat mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil

  4                     bananas -- cut in half

                        Melted butter -- (optional)

Cut bananas in half so that both halves have all the skin on.  Cut the halves lengthwise (so the bananas are shaped like boats) and LEAVE THE SKIN ON.  Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.  (If using butter, brush bananas lightly before sprinkling with cinnamon sugar.) 
Place bananas cut-side down for 1 to 3 minutes or until bananas have grill marks.  Turn over and continue cooking until warmed through.  When the banana skin starts to pull away from the fruit, they're done. 
Eat right out of the skin while still warm or serve on top of vanilla ice cream.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     duck - (4 to 5 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  sea salt or kosher salt
  2                     crisp tart apples, such as Granny Smith -- unpeeled
  3                     yellow onions -- peeled

Cut apples and onions into quarters.  Remove seeds from apples and set aside.  Rinse duck with cold water and pat dry.  Discard giblets and organ meats.  Trim all loose fat from the inner cavity.  Stuff cavity with apples and onions.  Sprinkle duck liberally with salt and pierce skin in several places with a fork. 
Place the duck, breast-side up, in a roast holder (which is placed in a drip pan for gas grill) in the center of the cooking grate.  Cook 1 1/2 to 2 hours, piercing the underside of the duck every 30 minutes to remove excess fat.  When the duck juices run clear, and the internal temperature is 170 to 180 degrees, remove from grill and let rest for 15 minutes. 
Remove apples and onions from duck cavity and place on cooking grate to crisp.  Serve duck with the grilled apples and onions while still warm. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

  3                     eggplants
  1                     garlic head
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Kosher or sea salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  minced parsley
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Wash and dry eggplants.  Peel garlic and set aside.  If the cloves are very large, cut in half.  Make multiple 1/2-inch slits in the eggplant and stud with garlic.  Push towards the center of the eggplant so the garlic is not sticking out.  When done, coat eggplant with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. 
Place in the center of the cooking grate until the eggplants have collapsed and are soft.  You will need to turn occasionally.  This will take approximately 30 minutes, depending on the size of the eggplants. 
When very soft, cut in half and scrape flesh and garlic from skin.  Mash with a fork and mix in enough olive oil to make creamy.  Season with salt, pepper and parsley.  Serve with pita wedges or flatbread. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gerard Renny
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  all-purpose flour - (1 lb)
  1              pound  ricotta cheese
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten

Put 2 1/2 cups of the flour into a bowl, make a well in the flour, and add the cheese and eggs.  Gradually work the mixture together, adding more flour if necessary, to make a soft but not sticky dough.  On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough until it is smooth.  Let the dough rest at room temperature, covered with an inverted bowl or wrapped in plastic, for 30 minutes. 
Form the dough into a round and cut into quarters.  Working with one quarter at a time (cover the remaining dough with an inverted bowl to keep the dough from drying out), on a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a rope 1/4-inch in diameter.  With a knife, cut the rope into 1/2-inch pieces.  With your index and third fingers held together, gently press down on each piece, beginning at the top and moving down toward the bottom, dragging your fingers toward you and causing the pasta to roll over on itself.  Transfer the formed pasta to a lightly floured jelly-roll pan and let dry at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. 
Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil, and add the pasta.  Cook until the cavatelli are al dente, 6 to 8 minutes.  They're done when they float up to the top.  Drain and toss the desired quantity with your favorite sauce.  Freeze leftovers. 
This recipe yields 2 pounds of pasta.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     roasting hen - (abt 6 lbs)
  1                cup  salt
  2                     onions -- quartered
  3                     leaf ends of celery stalks
  10                    sage leaves
  10                    fresh thyme sprigs
  1              quart  cold water -- plus
     1/4           cup  cold water
  1              small  orange -- quartered
  1                     bay leaf
  3        tablespoons  dark corn syrup
  4        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  cold water

Remove the neck and giblet package from the chicken and pull off the flap of fat if there is one.  Rub hen inside and out with salt.  Place the chicken in a pot that is just large enough to hold it and tall enough to completely cover it with water.  Add ice water just to cover the chicken and stir briefly.  Place in the refrigerator for 3 hours.  Remove the bird and rinse for several minutes under cold running water to remove all salt inside and out. 
While the chicken is in the refrigerator, make a simple stock by simmering the neck, giblets (no liver), 1 onion quartered, 1 leaf end of celery, 2 sage leaves, 2 thyme sprigs, and 1 quart water in a large saucepan over low heat for 1 to 2 hours.  Strain and save the stock.  Pull the meat from neck and add to the stock.  Cut up the giblets and add to the stock. 
Preheat the oven 475 degrees. 
Arrange a V-rack for holding the bird over a pan to catch juices.  Pour 1 1/2 cups of the stock into the pan, reserve the rest.  Place the remaining onion, leaf ends of celery, sage leaves, and thyme sprigs, plus the orange and bay leaf, in the chicken cavity. 
In a small bowl, stir together corn syrup and butter.  Brush the chicken lightly with this mixture and place in a V-rack, breast-side down.  Roast 20 minutes, basting with drippings in pan every 7 minutes.  Remove the chicken from oven and turn so that one leg and thigh are up.  Baste with the butter mixture and return to the oven for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven again, turn completely over so that the other leg is up, baste well with the butter mixture, and return to the oven for another 10 minutes. 
Remove from the oven again and turn the oven down to 325 degrees.  Leave the oven door partially open so oven temperature will come down quickly.  Turn the bird breast-side up, brush well with butter mixture and return to the oven.  Baste every 5 minutes.  In 5 minutes, check breast meat temperature using an instant-read thermometer.  The ideal temperature to remove it is 150 degrees to 154 degrees.  If necessary, place back in oven an additional 5 to 10 minutes until it reaches this temperature.  Breast meat temperature rises about 2 degrees every minute in the oven at this temperature. 
Add as much of the pan drippings to the remaining stock as you can without getting the sauce too salty.  Stir cornstarch into 1/4 cup cold water and stir it into the stock-drippings mixture in a large saucepan.  Heat over medium meat, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens. 
Allow chicken to stand at least 15 minutes after removing from the oven.  Carve or partially carve the chicken and arrange back in bird form on the serving platter.  Pass hot gravy in a separate bowl. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  porterhouse steak, 2" thick - (to 3 1/2
                        lbs)
                        Metal or wooden skewer
     1/2                lemon
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  2                     scallions, white parts only -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Vegetable oil cooking spray

Trim the outer fat from the steak (or ask the butcher to do so).  Rub the fat with the cut lemon to prevent burning and smoking.  Score both sides of the tail of the steak and then fold it back towards the main body and attach it to the meat with a small metal skewer or sturdy wooden skewer.  (If using a wooden skewer, soak it in water for about 20 minutes first). 
Combine the olive oil, garlic, scallions, salt and pepper in a glass or ceramic dish.  Put the steak in the dish and turn several times to coat.  Cover and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or in the refrigerator for as long as 4 hours.  Turn the meat once or twice during marinating. 
Prepare a charcoal or gas grill.  Lightly spray the grill rack with vegetable oil cooking spray.  The coals should be moderately-hot to hot.  Lift the steak from the marinade.  Discard the marinade.  Grill the steak, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes.  Turn and grill, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes longer for medium-rare, or until it reaches the desired degree of doneness.  Let the meat rest for a few minutes before serving. 
This recipe yields 4 to 5 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CREPES ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  water
  3              large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  olive oil - (to 5 tbspns)
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  1              pound  ricotta
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/2         pound  mozzarella cheese -- diced
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese -- plus extra
                        for sprinkling
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  Basic Marinara Sauce - (to 4 cups) -- see * Note
                        (or use store-bought sauce)

* Note:  See the "Basic Marinara Sauce" recipe which is included in this collection. 
To make the crepes, in a blender, combine the flour, water, eggs, and salt and blend, scraping down the sides of the bowl, until the batter is smooth.  Transfer to a bowl. 
Heat a 6- to 7-inch skillet over moderately-high heat until hot.  Brush the skillet with about 1 teaspoon of the olive oil to coat well and heat the oil until hot.  Pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the center of the skillet and lift and tilt the pan to coat the bottom with a thin layer.  Cook until the batter is set and the underside is golden, about 1 minute more, and invert onto a plate.  Make additional crepes with the remaining batter in the same manner. 
Crepes may be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Freeze for up to 1 month.  Defrost in the refrigerator before using.)  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil a large shallow baking dish. 
To make the filling, in a bowl combine all of the ingredients, except for the Basic Marinara Sauce. 
To assemble, lay each crepe on a work surface, attractive-side down, spoon 3 tablespoons of the filling down the center, and fold in the edges to enclose the filling.  Fill the remaining crepes in the same manner.  Spoon 1 to 1 1/2 cups of sauce into the baking dish in an even layer.  Arrange the crepes, seam-side down, in the dish and spoon on enough of the remaining sauce to coat the crepes.  (The dish may be assembled several hours or 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.  Allow longer baking time if refrigerated.) 
Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crepes are heated through and their edges are slightly crisp.  Sprinkle with additional Parmesan to taste and put the crepes under the broiler, about 3 to 4 inches from the heat, for 2 minutes, or until the top is golden. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  3               cups  water

  6                     dried shiitake mushrooms
  6                     wafer-thin slices peeled fresh ginger

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Diana Shaw
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  honey
  1           teaspoon  grated garlic
  1         tablespoon  grated peeled fresh ginger
  1              pound  extra-firm tofu -- cut 1/4"-wide strips
  2               cups  short-grain brown rice
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  extra-fine sugar
  2                     scallions, white part only -- minced
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- toasted
  5                     nori sheets (available in
                        Asian-specialty sections)
  1                cup  finely-shredded carrots
  10                    fresh spinach leaves -- steamed, and
                        squeezed dry
  1 1/2           cups  alfalfa sprouts

In a deep, wide dish or pie plate, combine the soy sauce, honey, garlic and ginger.  Add the tofu and let it marinate for at least an hour, turning it over half way through. 
Cook the rice according to the package.  In a large glass or ceramic bowl, combine the rice vinegar and sugar.  Add the hot rice in fourths, stirring the mixture well after each addition.  Stir in the scallions and sesame seeds, mix well. 
For each roll, place a sheet of nori on a piece of wax paper so that the bottom edge of the nori lies along the bottom edge of the paper.  Moisten your hands with cold water and place a handful of rice in the center of the nori, spread it out in a thin layer to fill the sheet evenly.  Add more rice if necessary.  Place 2 strips of tofu across the center of the nori, so they run the entire width of the sheet.  Place a portion of the carrots on top of the tofu, some spinach over that, finishing with some sprouts (use about a fifth of each filling ingredient).  Start rolling the nori from the bottom by gripping the nori and the wax paper, and using the paper to help you make a tight roll. 
Let the nori rest, seam-side down, while you repeat the remaining procedure with the remaining rice and nori.  You should have 5 rolls.  To serve, wet the blade of a serrated knife and cut rolls into rounds about 1-inch thick.  Serve at room temperature. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                          Onion And Cheese Tart

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY SHELL ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/4" pieces
  2        tablespoons  lard or vegetable shortening -- chilled, and
                        cut into 1/4" pieces
  3        tablespoons  ice water - (to 5 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  butter -- softened
                        === FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onions
     1/8      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4         pound  imported Swiss Gruyere cheese -- coarsely grated
     1/4         pound  imported Swiss Emmentaler cheese -- coarsely grated
  2                     eggs
     1/2           cup  light cream
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg, preferably freshly grated

Make the pastry shell:  In a large chilled bowl combine the flour, salt, chilled butter, and the lard or vegetable shortening.  Blend together until the mixture resembles coarse meal. 
Pour 3 tablespoons of ice water over the mixture.  Toss together lightly and gather the dough into a ball.  Add more water until dough holds together.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 1 hour before using. 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 14-inch round, about 1/8-inch thick.  Place the dough in a 9-inch tart pan.  Gently press it into the bottom and around the sides of the pan, being careful not to stretch the dough.  Trim off the excess dough by rolling the pin over the rim of the pan. 
Line the inside of the tart shell with aluminum foil and fill with beans or pie weights.  Blind bake in the middle shelf of the oven for 10 minutes.  Remove foil, prick the dough all over with a fork and return to the oven for an additional 10 minutes, or until the shell begins to brown. 
Make the filling:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a heavy 6- to 8-inch skillet, heat the oil over moderate heat until haze forms above it.  Add the onions and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until they are soft and transparent but not brown.  Stir in the paprika and set aside off the heat. 
In a bowl toss together the Gruyere and Emmentaler cheese until thoroughly combined.  Spread half the cheese evenly in the baked pastry shell and scatter the onions over it.  Cover with the remaining cheese. 
Beat the eggs cream, milk, salt, and nutmeg together with a wire whisk and pour the mixture slowly and evenly over the cheese. 
Bake in the upper third of the oven for 10 minutes.  Increase the heat to 425 degrees and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the filling has puffed and browned and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Remove pan from the oven and remove the tart from the pan. 
Serve hot or at room temperature as a first or main course. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ORANGE-CLOVE SORBET ===
  8             ounces  water
  8             ounces  sugar
                        Zest of 3 oranges without the white part

  8             ounces  fresh orange juice
  1              ounce  Grand Marnier
     1/2         ounce  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  egg white -- beaten
                        === PINEAPPLE-GINGER SORBET ===
  8             ounces  water
  8             ounces  sugar
                        Zest of 1 lemon without the white part
  1              ounce  fresh ginger -- sliced
  8             ounces  fresh pineapple puree
     1/2         ounce  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  egg white -- beaten
                        === ORANGE SAUCE ===
  1               pint  fresh orange juice
                        Sugar -- to taste
                        Grand Marnier -- to taste
                        Corn starch -- as needed
                        Fresh lemon juice -- as needed
                        === CRISPY SLICES ===
  12                    orange slices -- thin sliced with
                        skin on, cut in half
  12                    pineapple slices -- thin sliced with
                        skin off, cut in half
  8             ounces  water
  16            ounces  sugar

To prepare the crispy slices, combine water and sugar in a saucepan and bring it to a boil.  After a couple of minutes of boiling turn it off and cool it.  When it is at room temperature, slice the fruit, dry it in paper towel, dip it in the sugar syrup and place it over a nonstick paper over a sheet tray.  Bake in a very mild 150 degree oven for a couple of hours until they will be dry and crisp.  Flip them upside down after about one hour. 
To prepare the orange sorbet, combine sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  After about two minutes of boiling, add the zest and the cloves, turn off the heat and place the syrup in a bowl to cool.  When it will be cold, add the orange juice, the lemon juice and the grand marnier.  Strain it and put it in the ice cream machine.  Work it until it will become smooth and add the egg white just before it will be ready. 
To prepare the pineapple sorbet, combine sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  After about two minutes of boiling, add the zest and the ginger, turn off the heat and place the syrup in a bowl to cool.  When it will be cold, strain it, then add the pineapple puree, the lemon juice.  Put it in the ice cream machine.  Work it until it will become smooth and add the egg white just before it will be ready.  
To prepare the orange sauce, warm the orange juice in a saucepan, add sugar to taste.  Dissolve some cornstarch with grand marnier and add a little bit of it to the orange juice while is close to a simmer.  Stir and watch the consistency.  Keep adding drops of the corn starch and grand marnier mixture until the desired consistency.  Adjust the flavor with sugar, grand marnier and lemon juice.  Place the sauce into a bowl to cool. 
To plate, place one ball of orange sorbet and one ball of pineapple sorbet in an iced martini cup.  Drizzle some sauce on top.  Garnish with the crispy slices. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  1              ounce  anchovy fillets preserved in olive oil -- drained
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- to taste

Place the stock in an 8-quart saucepan and bring it to a simmer.  Adjust the flavor and place the meat inside, making sure that it will be completely submerged by the liquid.  Place a lid on and cook gently without simmering (poaching is 190 degrees) until the meat reaches 110 degrees internal temperature.  At that point turn the heat off and let the meat cool inside its own liquid.  The carry over cooking should leave the meat medium and pink.  (If you prefer it well done cook it longer). 
Prepare the mayonnaise either by hand or in a food processor.  Stir the egg yolks with salt, some lemon juice and add the oil very carefully.  Adjust the flavor.  Puree the tuna, anchovies and capers in a blender adjusting the consistency with some white wine, until smooth.  In a bowl incorporate the tuna puree, the mayonnaise, the heavy cream, adjust the consistency and the flavor with more wine and vinegar as needed. 
Place some of the sauce on a 12-inch plate.  Slice the veal very thin and place it in the center of the plate on top of the sauce.  Garnish with the celery, leaves, capers, anchovies, black pepper and extra-virgin olive oil. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  eggplant
  1                     zucchini
                        Salt -- to taste
  1              large  garlic head
  2          teaspoons  olive oil or olive oil cooking spray
     1/8           cup  black olives -- pitted
  1              large  plum tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Herbes de Provence
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded, cored,
                        and cut in half
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- seeded, cored,
                        and cut in half
  4                     red-leaf lettuce leaves
  2             ounces  goat cheese
  2                     French rolls or baguette sliced in half
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Slice the eggplant and zucchini lengthwise into 1/2-inch thick strips and lightly sprinkle with salt.  Let stand in a colander for about 1/2 hour until vegetables perspire.  Rinse well and dry with a paper towel. 
Meanwhile, remove outer skin from head of garlic and cut tops of cloves off.  Brush garlic lightly with olive oil and place in the center of the cooking grate.  Cook 45 minutes or until garlic is soft and cooked through.  Remove from grill, remove garlic pulp and set aside.  Combine garlic with the olives, tomato, red pepper flakes, balsamic vinegar and Herbes de Provence in the bowl of a food processor.  Lightly pulse with 1 teaspoon of olive oil, until mixture has combined and formed a paste. 
Lightly brush or spray eggplant, zucchini and bell peppers with olive oil and place in center of the cooking grate.  Grill, for 4 to 6 minutes, turning once during cooking.  Vegetables should be cooked through, but not limp.  Just before serving, split rolls and place on cooking grate to toast. 
Assemble sandwiches by layering lettuce, grilled vegetables and goat cheese (if desired).  Spread garlic-olive paste on top bun and season vegetables with salt and pepper. 
This recipe yields 2 servings.

Meanwhile, remove outer skin from head of garlic and cut tops of cloves off.  Brush garlic lightly with olive oil and place in the center of the cooking grate.  Cook 45 minutes or until garlic is soft and cooked through.  Remove from grill, remove garlic pulp and set aside.  Combine garlic with the olives, tomato, red pepper flakes, balsamic vinegar and Herbes de Provence in the bowl of a food processor.  Lightly pulse with 1 teaspoon of olive oil, until mixture has combined and formed a paste.

Lightly brush or spray eggplant, zucchini and bell peppers with olive oil and place in center of the cooking grate.  Grill, for 4 to 6 minutes, turning once during cooking.  Vegetables should be cooked through, but not limp.  Just before serving, split rolls and place on cooking grate to toast.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  pork loin
  2                     green apples -- peeled, cored
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1                cup  apple juice
     1/4           cup  brown sugar
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1             medium  sweet potato
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1              ounce  bourbon
  2          teaspoons  oil -- for cooking
  2        tablespoons  salted butter

Season the pork with salt and pepper.  Mix the cornstarch and reserved compote liquid to make a slurry.  Lightly oil a saute pan and heat it very hot.  Sear the pork on both sides for 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and deglaze the pan with the slurry.  When thickened, whisk in the butter. 
To assemble, spoon warm compote in the middle of the plate.  Arrange sweet potato around and stack pork on top of compote.  Drizzle sauce onto the plate.

           Raclette - (Melted Cheese With Potatoes And Pickles)

Recipe By     :Recipe adapted from Foods of the World, Time Life Series
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  imported Swiss raclette cheese -- cut in 16 slices
                        approximately 1/8" thick, 5" long,
                        and 2" wide
  4                     freshly-boiled small new potatoes -- peeled, and
                        kept hot
  4              small  sour gherkins - (to 8), preferably
                        imported cornichons
  4                     pickled onions - (to 8)

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  Heat four 10-inch oven-proof dinner plates in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes.  To ensure the success of the raclettes, the plates must be very hot. 
When ready to serve, remove the plates from the oven.  Working as quickly as possible, arrange four slices of cheese in the center of each plate, overlapping them slightly.  The cheese should begin to sizzle once it comes into contact with the plate. 
At once, place the four plates on the floor of the oven.  Let cheese melt in the oven for about 2 minutes, being careful not to let it brown. 
Remove from the oven, place a potato and one or two gherkins and pickled onions on the side of each plate and serve at once.  Serve each plate on a service plate to prevent scorching the table. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

           Salt-Crusted Shrimp With Lemon-Oregano Dipping Sauce

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Shirley Corriher
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Shellfish                       Shrimp


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16                    extra-large shrimp in shell -- (abt 1 1/4 lbs)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     3/4           cup  medium-grind sea salt or kosher salt
                        === LEMON-OREGANO DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  best quality extra-virgin olive oil
                        Juice from 1 large lemon
     1/4           cup  boiling water
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley

Make the Dipping Sauce:  Whisk together the oil, lemon juice and hot water.  Stir in the garlic, oregano, and parsley.  Let stand for at least 20 to 30 minutes to marry the flavors.  Set aside. 
Using a small sharp knife, make a slit about 1/4-inch deep down the backs of the shrimp and devein them but do not remove the shells.  Place the shrimp in a large bowl and toss with the olive oil to coat lightly all over.  Sprinkle the salt evenly over the shrimp and toss well to make sure each shrimp is thoroughly coated in a crust of salt. 
Place the shrimp in the center of the cooking grate, 3 to 4 minutes per side or until the meat is opaque all the way through when cut into. 
Arrange 4 shrimp on each serving plate and accompany with a small ramekin of the dipping sauce.  The shrimp may also be served on a communal platter with a bowl of the sauce in the center.  Provide plenty of napkins and a small bowl for discarding the peeled shrimp shells. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Make the Dipping Sauce:  Whisk together the oil, lemon juice and hot water.  Stir in the garlic, oregano, and parsley.  Let stand for at least 20 to 30 minutes to marry the flavors.  Set aside. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using a small sharp knife, make a slit about 1/4-inch deep down the backs of the shrimp and devein them but do not remove the shells.  Place the shrimp in a large bowl and toss with the olive oil to coat lightly all over.  Sprinkle the salt evenly over the shrimp and toss well to make sure each shrimp is thoroughly coated in a crust of salt. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the shrimp in the center of the cooking grate, 3 to 4 minutes per side or until the meat is opaque all the way through when cut into. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange 4 shrimp on each serving plate and accompany with a small ramekin of the dipping sauce.  The shrimp may also be served on a communal platter with a bowl of the sauce in the center.  Provide plenty of napkins and a small bowl for discarding the peeled shrimp shells.

Sauteed Salmon And Bacon Tournedos With Brussel Sprouts, Mushrooms And Sauce

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Culinary Institute of America
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            slices  skinless salmon fillet -- cut 1 1/2"-wide strips
  12            slices  bacon, very thin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        === FOR THE GARNISH ===
  1 1/2          pints  brussels sprouts -- cleaned, leaves
                        seperated, washed
  1              ounce  shallots -- minced
                        Olive oil -- as needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4         pound  small Hedgehog mushrooms -- cleaned
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  2             quarts  beef or veal stock -- unseasoned or
                        very lightly seasoned
                        Shallot trimmings from above
                        Mushrooms trimmings from above
  1                cup  dry white wine (sauvignon)
  2             ounces  butter -- diced
  1              bunch  fresh thyme
  1              bunch  fresh tarragon
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a saucepan place the shallots and mushroom trimmings, the stems of thyme, parsley and tarragon, add the cup of wine and reduce gently until almost dry. 
In a 4-quart rondeau, reduce gently the 2 quarts of stock until lightly syrupy (about to 1 pint).  Combine the reduced stock to the reduction.  Let it sit for a few minutes to infuse the flavor, then strain. 
Check the salmon for bones.  To form a tournedos roll the piece of salmon in to a small medallion, wrap it in bacon and tie it.  You should make 2 small tournedos per portion.  Season the tournedos with salt and pepper.  Saute them in a hot sauteuse with very little olive oil starting with a high heat and lowering the heat during the cooking.  Cook for about 1 1/2 minutes per side.  Remove from the pan and hold warm in a plate.  Remove the butcher twine. 
In one sauteuse warm up some olive oil with the garlic cloves.  When the garlic starts frying, remove it and add the mushrooms.  Cook them at high heat for a few seconds.  Season and reserve them in a bowl.  In the same sauteuse gently sweat the minced shallots with olive oil until tender but not colored (use a little water if necessary) then add the sprouts, season and saute for a few seconds until cooked.  Reserve in a bowl. 
Finish the sauce by reducing it in a sauteuse for adjusting the consistency, adjusting the flavor with salt and pepper, and add butter and fresh herbs. 
Place the sprouts in the center of the plate.  Add the mushrooms on top of the sprouts and the salmon on top of the mushrooms.  Drizzle with the sauce and serve. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

      Scandinavian-Style Rare-Cooked Salmon With Fava Beans And Peas

                Salmon                          Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- thinly sliced,
                        plus additional for greasing casseroles
  4                     very fresh salmon fillets - (7 oz ea)
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  shelled small peas
  24                    shelled fava beans -- skinned
  12                    snow peas -- cut across
                        into thin strips
  4          teaspoons  julienned bacon
  4                     scallions (white part) -- quartered lengthwise
     1/2           cup  shredded iceberg lettuce
  2               cups  Fish Fumet -- see * Note
  4              small  fresh mint sprigs, plus 8 leaves -- chopped

* Note:  See the "Fish Fumet" recipe which is included in this collection. 
Butter 4 individual, shallow, flame-proof casseroles and set aside.  Trim and discard the thin belly section from the salmon fillets and season the fillets on both sides with salt and pepper.  Place the salmon in the center of the casseroles and surround the fillets, in this order, with the peas, fava beans, snow peas, bacon, scallions and lettuce.  Season the vegetables with salt and pepper.  Lay the butter slices over the vegetables.  (Recipe may be made ahead to this point several hours ahead; cover and chill.) 
Pour the Fish Fumet into the dishes and place each dish on top of a stove burner turned to high heat.  Bring the fumet to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 minutes, until a metal skewer inserted into the center of the salmon for 5 seconds feels barely warm when touched to your lip; the salmon will be rare. 
Sprinkle the chopped mint over the vegetables and lay the mint sprigs on the salmon.  Put the casseroles on serving plates and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  cream cheese -- softened at
                        room temperature
  1                cup  chopped fresh herbs (chives, dill
                        and scallions)
  1             medium  cucumber
     1/2         pound  smoked salmon -- sliced thinly
  1            package  flour tortillas

In a small bowl, mix cream cheese with chopped herbs and set aside.  Slice cucumber very thinly lengthwise using a mandolin or very sharp knife.  Spread 3/4 of a tortilla with a layer of the cream cheese mixture (this way the spread won't ooze out when you roll it). 
With the uncovered portion at the top, arrange a layer of cucumber slices vertically from the bottom edge of the tortilla and then a layer of salmon slices horizontally.  Roll tightly.  (Use a sushi mat if you own one.)  Chill, seam-side down, covered with a slightly damp paper towel and plastic wrap. 
When ready to serve, cut on the bias in 1 1/2-inch slices, discarding uneven ends, and arrange on a serving platter. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

In a small bowl, mix cream cheese with chopped herbs and set aside.  Slice cucumber very thinly lengthwise using a mandolin or very sharp knife.  Spread 3/4 of a tortilla with a layer of the cream cheese mixture (this way the spread won&apos;t ooze out when you roll it). 
</DirT>
<DirT>
With the uncovered portion at the top, arrange a layer of cucumber slices vertically from the bottom edge of the tortilla and then a layer of salmon slices horizontally.  Roll tightly.  (Use a sushi mat if you own one.)  Chill, seam-side down, covered with a slightly damp paper towel and plastic wrap. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve, cut on the bias in 1 1/2-inch slices, discarding uneven ends, and arrange on a serving platter.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  red bell pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  large red potatoes -- scrubbed, and
                        sliced 1/4-inch thick
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  3                     corn ears -- shucked
     1/4           cup  plain yogurt
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  1                     canned chipotle in adobo sauce -- seeded, and
                        minced to a paste, plus
     1/2      teaspoon  adobo sauce
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
                        Kosher salt -- to taste

Rub the pepper with a little of the oil and grill it on the rack about 5 to 6 inches from the heat source, turning frequently, until it is charred on all sides, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Transfer it to a bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap.  When cool enough to handle, peel the pepper and remove the seeds.  Chop the pepper and set aside.  Let the grill fire cool to medium heat. 
Toss the potatoes with 1 tablespoon of the oil and salt to taste and arrange in one layer on the rack.  Grill, turning frequently, until browned and tender, 15 to 25 minutes.  Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl and while still hot, toss with the vinegar. 
Rub the corn with the remaining oil, season with salt and grill, turning frequently, until the corn is lightly golden on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes.  Cut the corn off the cob and add to the bowl with the potatoes. 
In a small bowl whisk together the yogurt, mayonnaise, chipotle and adobo sauce and salt to taste.  Add the chipotle mayonnaise, red pepper and cilantro to the potato salad and toss gently.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  hot water -- (110 degrees)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast - (1/4 oz envelope)
  5               cups  all-purpose flour - (to 6 cups)
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2          teaspoons  canola oil
  2        tablespoons  baking soda
  1              large  egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water
                        Coarse or pretzel salt -- as needed
                        Vegetable-oil cooking spray

Pour 2 cups hot water into bowl of electric mixer with dough hook.  Check water with instant-read thermometer to register about 110 degrees.  Add sugar, stir to dissolve.  Sprinkle with yeast; let sit 5 minutes; yeast should bubble. 
Beat 1 cup flour into yeast on low until combined.  Beat in salt and 4 cups flour until combined, about 30 seconds.  Beat on medium-low until dough pulls away from sides of bowl, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Add 1/2 cup flour, and knead on low 1 minute more.  If dough is still wet and sticky, add 1/2 cup more flour (this will depend on weather conditions); knead until combined, about 30 seconds.  Transfer to a lightly floured board, and knead about 10 times until smooth. 
Pour oil into a large bowl; swirl to coat sides.  Transfer dough to bowl, turning dough to completely cover all sides.  Cover with a kitchen towel, and leave in a warm spot for 1 hour, or until dough has doubled in size. 
Heat oven to 450 degrees.  Lightly spray two baking sheets with cooking spray.  Set aside.  Punch down dough remove bubbles.  Transfer to a lightly floured board.  Knead once or twice, divide into sixteen pieces (about 2 1/2 ounces each), and wrap in plastic. 
Roll one piece of dough at a time into an 18-inch-long strip.  Twist pretzel shape; transfer to prepared baking sheet.  Cover with a kitchen towel.  Continue to form pretzels; eight will fit on each sheet.  Let dough rest until it rises slightly, about 15 minutes. 
Meanwhile, fill large shallow pot with 2 inches water.  Bring to a boil.  Add baking soda.  Reduce to simmer; transfer three to four pretzels to water.  Poach 1 minute.  Use slotted spoon to transfer pretzels to baking sheet.  Continue until all pretzels are poached. 
Beat egg with 1 tablespoon water.  Brush pretzels with egg wash.  Sprinkle with salt.  Bake 12 to 15 minutes, until golden brown.  Let cool on wire rack.  Pretzels are best when eaten the same day, and will keep at room temperature, uncovered, for two days.  Do not store in covered container. 
This recipe yields about 16 pretzels.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TUILES ===
  6        tablespoons  Parmesan cheese
                        === SALAD ===
  6             ounces  fresh porcini mushrooms - (abt 3 med)
  18            medium  asparagus spears -- blanched
  18                    spring (pearl) onions -- peeled, blanched
  12                    ramps or baby leeks -- blanched, (optional)
  2               cups  pea shoots - (loosely packed)
     3/4           cup  fava beans -- shelled, blanched,
                        and peeled
     3/4           cup  fresh peas -- shelled, blanched
                        === WHITE TRUFFLE-OIL VINAIGRETTE ===
  2 1/2    tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  roughly-chopped fresh chervil
  1         tablespoon  roughly-chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  roughly-chopped fresh chives
  1           teaspoon  roughly-chopped fresh tarragon
  1           teaspoon  mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-chopped garlic
  8                     grinds of a pepper mill
  9        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  white truffle-oil
                        (substitute extra-virgin olive oil
                        or a herb-flavored oil)

Tuile:  Place a 12-inch non-stick pan over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan on the bottom of the pan.  As it starts to melt, use a spatula to form it into three 2- by 5-inch strips.  When the cheese starts to bubble and turn golden brown, remove the pan from the heat.  Let cool for 4 to 5 minutes; the strips should be pliable.  Pick up one end of a strip with a pair of tongs and lay it across the bottom of an overturned bowl or across a wide cylinder so that the tuile hardens into an arc.  Set aside and repeat the process with the other strips.  Repeat the entire process with the remaining cheese.  (Yields 9 tuiles) 
White Truffle-Oil Vinaigrette:  Blend all the vinaigrette ingredients except their oils in a 2-quart stainless steel bowl.  Whisk in the olive and white truffle oils in a slow, steady stream until it is all incorporated and the sauce emulsifies. 
Salad:  Remove the mushroom caps from their stems.  Clean the tops with a damp cloth or towel.  Peel the stem using a vegetable peeler; discard the scraps.  Slice the mushrooms as thinly as possible, and place in a 2-quart stainless steel bowl.  Add the remaining vegetables.  Add the vinaigrette and toss well. 
To serve:  Divide the salad among 6 chilled plates.  Stand a Parmesan tuile over each salad.  Handle gently and serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2          pints  strawberries -- hulled, and
                        quartered lengthwise
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar -- or to taste
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- well chilled
  3        tablespoons  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  confectioners' sugar -- or to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
  4                     Cream Biscuits -- see * Note

* Note:  See the "Cream Biscuits" recipe which is included in this collection. 
In a large bowl combine 1 pint of the strawberries and the granulated sugar and with a potato masher mash the berries gently until they release their juices, being careful not to crush them to a pulp.  Add the remaining 1/2 pint of berries.  Let the mixture stand at room temperature, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. 
In a bowl beat the heavy cream with the sour cream and the confectioners' sugar until it holds a soft shape and beat in the vanilla.  Split the Cream Biscuits horizontally with a fork, arrange the bottom halves on 4 plates, and spoon the strawberry mixture over them.  Top the strawberry mixture with some of the whipped cream and arrange the biscuit tops on the cream.  Serve the remaining cream separately. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

     1/2        recipe  Basic Pizza Dough -- see * Note
                        Cornmeal -- for pizza paddle
     3/4           cup  shredded Mozzarella cheese
     3/4           cup  shredded Provolone cheese
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh herbs
                        (parsley, basil, chives, etc.)
                        === TOPPING SUGGESTIONS ===
                        (choose any variety of the following)
  5             ounces  sliced ham
  5             ounces  thinly-sliced pepperoni
  1                box  button mushrooms - (10 oz) -- sliced, roasted
  2              large  red peppers -- sliced, roasted
  1              large  onion -- sliced, roasted

* Note:  See the "Basic Pizza Dough" recipe which is included in this collection. 
Preheat oven (with pizza stone inside) to 450 degrees.  (If you do not have pizza stone, can use a baking sheet). 
Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface.  Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 10- by 14-inch rectangle.  Cover the rectangle with layers of your desired toppings, leaving a 1-inch border around the sides and at the top.  Mix the three cheeses and the herbs together in a small bowl and sprinkle on top of the toppings. 
Starting at the end closest to you, roll the stromboli into a log.  Seal the dough by pinching firmly with fingertips on sides and ends. 
Sprinkle a little cornmeal on a pizza paddle.  Put the stromboli on the paddle.  Make sure the seam is on the bottom.  Use a pastry brush to brush the top and sides of the stromboli with a little olive oil.  Carefully place the stromboli on preheated pizza stone.  Turn down oven temperature to 400 degrees and bake for 35 minutes.  Carefully remove from oven and let rest 5 to 10 minutes.  Slice with a serrated knife. 
This recipe yields 1 stromboli for 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BUTTERMILK BISCUIT CRUST ===
  3               cups  self-rising cake flour
  1 1/2         sticks  unsalted butter
  1 1/4           cups  buttermilk
                        === FILLING ===
  3             pounds  fresh apricots -- rinsed, halved,
                        pitted and sliced
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh sweet cherries -- rinsed, pitted
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
                        Buttermilk -- for finishing
                        Sugar -- for finishing

Butter a 2 1/2- to 3-quart gratin dish.  Set aside. 
For the dough, place flour in a bowl and rub in butter until fine and mealy.  Do not allow to become pasty.  Stir in 1 cup of the buttermilk, adding the remainder if necessary.  Press dough together on a floured surface, wrap and allow to rest while preparing filling. 
For filling combine apricots and cherries in a bowl and toss with sugar.  Pour into a large gratin dish or other shallow baking dish.  Dot with butter and sprinkle evenly with the almond extract. 
Press the dough out on a floured surface until roughly the size of the baking dish.  Lift dough onto filling and cut several vent holes in top.  Brush with buttermilk and sprinkle with sugar. 
Bake the cobbler at 450 degrees about 20 minutes, until crust is well colored and filling is bubbling.  Cool slightly on a rack and serve warm or at room temperature with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. 
This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SWEET PASTRY DOUGH ===
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
  3              large  eggs
                        === FILLING ===
  3             pounds  ripe apricots
     3/4           cup  sugar
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1              pinch  salt
  6              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  heavy whipping cream
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract

Butter a 10-inch round, 2-inch deep pan.  Set a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. 
For the dough, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to mix.  Cut butter into 12 pieces and add.  Pulse repeatedly until butter is mixed in finely.  Add eggs and continue to pulse until dough forms a ball.  Wrap and chill dough while preparing filling. 
Rinse, stem, halve and pit the apricots.  Combine the sugar, flour and salt in a mixing bowl and whisk to mix.  Whisk in the eggs, two at a time, then whisk in the cream and vanilla.  Cut off 2/3 of the dough.  Roll it on a floured surface and use it to line the prepared pan.  Trim dough even with top rim of pan.  Arrange the apricot halves, skin-side down, slightly over-lapping, and in concentric circles, in the dough-lined pan.  Pour the cream and egg mixture over the apricots. 
For the top crust, roll remaining dough to a 8- by 10-inch rectangle and cut into ten 3/4-inch by 10-inch strips.  Arrange 5 strips on the filling, then arrange another 5 strips diagonally to the first ones to form a lattice.  Trim ends of dough even with rim of pan. 
Bake the tart for about 1 hour, until the pastry is baked through and the filling is set.  Plunge the point of a thin knife into the center of the tart, it should emerge fairly clean.  Cool the tart on a rack and serve it at room temperature. 
This recipe yields one 10-inch tart, about 10 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  dry unseasoned bread crumbs
  1                cup  grated Parmesan cheese -- plus
  4        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh basil
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  water
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  8                     veal scallops
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  tomato sauce
  8             slices  mozzarella cheese

Position a rack in the center of the oven.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Combine the bread crumbs, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese, fresh herbs, salt and pepper in a pie plate.  Set aside.  In a shallow bowl, whisk the eggs and water.  Set aside.  On a plate, spread the all-purpose flour.  Coat the veal scallops with the flour and shake off the excess.  Dip in the egg mixture and then coat with the bread crumb mixture, patting with your fingers to make the crumbs adhere. 
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the veal and saute until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  Using tongs, turn the cutlets and cook, 2 to 3 minutes more, adding a little more oil if the pan looks dry.  Remove veal scallops to a plate and blot with paper towels. 
Lightly oil a baking pan or shallow baking dish.  Spoon into the pan 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce.  Arrange the veal scallops over the sauce, slightly overlapping them.  Sprinkle with 4 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese.  Cover with the remaining tomato sauce.  Top with the mozzarella slices and the remaining Parmesan cheese.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake until heated through, 20 to 30 minutes.  If you wish to brown the top, remove the foil and run the dish briefly under a broiler. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

                             Warm Skate Salad

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Eric Ripert, Le Bernardin Cookbook
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Salads/Dressings
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Court Bouillon -- see * Note
  1                     boneless skinless skate wing - (10 oz)
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  5               cups  mesclun (baby greens)
  5        tablespoons  Vinaigrette -- see * Note
  1         tablespoon  thinly-sliced coriander leaf
     1/2                ripe tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/4" dice

* Note:  See the "Court Bouillon" and "Vinaigrette" recipes which are included in this collection. 
Bring the Court Bouillon to a boil in a flameproof roasting pan.  Season the skate with salt and pepper.  Add the skate to the roasting pan and poach until a knife will go easily into the crease between the skate ribs, about 1 minute. 
In a bowl, toss the mesclun with 3 tablespoons of the Vinaigrette.  Arrange in a tall mound in the center of 2 dinner plates. 
As soon as the skate is cooked, separate it into thin strips, cutting through the natural creases in the fish.  Drape the strips over the salad in a circle, as if making a teepee. 
Drizzle the skate with the remaining 2 tablespoons of vinaigrette.  Scatter the coriander and the tomato over all.  Serve immediately. 
This recipe yields 2 servings.

Trim the spareribs, if necessary, and rub both sides of the ribs with the dry rub, working it into the meat.  Put the ribs in a shallow glass or ceramic dish, cover, and set aside at room temperature for no longer than 30 minutes, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours.  Alternatively, enclose the ribs in a sealable plastic bag and refrigerate. 
Prepare a charcoal or gas grill, arranging the coals for indirect cooking.  Lightly spray the grill rack with vegetable cooking spray.  The coals should be hot. 
Set the ribs, meat-side down, over the hottest part of the fire and sear for about 10 minutes until there are defined grill marks on the meat.  Transfer the ribs to the cooler part of the grill, cover, and turning the ribs every 15 to 20 minutes, cook for about 1 1/2 hours. 
If using a charcoal grill, add fresh coals to maintain the heat at medium; if using a gas grill, turn the heat to medium on the burner away from the meat -- turn off the burner under the meat.  Cut the ribs between the bones and serve with sauce on the side. 
This recipe yields 6 servings.
