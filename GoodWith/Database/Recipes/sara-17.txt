                   20 Clove Of Garlic Roasted Game Hens

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cornish Hens                    Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Cornish game hens - (1 1/2 lbs ea)
  6        tablespoons  softened butter
  8                     fresh sage leaves
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon zest
  40                    garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1                cup  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  arrowroot
  2        tablespoons  water

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 

In a pot of boiling water blanch garlic cloves for 30 seconds.  Remove to ice bath to stop cooking.  Remove skins. 

In a small bowl, combine softened butter, lemon zest, salt and pepper.  Loosen the skin of the hens by slipping your fingers between the meat and skin of the breast and legs.  Rub the butter mixture under the skin of each hen.  Place a fresh sage leaf under the skin on each breast half and at each leg. 

Place hens, head to toe, in roasting pan.  Place garlic cloves inside the cavities and surrounding each hen.  Roast hens for 25 to 30 minutes at 400 degrees, until juices run clear when thigh is pierced. 

Remove hens and garlic from roasting pan to platter.  Pour off fat and juices into defatting cup.  Place roasting pan over heat.  Pour in 1/2 cup white wine to deglaze.  Reduce until almost evaporated, scraping up the brown bits from the bottom of pan. 

When reduced, add 1 cup chicken stock and any juices that have settled in the defatting cup and from the platter.  Mix together 2 tablespoons arrowroot and 2 tablespoons water.  Add to sauce and bring to a boil to achieve full thickening power. 

Cut hens in half down breast bone and back bone.  Serve half a hen per guest.  Serve pan sauce on side. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                            Almond Toffee Bark

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 36    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Candies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  sliced almonds  - (10 oz)
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/3           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6             ounces  fine-quality bittersweet chocolate -- (not sweetened)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and oil a large baking sheet. 

In a large baking pan spread almonds evenly and toast in the middle of the oven, stirring nuts halfway through toasting until golden, about 10 minutes. 

In a 3-quart heavy saucepan bring butter, sugar, water, lemon juice, vanilla, and salt to a boil over moderate heat, stirring with a wooden spoon.  Boil mixture, without stirring, swirling pan occasionally, until deep golden, about 12 minutes. 

Remove pan from heat and stir in two-thirds of the almonds.  Immediately pour toffee onto baking sheet and with an offset spatula spread into a thin layer.  Carefully transfer baking sheet (it will be very hot) to a rack and cool toffee. 

Chop chocolate.  In a double boiler or small metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt chocolate, stirring until smooth.  Pour chocolate over cooled toffee and evenly spread with offset spatula.  Sprinkle toffee with remaining almonds.  Chill toffee, uncovered, until firm, about 1 hour. 

Break toffee into 2-inch pieces of "bark."  Bark keeps, layered between sheets of wax paper in an airtight container at cool room temperature or chilled, 1 week. 

This recipe yields 36 pieces.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and sliced into 1/4" slices
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  6        tablespoons  sugar -- divided
  1        tablespoons  Calvados or other brandy - (to 2 tbspns)
  4              large  egg yolks
  4              large  egg whites
  1              pinch  salt
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  gorgonzola cheese -- crumbled

In a large heavy skillet saute the apples in the butter over moderately-high heat, stirring ocasionally, for 5 minutes, or until they are softened.  Sprinkle them with sugar and cook them for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.  Stir in Calvados and keep warm. 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 

In a bowl whisk together 4 large egg yolks and 3 tablespoons sugar until thick and light.  In a separate bowl, whip 4 large egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff.  Fold the yolk mixture into the egg whites until just combined. 

Melt butter in a 10-inch oven proof skillet over medium heat.  Pour the egg mixture into the pan after the butter foam has subsided.  Spread evenly and smooth the top of souffle.  Cook for 1 minute and then shake pan slightly to prevent sticking. 

Cover pan with a greased lid, reduce heat and cook for about 4 minutes.  Remove the cover and place skillet in oven until the top is set, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from oven.  Place apple filling on half of souffle.  Sprinkle gorgonzola over apples.  Fold in half. 

This recipe yields 2 servings.

                        and sliced thin crosswise
     3/4         pound  ground chuck
     3/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2           cup  minced fresh parsley leaves

Prick the potatoes a few times with a fork and bake them on a rack in the middle of a preheated 450 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours. 

While the potatoes are baking, in a small bowl dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons of the yogurt and in a saucepan simmer the cornstarch mixture and the remaining yogurt, whisking, for 5 minutes.  Stir in the garlic paste, simmer the sauce, whisking, for 2 minutes, and keep it warm, covered. 

In a skillet cook the walnuts in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they are golden, and transfer them with a slotted spoon to a large bowl.  In the oil remaining in the skillet cook the onion, stirring occasionally, until it is golden, add the chuck, and brown the meat, breaking up the lumps. 

While the baked potatoes are still warm, halve them lengthwise, scoop out the flesh, leaving crisp shells, and chop coarse the flesh. 

In the large bowl combine well the walnuts, the chuck mixture, the chopped potato, the cinnamon, the parsley, and salt and pepper to taste, divide the mixture among the potato shells, and top it with some of the sauce.  Bake the potatoes on a baking sheet in the 450 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the filling is hot, and serve them with the remaining sauce. 

This recipe yields 6 entree servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ORANGE-ROSEMARY BUTTER ===
  2               cups  Tropicana orange juice
                        Zest and juice of 2 oranges -- zest finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped rosemary
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1              pound  butter
                        === WILTED GREENS ===
  1              large  portobello mushroom cap -- under-side cleaned,
                        the stem removed, and thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1              large  handful of mixed greens, spring mix
                        or mesclun
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  white wine
                        === BLACKENED SALMON ===
  4                     salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Cajun spice -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  canola oil

For the Orange-Rosemary Butter:  Reduce all the ingredients down to approximately 1/2 cup and chill the reduction.  When chilled, incorporate the reduction into 1 pound of butter, using a food processor.  Remove to a bowl and refrigerate until needed. 

For the Wilted Greens:  In a medium saute pan over high heat saute the mushrooms in butter until well browned.  Season with salt and pepper.  When the mushrooms are cooked, add the greens and deglaze the pan with white wine. 

For the Blackened Salmon:  Season the fillets with salt and pepper and Cajun spice.  Heat the canola oil in a cast-iron skillet until very hot, almost smoking.  Carefully add the salmon fillets and blacken them, approximately 3 minutes per side.  Turning only once per side. 

To assemble the dish:  Place the blackened salmon on top of the wilted greens and mushrooms, and top it with 1 teaspoon of the orange-rosemary butter.  Serve with your favorite wild rice blend and honey-glazed carrots.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  sifted all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  ground nutmeg
  2               cups  unsalted butter -- at room temperature
  3               cups  sugar
  6              large  eggs -- at room temperature
  1                cup  milk -- at room temperature
  2          teaspoons  lemon extract or vanilla

Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg and set aside. 

Cream butter until very light and fluffy, then add sugar gradually, creaming all the while.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition just enough to mix. 

Combine the milk and the flavoring (lemon, vanilla or lemon and vanilla).  Add the sifted dry ingredients to the creamed mixture alternately with the milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. 

Pour into a well-buttered-and-floured 10-inch tube pan, filling to within about 2 inches of the top.  Bake in a 300 degree oven for about 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until cake just begins to pull from the sides of the pan and a finger pressed gently on the top of the cake leaves a print that vanishes slowly. 

Cool cake upright in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then turn out on the rack and cool to room temperature before cutting.  Serve as is or garnish, if you like with a dusting of

                           Butterscotch Pudding

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gale Gand, Brasserie T, Northfield, IL
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Puddings


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  whole, 2% fat, or 1% fat milk
  1                cup  heavy cream
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/4           cups  light brown sugar - (packed)
  3                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract

In a large saucepan, combine the milk and cream and bring to a simmer over medium heat.  Immediately turn off the heat and set aside. 

In a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Stir in the brown sugar, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring constantly, to caramelize the mixture.  (You'll smell a characteristic nutty-caramel odor when the butter browns, signaling that the mixture is ready.)  Whisking constantly, gradually add the butter/brown sugar mixture to the hot milk/cream mixture.  If the mixture is not smooth, blend for 20 seconds with a hand blender or pour through a fine sieve. 

Put the egg yolks in a medium bowl.  Whisk in about 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture.  Whisk in the cornstarch and salt until dissolved.  Whisk the cornstarch mixture back into the hot mixture in the saucepan.  Whisking constantly, cook over medium-high until thick and just boiling.  When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top.  Turn off the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. 

Pour into 6 to 8 custard cups, ramekins, or mugs and chill, uncovered, at least 2 hours or overnight.  Serve chilled. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5              large  tangerines -- halved and juiced
                        (save juice to drink at breakfast time)
  2               cups  granulated sugar -- plus
  1                cup  granulated sugar -- for tossing

Place the tangerine halves in a large saucepan with enough cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until the tangerine rinds are tender, about 30 to 45 minutes.  (Begin checking the rinds for tenderness about 20 minutes into the process, you donít want them to become mushy.)  Youíll know theyíre done when you can scrape away the pith (the white part) easily. 

Drain the peels and when cool enough to handle, cut into 1/4-inch strips.  In the same sauce pan (now empty), combine 1 1/4 cups water with the sugar.  Bring to a boil, add the peels, reduce heat to medium, and cook until the peel is translucent, stirring occasionally. 

Spread the candied peel onto an oiled cooling rack over a cookie sheet and allow to cool and drain.  Spread the remaining sugar in a large shallow bowl, or on a cookie sheet.  Add the drained peel to the sugar and toss to coat with the sugar, separating the pieces as you do so. 

Spread the candied peel on a cookie sheet to dry overnight.  Store in an airtight container in the freezer or refrigerator.

                  Chocolate Mango-Raspberry CrËme BrulÈe

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Wayne Harley Brachman
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             ounces  semisweet chocolate
  3               cups  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  framboise
  8              large  egg yolks
  1               pint  raspberries
  1                     ripe mango -- cut 1/2" dice
                        Extra sugar for the caramel top

Preheat oven to 300 degrees. 

In a dry bowl, melt the chocolate over barely simmering water.  Remove from heat.  In a medium saucepan, combine the cream and 1 tablespoon of sugar.  Bring to a scald. 

Meanwhile, put the remaining sugar, framboise and egg yolks in a large bowl and whisk just to blend.  While gently whisking the yolks, drizzle the hot cream into them to gradually warm them up.  Whisk in the warm chocolate. 

Strain into a pitcher.  Divide the custard among 8 ramekins.  Add 1/3 of the berries and 1/3 of the mango cubes.  Dunk each piece of fruit so that it is completely coated with custard.  Skim any bubbles off the surface. 

Put the cups in a roasting pan and add enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the cups.  Tightly cover the pan with foil and bake 35 to 45 minutes.  They should still jiggle slightly but their surfaces should be set. 

Let cool to room temperature in the bath then remove the custards and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. 

To serve, sprinkle on some sugar and melt with tip of a propane torch flame.  While still hot, sprinkle on the rest of the raspberries and mango. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1                     vanilla bean -- split and scraped
  1         tablespoon  dark rum
  8              large  egg yolks
                        Extra sugar for the caramel top

Preheat oven to 300 degrees. 

In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, 1 tablespoon of sugar and the vanilla bean.  Bring to a scald. 

Meanwhile, put the remaining sugar, rum and egg yolks in a large bowl and whisk just to blend.  While gently whisking the yolks, drizzle the hot cream into them to gradually warm them up. 

Strain into a pitcher.  Divide the custard among 8 ramekins.  Skim any bubbles off the surface. 

Put the cups in a roasting pan and add enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the cups.  Tightly cover the pan with foil and bake for 35 to 45 minutes.  They should still jiggle slightly but their surfaces should be set. 

Let cool to room temperature in the bath, then remove the custards and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. 

To serve, sprinkle on some sugar and melt with the tip of a propane torch flame. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

<DirT>
Preheat oven to 300 degrees. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, 1 tablespoon of sugar and the vanilla bean.  Bring to a scald. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, put the remaining sugar, rum and egg yolks in a large bowl and whisk just to blend.  While gently whisking the yolks, drizzle the hot cream into them to gradually warm them up. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain into a pitcher.  Divide the custard among 8 ramekins.  Skim any bubbles off the surface. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the cups in a roasting pan and add enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the cups.  Tightly cover the pan with foil and bake for 35 to 45 minutes.  They should still jiggle slightly but their surfaces should be set. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
Let cool to room temperature in the bath, then remove the custards and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. 
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, sprinkle on some sugar and melt with the tip of a propane torch flame.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR FILLING ===
  12            ounces  dried apples (preferably Granny Smith)
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  4               cups  water
  2               cups  apple cider
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  4                     cinnamon sticks - (3" ea)
                        === FOR TOPPING ===
     3/4         stick  cold unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
                        === FOR PASTRY DOUGH ===
  1 1/4         sticks  cold unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  confectionersí sugar
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Whipped cream or ice cream

Make filling:  In a heavy 5-quart kettle simmer filling ingredients with a pinch salt, covered, until apples are fully plumped, about 15 minutes.  Uncover mixture and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick and any excess liquid is evaporated or absorbed, about 1 hour.  (Reduce heat as liquid is evaporated or absorbed and stir mixture frequently toward end of cooking to prevent scorching.)  Discard cinnamon sticks.  Filling may be made 2 days ahead and cooled before being chilled, covered. 

Make topping:  Cut butter into 1/2-inch pieces.  In a food processor pulse butter, flour, and granulated sugar until crumbly.  Transfer topping to a bowl and chill, covered, until ready to use. 

Make pastry dough when filling and topping are done:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Cut butter into 1/2-inch pieces.  In cleaned food processor pulse together pastry dough ingredients and a pinch of salt until mixture begins to gather together. 

Press dough evenly onto bottom and up side of an 11-inch tart pan with a removable fluted rim.  Line shell with foil and bake in middle of oven until shell is set, about 12 minutes.  Gently remove foil (if foil sticks to shell, leave foil on and bake about 2 minutes more) and bake shell until edge is golden, about 5 minutes (tart shell will not be completely cooked). 

Immediately spoon filling into shell and crumble topping evenly over filling.  Bake tart in middle of oven 30 minutes or until topping is golden.  Cool tart in pan on rack.  Tart may be made 1 day ahead and kept, covered and chilled, in pan.  Reheat tart, uncovered, if desired or bring to room temperature before serving.  Remove side of pan.  Serve tart with whipped cream or ice cream.

  2                     Belgian endives - (abt 10 oz) -- washed
  1         small head  radicchio - (abt 5 oz) -- washed
  2                     carrots - (abt 6 oz) -- peeled, and

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  asparagus, preferably large stalks with
                        tight heads for garnish
  2 1/2           cups  water
  3                     yellow peppers - (abt 1 1/3 lbs) -- halved, stemmed,
                        seeded, and cut into 1" pieces
  1              large  potato - (abt 9 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  1              large  onion - (abt 9 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Peel the lower third of the asparagus stalks, and discard the trimmings.  Cut the asparagus on the bias into slices about 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick.  (You should have about 1 1/2 cups.)  Bring 1/2 cup of the water to a boil in a saucepan, and add the asparagus pieces.  Bring the water back to a boil, and boil the asparagus for 30 seconds.  Drain, reserving the cooking juices, and set the cooked asparagus pieces aside in a bowl. 

Place the yellow peppers, potato, onion, garlic, salt, sugar, and pepper in a large saucepan, and add the remaining 2 cups of water.  Bring to a boil, add the reserved asparagus cooking juices, cover, and reduce the heat to medium.  Cook the mixture for 30 minutes, then push it through a food mill fitted with a fine screen to remove the skin of the yellow peppers. 

Add the butter and oil, and emulsify the mixture with a handheld immersion blender until it is smooth and creamy in appearance.  Add the reserved asparagus, heat through, and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                     Idaho baking potato -- peeled

  2                     garlic cloves

  4                     eggs
  1         tablespoon  butter

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 4- to 6-inch nonstick skillet.  In a food processor with grating attachment, grate potato.  Transfer potato to skillet.  Pat into thin pancake.  Cook until golden on one side, 4 to 5 minutes.  Turn pancake over and cook until golden on other side, 4 to 5 minutes more.

Beat 4 eggs until just combined.  Do not beat too much air into eggs or the texture will be dry.  Add 1 tablespoon butter to spinach pan.  After foam has subsided, pour in the eggs.  While stirring the eggs with a fork, shake the pan back and forth. 

Once the bottom of the omelet has set, slide in potato pancake.  Add spinach and crumbled feta cheese on top of potato.  Run omelet under broiler until cheese starts to melt.  Remove from broiler and fold into half moon shape.  Sprinkle sauted garlic slices over top of omelet.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  14            medium  red potatoes - (abt 4 lbs)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  dried dill
  2          teaspoons  dried thyme
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly course-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat grill or grill pan. 

Working in batches, cut potatoes into 1/8-inch thick rounds and in a large bowl toss with oil, dill, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste.  Grill potato rounds in batches over moderate heat, turning them occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes, and transfer them to another large bowl. 

Alternatively, roast potatoes in a 450 degree oven:  Arrange half of oiled potatoes, lightly overlapping, in 2 large shallow baking pans and roast in upper and lower thirds of oven, turning them occasionally, until golden and tender, about 15 minutes.  Roast remaining potatoes in the same manner. 

This recipe yields 6 servings, plus leftovers.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  canned plum tomatoes in thick puree -- crushed up
     3/4           cup  chopped fresh basil
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped garlic
  2 1/4           cups  grated Romano cheese
  2 1/4           cups  grated fontina cheese
  3         tablespoon  chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        Scopa's Mashed Potatoes, if desired -- (see recipe)
                        === PIZZA DOUGH ===
  11            ounces  lukewarm water
  1           teaspoon  fresh yeast
  1         tablespoon  molasses
  2 1/2       teaspoon  kosher salt
  2 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  whole wheat flour

For the Pizza Dough:  Mix the water, yeast, and molasses in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Let this stand for 12 minutes to activate the yeast (the water will foam slightly.)  Add the salt and oil to the bowl and mix well.  With mixer on low speed add the all-purpose flour and the whole wheat flour to the bowl and mix until all the flour is absorbed and the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. 

Remove the dough from the bowl and cut the dough into 6 (5 1/2-ounce) portions.  Roll the portioned dough into balls and place on an oiled baking pan.  Brush the ball lightly with olive oil and cover with plastic wrap. 

If you are going to use the dough right away let the dough sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before using.  You can store the dough after portioning for 1 day in the refrigerator, but you must let sit at room temperature for 1 hour before using. 

In a bowl, combine the tomatoes in puree, basil, 1/4 cup of the olive oil and the garlic.  Stir well and set aside at room temperature for up to 1 hour. 

In a bowl, mix together the Romano and fontina cheeses.  Spread about 3/4 cup of the romano-fontina mixture over each pizza crust and then dollop each with 8 to 10 tablespoons of the tomato sauce.  Do not spread the sauce over the crust.  Drizzle each pizza with about a tablespoon of the remaining olive oil and sprinkle each with parsley.  At this point if you desire, spread the mashed potatoes thinly over the dough.  Slide the crust back to the edge of the hot section of the grill.  Rotate them 3 to 4 minutes, until the bottoms are evenly golden brown.  Cut pizzas and serve. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  sifted all-purpose flour -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sifted all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2                     vanilla beans -- split
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
  1              large  egg
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed) -- plus
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar - (packes)
     3/4           cup  toasted almonds (or pecans) -- coarsely chopped
  2             ounces  white chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  2             ounces  dark chocolate -- coarsely chopped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 6- to 8-inch square baking pan. 

Sift the flour with the baking soda and salt onto a sheet of waxed paper.  Scrape the vanilla beans and reserve the pods and scrapings. 

Place the vanilla and the butter in a small saucepan and heat until melted.  Beat the egg with the brown sugar at medium-high speed until it resembles very loose meringue, about 3 minutes, then add melted butter. 

Reduce the speed, then add the flour and mix until not quite incorporated.  Add the nuts and chopped chocolate; fold until well blended.  Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. 

Bake until the top is dry and golden and a toothpick inserted in the center emerges nearly dry, about 30 minutes.

         Hummus With Toasted Pine Nuts, Cumin Seeds, Parsley Oil

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  fresh flat-leafed parsley sprigs - (packed -- plus
  2                     or 3 additional sprigs
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  pine nuts
  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds
  2               cans  chickpeas - (19 oz ea)
  4                     garlic cloves
     2/3           cup  well-stirred tahini -- see * Note
     2/3           cup  water
  5        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Toasted pita chips -- for accompaniment

* Note:  Middle Eastern sesame paste available at natural foods stores and some supermarkets 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 

In a blender or small food processor puree 1/4 cup parsley with 1/4 cup oil.  Pour mixture through a fine sieve set over a bowl, pressing hard on solids, and discard solids.  

In a small baking pan toast pine nuts and cumin seeds, stirring occasionally, until nuts are golden, about 10 minutes. 

In a colander rinse and drain chickpeas and in a food processor puree 1/2 cup with garlic until garlic is finely minced.

     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley leaves

Transfer the meat to a cutting board, brush it with some of the green peppercorn butter, and let it stand for 15 minutes.  Cut the London broil into thin slices across the grain at a 45-degree angle and dot the slices with more of the butter. 

This recipe yields 6 servings, plus leftovers.

     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
     1/2           cup  hot water -- (abt 115 degrees)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  egg whites
  1           teaspoon  vanilla

Oil bottom and sides of a 13- by 9- by 2-inch rectangular metal baking pan and dust bottom and sides with some confectioners' sugar. 

In bowl of standing electric mixer or in a large bowl sprinkle gelatin over cold water and let stand to soften. 

In a 3-quart heavy saucepan cook granulated sugar, corn syrup, hot water, and salt over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until sugar is dissolved.  Increase heat to moderate and boil mixture, without stirring, until a candy or digital thermometer registers 240 degrees, about 12 minutes.  Remove pan from heat and pour sugar mixture over gelatin mixture, stirring until gelatin is dissolved. 

With standing or a hand-held electric mixer beat mixture on high speed until white, thick and nearly tripled in volume, about 6 minutes if using standing mixer or about 10 minutes if using hand-held mixer.  In a large bowl with cleaned beaters beat whites (or reconstituted powdered whites) until they just hold stiff peaks.  Beat whites and vanilla into sugar mixture until just combined.  Pour mixture into baking pan and sift 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar evenly over top.  Chill marshmallow, uncovered, until firm, at least three hours, and up to 1 day. 

Run a thin knife around edges of pan and invert pan onto large cutting board.  Lifting up 1 corner of inverted pan, with fingers loosen marshmallow and let drop onto cutting board.  With a large knife trim edges of marshmallow and cut marshmallows into roughly 1-inch cubes.  Sift remaining confectioners' sugar into a large bowl and add marshmallows in batches, tossing to evenly coat.  Marshmallow keep in an airtight container at cool room temperature 1 week. 

This recipe yields 96 marshmallows.

Categories    : Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  milk -- at room temperature
  1                cup  water -- (about 125 degrees)
  2        tablespoons  dry yeast or 1 1/2 oz fresh yeast
  2 2/3           cups  sifted tipo 00 flour or cake flour
     1/3           cup  sifted all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  fine salt
                        Olive oil -- for oiling bowl

In a small bowl or coffee cup mix together the milk and water.  Sprinkle in the dry yeast, or crumble the fresh yeast in your hand and mix it into the liquid.  Stir once, and let sit in a warm place until there is considerable foam on the top, about 10 to 20 minutes.  (If your mixture doesn't foam up at least a little, the yeast wasn't fresh.  Buy more and start over.) 

In a large bowl combine the sifted flours with the salt.  Mix well.  Spill the foaming yeast mixture into the bowl and, working with a wooden spoon, mix together rapidly.  Smooth out as many yeast clumps as possible during this stage.  Your dough at this point will be very wet. 

Dust a work surface with flour.  Add a little flour, about 1/4 cup, to the dough in the mixing bowl.  This should enable you to scrape the dough together and place it on the floured surface.  Add more flour if necessary.  Begin kneading the dough on the work surface with your hands and adding tipo 00 flour or cake flour, 1/4 cup at first, less and less as you proceed.  While you are kneading, at first the dough will probably stick to the work surface and your hands.  Don't worry.  Keep kneading and adding more flour.  But don't lose patience and add too much.  Add slowly.  The goal is to create dough that is just past sticky; in fact, when it is finished, it should be threatening to stick to the work surface.  You may even want to work with a spatula to remove the dough from the surface if it sticks slightly.  All together, kneading time should be about 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth, silky, and just past stickiness.  Do not end up with very dry, very stable dough. 

Lightly oil the bottom of a large bowl with the olive oil.  Form the dough into a ball.  Place the dough in the bowl, and cover tightly with plastic wrap.  Place the bowl in a spot that's room temperature, neither warm nor cool.  In 2 hours or so, the dough should double in size. 

Cut the dough into 4 quarters.  Place 1 quarter on a floured surface, pulling it gently into a round as you place it on the surface.  Your goal is a round pizza that is 6 to 7 inches in diameter, approximately 1/4-inch thick, except at the rim where it should be about 3/8-inch thick.  Use one of the following means to achieve this:
 * Pull it from the outer edges until the desired shape is reached.
 * Working it with your fingertips, push toward the rim, until the center is 1/4-inch thick and the rim is 3/8-inch thick.
 * Do it pizzeria style by placing the dough on your 2 fists, and revolving it on your fists until it has widened to the desired shape (be careful not to tear the dough at the center).
 * Use these techniques in combination. 

Do not roll your dough out.  Don't worry if your pizza isn't perfectly round; there's much to be said for rusticity.  If your pizza doesn't have much of a rim, use your fingertips to crimp the dough and build a small one around the circumference; this is called the cornicione.  If your pizza dough has a tear in it, transplant a small piece of dough, smoothing it in.  Run a wide spatula under the pizza to make sure you'll be able to move it easily off the surface later; add extra flour underneath if it's sticking. 

Repeat this process until all 4 pizzas are shaped.  Place towels loosely over the pizzas as soon as they're shaped.  Let each pizza rest for at least 10 minutes and up to 60 minutes before cooking.  The pizzas should puff very slightly. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    New Zealand baby single-rib lamb chops -- wholly frenched
                        to the eye - (abt 2 lbs)
  1                     garlic clove -- halved crosswise
     1/2      teaspoon  crumbled dried thyme
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  white-wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  minced fresh mint leaves -- plus
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh mint leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a small saucepan combine the vinegar and the sugar and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved.  Stir in the mint and let the sauce cool.  Season the sauce with salt and pepper and transfer it to a small bowl. 

Pat the chops dry, rub them with the cut sides of the garlic, and sprinkle both sides of the chops with the thyme and the white pepper.  Grill the chops in a well-oiled ridged grill pan over moderately-high heat for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chops, on each side for rare meat.  (Alternately, the chops may be broiled under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for about 2 minutes on each side for rare meat.)  Serve the chops with the dipping sauce. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  1                cup  vegetable oil
                        === GREEN CHILE CHUTNEY ===
  2               cups  chopped fresh cilantro - (packed)
     1/2           cup  chopped scallion
     1/4           cup  sweetened flaked coconut

Categories    : Pasta                           Rice/Grains


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  water
     3/4           cup  lentils
  2              large  garlic cloves -- crushed
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                cup  chopped canned plum tomatoes -- with some juice
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2         pound  vermicelli or capellini,
                        or small tubular pasta, or pasta mista
  2        tablespoons  finely-cut or snipped parsley - (rounded)
                        === OPTIONAL GARNISH ===
                        Extra-virgin olive oil
                        Hot red pepper flakes or hot pepper oil

In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a rolling boil, add the lentils, and cook, covered over a medium-high heat, until nearly but not entirely tender, about 20 minutes. 

Add the garlic, olive oil, tomatoes, salt and pepper.  Reduce the heat, cover and continue to simmer briskly for another 10 minutes, stirring a few times, or until the lentil are fully tender. 

If using capellini, break it into 2- to 4-inch pieces and add them to the lentils.  Cook, covered, at a steady simmer, stirring several times and scraping the bottom of the pot when you do.  Cook until the pasta is just done, stirring more frequently as it gets closer to that point. 

If using a small tubular pasta or pasta mista, cook the pasta at least halfway in plenty of salted boiling water.  Drain the pasta, add it to the lentils, and simmer to finish cooking the pasta. 

When either pasta is cooked to taste, remove the pot from the heat, stir in the parsley, cover the pot, and let stand about 5 minutes before serving.  Serve hot, passing hot pepper oil and the best quality extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling on top. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Jacques Pepin
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  penne pasta - (2 1/4 cups)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2           cups  milk
  4 1/2         ounces  cheddar cheese -- cut 1/2" dice
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              large  tomato - (abt 8 oz) -- halved, seeded,
                        and the flesh cut into 1/2" dice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika

Bring 2 1/2 quarts of water to a boil in a pot.  Add the penne, bring the water back to a boil, and boil the pasta over medium heat, uncovered, for about 8 minutes.  (The pasta should be al dente, firm to the bite.)  Drain the penne in a colander and rinse it under cold tap water until cool, and set aside. 

Heat the butter and oil in a saucepan, and add the flour.  Cook the mixture over medium heat for about 10 seconds, then add the milk, stir it in quickly with a whisk so the mixture doesn't scorch.  Bring the mixture to a boil, and boil it for 10 seconds.  Add the cheddar cheese, salt and pepper, mix well, then cook over low heat for 3 to 4 minutes.  Set aside. 

When ready to finish the gratin, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 

Mix the pasta with the cheddar sauce, and transfer the mixture to a 6-cup gratin dish.  Sprinkle the tomato on top of the pasta and sauce.  Combine the Parmesan and paprika in a small bowl, and sprinkle the mixture on the pasta.  Bake in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes, until the gratin is bubbly and nicely browned on top.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  If making the gratin at the last moment, and assembling it while the sauce and pasta are both hot, do not bake the gratin.  Instead, place it under a hot broiler until golden brown on top.

Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PHYLLO TARTS ===
  4             sheets  phyllo - (to 6)
  3        tablespoons  melted butter - ( to 4 tbspns)
     1/4           cup  sugar
                        === SABAYON ===
  6                     egg yolks
  1                cup  Muscat wine or any other sweet wine
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2               cups  heavy cream
                        Assorted berries (blackberries,
                        blueberries, raspberries, etc.)
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 

To make the tarts you can use muffin tins to form the individual tarts or you can use small tart rings.  To begin you should have your sugar and melted butter with a pastry brush ready.  If not using immediately keep the phyllo dough covered with a damp towel as it has a tendency to dry out very quickly. 

Brush each sheet with enough butter to lightly coat.  Sprinkle with sugar and fold the dough in half and then cut the rectangle in half creating 2 squares.  Place each square in muffin tins and the dough may bunch up on top that is okay it will appear ruffled when baked.  Repeat this method as many times as you need for each serving.  Bake phyllo for 10 minutes or until golden brown and set. 

For the Sabayon:  Whisk together the egg yolks, sweet wine, and sugar in a large bowl.  (Remember this is going to need room to grow 3 times its volume).  Place this bowl on top of a pot of simmering water and begin to whip constantly.  It will probably take 10 minutes or so, so you may want to have a relief whisker available.  Once the sabayon is light and airy yet you can see the tracks made by the whip take off the double boiler and place bowl inside of a larger bowl that has water and ice in it to cool the cream down.  Once cooled you can whip 2 cups of heavy cream until medium to stiff peaks.  Fold into the sabayon. 

To assemble the tarts, place the baked phyllo cups on plates and spoon in sabayon cream, then pile high with any berries you like.  Dust with powdered sugar and enjoy. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  11            ounces  lukewarm water
  1           teaspoon  fresh yeast
  1         tablespoon  molasses
  2 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
  2 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  whole wheat flour

Mix the water, yeast, and molasses in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Let this stand for 12 minutes to activate the yeast (the water will foam slightly.)  Add the salt and oil to the bowl and mix well.  With mixer on low speed add the all-purpose flour and the whole wheat flour to the bowl and mix until all the flour is absorbed and the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. 

Remove the dough from the bowl and cut the dough into 6 (5 1/2-ounce) portions.  Roll the portioned dough into balls and place on an oiled baking pan.  Brush the ball lightly with olive oil and cover with plastic wrap. 

If you are going to use the dough right away let the dough sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before using.  You can store the dough after portioning for 1 day in the refrigerator, but you must let sit at room temperature for 1 hour before using.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  broccoli rabe
  2             pounds  hot or mild sausage
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
     1/2     teaspoons  crushed red flakes
  2 1/4           cups  grated Romano cheese
  2 1/4           cups  grated fontina cheese
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        === PIZZA DOUGH ===
  11            ounces  lukewarm water
  1           teaspoon  fresh yeast
  1         tablespoon  molasses
  2 1/2       teaspoon  kosher salt
  2 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  whole wheat flour

For the Pizza Dough:  Mix the water, yeast, and molasses in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Let this stand for 12 minutes to activate the yeast (the water will foam slightly.)  Add the salt and oil to the bowl and mix well.  With mixer on low speed add the all-purpose flour and the whole wheat flour to the bowl and mix until all the flour is absorbed and the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. 

Remove the dough from the bowl and cut the dough into 6 (5 1/2-ounce) portions.  Roll the portioned dough into balls and place on an oiled baking pan.  Brush the ball lightly with olive oil and cover with plastic wrap. 

If you are going to use the dough right away let the dough sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before using.  You can store the dough after portioning for 1 day in the refrigerator, but you must let sit at room temperature for 1 hour before using. 

In a large pot of boiling water, blanch the broccoli rabe over high heat for about 4 minutes.  Using tongs or a slotted spoon lift from the water and set aside to cool.  When cool, chop coarsely. 

Bring the water back to a boil and cook the sausage for about 15 minutes, until cooked through.  Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the sausage from the water and immediately plunge in cold water to stop the cooking.  When cool, remove the meat from the casing and crumble.  (You should have 6 cups of sausage.) 

In a large saute pan, over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil and cook the garlic for about 30 seconds, until browned.  Add the broccoli rabe and red pepper flakes to the pan and season to taste with salt.  Cook for 6 to 7 minutes, until very tender. 

In a bowl, mix together the Romano and fontina cheeses.  Spread about 3/4 cup of the Romano-fontina mixture over each pizza crust, top each with equal amounts of broccoli rabe and sausage and then slide them back to the edge of the hot section of the grill.  Rotate them every 3 to 4 minutes until the bottoms are evenly golden brown.  Cut the pizzas and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pork rack, with 7 to 8 rib bones -- (2 to 2 1/2 lbs)
                        === FOR THE MASHED YAMS ===
  2              large  red yams
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/4      teaspoon  salt -- or to taste
                        === FOR THE BASTING SAUCE ===
     1/2         pound  pitted prunes
  1                cup  red wine
  1                cup  water
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne
                        === FOR THE SWEET ONIONS ===
  2              large  red onions -- halved crosswise,
                        and sliced
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  grenadine syrup (or boysenberry syrup)
  1                cup  red wine
     1/4           cup  white sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR THE SPINACH ===
  1              pound  fresh spinach -- stems removed,
                        and washed
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Place the yams on a cookie sheet or in a roasting pan, and bake until soft, approximately 40 minutes.  Spoon the hot yams out from inside their skins, and fork mash them in a bowl with the butter.  Cover and keep warm. 

Meanwhile, place the prunes, water, red wine vinegar, salt and cayenne in a 4-quart non-reactive saucepot.  Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer.  Cook the basting sauce for 30 minutes, and allow to cool. 

When completely cool, place in the blender, and puree.  If the mixture is too thick to puree properly, add more water as needed.  Reserve 1/3 of the basting sauce and set aside.  Completely cover the entire pork rack with the remaining 2/3 of the basting sauce.  Refrigerate until ready to cook. 

Heat a 12-inch skillet, preferably non-stick, over medium heat.  Add the butter and the onions, and saute stirring occasionally for 5 minutes.  Add the grenadine syrup, the red wine, sugar and salt, and lower the heat to a simmer.  Allow the liquid to completely reduce over the onions.  When cooked, the onions should look silky, and be a deep rose color.  Keep warm. 

Liberally season the pork rack all over with salt and pepper, and place in a roasting pan in the middle of the oven.  Roast the rack 30 minutes for medium, 40 minutes for well done.  When cooked, remove the rack from the oven and allow to rest for the 5 minutes before serving. 

Meanwhile, heat a 12-inch skillet on high heat.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and allow the butter to brown slightly.  Immediately add half the washed spinach and allow it to wilt, stirring with tongs or a spoon.  Add the rest of the spinach, and when it has wilted, season to taste with salt and pepper. 

To serve, cut 2 or 3 ribs off the rack of pork and place in the top of the plate.  Next to the rack place the mashed yams and spinach and garnish with sweet onions.

             Roasted Figs With Scented Sabayon And Pistachios

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  superfine sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/8      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2           cup  Riesling, Gerwurtztraminer, or a
                        slightly sweet dessert wine
     1/2           cup  lavender scented honey
  18                    fresh figs -- well washed, dried
     1/4           cup  chopped toasted pistachios

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 

Whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, 1/8 teaspoon cardamom, and the coriander in the top half of a double boiler.  When the mixture is very thick and pale yellow, whisking constantly, slowly beat in the wine. 

Place the top half of the double boiler over gently simmering water.  Using a rubber spatula, clean the egg yolk mixture from the sides of the pan.  Cook, whisking constantly, until the sabayon is very thick and light and will mound slightly when lifted with a spoon.  This should take about 7 minutes.  Remove the top half of the double boiler from the simmering water and place it in a bowl of lukewarm water to keep warm while you prepare the figs.  (Note:  You can prepare the sabayon some hours ahead of time and let it cool to room temperature.  Before serving, warm it slightly by sitting the pan in lukewarm water as above.) 

Place the honey and remaining cardamon in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the honey has just warmed.  Remove from the heat and, using a pastry brush, lightly coat each fig with the seasoned honey.  Place the figs, at least 1/2-inch apart, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Place in the preheated oven and roast for 5 minutes or until the figs are beginning to take on color and are nicely glazed. 

To serve, spoon a pool of sabayon onto the center of each of six luncheon plates.  Using the back of a spoon, gently spread the sauce out onto each plate to cover the bottom.  Place 3 figs into the center of the plate and sprinkle some of the toasted pistachios over the top.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2                     garlic cloves -- unpeeled and crushed
  4        tablespoons  olive oil

Prepare marinade by combining all ingredients to taste.  Let stand for an hour.  With a very sharp knife, cut ham across lengthwise exposing the bone.  Cut around the bone and remove.  By doing small cuts, spread ham flat.  Trim into a rectangular shape.  Discard any excessive fat.  Season the meat with marinade and set for at least 2 hours. 

Place rice stuffing in the middle of ham and fold both ways until stuffing is fully covered.  Tie with string both lengthwise and across.  Place in a roasting pan and cook for 20 minutes per pound or until inside cavity reaches 150 degrees. 

Moros Y Cristianos:  Soak beans in water overnight.  Drain rinse.  Bring beans, 5 cups water, bay leaf, and 1/2 piece of Italian pepper to a full boil.  Simmer until beans are soft.  Strain and remove the pepper.  Reserve the water (if necessary, add water to make 4 cups). 

Saute in olive oil the onion, pepper, garlic and oregano until transulent.  Add the rice, beans and water and bring to a boil.  Season with salt.  Reduce heat and cook covered until rice is soft. 

Saute crushed garlic cloves in the 4 tablespoons of olive oil until brown.  Remove the cloves and add to the rice.  Season with vinegar and let stand.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Venison


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  rack of venison - (to 4 lbs)
  2             pounds  shallots -- trimmed and peeled
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- plus additional
                        for rubbing the venison
     1/2           cup  beef broth
     1/2           cup  red wine
     1/2           cup  water
  1         tablespoon  juniper berries -- crushed lightly
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/3           cup  dried cranberries
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Note:  One (3 to 4 pound) rack 8 to 11 ribs of venison, halved to form two 4 to 6 rib racks, any tough membranes trimmed, and tied into a crown roast. 

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  In a roasting pan large enough to hold the venison racks without crowding them, toss the shallots with 2 tablespoons of the oil and salt and pepper to taste and roast them in the middle of the oven, stirring occasionally, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they are golden. 

Pat the venison dry, season it with salt and pepper, and rub it generously with the additional oil.  Push the shallots to the sides of the roasting pan, stand the venison crown in the middle of the pan.  Mound stuffing in center and roast in the middle of the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a meat thermometer registers 125 degrees, for rare meat.  Transfer the racks with shallots to a platter and let them stand, covered loosely with foil, for 15 minutes. 

To the roasting pan add the broth, the wine, the water and the juniper berries and simmer the mixture, scraping up the brown bits, for 5 minutes.  Strain the mixture through a fine sieve set over a small saucepan, whisk the cornstarch mixture, and add it to the saucepan with the cranberries, the vinegar and salt and pepper to taste.  Simmer the gravy, whisking for 5 minutes. 

Cut the venison into individual chops and serve it with the shallots and the gravy. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  root beer - (1 1/2 quarts)
  1              quart  vanilla ice cream
  4                     elbow straws

The day before you plan to serve, pour 4 cups of the root beer into ice cube trays to a depth of no more than 1/2-inch (keep the remaining root beer refrigerated until ready to serve).  Freeze overnight, along with tall, thin glasses or parfait glasses for serving. 

When ready to serve, unmold the cubes into a food processor fitted with the metal blade.  Process, pulsing, just until crushed. 

Place a straw in each glass, leaning along the side.  Layer the parfaits by alternating scoopfuls of the root beer granita and vanilla ice cream, ending with a scoop of ice cream on the top. 

Serve with a pitcher of the remaining root beer, and pour root beer up to the top of each parfait at the table. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

The day before you plan to serve, pour 4 cups of the root beer into ice cube trays to a depth of no more than 1/2-inch (keep the remaining root beer refrigerated until ready to serve).  Freeze overnight, along with tall, thin glasses or parfait glasses for serving.

When ready to serve, unmold the cubes into a food processor fitted with the metal blade.  Process, pulsing, just until crushed.

Place a straw in each glass, leaning along the side.  Layer the parfaits by alternating scoopfuls of the root beer granita and vanilla ice cream, ending with a scoop of ice cream on the top.

Serve with a pitcher of the remaining root beer, and pour root beer up to the top of each parfait at the table.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR CAULIFLOWER RISOTTO ===
  5               cups  chicken stock or low sodium canned broth
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/3           cup  minced peeled onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled and minced
  1 1/2           cups  aborio rice
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  cauliflower florets -- rinsed under cold
                        water and dried
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        White truffle oil -- to taste
                        Veal demi-glace -- as needed
                        === FOR THE BASS ===
  4                     skin-on striped bass fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter, softened

Place the chicken stock in a pot and bring to a steady simmer. 

In a heavy, 4-quart pot, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the olive oil, onion and garlic, and saute, stirring, for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft.  Do not brown.  Add the rice and stir to coat well.  Continue to cook, stirring for 1 minute, to heat the rice through.  Add the white wine and increase the heat to bring the liquid to a boil.  Add the cauliflower, salt, and pepper to season, reduce heat to medium, and stir to combine well. 

Make additions of 1/2 cup of hot chicken stock at a time, stirring each addition continuously until the chicken stock is fully absorbed.  Continue making the additions until all the chicken stock is used, total cooking time approximately 15 minutes. 

Taste to make sure rice is al dente.  Stir in Parmesan cheese, reduce heat to low and cover.  Serve immediately. 

For the Bass:  Place a saute pan over very high heat.  Season the fillet with salt and pepper; brush each fillet generously with butter (room temperature) onto the skin side only.  Place the fillet into the hot pan, butter-side down, and brown for 2 minutes over high heat.  Pop the pan into the oven for 3 to 5 minutes.  Flip fillet and serve with risotto. 

To serve:  Mound risotto in the center of a warm plate and surround with a little demi-glace.  Drizzle with truffle oil.  Place bass onto the risotto mound and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3             pounds  chicken - (to 3 1/2 lbs) -- cut 8 pieces
                        (2 wings, 2 legs, 2 thighs, and each
                        breast cut in half crosswise)
  1             medium  onion -- peeled, halved,
                        and thinly sliced
  1              large  red pepper -- sliced 1/2" strips
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1          big pinch  hot red pepper flakes
  2               cups  well-drained coarsely-chopped canned
                        plum tomatoes
     1/3           cup  torn basil leaves

In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan with cover, heat the oil over medium-high heat, and when it is hot, brown the chicken on the skin side first, then the underside.  Do not crowd the pan.  Brown the chicken in batches if necessary, setting aside the browned chicken on a plate until the rest is done. 

When the first few pieces of chicken are almost browned and still in the pan, add the onion red pepper, saute until tender. 

Arrange all the browned chicken in the pan, skin-side up, and add the white wine.  Season with salt and hot pepper flakes, then let the wine cook until it has almost entirely evaporated, just a couple of minutes.  While it is reducing, turn the chicken in the liquid once or twice, but leave it skin-side up at the end. 

Add the tomatoes.  Cover the pan, lower the heat, and let cook at a gentle simmer, without turning, for about 30 minutes, or until the chicken is done. 

Remove the chicken to a serving platter, add the basil to the pan and increase the heat to high, letting the sauce reduce for about 2 minutes.  In the end, the sauce will be creamy pink. 

Pour the sauce over the chicken or use it to dress pasta (reserving some for the chicken) and serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  6             ounces  pasta - (to 8 oz) -- see * Note
  4                     eggs -- lightly beaten
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or

  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  diced salami
  5             ounces  sliced mozzarella

* Note:  Linguini, spaghetti, or other pasta, cooked and sauced or not sauced, leftover or freshly cooked, at room temperature. 

In a large mixing bowl, combine the pasta, the beaten eggs, the black pepper, and the grated cheese.  Mix well. 

In a 8- to 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium heat and swirl it around to make it coat the bottom of the pan. 

Add half the pasta and spread it evenly in the pan.  Place the sliced cheese and salami on top, but don't put any cheese within 1/2 inch of the edge.  Add the remaining pasta and spread it to make sure it covers the bottom pasta layer and the sliced cheese.  Cook over medium heat for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the bottom browns. 

Place a plate on top of the pan and reverse the frittata so it falls on the plate.  Slip the frittata back into the skillet and cook the other side for another 5 to 8 minutes, until it browns.  Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     tender steaks of your choice -- each 1 portion
                        (or 4 to 6 cube steaks weighing a
                        total of 1 1/2 to 2 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
     3/4      teaspoon  dried oregano or marjoram
  2               cups  Smooth Tomato Sauce -- (recipe follows)
                        === SMOOTH TOMATO SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
                        (or 1 large garlic clove, lightly smashed)
  1                can  plum tomatoes - (28 oz) -- drained of can juice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Hot red pepper flakes or
                        freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Few leaves of fresh basil or parsley

Sprinkle both sides of the steak with salt. 

In a large skillet, preheated over high heat, pan-broil the steaks, until the large ones are almost done to taste, or the small ones are well browned.  If using large steaks, you probably will not be able to fit them all in the pan at once.  Do a couple at a time, then remove them and set them aside while cooking the rest.  The small steaks should fit comfortably in the pan side by side, but if they crowd the pan, do not brown them all at once.  When all the steaks have been cooked, pour off any fat in the skillet. 

Add the 2 cups of tomato sauce and dried oregano to the pan, scraping up any brown film or bits in the pan.  Return the cubed steaks to the pan if you are using them and they were set aside.  Bring to a simmer over high heat.  If using cubed steaks, cover the pan and adjust the heat so the tomatoes simmer gently for about 40 minutes, or until the meat is tender. 

Place each steak on dinner plate and top with sauce.  If the sauce on the cubed steaks is not thick enough, uncover pan at the end of the cooking time and reduce. 

For the Smooth Tomato Sauce:  In a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan, combine the oil and onion and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onion is fully tender and golden, 8 to 10 minutes.  Or, over medium-low heat, combine the oil and the garlic.  Cook the garlic, pressing it into the oil a couple of times to release its flavor, until it barely begins to color on both sides.  Remove the garlic. 

With a food mill, puree the tomatoes directly into the pot and stir well.  Add salt and either hot pepper flakes or black pepper to taste.  Increase the heat slightly and bring to a brisk simmer.  Adjusting the heat as the sauce cooks down, and stirring frequently, simmer briskly for about 12 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and reduced. 

Season with herbs according to the recipe you are preparing.  For the most basic sauce, add a few torn basil leaves or a tablespoon of finely cut parsley while the sauce is simmering.  Then add a little more at the end of cooking. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                jar  caper berries on the stem - (abt 8 oz) -- drained
                        === BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE ===
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  minced shallot
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

For the Balsamic Vinaigrette:  In a medium bowl whisk together the vinegar, mustard, shallot, hot pepper sauce and salt.  Continue to whisk while adding the oil in a slow stream; the dressing will thicken.  Add freshly ground pepper to taste, and adjust the seasoning.  Use within an hour or so of completion.  (Yields 1 1/4 cups) 

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the haricots verts and 2 teaspoons salt.  Cook until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes after the water returns to a boil.  Drain the haricots verts, immediately transfer them to a bowl of iced water and let stand just until cool.  Drain well. 

Mound the mesclun in the center of a large platter.  Spoon the artichokes, potatoes, onions, and tomatoes around, not on, the mesclun.  Add the hard cooked egg wedges and haricots verts to the platter and drizzle them with a tablespoon or two of vinaigrette.  Arrange the steak slices over the mesclun and drizzle with 3 tablespoons of vinaigrette.  Scatter the olives and arrange the caper berries decoratively over and around the various components and serve immediately.  Pass the remaining vinaigrette at the table. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     baking potatoes - (abt 8 oz ea)
                        Unsalted butter
     1/4         pound  mushrooms -- sliced thin
     1/4           cup  medium-dry Sherry
     1/2      teaspoon  dried tarragon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2         pound  baked ham -- chopped
     3/4           cup  half-and-half
  2              large  egg yolks
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan

Rub six 8-ounce baking potatoes, well scrubbed, with softened, unsalted butter, sprinkle them with salt, and bake them in a preheated hot oven (400 degrees) for 1 hour, or until they test done when pierced with a skewer. 

In a skillet saute 1/4 pound mushrooms, sliced thin, in 1 tablespoon unsalted butter over moderately-high heat for 2 minutes, add 1/4 cup medium-dry Sherry, 1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon, salt and pepper to taste, and cook the mixture, until almost all the liquid is evaporated.  Add 1/2 pound baked ham, chopped, and cook the mixture, tossing it, for 2 minutes. 

Cut a 1/2-inch slice from the top of each potato, scoop out the pulp, and reserve the shells.  Puree the pulp through a food mill or ricer into a large bowl (should be about 3 cups).  Combine the puree with 3/4 cup scalded half-and-half, 3 tablespoons softened unsalted butter, 2 large egg yolks, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, and cayenne, salt and pepper to taste.  Fold in 1 cup grated Gruyere and ham mixture and combine the mixture well. 

Heap mixture into the reserved potato shells, sprinkle the shells with a mixture of 1/4 cup each of fresh bread crumbs and freshly grated Parmesan.  Dot them with butter.  Arrange the potatoes in a lightly buttered baking dish and bake them in the upper third of a preheated moderately-hot oven (350 degrees) for 15 minutes or until they are puffed and lightly browned. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  minced onion
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2               cans  crushed tomatoes in puree - (28 oz ea)
  1                cup  water
  1                can  tomato sauce  - (15 oz)
  2                     carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 2" lengths
  1                     boiling potato -- peeled, left whole

Sauce:  In a casserole set over moderate heat, cook the onion and garlic in the oil, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until transulent. 

In a blender or food processor, puree the tomatoes, water, and tomato sauce until smooth and add it to the casserole.  Add the carrots, potato, basil, cayenne and salt.  Bring the liquid to a boil and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. 

Rinse the squid and turn the body sacs inside out.  Mince the tentacles. 

In a skillet set over moderate heat, cook the onion and garlic in the oil, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes more.  Transfer to a bowl.  Add the sea legs, eggs, bread crumbs, grated cheese, and salt and pepper.  Combine the mixture well.  Stuff the squid with the bread-crumb mixture and close with a toothpick.  Add the squid to the sauce and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until just tender.  Transfer the squid to a serving dish. 

Meanwhile, cook the linguini according to package directions, drain, and transfer it to a large bowl.  Add enough sauce to coat the pasta and toss to combine.  Sprinkle with cheese.  Serve the squid separately with a mixed green salad. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                           Sweet-Hot-Beet Soup

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Michael Romano, Union Square Cafe, NYC
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  beets - (to 4), unpeeled, and
                        roots trimmed
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil or clarified butter
  3             medium  onions -- peeled and sliced
  3                     jalapeÒos -- seeded and diced
  3        tablespoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  cumin seeds -- freshly ground
  2        tablespoons  coriander seeds -- freshly ground
  1           teaspoon  turmeric
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground dried Thai chilies
                        (or ground red pepper flakes)
     1/4           cup  basmati rice -- rinsed and drained
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3             quarts  vegetable or chicken broth
     3/4           cup  coconut milk
  1         tablespoon  honey -- (optional)
     3/4      teaspoon  garam masala
  10       tablespoons  yogurt or sour cream
     1/2           cup  fresh cilantro leaves -- picked and washed

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 

Wrap the beets individually with aluminum foil and roast them in the oven until easily pierced by the tip of a paring knife, about 60 to 70 minutes.  When the beets are cool enough to handle, trim the ends, and gently rub off their skins with a paper towel.  Cut into 1/4-inch slices, place them in a food processor and pulse, scraping down the sides often, until they are finely chopped, but not completely pureed.  Set aside. 

Place the vegetable oil or clarified butter in a 6-quart soup pot over medium heat and add the onions.  Cook, stirring often, until the onions are wilted and translucent, but not browned, about 15 minutes.  Add the jalapeÒos and ginger and continue to cook 5 more minutes.  Follow with the ground cumin, coriander, turmeric and chilies and continue stirring until the spices are well cooked, about 8 to 10 minutes. 

Stir in the basmati rice until well coated with the oil, season with the salt and pepper, and add the vegetable stock to the pot.  Bring the stock to a boil and immediately reduce the heat until the soup just simmers.  Allow the soup to cook, covered, until the rice is very tender, about 20 minutes. 

Using either a blender or an immersion blender process the soup until you have a rich puree.  Whisk in the coconut milk and the chopped beets, and return the soup to the fire.  Bring the soup slowly back to a boil and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper as required. 

Finish the soup with the honey, if desired, and the garam masala, and serve in warmed bowls with a dollop of yogurt or sour cream and a few sprigs of fresh cilantro. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

For the Roasted Shallot and Pancetta Vinaigrette:  In a skillet over medium-high heat saute pancetta until golden brown or until the fat is rendered.  Remove pancetta from pan and set aside. 

Saute shallots and garlic until golden brown.  Add sherry and reduce by 3/4 at a low simmer, then add vegetable stock and reduce by 3/4.  Salt and pepper to taste, add olive oil and reserved pancetta.  Reserve. 

For the Trout:  Preheat a medium nonstick saute pan on medium-high heat, with 1 ounce olive oil.  Place trout skin-side down for 1 minute or until skin starts to turn golden brown, flip trout over and place in a 350 degree oven for four minutes. 

In a large saute pan heat all the vegetables with a little olive oil, then add parsley, thyme, and salt and pepper, to taste. 

To assemble, place vegetables on a oval plate if you have one or a round one.  Then lay the trout over the vegetables, heat shallot sauce and pour over fish. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.
