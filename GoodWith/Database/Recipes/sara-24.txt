  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  2              large  hard-cooked eggs
  1                cup  finely-chopped scallion greens -- (abt 1 lg bunch)
                        === EGG SHEETS ===
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  cold water
  4              large  eggs -- beaten lightly
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Vegetable oil -- for brushing skillet
  2             ounces  beluga or sevruga caviar
                        = (available at some specialty
                        foods shops)

Make Filling:  In a bowl beat cream cheese until fluffy.  Quarter eggs and with back of a spoon force through a coarse sieve into cream cheese.  Add scallion and stir well.  Filling may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.  Bring filling to room temperature before proceeding.

To make Egg Sheets:  In a bowl dissolve cornstarch in water and whisk in eggs and salt until smooth.  Brush a non-stick skillet measuring 6 inches across bottom lightly with oil and heat over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking.

Half-fill a 1/4-cup measure with egg mixture.  Remove skillet from heat and pour in 1/8 cup egg mixture, swirling skillet to coat evenly.  Return skillet to heat and cook egg sheet until set, 10 to 15 seconds.  Loosen edges of egg sheet with a heatproof rubber spatula and turn sheet over.  Cook egg sheet until set, 5 to 10 seconds more, and slide onto a plate.

Make more egg sheets with remaining mixture in same manner, brushing skillet lightly with oil each time.  Egg sheets may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, wrapped in plastic wrap.  (Makes 8 or 9 egg sheets)

On a work surface arrange 2 egg sheets, side by side and overlapping by 1-inch.  Put a dab of filling between sheets where they overlap (to act as glue) and press sheets together gently.  Spread 1/2 cup filling on overlapping egg sheets, leaving about a 1/2-inch border on each long side.  Fold in border of long side nearest you and tightly roll up sheets jelly-roll fashion into 1 (11-inch-long) roll.

Wrap egg sheet roll in plastic wrap and chill 1 hour, or until firm.  Make 3 more egg sheet rolls with remaining egg sheets and filling in same manner.  Egg sheet rolls may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, wrapped well.

Discard plastic wrap and trim ends of egg sheet rolls.  Cut rolls crosswise into 3/4-inch pieces.  Arrange pieces, cut-ends up, on a platter and top each with about 1/4 teaspoon caviar.

This recipe yields about 40 hors d'oeuvres.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN NEGIMAKI ===
  8              small  boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (abt 2 1/2 lbs total
  2            bunches  scallions
  1                     garlic clove
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  seasoned rice vinegar
  2          teaspoons  Asian sesame oil
                        === RED PEPPER DIPPING SAUCE ===
  1                     red bell pepper
     3/4           cup  distilled white vinegar
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  dried hot red pepper flakes
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/3           cup  black or white sesame seeds --see * Note
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  65                    wooden skewers - (6" long)

* Note:  Black sesame seeds are available at Asian markets and some specialty foods shops and supermarkets.

To make Negimaki:  Remove "tenders" from chicken, if necessary.  Pound breast halves 1/2-inch thick between 2 sheets of plastic wrap.

On a work surface arrange 1 breast half, smooth-side down, with a long side facing you and put 1 scallion (or 2 if very thin) lengthwise on chicken.  Roll chicken around scallion and tie with kitchen string at 1-inch intervals.  Trim scallion flush with chicken.  Make 7 more rolls in same manner.

Mince garlic and in a shallow baking dish just large enough to hold rolls in 1 layer stir together garlic, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil.  Add rolls, turning them to coat.  Marinate negimaki, covered and chilled, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.

To make Red Pepper Dipping Sauce:  Coarsely chop bell pepper and in a blender purÈe with white vinegar.  Transfer mixture to a small saucepan and stir in sugar, red pepper flakes, and salt, to taste.  Simmer sauce 5 minutes and cool.  Sauce may be made 1 week ahead and chilled in an airtight container.

Spread sesame seeds on a sheet of waxed paper.  Remove negimaki from marinade, letting excess drip off, and roll in sesame seeds to coat.  In a large skillet heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook negimaki in 2 batches, turning them occasionally, until cooked through, about 10 minutes, adding remaining tablespoon vegetable oil to skillet as necessary.

Transfer negimaki as cooked to a cutting board and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices, discarding string.

Push skewers through sesame seed-coated edge of slices.  Serve negimaki warm or at room temperature with dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 65 hors d'oeuvres.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             slices  bacon -- chopped fine
  1                cup  chopped onion
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  finely-diced red bell pepper
  1                cup  finely-diced green bell pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
  2          teaspoons  wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  24                    cherrystone clams -- shucked, and the
                        bottom shells reserved
                        Coarse salt -- for filling the
                        pan and platter

In a heavy skillet cook the bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until it begins to brown but is not crisp, transfer it with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, and discard the fat from the skillet.

In the skillet, wiped clean, cook the onion and the garlic in the oil over moderately-low heat until they are softened, add the bell peppers and the oregano, and cook the mixture, stirring, until the bell peppers are crisp-tender.

Transfer the mixture to a small bowl and stir in the bacon, the vinegar, the Parmesan, and salt and black pepper to taste.  The bell pepper mixture may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.

Arrange the clams in the reserved shells in a jelly-roll pan filled with some of the coarse salt (to balance the shells), divide the bell pepper mixture among them, and bake the clams in a preheated 400 degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are just cooked through.   Arrange the clams on a platter filled with more of the coarse salt.

This recipe yields 24 baked clams, 4 to 6 servings.

Raw Preparation:  Place slab of ribs bone-side down on table.  Slide knife under the membrane and against the end bone to separate the two.  With a dry paper towel, grasp the edge of the thin membrane and pull.  The entire membrane should separate from the rib.

Preheat oven to 250 degrees.  Combine First Stage rub and mix well.  Generously apply rub onto the front and back sides of ribs.  Gently pat to ensure that rub will adhere.  Place ribs meat-side up on a broiler pan and bake for 2 1/4 hours.

Remove ribs from oven.  Place each rib meat-side down on its own doubled aluminum foil square.  Foil should be large enough to completely wrap rib.  Mix the Second Stage juices.  Pour 1 cup of liquid over each rib.  At the same time wrap and seal each rib tight.  Return to the oven for 1 hour.

Remove wrapped ribs from oven.  Remove from foil and apply a medium coat of the Third Stage rub to the meat-side of the ribs.  Place uncovered in the oven meat-side up for 30 minutes.

Remove ribs from oven and increase oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Brush finishing glaze on both sides of ribs.  Place ribs in oven for 10 minutes, or until sauce caramelizes.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  white boiling potatoes -- peeled, sliced
  1           teaspoon  salt

Place the potatoes in a large bowl and partially mash.  Add the warm buttermilk and baking soda, mix well, and mash completely.  Stir in the butter and pepper and adjust the seasoning as needed.  If you like your mashed potatoes creamy, add the reserved cooking liquid.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                    Frangipane Tart With Strawberries

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  P‚te Brisee -- (see below)
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- softened
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1              large  egg
     3/4           cup  blanched almonds -- ground fine
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
  1         tablespoon  almond flavored liqueur, like Amaretto
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  strawberries -- hulled
     1/4           cup  strawberry jam -- melted, strained
                        === PATE BRISEE ===
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut into bits
  2        tablespoons  cold vegetable shortening
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

For the P‚te Brisee:  In a large bowl blend the flour, the butter, the vegetable shortening, and salt until the mixture resembles meal.  Add 2 tablespoons ice water, toss the mixture until the water is incorporated, adding more ice water if necessary to form a dough, and form the dough into a ball.  Dust the dough with flour and chill it, wrapped in waxed paper, for 1 hour.

Roll out the pate brisee dough 1/8-inch thick on a lightly floured surface, fit it into an 11- by 8-inch rectangular or 10- or 11-inch round tart pan with a removable fluted rim, and chill the shell while making the frangipane.

In a small bowl cream together the butter and the sugar and beat in the egg, the almonds, the almond extract, the almond flavored liqueur, and the flour.  Spread the frangipane evenly on the bottom of the shell and bake the tart in the middle of a preheated 375 degree oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the shell is pale golden.  (If the frangipane begins to turn too brown, cover the tart loosely with a piece of foil.)  Let the tart cool.

Cut the strawberries lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick slices, arrange the slices, overlapping, decoratively in rows on the frangipane, and brush them gently with the jam.

This recipe yields 1 tart, 8 to 10 servings.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  mayonnaise
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh flat-leafed parsley leaves
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  24                    Ritz crackers - (abt 3 oz)
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1              pound  small squid -- cleaned
  5               cups  vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
                        Lemon wedges -- for accompaniment

To make aÔoli:  In a small bowl stir together mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, parsley, and garlic until combined well and season with salt and pepper.  AÔoli may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.

Fry squid in small batches, turning, until golden and crisp, about 1 minute, transferring with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.  Make sure oil returns to 375 degrees between batches.  Serve squid with aÔoli and lemon wedges.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        == TURTLE CREEK MANSION PEPPER MIXTURE ==
  1                cup  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/3           cup  freshly-ground white pepper
  1 1/2    tablespoons  ground cayenne pepper
  1              small  bunch fresh marjoram
                        === GARLIC HORSERADISH SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  10                    garlic cloves -- peeled
  4              large  white mushrooms, cleaned and sliced
  4              large  shallots, peeled and chopped
     1/2         pound  roasted lamb bones
  2          teaspoons  freshly-cracked black pepper
  1                     small bunch fresh thyme
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  veal demi-glace
     1/4           cup  grated fresh horseradish
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Fresh lemon juice -- to taste
                        === LAMB CHOPS ===
  16                    lamb rib chops, 1" thk -- butchered French sty
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
                        Salt -- to taste

To make pepper mixture combine black and white peppers, cayenne, and marjoram.  Cover tightly and store in a cool place.  Use to season red meats and game before cooking.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small ovenproof sautÈ pan over medium heat.  When hot, add garlic cloves and sautÈ for 4 minutes or until golden brown.  Place in preheated 350 degree oven and roast for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.  Remove from oven.  Remove garlic from pan and cool.  Set aside until ready to use.

Place remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.  When hot, add mushrooms and sautÈ for 1 minute.  Add shallots, lamb bones, and pepper and sautÈ for 1 minute.  Add thyme, chicken stock, and demi-glace and bring to a boil.  Skim off scum.  Lower heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until sauce is reduced by one-third.

Remove lamb bones and strain into a small saucepan.  Add roasted garlic and grated horseradish.  Bring to a boil.  Remove from heat.  Let sauce sit for 5 minutes to capture as much flavor from the garlic and horseradish as possible.  Season with salt and lemon juice.  Keep warm until ready to serve.

Preheat grill.  Make sure grates are clean and lightly rub or brush with oil.  Brush chops with 3 tablespoons peanut oil and season to taste with salt and pepper mixture.  Grill chops about 2 minutes or just long enough to mark one side.  Turn chops and cook for about 2 minutes longer for medium-rare.  Increase cooking time slightly for medium doneness.  Remove chops from grill.

Spoon Roasted Garlic Horseradish Sauce over the bottom of 4 warm dinner plates.  Place 4 grilled lamb chops along the top of each plate, bones to the center.  Garnish plates with sprigs of marjoram.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

To make pepper mixture combine black and white peppers, cayenne, and marjoram.  Cover tightly and store in a cool place.  Use to season red meats and game before cooking.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small ovenproof sautÈ pan over medium heat.  When hot, add garlic cloves and sautÈ for 4 minutes or until golden brown.  Place in preheated 350 degree oven and roast for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.  Remove from oven.  Remove garlic from pan and cool.  Set aside until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.  When hot, add mushrooms and sautÈ for 1 minute.  Add shallots, lamb bones, and pepper and sautÈ for 1 minute.  Add thyme, chicken stock, and demi-glace and bring to a boil.  Skim off scum.  Lower heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until sauce is reduced by one-third.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove lamb bones and strain into a small saucepan.  Add roasted garlic and grated horseradish.  Bring to a boil.  Remove from heat.  Let sauce sit for 5 minutes to capture as much flavor from the garlic and horseradish as possible.  Season with salt and lemon juice.  Keep warm until ready to serve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat grill.  Make sure grates are clean and lightly rub or brush with oil.  Brush chops with 3 tablespoons peanut oil and season to taste with salt and pepper mixture.  Grill chops about 2 minutes or just long enough to mark one side.  Turn chops and cook for about 2 minutes longer for medium-rare.  Increase cooking time slightly for medium doneness.  Remove chops from grill.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon Roasted Garlic Horseradish Sauce over the bottom of 4 warm dinner plates.  Place 4 grilled lamb chops along the top of each plate, bones to the center.  Garnish plates with sprigs of marjoram.  Serve immediately.

  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  8             medium  all-purpose potatoes -- boiled, peeled,

                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- melted

In a heavy medium sautÈ pan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium heat.  Spread the potatoes in an even layer in the sautÈ pan, pressing down on them slightly with a spatula.  Season with salt and pepper and cook until the potatoes begin to brown on the bottom, 6 to 7 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally to prevent sticking.  Pour 1 tablespoon of the melted butter over the top of the potatoes.

Place a large plate over the pan and invert the potatoes onto the plate.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan, slide the potatoes back in, and brown on the other side, about 5 minutes more.  Season with salt and pepper and slide onto a platter.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

           Lazy Sunday Pot Roast With Caraway And Green Apples

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Chris Schlesinger
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  oil -- or more if needed
  4             pounds  boneless cross-rib pot roast - (to 5)
                        = (or other chuck roast)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  2             medium  onions -- peeled, halved,
                        and thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar
                        = (or substitute white vinegar)
  3                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  caraway seeds
     1/4           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh marjoram
                        = (or 2 tbspns dried marjoram)
  2               cups  beef stock - (to 2 1/2)
  4                     Granny Smith or other tart green apples -- quartered, cored,
                        and peeled

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

In a 5-inch-deep Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat until very hot but not smoking.  Dry the meat with paper towels, sprinkle it generously with salt and pepper, place in the pot, and brown well, about 8 to 10 minutes per side.  When the meat is well browned, transfer it to a platter.

Pour off fat or add oil to the pot as needed so you have about 2 tablespoons in the pot.  Add the onions and sautÈ, stirring, until translucent, 7 to 9 minutes.

Add the vinegar and bring to a boil, scraping up any brown stuff from the bottom of the pan.  Put the meat back in the pot and add the bay leaves, caraway seeds, brown sugar, marjoram, and enough stock so that the liquid comes halfway up the sides of the meat.  Bring just to a simmer and skim any scum off the surface then cover, put in the oven, and cook until the beef is fork-tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

After 2 hours and 15 minutes, add the apples to the pot; after 2 1/2 hours, remove the apples with a slotted spoon, set aside, and begin checking the meat for doneness.  To check for doneness, plunge a fork straight down into the meat and try to pull the fork out.  If the fork slides out easily, the meat is done; if the meat hangs on to the fork, give it more time.

When the meat is done, remove it from the pot, cover it loosely with foil, and let it rest for at least 10 minutes.  Skim the fat from the braising liquid and taste the liquid.  If it needs more flavor, place the pan on the stove over medium-high heat and simmer to reduce the liquid.  For a thicker sauce, reduce it until it coats the back of a spoon.  Season with salt and pepper.  (You can also strain the liquid and pass it and the cooked onions separately.)

Cut the meat into thin slices and serve accompanied by the apples, braising liquid, and onions.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                        Salt -- to taste
  2                     limes -- each cut 6 wedges

Cutting the mangoes:  Peel the mangoes, then cut the flesh from the pits.  A mango pit (to which the flesh clings tightly) is flattish and oval, more-or-less a smaller version of the mangoís overall shape.  To cut the flesh off the pit, stand a mango on one end and slice the flesh from one side of the pit.  Turn the mango around and slice the flesh off the other side.  Youíll be able to get a couple thin slices of flesh off the pit on each end.  Cut the large pieces into long 1/2-inch-wide fingers.

Salad:  In pointed Sno-Cone cups (youíll need a snow-cone holder or a glass to support each cup) or in paper cups or glasses, combine a portion of mango, jÌcama and cucumber fingers or wedges (they will be standing in the cups).  Mix the chile and 1/2 teaspoon salt; sprinkle over the salads.  Serve with lime wedges for each guest to squeeze over the pieces as they eat them.

Variation:  Cut the mango, jÌcama and cucumber into cubes instead of fingers, and mix together in a large bowl.  Juice the limes (rather than cutting them into wedges) and drizzle over the mixture.  Sprinkle with the salt and chile, and serve on a buffet or pass this at the table.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FISH ===
  2        tablespoons  golden raisins
     1/2           cup  white balsamic vinegar
                        = (or 1/2 cup cider vinegar mixed
                        with 2 tbspns sugar)
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced crossw
  2 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1              pound  halibut fillet with skin, abt 1 1/2" thk
  2        tablespoons  potato starch
                        === SALAD ===
  1              large  fennel bulb with fronds
                        = (sometimes called anise)
  2 1/2         ounces  radish sprouts or watercress sprigs -- trimmed (2 cups)
  2        tablespoons  white balsamic vinegar
                        = (or 2 tbspns cider vinegar mixed
                        with 1 1/2 tspns sugar)
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar

Prepare fish:  Simmer raisins in vinegar in a small saucepan until raisins are plump, 3 to 5 minutes, and then cool.

Cook onion in 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 6 minutes.  Remove skillet from heat and transfer half of onion to a 9-inch square glass or ceramic baking dish with a slotted spoon, spreading evenly.  Reserve remaining onion.

Cut fish into 6 equal pieces.  Pat dry and season with salt and pepper.  Spread potato starch on a plate and dredge fish in it, shaking off excess.

Heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in skillet over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking, then sautÈ fish, skin-sides down, until lightly browned, 1 1/2 to 3 minutes.  Turn fish over and sautÈ until lightly browned and just cooked through, 1 1/2 to 3 minutes more.

Arrange fish on top of onion in baking dish, then top with reserved onion and drizzle with raisins and vinegar.  Cool completely, then marinate, covered and chilled, at least 8 hours.  Bring to room temperature.

Make salad:  Tear enough fennel fronds to measure 1 tablespoon.  Trim stalks flush with bulb and discard stalks.  Quarter bulb lengthwise, then cut lengthwise into paper-thin slices with a mandoline or other manual slicer.  Transfer slices to a bowl and toss with radish sprouts.

Whisk together vinegar and oil, then whisk in sugar and salt and pepper to taste.  Toss vegetables with half of dressing and divide among 6 plates.

Remove onion from top of fish, reserving it, and put a piece of fish on top of each salad.  Mound all of onion and raisins on top of fish, and then drizzle with remaining dressing and sprinkle with fennel fronds.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10             large  garlic cloves -- unpeeled
  1                can  garbanzo beans - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
  1                can  white beans (cannellini) - (15 oz) -- drained, rinsed
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin -- toasted
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 3)
     1/4           cup  minced fresh mint, basil, cilantro, or
                        thyme
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground coarse black pepper -- to taste
                        === CRISPY SHALLOTS ===
  1                cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  finely-sliced shallots - (4 or 5)

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Place garlic cloves on a baking sheet and roast for 15 to 20 minutes, until they begin to turn golden brown.  Remove and let cool.  Squeeze the cloves to press out the roasted garlic.

Combine the garlic, beans, lemon juice, and cumin in a food processor and puree until creamy.  With motor running, slowly add the olive oil.  Process to a smooth, thick puree.  Add the fresh herb and pulse to leave some whole bits.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Garnish with the shallots.

For the Crispy Shallots:  Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a small wok or heavy-bottomed saucepan to 360 degrees.  Add the shallots and fry, turning frequently, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from the oil with a strainer or slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  If made ahead, cool and store in an airtight container up to 3 days.  (Makes about 1 1/4 cups)

This recipe yields 2 cups.

To toast spices:  Place spices in a dry sautÈ pan over medium heat.  Toast, while shaking the pan to avoid overheating in 1 spot.  Remove from the heat when the spices have become aromatic, 1 to 2 minutes.  If the spices start to smoke, immediately dump them out of the pan onto a cool surface to halt the cooking.  If there is any burned smell, you should discard them and start over.

       Mozzarella Casserole With Mushrooms And Smoky Chipotle Chile

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Rick Bayless
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Mexican


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  red onion -- sliced
  8             ounces  full-flavored mushrooms, such as oysters,
                        shiitakes or practically any wild variety -- stemmed (discard
                        woody stems or chop them finely) and slice
  2                     canned chipotle chiles - (to 3) -- removed from the
                        canning sauce, seeded and thinly sliced
                        Salt -- to taste
  12                    corn tortillas, the fresher the better
                        = (store-bought are okay, though homemade
                        will really shine here)
  8             ounces  mozzarella, preferably whole milk (but
                        not "fresh" mozzarella which will not
                        melt) or Mexican quesillo cheese -- shredded
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        = (or 1 generous tspn chopped fresh epazot
                        A little freshly-ground black pepper

Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large skillet (preferably non-stick), heat the oil over medium-high.  Add the sliced onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softening and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and stir nearly constantly until they have softened and any juice they release has evaporated, about 5 minutes longer.  Stir in the sliced chile, then taste and season with salt, usually about 1/4 teaspoon.

Transfer the mixture to a 9- or 10-inch shallow baking dish, Mexican cazuela or pie plate.  Very lightly dampen a clean kitchen towel.  Check the tortillas to make sure none are stuck together.  Wrap them in the towel, then in foil, sealing the edges tightly.  Place in the oven and set the timer for 7 minutes.

When the timer goes off, stir the shredded cheese into the warm mushroom mixture.  Set in the oven alongside the tortillas and bake until the cheese is just melted, about 5 more minutes.  Sprinkle with the thyme or epazote and black pepper and serve without a momentís hesitation, accompanied by the warm tortillas.

This recipe yields 12 soft tacos, serving 6 as an appetizer, 4 as a casual main dish.

     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2         pounds  blackberries and loganberries

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN ===
  2             ounces  andouille sausage -- finely chopped
  1                cup  crisp rice cereal (not flakes)
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  2          teaspoons  sweet paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3              large  garlic cloves -- finely minced
  1              large  egg
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (5 oz ea)
                        === SAUCE ===

Arrange chicken pieces, not touching, on prepared baking sheet and bake uncovered until well done in center, about 30 minutes.

For Sauce:  Whisk together all ingredients in a small bowl.  As soon as chicken tests done, serve.  Pass sauce separately.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  3                     sheets phyllo dough - (12" by 17" ea) -- room temperature

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spray a large nonstick baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.

In a small bowl, mix the cheese, chili powder and cumin.  Place the sheets of phyllo on a work surface and cover them with a damp towel.

Remove the first sheet and place it with short side toward you.  Coat with nonstick cooking spray (butter-flavored is nice), then sprinkle with about 2 teaspoons of the cheese mixture; fold the phyllo in 1/2 to form a 12- by 8 1/2-inch rectangle.

Spray the phyllo again and sprinkle with 2 more teaspoons of the cheese mixture; fold in 1/2 again to form a 6- by 8 1/2-inch rectangle.

Spray the phyllo again and sprinkle with 2 more teaspoons of the cheese mixture; fold in 1/2 again to form a 6- by 4 1/4-inch rectangle.

Spray again and sprinkle with just a bit of the cheese mixture; with a serrated knife, cut into 8 short strips.

Transfer the strips to the baking sheet, placing them about 1/2-inch apart.  Repeat the process 2 more times to make 24 cheese straws.  Bake until the cheese straws are crisp and golden, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Cool on wire racks.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spray a large nonstick baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, mix the cheese, chili powder and cumin.  Place the sheets of phyllo on a work surface and cover them with a damp towel.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the first sheet and place it with short side toward you.  Coat with nonstick cooking spray (butter-flavored is nice), then sprinkle with about 2 teaspoons of the cheese mixture; fold the phyllo in 1/2 to form a 12- by 8 1/2-inch rectangle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spray the phyllo again and sprinkle with 2 more teaspoons of the cheese mixture; fold in 1/2 again to form a 6- by 8 1/2-inch rectangle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spray the phyllo again and sprinkle with 2 more teaspoons of the cheese mixture; fold in 1/2 again to form a 6- by 4 1/4-inch rectangle.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spray again and sprinkle with just a bit of the cheese mixture; with a serrated knife, cut into 8 short strips.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the strips to the baking sheet, placing them about 1/2-inch apart.  Repeat the process 2 more times to make 24 cheese straws.  Bake until the cheese straws are crisp and golden, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Cool on wire racks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2            bunches  fresh parsley
  1                cup  pitted kalamata, Greek, or nicoise olives
                        = (abt 1 1/4 cups with pits)
  1                cup  walnuts -- toasted
  1              bunch  green onions
  2              large  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded
     1/3           cup  good-quality extra-virgin olive oil
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin powder
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground coarse black pepper -- to taste

Remove the stems from the parsley and mince either by hand or with quick pulses in a food processor.  The parsley should be finely chopped, but if you use a food processor be careful not to puree it.  The parsley should form a fluffy base for other textures.

Chop the olives, walnuts, and green onions by hand into a rough dice.  Dice the prepared tomatoes and drain.

Combine all of the chopped ingredients in a large wooden bowl.  Add the olive oil, lemon juice, cumin, and red pepper flakes and toss to combine.  Add salt and pepper, to taste.

This recipe yields 8 salad servings.

To toast nuts:  Place nuts in a dry sautÈ pan over medium heat.  Toast, while shaking the pan to avoid overheating in 1 spot.  Remove from the heat after 3 to 5 minutes when the nuts have achieved a nice pale golden color.

                    Perfect Porterhouse Steak For Two

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  Porterhouse steak, 2" thick
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
                        === ROQUEFORT SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  minced shallot
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  milk
  1                cup  crumbled Roquefort - (abt 1/4 lb)
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BEARNAISE SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  dried tarragon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     egg yolks
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- melted in saucepan
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh tarragon

Heat a grill pan over moderately-high heat.  Pat the steak dry with paper towels, then rub it with the oil and sprinkle it generously with salt and pepper.

Place the steak on the grill pan and cook until well seared on 1 side, 6 to 8 minutes.  Turn and sear the second side, again for 6 to 8 minutes.  Lower the flame to medium and cook, turning once, 10 to 15 minutes more for rare.  To check for doneness, nick, peek, and cheat: make a 1/4-inch cut in the thickest part of the meat and take a peek; it should be slightly less done than you like it.

Remove the meat from the fire, cover it loosely with foil, and allow it to rest for 10 minutes before serving.  Serve with 1 of the 2 sauces or herb butter.

For Roquefort Sauce:  In a small heavy saucepan cook the shallot in the butter over moderately-low heat, stirring, until it is softened, add the wine, and boil the mixture until the liquid is reduced to about 1 tablespoon.  Whisk in the flour and cook the mixture, whisking, for 3 minutes.  Add the milk in a stream, whisking, and boil the mixture, whisking, for 2 minutes.

Reduce the heat to low, whisk in the Roquefort, a little at a time, whisking until it is melted and being careful not to let the mixture boil, and strain the sauce through a fine sieve into a bowl.  Stir in the parsley, season the sauce with salt and pepper, and serve it with roasted or grilled beef, veal, or pork.  (Makes about 1 cup)

For Bearnaise Sauce:  In a small saucepan combine vinegar, wine, shallots, and dried tarragon and simmer over moderate heat until reduced to 2 tablespoons of liquid.  Cool and strain through a fine sieve.

In the top of a double boiler whisk the egg yolks until they become thick and sticky.  Whisk in the reduced vinegar mixture and pepper.  Place the pan or bowl over a saucepan of simmering, not boiling water.  Whisk until mixture is warm, about 2 minutes.  (If mixture appears to become lumpy, dip pan immediately in a bowl of ice water to cool, whisk until smooth and then continue recipe.)  The yolk mixture has thickened enough when you can see the bottom of the pan between strokes and mixture forms a light cream on the wires of the whisk.

While whisking the yolk mixture gradually pour in the melted butter, 1 tablespoon or so at a time whisking thoroughly to incorporate before adding more butter.  As the mixture begins to thicken and become creamy, the butter can be added more rapidly.  Do not add the milk solids at the bottom of the melted butter.

Season the sauces, to taste, with chopped tarragon, salt and pepper.  To keep the sauce warm, set the pan or bowl in lukewarm water or in a thermos.  (Makes 1 to 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 2 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     boneless skinless salmon fillets -- (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Olive oil
                        Pesto -- (see below)
     1/2           cup  very fine breadcrumbs - (to 3/4)
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  2                     oranges -- peeled, segmented
  2                     grapefruits -- peeled, segmented
                        === PESTO ===
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6               cups  fresh basil -- thoroughly washed,
                        and dried
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs - (to 3/4)
                        === CITRUS SOY SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced peeled ginger
     1/4           cup  thinly-sliced peeled shallots
     1/8           cup  sliced peeled garlic
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/8           cup  champagne vinegar
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fish sauce
  1               cups  grapefruit juice
  1 1/2           cups  orange juice
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock reduced to 1/2 cup
  1                cup  olive oil
                        === STEAMED SPINACH LEAVES ===
  2             pounds  loose spinach leaves

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Heat a 12-inch non-stick sautÈ pan over a high flame.  Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper.  Add a small amount of oil to the pan and sear both sides of the salmon quickly, just a few seconds on each side, leaving the fish very rare.  Remove the pan from the heat, and place the fish on a work surface.  Wipe out the pan and reserve for later use.

Spread a 1/4-inch layer of Pesto evenly over 1 side of the fillet.  Sprinkle the top of the pesto with a light, thin dusting of fresh bread crumbs.  Carefully invert each fillet into the pan and place it over a medium flame.  Toast the bread coating, adding tiny bits of butter to the pan that will melt into the salmon underneath.  Once the bread is toasted (after about 1 minute), place the pan in the oven for about 3 minutes, just to heat the fish through.

To serve, mound 1/6 of the Steamed Spinach Leaves in the center of a warm dinner plate.  Invert 1 salmon fillet onto the spinach, crust-side up, and ladle Citrus Soy Sauce around the sides.  Place 1 orange segment on top of 1 grapefruit segment in the sauce at 3 different points on the plate.

For the Pesto:  In the bowl of a food processor place, pine nuts, garlic, salt, and pepper.  Add the basil and process again.  With the motor running, add the oil in a stream slowly, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally.  Add bread crumbs a little at a time, just enough to make pesto spreadable.  Process and repeat until the pesto is the right consistency.  Remove from food processor and set aside until ready to use.

For the Citrus Soy Sauce:  In a non-reactive saucepan, sautÈ the ginger in 1 tablespoon olive oil for 1 minute over medium heat.  Add the shallot and garlic and continue cooking for 1 minute longer.  Deglaze the pan with white wine, champagne vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, and all 3 fruit juices.  Reduce the liquid volume down to 1 cup.  Add the chicken stock, bring it to a boil, and cook another 3 minutes.

Strain, pushing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible, and place the liquid into a blender or food processor.  With the motor running on low, add the remaining olive oil in a slow stream until all the oil is incorporated.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

For the Steamed Spinach Leaves:  Wash spinach thoroughly and drain, leaving some of the water clinging to the leaves. In a 12-inch saute pan over medium heat, saute the spinach in a small amount of olive oil until it is wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain excess moisture, season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

<DirT>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Heat a 12-inch non-stick sautÈ pan over a high flame.  Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper.  Add a small amount of oil to the pan and sear both sides of the salmon quickly, just a few seconds on each side, leaving the fish very rare.  Remove the pan from the heat, and place the fish on a work surface.  Wipe out the pan and reserve for later use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread a 1/4-inch layer of Pesto evenly over 1 side of the fillet.  Sprinkle the top of the pesto with a light, thin dusting of fresh bread crumbs.  Carefully invert each fillet into the pan and place it over a medium flame.  Toast the bread coating, adding tiny bits of butter to the pan that will melt into the salmon underneath.  Once the bread is toasted (after about 1 minute), place the pan in the oven for about 3 minutes, just to heat the fish through.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, mound 1/6 of the Steamed Spinach Leaves in the center of a warm dinner plate.  Invert 1 salmon fillet onto the spinach, crust-side up, and ladle Citrus Soy Sauce around the sides.  Place 1 orange segment on top of 1 grapefruit segment in the sauce at 3 different points on the plate.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Pesto:  In the bowl of a food processor place, pine nuts, garlic, salt, and pepper.  Add the basil and process again.  With the motor running, add the oil in a stream slowly, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally.  Add bread crumbs a little at a time, just enough to make pesto spreadable.  Process and repeat until the pesto is the right consistency.  Remove from food processor and set aside until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Citrus Soy Sauce:  In a non-reactive saucepan, sautÈ the ginger in 1 tablespoon olive oil for 1 minute over medium heat.  Add the shallot and garlic and continue cooking for 1 minute longer.  Deglaze the pan with white wine, champagne vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, and all 3 fruit juices.  Reduce the liquid volume down to 1 cup.  Add the chicken stock, bring it to a boil, and cook another 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Strain, pushing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible, and place the liquid into a blender or food processor.  With the motor running on low, add the remaining olive oil in a slow stream until all the oil is incorporated.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Steamed Spinach Leaves:  Wash spinach thoroughly and drain, leaving some of the water clinging to the leaves. In a 12-inch saute pan over medium heat, saute the spinach in a small amount of olive oil until it is wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain excess moisture, season with salt and pepper.

  8                     gingersnaps -- finely ground

If using fresh rhubarb, trim and finely chop.

Cook rhubarb and granulated sugar in a wide 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately-high heat, stirring constantly, until rhubarb begins to give off juices.  Reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until rhubarb falls apart and is reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, about 20 minutes.

Transfer rhubarb to a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and chill, stirring occasionally, until cold, about 5 minutes.

Beat heavy cream and confectionersí sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks.  Add sour cream and sherry and beat until it returns to stiff-peak stage.

Decoratively layer 1/3 cup rhubarb, 1/2 cup whipped cream, and 1 1/2 tablespoons gingersnap crumbs in each of 4 (6-ounce) stemmed glasses (there will be a little rhubarb left over).  Chill until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  oil
  1                     bag sauerkraut - (16 oz) -- rinsed, drained
  2                     onions -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  caraway seeds
  1              pound  low-fat turkey kielbasa
  1                can  refrigerated pizza dough - (10 oz)
  1                cup  honey mustard

In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil.  Add the sauerkraut, onions, caraway seeds and a 1/2 cup of water; cook, covered, until the liquid evaporates and the sauerkraut and onions are very tender, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool completely.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Cut the kielbasa into 2 (8-inch) lengths, then cut the pizza dough in half.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out each 1/2 of dough into a rectangle about 2 inches longer than the kielbasa and wide enough to wrap around it.  Spoon 1/2 of the sauerkraut mixture down the center of each piece of dough, then place a kielbasa half on the sauerkraut.  Fold up the dough to enclose the kielbasa completely, pinching the edges to seal.

Transfer to an ungreased baking sheet.  Bake until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.  Cut into slices; serve warm or at room temperature, with honey mustard on the side.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

     1/4           cup  Chive Oil -- (see below)
     1/4           cup  diced fresh chives
                        === CHIVE OIL ===
  1                cup  vegetable oil -- well chilled

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  truffle oil
  1                cup  grapeseed oil
                        === SAUTEED SHIITAKES ===
  1                cup  thinly-sliced shiitakes
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  butter
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  chopped shallots
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme leaves
     1/2           cup  haricots verts -- blanched
     1/4           cup  diced seeded tomato

Preheat an oven to 375 degrees.  Season the fillets on both sides with salt and pepper.

Place a large, non-stick sautÈ pan over very high heat.  When hot, add the oil, and swirl to coat bottom of pan.  Brush each fillet (skin side only) generously with butter.  Place the fish fillets into the hot pan, skin-side down, and brown for 2 minutes over high heat.

Place the pan in the oven for 3 minutes.  Serve warm from the oven, with Chive Whipped Potatoes, Truffle Vinaigrette, and SautÈed Shiitakes.

For the Chive Whipped Potatoes:  Put the potatoes in a saucepot and cover with cold water.  Add salt and bring to a boil.  Cook the potatoes until tender, about 15 minutes.  Strain the water out of the pot and mash the potatoes with the cream, butter, salt and pepper.  Stir in the chive oil and sliced chives, and serve.

For the Chive Oil:  In a food processor, blend the oil and chives together.  Season to taste with salt.  Reserve the remainder in a plastic squeeze bottle, refrigerated.

For the Truffle Vinaigrette:  Place chicken stock in a saucepan and reduce liquid to 1/2 cup.  Place chopped shallots in a large, stainless steel mixing bowl, pour hot stock over them, and steep for 10 minutes.  Add the vinegar, season to taste, and slowly add the oils, whisking constantly to emulsify.  Set aside until ready to use.  (Makes 2 1/2 cups)

For the SautÈed Shiitakes:  SautÈ the mushrooms in olive oil and butter.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add shallots, garlic, and thyme.  SautÈ until shallots and garlic turn translucent.  Add the haricots verts, combine and remove from heat.  Stir in the dice tomato and serve.

                        Shad Roe With Black Butter

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     pairs shad roe
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1         tablespoon  capers - (to 2)
  1                     lemon - (to 2) -- quartered, peeled
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
     1/4         bunch  parsley -- trimmed, chopped
  2        tablespoons  tarragon
  2             slices  bacon -- rendered

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat.  Carefully arrange roe in the bottom of a large, wide bowl.  Pour boiling water down inside edge of the bowl, avoiding roe as you pour.  Roe will turn gray, pairs may separate, and eggs will "bloom" where there are tears in the sac.

After 15 seconds, transfer roe with a slotted spatula to paper towels and pat dry.  Carefully separate any pairs still attached to each other and discard connective membrane.

Melt butter in a large heavy-bottomed skillet set over medium-high heat.  Add roe and fry, turning once (and reducing heat to medium if roe begins to burn), until roe is browned on the outside and still pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side.  Roe will "spit" as it cooks.

Add capers and lemons to taste over roe while gently shaking skillet over heat.  Then remove skillet from heat.  Generously season roe with salt and garnish with chopped parsley, tarragon and crumbled bacon.  Serve roe with some of the blackened butter sauce from the skillet spooned over the top.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  6             ounces  fresh shiitakes -- stems discarded,
                        and caps chopped coarse - (abt 1/2 cup)
     1/3           cup  fine dry bread crumbs
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour -- seasoned with
                        Salt -- to taste, and
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
  1              large  egg -- beaten lightly
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        === RAGOUT ===
  6             ounces  fresh shiitakes
  1              pound  medium green asparagus -- peeled, trimmed
  10            ounces  pearl onions
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

In a shallow baking pan drizzle oil over shiitakes, and toss to coat.  Roast mushrooms, stirring once or twice, 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden.  Keep oven at 450 degrees.

Blanch onions in boiling salted water 1 minute.  Drain in a colander and rinse under cold running water to stop cooking.  Trim root ends and peel.

Mince roasted shiitake and in a shallow bowl, stir together with bread crumbs and salt and pepper to taste.  Have ready in separate shallow bowls seasoned flour and egg.

Working with 1 chicken breast at a time, dredge in flour, shaking off excess, and dip in egg, letting excess drip off.  Coat chicken with mushroom mixture, gently knocking off excess, and transfer to a plate.  Chicken may be prepared up to this point 2 hours ahead and chilled, uncovered, on a rack.

In a 12-inch non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking and sautÈ chicken until golden, about 1 minute on each side.  Transfer chicken with tongs to baking pan.  Scatter pearl onions around chicken and roast in middle of oven 10 minutes, or until chicken is just cooked through.

Cut asparagus diagonally into 2-inch lengths.  Arrange on a steamer rack and sprinkle with kosher salt.  Steam asparagus, covered, over boiling water until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes, then transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop cooking.  SautÈ shiitakes in 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Set aside.

Transfer chicken to a platter, cover loosely with foil.  Transfer onions and pan juices to 2 separate small bowls (do not clean roasting pan).

To a large skillet add 1 tablespoon butter and cook shiitakes.  SautÈ until mushrooms are softened and browned lightly.  Add wine and chicken stock and remaining pan juices and boil until liquid is reduced to about 1/3 cup.  Add asparagus and onions.

Cut remaining 2 tablespoons butter into pieces and add to vegetables.  Cook over moderately-high heat, shaking pan, until butter is just incorporated and vegetables are glazed.  Season vegetables with salt and pepper and spoon around chicken.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  12            medium  garlic cloves -- crushed
  1                cup  dry red vermouth
  2               cups  diced tomatoes
  1 1/2         pounds  large shrimp -- shelled, deveined
  1                cup  chopped fresh parsley

  1              pound  fresh asparagus
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ITALIAN GREENS ===
  8               cups  ready-to-eat Italian-style salad greens -- washed
  1         tablespoon  no-sugar-added oil and vinegar dressing -- plus
  1           teaspoon  no-sugar-added oil and vinegar dressing

Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless lamb - (to 2)
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground coarse black pepper -- to taste
                        === ALMOND MINT PESTO ===
     1/4           cup  unsalted almonds -- toasted
     1/4           cup  freshly grated Parmesan cheese
     1/3           cup  extra virgin olive oil
     3/4           cup  fresh basil leaves
  1 1/4           cups  fresh mint leaves
  3             medium  garlic cloves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground coarse black pepper -- to taste

If using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for at least 30 minutes to prevent burning.

Preheat the broiler or grill to high.

Thinly slice the lamb into 4- by 1-inch strips.  Lightly brush the lamb with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Thread the lamb on to the skewers, creating a ruffle.

Place under the broiler or on the grill and cook for 1 to 2 minutes on each side until medium-rare, or to desired doneness.  Serve with the pesto as a dipping sauce.

For the Almond Mint Pesto:  Put the almonds, cheese, and the olive oil in a food processor and pulse until pureed.  Add the basil, mint, and garlic and process to a smooth texture.

Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.  Taste for salt and pepper and add if needed.  Serve the pesto or refrigerate up to 24 hours.

This recipe yields 8 servings; 16 skewers.

To toast nuts:  Place nuts in a dry sautÈ pan over medium heat.  Toast, while shaking the pan to avoid overheating in 1 spot.  Remove from the heat after 3 to 5 minutes when the nuts have become a nice pale golden color.

                        === CORN CAKES ===
  1                     sweet corn ear
  1              small  garlic clove -- minced
  1                     serrano chili -- seeded, ribs removed
                        and finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  finely-diced red bell pepper
  1         tablespoon  finely-diced yellow bell pepper
  1         tablespoon  finely-diced green bell pepper
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour, sifted
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                     extra large egg -- lightly beaten
  1                cup  whole milk
     1/2    tablespoon  bacon grease -- melted
                        Few drops lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  8        tablespoons  Diablo Sauce

To make sauce, heat oil in a heavy bottomed skillet until lightly smoking.  SautÈ shallots and garlic until light brown.  Add chilies, cumin, ginger, and red peppers.  Stir about 30 seconds.  Add mango and chicken stock.  Simmer about 20 minutes.  Puree and season with salt and lime juice.  Sauce may be used hot or cold.

For pancakes, shuck corn, remove silk, and cut kernels from cob.  Place in smoker for 8 minutes.

In a medium bowl, combine smoked corn, garlic, serrano chili, and bell peppers.  In another bowl, mix cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt.  Combine egg, milk, and bacon grease.  Add vegetables to dry ingredients, then stir in egg mixture.  Adjust seasoning with lemon juice.  Fold to mix and let rest for 20 minutes.  Adjust seasonings, if necessary.

Place a large skillet over medium heat.  Add just enough oil to coat bottom of skillet.  When skillet is hot, pour corn batter, about 1/8 cup per corn cake.  Cook on 1 side for about 1 1/2 minutes or until brown.  Turn and cook until middles of cakes no longer appear wet.  Remove cakes to warm platter and repeat to make 8 cakes.

Place 2 cakes, edges overlapping on the center of each 4 warm plates.  Spoon 2 tablespoons of Diablo Sauce around cakes and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

To make sauce, heat oil in a heavy bottomed skillet until lightly smoking.  SautÈ shallots and garlic until light brown.  Add chilies, cumin, ginger, and red peppers.  Stir about 30 seconds.  Add mango and chicken stock.  Simmer about 20 minutes.  Puree and season with salt and lime juice.  Sauce may be used hot or cold.

For pancakes, shuck corn, remove silk, and cut kernels from cob.  Place in smoker for 8 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium bowl, combine smoked corn, garlic, serrano chili, and bell peppers.  In another bowl, mix cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt.  Combine egg, milk, and bacon grease.  Add vegetables to dry ingredients, then stir in egg mixture.  Adjust seasoning with lemon juice.  Fold to mix and let rest for 20 minutes.  Adjust seasonings, if necessary.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place a large skillet over medium heat.  Add just enough oil to coat bottom of skillet.  When skillet is hot, pour corn batter, about 1/8 cup per corn cake.  Cook on 1 side for about 1 1/2 minutes or until brown.  Turn and cook until middles of cakes no longer appear wet.  Remove cakes to warm platter and repeat to make 8 cakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place 2 cakes, edges overlapping on the center of each 4 warm plates.  Spoon 2 tablespoons of Diablo Sauce around cakes and serve immediately.

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Kathleen Kennedy
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  12                    eggs -- separated
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/2         pound  smoked salmon -- roughly chopped
  1              pound  cream cheese -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  fresh dill -- chopped
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan cheese

Generously butter 2 (15- by 10- by 1-inch) baking (jelly roll) pans and line them with parchment paper.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Over medium heat, melt the butter in a saucepan.  Whisk in the flour, cayenne, and salt.  Cook 3 to 5 minutes, stirring until the center bubbles.  Remove from heat, and stir in the milk.  Return to heat and cook 3 to 5 minutes more, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens.  Remove from heat.

In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with a wire whisk.  Gradually whisk in the flour mixture; beat until smooth.

Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar until stiff peaks form.  Gently fold the whites into the yolks, being careful not to overmix.

Using rubber spatula, divide the batter between the 2 pans and spread evenly.  Bake 15 to 20 minutes, until the roulade springs back when touched in the center.  When completely cooled, invert the roulade sheets onto a clean surface, and discard the parchment paper.

Whip together the salmon, cream cheese, and dill, until light and fluffy.  Spread the salmon mixture evenly on the surface of the roulade.  Place 1 of the 15-inch roulade sides in front of you.  Carefully roll it toward the other 15-inch side, until the width of the roulade forms a spiral of egg and filling.  Cut each roulade into 10 slices.  Refrigerate if not serving immediately.

Spread the roulade slices out on a greased baking tray in a single layer so that the sprial is on the top and bottom of each slice.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Reheat in a preheated 350 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes.  Broil for 3 to 5 minutes, until lightly browned.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Mexican


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     pork tenderloins - (abt 1 lb total)
  1                can  chipotle chiles en adobo - (7 oz)
  1                cup  fresh orange juice
  1                cup  sun-dried tomatoes - (abt 2 oz) -- halved
  1              small  red onion -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped pitted kalamata olives
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice -- more or less
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil, rich-tasting
                        pork lard or bacon drippings
  12                    fresh warm corn tortillas
                        = (reheat store-bought ones or
                        make them from scratch)

Butterflying and marinating the pork:  Lay 1 tenderloin on your cutting board and cut it in half.  Now, with a sharp knife, make a horizontal cut through 1 half (youíll be cutting parallel with the board) from one long side to within 1/4- inch of the other.  This will allow you to fold open the meat like a book, utilizing that 1/4-inch uncut side as a hinge.  Using a meat pounder or heavy mallet, pound the pork to between 1/4 to 1/8-inch thickness.

In a food processor or blender, thoroughly puree the chipotles and all the canning sauce.  With a pastry or basting brush, liberally paint the meat on both sides with the pureed chipotles.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 24 hours).  Repeat with the other tenderloin pieces.  (There will be considerably more chipotle puree than you need; cover and refrigerate the leftover for up to 2 weeks and use it to marinate other meat, fish, poultry or vegetables.)

Soaking the sun-dried tomatoes:  In a small saucepan bring the orange juice just to a boil.  Add the sun-dried tomatoes, stir well, cover and remove from the heat.  Let stand, stirring once or twice, until softened, about 20 minutes.

Salsa:  Scrape the soaked tomatoes and the juice into a food processor or blender, and measure in 1 tablespoon of chipotle puree.  Pulse the processor until the tomatoes are rather finely chopped (not pureed).  Scrape into a small serving bowl.

Rinse the chopped onion under cold water, shake off the excess liquid and add it to the salsa along with the olives, cilantro and the lime juice.  Stir everything together, then taste and season with salt, usually about 1/4 teaspoon.  Adjust the consistency to that of an easily spoonable salsa with additional juice or water if needed.  Set aside at room temperature while you cook the meat.

Searing the meat:  Set a large (12-inch) heavy well-seasoned or non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.  Add the lard, oil or bacon drippings, brushing or spreading it around to evenly coat the surface.  (If using a non-stick surface, oil the meat instead of the pan.)

When the oil is very hot (itíll just begin to smoke), lay on one of the marinated meat pieces in a single layer.  Sear on one side until beginning to brown (2 to 3 minutes), flip it over, and sear the other side about 1 1/2 minutes.  Transfer to a baking sheet in a single layer and keep warm in the oven.  Sear the remaining meat and add to the baking sheet.

Chop or slice the meat into smallish pieces and scoop into a warm serving bowl.  Set on the table along with the salsa and warm tortillas, and your meal is ready.

This recipe yields 12 tacos, serving 4 as a light meal.

Now, with a sharp knife, make a horizontal cut through 1 half (youíll be cutting parallel with the board) from one long side to within 1/4- inch of the other.  This will allow you to fold open the meat like a book, utilizing that 1/4-inch uncut side as a hinge.  Using a meat pounder or heavy mallet, pound the pork to between 1/4 to 1/8-inch thickness.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a food processor or blender, thoroughly puree the chipotles and all the canning sauce.  With a pastry or basting brush, liberally paint the meat on both sides with the pureed chipotles.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 24 hours).  Repeat with the other tenderloin pieces.  (There will be considerably more chipotle puree than you need; cover and refrigerate the leftover for up to 2 weeks and use it to marinate other meat, fish, poultry or vegetables.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Soaking the sun-dried tomatoes:  In a small saucepan bring the orange juice just to a boil.  Add the sun-dried tomatoes, stir well, cover and remove from the heat.  Let stand, stirring once or twice, until softened, about 20 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Salsa:  Scrape the soaked tomatoes and the juice into a food processor or blender, and measure in 1 tablespoon of chipotle puree.  Pulse the processor until the tomatoes are rather finely chopped (not pureed).  Scrape into a small serving bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Rinse the chopped onion under cold water, shake off the excess liquid and add it to the salsa along with the olives, cilantro and the lime juice.  Stir everything together, then taste and season with salt, usually about 1/4 teaspoon.  Adjust the consistency to that of an easily spoonable salsa with additional juice or water if needed.  Set aside at room temperature while you cook the meat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Searing the meat:  Set a large (12-inch) heavy well-seasoned or non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.  Add the lard, oil or bacon drippings, brushing or spreading it around to evenly coat the surface.  (If using a non-stick surface, oil the meat instead of the pan.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the oil is very hot (itíll just begin to smoke), lay on one of the marinated meat pieces in a single layer.  Sear on one side until beginning to brown (2 to 3 minutes), flip it over, and sear the other side about 1 1/2 minutes.  Transfer to a baking sheet in a single layer and keep warm in the oven.  Sear the remaining meat and add to the baking sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Chop or slice the meat into smallish pieces and scoop into a warm serving bowl.  Set on the table along with the salsa and warm tortillas, and your meal is ready.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 12 tacos, serving 4 as a light meal.

  16                    medium-large fresh oysters
  2               cups  dried cornbread crumbs

                        finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  peanut oil
                        === SALAD ===
  1              large  romaine head -- outer leaves removed
                        cleaned, dried, and diced

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  fiddleheads -- cleaned
     1/2         pound  baby pattypan squash -- trimmed
     1/2         pound  baby carrots -- trimmed
     3/4           cup  shelled fresh peas
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/2         pound  pearl onions -- blanched in boiling
                        water for 1 minute, peeled, trimmed
  2                     thyme sprigs
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  chicken broth
     1/4         pound  fresh morels -- washed well,
                        patted dry, and trimmed
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley leaves
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced fresh mint leaves
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced

To clean fresh-picked fiddleheads:  Snap off the crisp, bright green fiddlehead tops from ostrich ferns, leaving about 2 inches of stem attached.  Rub off the dry brown casings by hand or put the fiddleheads in a wire salad basket and whirl the basket outdoors to remove the casings.  Let the fiddleheads soak in a sink half full of cold water, changing the water several times to remove any grit or casing particles, and drain them.  The fiddleheads keep, covered and chilled, for 1 week

In a kettle of boiling salted water boil the fiddleheads for 4 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender, transfer them with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop the cooking, and transfer them to paper towels to drain.

In the kettle boil the squash and the carrots for 3 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender, transfer the vegetables with the slotted spoon to the bowl of ice and cold water to stop the cooking, and transfer them to paper towels to drain.

In the kettle boil the peas for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are just tender, and drain them.

In a large heavy skillet combine 2 tablespoons of the butter, the onions, the thyme, the bay leaf, 1/4 cup of the broth, and salt and pepper, to taste, and simmer the mixture, covered, for 5 minutes.  Add the morels, halved lengthwise or sliced crosswise, and 1/2 cup of the remaining broth and simmer the mixture, covered, for 10 minutes, or until the morels are tender.

Add the fiddleheads, the squash, the carrots, and the remaining 1/4 cup broth and simmer the mixture, covered, for 1 minute.  Add the peas, the parsley, the mint, and the garlic, simmer the ragout, covered, for 1 minute, and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, cut into bits, stirring until the butter is just melted.  Discard the bay leaf and season the ragout with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

To clean fresh-picked fiddleheads:  Snap off the crisp, bright green fiddlehead tops from ostrich ferns, leaving about 2 inches of stem attached.  Rub off the dry brown casings by hand or put the fiddleheads in a wire salad basket and whirl the basket outdoors to remove the casings.  Let the fiddleheads soak in a sink half full of cold water, changing the water several times to remove any grit or casing particles, and drain them.  The fiddleheads keep, covered and chilled, for 1 week

     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  garlic clove -- chopped, and
                        mashed to a paste with
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

       Veal Birdies Tidewater-Style, With Ham, Crab, Lemon-Caper Sa

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Chris Schlesinger
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  backfin crabmeat -- picked over
                        for shells and cartilage
  2        tablespoons  roughly-chopped fresh chervil
                        = (or substitute parsley)
  8             slices  veal leg - (4 oz ea)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-cracked black pepper -- to taste
  8             slices  Smithfield ham - (very thin)
                        = (or substitute prosciutto)
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  3        tablespoons  capers -- rinsed well
     1/2                lemon
     1/4           cup  roughly-chopped fresh parsley

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  In a small bowl, combine the crabmeat and chervil and toss gently.  Cover and refrigerate.

Dry the veal with paper towels, then place each slice between 2 pieces of waxed paper and, using a meat mallet or other blunt instrument like a small sautÈ pan, pound to about 1/4-inch thickness.  Sprinkle the veal slices generously with salt and pepper, then lay 1 slice of ham on top of each slice.  Top each piece of ham with 1/8 of the crabmeat mixture.  Roll up each veal slice into a fat tube and secure with 1 or more toothpicks.  If you have time, place the birdies in the refrigerator for 20 minutes; this will help keep them sealed as they cook.

In a large sautÈ pan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat.  Add the veal, in batches if necessary to avoid crowding, and cook until browned on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side; transfer the birdies to an ovenproof platter as they are done.  When all the birdies are browned, turn off the oven and place the platter in the oven while you prepare the sauce.

Add the capers to the pan and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Drain off the darkened butter, leaving the capers in the pan.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pan.  When the butter has melted, squeeze the lemon juice over the capers.  Add the parsley and stir to combine.  Season with salt and pepper, pour the sauce over the platter of veal birds, and serve right away.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                      Warm Scallop And Spinach Salad

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PRALINE ===
     1/3           cup  pecans -- chopped fine
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne -- or to taste
  3        tablespoons  sugar
                        === SALAD ===
     3/4         pound  sea scallops
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/2    tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     3/4      teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  1              large  firm ripe avocado
  7               cups  tatsoi (thick, spoon-shaped Asian
                        greens) or baby spinach leaves -- washed well,
                        and spun dry

To make Praline:  In a bowl stir together pecans, salt, and cayenne.  In a dry small heavy skillet or saucepan cook sugar over moderate heat, stirring with a fork, until melted and cook, without stirring, swirling skillet or pan, until a golden caramel.

Add pecan mixture and stir to coat nuts with caramel.  Spoon praline onto a sheet of foil and cool.  Transfer praline to a cutting board and chop fine.  Praline can be made 3 days ahead and kept in an airtight container.

Remove tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary and halve any large scallops.  On a sheet of waxed paper combine flour, salt, cumin and cayenne and dip flat sides of each scallop into mixture to coat, knocking off excess.

In a skillet heat butter and olive oil over moderately-high heat until foam subsides and saute scallops, flat-sides down, until golden and just cooked through, about 2 minutes on each flat side.  Remove skillet from heat and cool scallops slightly.

In a large bowl whisk together lemon juice, extra-virgin olive oil, mustard, and salt and pepper, to taste, until emulsified.  Peel and pit avocado and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges.  Cut wedges in half crosswise and add to dressing.  Add scallops with any liquid remaining in skillet, tatsoi, and praline and gently toss to coat.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Fish (Ocean)
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  mustard oil
  6        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  8        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  wasabi powder
  1 1/2    tablespoons  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  yuzu kosho, red
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
  12            ounces  yellowfin tuna -- cleaned, and
                        diced into 1/4" cubes
  4        tablespoons  finely-diced shallots
  6        tablespoons  finely-sliced chives
                        Seaweed Salad -- (see below)
  18                    Gaufrette Potatoes -- (see below)
  3             ounces  paddlefish roe -- (optional)
                        === SESAME SEAWEED SALAD ===
  2             ounces  dried wakame seaweed
     1/3           cup  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  toasted sesame oil
     1/2           cup  soy oil
  2              small  red chile peppers -- seeds removed,
                        and cut into thin strips
  4        tablespoons  sesame seeds -- toasted
                        === GAUFRETTE POTATOES ===
  2              large  baking potatoes, like russets
  2        tablespoons  clarified butter

Combine the mustard, vegetable, and extra-virgin olive oils in a cup with a pour spout.

In a mixing bowl, combine the wasabi, lemon juice, rice vinegar, Dijon mustard, yuzu kosho and soy sauce, and whisk well.  Slowly add the oils, whisking constantly to emulsify.  Taste for seasoning, add salt, and set aside.

Place tuna in a glass or stainless steel bowl.  Add the shallots and chives, and toss gently to combine.  Drizzle about half of the vinaigrette over the tuna, and mix well.  Let the tartar sit for 2 minutes; taste for seasoning, and add more of the vinaigrette or salt, to taste.  Leftover vinaigrette will keep, refrigerated, for 1 week.

To serve:  Shape 1/6 of the tuna tartare into a disc and place it in the center of a serving plate.  Arrange 3 dollops of Sesame Seaweed Salad around the disc and garnish with 3 Gaufrette Potato slices.  Top tuna with a small spoonful of caviar, if desired.

For the Sesame Seaweed Salad:  Place the wakame in a mixing bowl, and soak it in tepid water for 20 to 30 minutes.  Remove from water, squeeze dry, and trim away the tough spine.  Cut into thin strips, and place in a large mixing bowl.

In a separate bowl, combine the vinegar, salt, sugar, and both oils.  Pour the dressing over the wakame, add the chile peppers, and toss.  Sprinkle with the sesame seeds.

For the Gaufrette Potatoes:  Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.  Peel the potatoes, and using a mandolin for best results (you can thinly slice with a knife, but you will not get the criss-cross pattern which makes these potatoes unique), slice them thin in a criss-cross pattern with the zig-zag part of a mandolin.  Lay the slices onto a non-stick sheet pan, not overlapping, and brush them with clarified butter.  Bake until crisp, about 12 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 appetizer servings.
