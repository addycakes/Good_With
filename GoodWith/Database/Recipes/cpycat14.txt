Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  4                     egg whites
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  milk
  8             ounces  white chocolate -- cut into chunks
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  powdered sugar
     1/4           cup  cream cheese -- softened
  2        tablespoons  maple syrup
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === SERVING ===
  8             scoops  vanilla ice cream
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

To make the blondie cake, whip the egg whites until they are stiff and form peaks.  Add softened butter, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, and vanilla and mix with an electric mixer until smooth.

In a separate bowl sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix well until smooth.  Mix in milk, white chocolate chunks, and walnuts.

Pour ingredients into a greased 9- by 13-inch baking pan and bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until cake is golden brown on top.  Slice cake into 8 equal slices when cool.

While cake bakes, combine all ingredients for the sauce in a medium bowl with an electric mixer.

To prepare dessert, heat a skillet in a hot oven for 10 to 15 minutes (you can also serve the dessert on a plate).  Arrange the cake on the skillet or plate.  Heat up the sauce for 30 to 60 seconds in the microwave until hot.  Place a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the cake, then drizzle some of the sauce over the top, followed by a tablespoon of chopped walnuts.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  For Applebee's regulars, this dessert is a favorite, and the clone has become a top request here at TSR.  In a hot skillet comes a delicious slice of white chocolate and walnut cake with a scoop of ice cream on top and warm maple butter sauce drizzled over the top.  Ooh, baby!

To recreate this pile of pleasure at home you start by making the cake from scratch.  For the white chocolate, get a couple of 4-ounce bars or one 8-ounce bar and chop it into chunks.  White chocolate chunks work best in this recipe, but you can certainly use white chocolate chips in a pinch.

While the blondie cake is baking, whip up the sauce.  The sauce will be fluffy at first.  But when you're ready to serve the dessert, zap the sauce in the microwave until it's hot and creamy.  Pile the decadent thing up in a hot skillet and serve it sizzling to happy, drooling mouths.

While the blondie cake is baking, whip up the sauce.  The sauce will be fluffy at first.  But when you&apos;re ready to serve the dessert, zap the sauce in the microwave until it&apos;s hot and creamy.  Pile the decadent thing up in a hot skillet and serve it sizzling to happy, drooling mouths.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10              cups  clam juice
  2             pounds  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, diced
  4             pounds  fresh or frozen clams -- shelled, diced
     1/4         pound  salt pork -- diced
  2              small  onions -- diced
  1                cup  butter
  1                cup  flour
  2              pints  half-and-half
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1               dash  hot pepper sauce
  1               dash  Worcestershire sauce

Bring the potatoes and the clam juice to the boil.  Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the clams and any of their liquid.  Cook about 5 minutes.  Set aside.

Add the pork to a sautÈ pan and cook over low heat until rendered.  Add the onions and cook until transparent.  Add the butter and allow it to melt.  Add the flour and cook until slightly colored.  Add a bit more flour if necessary if the mixture is too soft.

Bring the clams, juice and potatoes back to the boil.  Gradually stir in the cooked roux.  Bring to a rolling boil to thicken.  Stir continuously while cooking.

Beat the half-and-half and add to the soup.  It may not be necessary to use all the half-and-half; the soup should be thick.  Adjust the seasoning and add a dash of hot pepper sauce and Worcestershire sauce before serving.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SABAYON-MASCARPONE ===
  12            ounces  mascarpone cheese
  5                     egg yolks
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  marsala wine
     2/3           cup  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === SABAYON TOPPING SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  Marsala wine
                        === Espresso Rum Mixture ===
  1 1/2           cups  coffee
  1 1/2           cups  dark rum
                        === WHIPPED CREAM ===
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        === TIRAMISU ===
  20                    ladyfinger cookies
  2        tablespoons  shaved chocolate

For the Sabayon-Mascarpone Mixture:  In a medium mixing bowl, beat Mascarpone with a spatula until smooth and creamy.  Set aside and allow Mascarpone to warm up to room temperature (up to 1 hour).

In another medium mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, 4 tablespoons of the sugar, and the Marsala and whisk until blended.  Transfer the mixture to the top half of a double boiler and place it over simmering water over medium high heat.  With a whisk, beat the mixture until it triples in volume (5 minutes).  Remove from heat, cover, and chill thoroughly in the refrigerator (30 minutes).

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the cream, 2 tablespoons sugar, and vanilla extract.  Beat with an electric beater until peaks form.  Using a spatula fold whipped cream mixture into Mascarpone.  Then gently fold the egg mixture into the whipped cream-mascarpone mixture.  Cover and refrigerate.

For the Sabayon Topping Sauce:  In a mixing bowl, stir 1 cup of the Sabayon-Mascarpone mixture and the Marsala.  Cover and refrigerate.

For the Espresso Rum Mixture:  In a small bowl, mix the rum and espresso.  Cover and refrigerate.

For the Whipped Cream:  In a mixing bowl, combine the cream, sugar, and vanilla extract.  Beat with a beater until soft peaks form.

For the Tiramisu:  In a mixing bowl, fold 1 cup of the Sabayon-Mascarpone mixture into 1/2 cup of the whipped cream.  Spread a small amount of this mixture into the bottom of a 10- by  6-inch baking dish, forming a 1/8-inch deep layer.

Dip 10 of the ladyfingers into the espresso mixture (only for 2 seconds).  Transfer to a dry surface.  Gently press the soaked ladyfingers into the layer of sabayon whipped cream.  Spread the remaining sabayon whipped cream over the soaked ladyfingers and gently tap the pan to release any air bubbles.  Smooth the surface with a spatula.

In the same way, soak the remaining ladyfingers and arrange them in the baking dish.  Spread the remaining Sabayon-Mascarpone mixture over the second layer of ladyfingers.  Smooth the surface with a spatula.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 12 hours.

Transfer the mixture to the top half of a double boiler and place it over simmering water over medium high heat.  With a whisk, beat the mixture until it triples in volume (5 minutes).  Remove from heat, cover, and chill thoroughly in the refrigerator (30 minutes).

For the Tiramisu:  In a mixing bowl, fold 1 cup of the Sabayon-Mascarpone mixture into 1/2 cup of the whipped cream.  Spread a small amount of this mixture into the bottom of a 10- by  6-inch baking dish, forming a 1/8-inch deep layer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dip 10 of the ladyfingers into the espresso mixture (only for 2 seconds).  Transfer to a dry surface.  Gently press the soaked ladyfingers into the layer of sabayon whipped cream.  Spread the remaining sabayon whipped cream over the soaked ladyfingers and gently tap the pan to release any air bubbles.  Smooth the surface with a spatula.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the same way, soak the remaining ladyfingers and arrange them in the baking dish.  Spread the remaining Sabayon-Mascarpone mixture over the second layer of ladyfingers.  Smooth the surface with a spatula.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 12 hours.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COOKIE CRUST ===
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
  1               dash  salt
  1                     egg
  1 1/2           cups  flour
                        === FILLING ===
  5           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- softened
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
     1/3           cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  flour
  3                     eggs

Leave the butter and cream cheese out of the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes to soften.  Make the crust by creaming together butter, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and salt.  Add 1 egg and mix well.  Add 1 1/2 cups flour and stir well to combine.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees, then press half of the dough onto the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.  Bake for 5 to 7 minutes or until edge of dough begins to turn light brown.  Cool.

When the pan has cooled, take the remaining dough and press it around the inside edge of the pan.  Don't go all the way up to the top though.  Leave about a 1/2-inch margin from the top of the pan.

Crank oven up to 500 degrees.  Combine cream cheese, 1 1/3 cups sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla and lemon juice with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth.  Mix in sour cream and 2 tablespoons flour.  Add the eggs and mix on slow speed until combined.

Pour cream cheese filing into the pan and bake at 500 degrees for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350 and bake for 30 to 35 minutes more, or until the center is firm.  Cover and cool in refrigerator for several hours or overnight before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Carnegie Deli's huge pastrami sandwiches were selected as the best in New York by New York Magazine in 1975, but it's the cheesecakes, which can be shipped anywhere in the country, that really put this famous deli on the map.  The secret to cloning a traditional New York cheesecake is in creating the perfect not-too-sweet sugar cookie crust, and varying the cooking temperature so that we get a nicely browned top.  This clone for the best New York-style cheesecake around is our special tribute this week to a great American city.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         Ounce  clarified butter
  3             pieces  veal scaloppine - (2 oz ea) -- pounded thin
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Flour -- to dust
  1              ounce  chicken stock
  3             ounces  mushroom marsala sauce
  1           teaspoon  finely chopped parsley

Heat clarified butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat.  Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper on both sides and lightly dust with flour.

When butter is hot, add the veal slices and brown on both sides approximately 45 seconds.  Pour off the fat from the pan and add the chicken stock, scraping up any residue from the bottom of the pan.

Return the pan to the stove and lower the heat.  Add the mushroom marsala sauce and parsley.  Cook just long enough to make a nice creamy sauce, turning and coating the veal slices.

Shingle slices of veal and spoon sauce over veal.  Serve with choice of side.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Points To Remember:

~ Light dust of flour

~ Clarified butter must be hot in order for veal to brown properly

~ Veal must be floured just before going into the pan.  If it is floured too soon, the moisture in the veal will be drawn out by the flour

~ The veal must be started and finished in the same pan.  If you put the browned veal in a clean pan, you've lost all the flavor.  The de-glazing process is very important.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  Oreo cookies - (abt 1/2 lb) -- broken rough chunks
                        = (use the whole cookie, including the
                        white cream filling)
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        === FOR MOUSSE FILLING ===
  18            ounces  Nestle's semi-sweet chocolate bits
  6                     egg yolks
  5                     egg whites
  2               cups  heavy cream

To make the crust:  Place cookie chunks in the bowl of a food processor and process until you have crumbs.  Add the melted butter and process again until well mixed.

Spray a 9-inch spring-form pan with nonstick cooking spray.  Press the crumb mixture into the bottom of the pan and about 2 inches up the sides.  Freeze to set while you prepare the mousse filling.

To make the filling:  Place the chocolate bits in a heavy glass or ceramic bowl.  Microwave for 1 minute, then stir and microwave again until the chocolate has melted completely.  (If you prefer, you can place the chocolate in a bowl over a pot of water that is steaming -- but not boiling and let it melt, stirring occasionally.)  Stir the egg yolks into the melted chocolate.

Place the egg whites in a clean, dry mixing bowl.  Beat, using a wire whisk, until soft peaks form.  Fold the egg whites into the chocolate mix, one third at a time.

Place the cream in the mixing bowl you used for the egg whites and, using the wire whisk, beat the cream until it is stiff and not at all grainy.  Fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture.

Pour the mousse into the reserved crumb crust.  Freeze again until firm and set, about three or four hours.

To cut portions cleanly, use a sharp knife.  Dip the knife into hot water and dry it off before you make each slice.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR PIZZA DOUGH ===
  3               cups  all-purpose flour - (to 3 1/2)
  1            package  yeast
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  hot water -- (125 degrees)
  2         tablespoon  olive oil
                        === FOR TOPPING ===
  1              ounce  sweet barbecue sauce
  4             ounces  mozzarella cheese -- shredded
  1              ounce  red onion -- julienned
  3             ounces  chicken -- cooked
  1              ounce  Gouda cheese -- shredded

For Pizza Dough:  Combine 2 cups all-purpose flour, undissolved yeast and salt into a mixing bowl.  Stir the water and the olive oil into the dry ingredients and then slowly add enough of the remaining flour to soften the dough.  Place dough on a floured surface and knead approximately 6 minutes until smooth and elastic.  Divide dough into two equal portions and roll each piece into a ball.  Cover and let stand until the dough rises and is soft enough to stretch.  Stretch the dough into round shape and top with desired toppings.

Assembly:  Top the stretched dough in order beginning with the barbecue sauce.  Place the pizza on a pizza stone in the oven at 400 degrees and bake until golden brown.

This recipe yields 2 individual-size pizzas.

                      El Pollo Loco's Avocado Salsa

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salsa

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     ripe avocado
  1                     jalapeÒo -- stemmed, quartered
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  white distilled vinegar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  diced onion

Combine avocado, jalapeÒo, water, vinegar and salt in a food processor.  Puree the mixture for several seconds on high speed, or until jalapeÒo is finely minced.

Pour mixture into a medium bowl.  Stir in cilantro and onion.  Cover and chill until ready to serve.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 cups.

Comments:  This creamy green sauce is available at the salsa bar at each of the 300 El Pollo Loco outlets located throughout the western U.S., and folks are going crazy over it.  The problem is, you can only get it at the restaurants in small quantities -- time to put on our kitchen cloning hat.

Use a food processor to mix this one up (everything but the cilantro and onion goes in there) and prepare for a delicious, spicy concoction that you can pour over your favorite homemade Mexican-style dishes, from tacos salads to fajitas.

Pancho Ochoa opened his first roadside chicken stand in Guasave, Mexico in 1975, and now El Pollo Loco is the number one quick-service, flame-broiled chicken chain in America.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
     1/2           cup  Crisco shortening
                        = (butter at room temperature
                        may also be used)
  5        tablespoons  water
                        === FOR APPLE COBBLER FILLING ===
  2 1/2         pounds  sour cream
  3                     eggs
  3               cups  sugar
  2         tablespoon  vanilla
  1 1/2       teaspoon  salt
  12                    Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored
                        = (from an 88-count case)
                        === FOR APPLE COBBLER TOPPING ===
     1/2         pound  butter
     1/2         pound  margarine
  2 1/2           cups  flour
  1                cup  brown sugar
                        = (preferably Dixie Crystals dark brown)
  1                cup  sugar
  3         tablespoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  8             ounces  walnuts -- coarsely chopped
                        === FOR CINNAMON SUGAR MIX ===
  4               cups  sugar
  1                cup  cinnamon

For Dough:  In a suitable container, combine flour, sugar and salt.  Mix thoroughly.  Cut in the shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Sprinkle water, 1 tablespoon at a time, over flour mixture and toss lightly until mixture holds together.  Press mixture together to form a ball.  Let rest for 30 minutes.

For Apple Cobbler Filling:  Peel apples using a peeler or a paring knife.  Cut apples in half lengthwise (from top to bottom) and core out the center portion containing the seeds.  Cut apples into quarter slices.  Keep apples in water with a touch of lemon juice so that apples do not brown.  When ready to use, remove from liquid and dry.  Whisk sour cream and eggs in large bowl.  Add remaining dry ingredients and whisk until well blended.  Add sliced apples and reserve filling until ready to bake.

For Apple Cobbler Topping:  Cut butter and margarine into cubes.  Pulse in food processor with flour until mixture becomes crumbly.  Do not over mix.  Place flour mixture in a container and add remaining ingredients.  Toss mixture until ingredients are combined.

For Cinnamon Sugar Mix:  Measure and place in suitable container.  Combine sugar and cinnamon until thoroughly mixed.  Put in proper container.  Label, date and store in cool, dry area.

To Assemble:  Place cobbler dough in full hotel pan, making sure the bottom is fully covered.  Pour cobbler filling into hotel pan and distribute ingredients evenly.  Place hotel pan in 350 degree convection oven on low fan for 45 minutes.  Remove hotel pan from convection oven and sprinkle cobbler topping evenly over the filling.  Return hotel pan into 350 degree convection oven for an additional 10 minutes.  Remove and allow product to cool and set up prior to cutting.

Note:  Cut into 3-inch-by-5-inch portions per hotel pan.

This recipe yields 15 servings.

For Dough:  In a suitable container, combine flour, sugar and salt.  Mix thoroughly.  Cut in the shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Sprinkle water, 1 tablespoon at a time, over flour mixture and toss lightly until mixture holds together.  Press mixture together to form a ball.  Let rest for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Apple Cobbler Filling:  Peel apples using a peeler or a paring knife.  Cut apples in half lengthwise (from top to bottom) and core out the center portion containing the seeds.  Cut apples into quarter slices.  Keep apples in water with a touch of lemon juice so that apples do not brown.  When ready to use, remove from liquid and dry.  Whisk sour cream and eggs in large bowl.  Add remaining dry ingredients and whisk until well blended.  Add sliced apples and reserve filling until ready to bake.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Apple Cobbler Topping:  Cut butter and margarine into cubes.  Pulse in food processor with flour until mixture becomes crumbly.  Do not over mix.  Place flour mixture in a container and add remaining ingredients.  Toss mixture until ingredients are combined.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For Cinnamon Sugar Mix:  Measure and place in suitable container.  Combine sugar and cinnamon until thoroughly mixed.  Put in proper container.  Label, date and store in cool, dry area.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To Assemble:  Place cobbler dough in full hotel pan, making sure the bottom is fully covered.  Pour cobbler filling into hotel pan and distribute ingredients evenly.  Place hotel pan in 350 degree convection oven on low fan for 45 minutes.  Remove hotel pan from convection oven and sprinkle cobbler topping evenly over the filling.  Return hotel pan into 350 degree convection oven for an additional 10 minutes.  Remove and allow product to cool and set up prior to cutting.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Cut into 3-inch-by-5-inch portions per hotel pan.

                 Joe's Crab Shack's Garlic King Crab Legs

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  2              large  garlic heads -- separate and
                        peel all cloves
  2             pounds  king crab legs
  2          teaspoons  dried parsley flakes
                        === ON THE SIDE ===
                        Melted butter

Fill a large pot halfway with water.  Add oil and bring to a boil.  Separate and peel the garlic cloves.  Crush all of the garlic cloves with a mallet and then chop them up real well with a knife.  When the water and oil comes to a boil add the garlic and boil for 15 minutes.

Cut the crab legs in half so that they will fit into the pot.  Use the handle end of nut cracker or wooden spoon to poke several holes in the shell of each crab leg.  This will allow the flavor of the garlic to seep into the crab.  Lower the crab into the pot and boil for 5 to 6 minutes.

Remove crab legs and drain.  Arrange one pound of crab on each plate.  Sprinkle crabs legs with parsley flakes and serve with melted butter on the side.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  These legs from the king of crabs come already cooked and usually previously frozen, so we won't have to boil them long to finish them off.  But we do want to give them a long enough bath to get the flavor of garlic into the meat.  To aid in this process we need to poke several holes in the shell along each leg so that the garlic water can seep in.  Use the handle end of a nut cracker (the kind that is often serve with crab to help crack the shells), or the end of a wooden spoon to make those holes.  Pound the garlic cloves flat before chopping them up so that the maximum flavor will be released into the boiling water.

                         KFC's Cajun Honey Wings

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  ketchup
  1                cup  water
     3/4           cup  white vinegar
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/3                honey
  4          teaspoons  Chef Paul Prudhomme's Meat Magic
  1         tablespoon  minced canned green chilies
  1 1/4      teaspoons  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  liquid smoke (hickory flavor)
     1/8      teaspoon  dried thyme
                        === BATTER AND WINGS ===
  6               cups  vegetable shortening - (to 8)
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1                cup  milk
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  MSG (Accent Flavor Enhancer)
  20                    chicken wing pieces

Combine the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Stir until ingredients are well combined and bring to a boil.  Then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes or until thickened.

As sauce is simmering, heat up 6 to 8 cups of shortening in a deep fryer set to 350 degrees.

Combine the beaten egg with the milk in a small bowl.  In another small bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper, and MSG.

When shortening is hot, dip each wing first in the flour mixture, then into the milk and egg mixture, and back into the flour.  Arrange wings on a plate until each one is coated with batter.

Fry the wings in the shortening for 9 to 12 minutes or until light golden brown.  If you have a small fryer, you may wish to fry 10 of the wings at a time.  Drain on paper towels or a rack.

When the sauce is done, brush the entire surface of each wing with a coating of sauce.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings (20 wings).

Comments:  When the "Limited time only" signs come down for this one, we'll all smile.  Because now we've got a clone recipe that'll closely duplicate the sweet and spicy sauce on these amazing chicken wings.  The Colonel's people coat the wings with a KFC-style breading before frying them up and adding the Cajun sauce.  But you don't need wings to put this sauce to work.  This recipe makes 1 cup of the sauce that you can use to coat beef, pork or other chicken parts.  This recipe requires the meat variety of Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning Blends, but it will also work with other Cajun seasoning blends available in most markets.

<DirT>
Combine the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Stir until ingredients are well combined and bring to a boil.  Then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes or until thickened.
</DirT>
<DirT>
As sauce is simmering, heat up 6 to 8 cups of shortening in a deep fryer set to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the beaten egg with the milk in a small bowl.  In another small bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper, and MSG.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When shortening is hot, dip each wing first in the flour mixture, then into the milk and egg mixture, and back into the flour.  Arrange wings on a plate until each one is coated with batter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fry the wings in the shortening for 9 to 12 minutes or until light golden brown.  If you have a small fryer, you may wish to fry 10 of the wings at a time.  Drain on paper towels or a rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When the sauce is done, brush the entire surface of each wing with a coating of sauce.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings (20 wings).

Comments:  When the &quot;Limited time only&quot; signs come down for this one, we&apos;ll all smile.  Because now we&apos;ve got a clone recipe that&apos;ll closely duplicate the sweet and spicy sauce on these amazing chicken wings.  The Colonel&apos;s people coat the wings with a KFC-style breading before frying them up and adding the Cajun sauce.  But you don&apos;t need wings to put this sauce to work.  This recipe makes 1 cup of the sauce that you can use to coat beef, pork or other chicken parts.  This recipe requires the meat variety of Paul Prudhomme&apos;s Magic Seasoning Blends, but it will also work with other Cajun seasoning blends available in most markets.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     Lipton tea bags - (regular size)
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  Kool-Aid lemonade unsweetened drink mix

Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil in a large saucepan.  Add the tea bags and remove the pan from the heat.  Let the tea steep for at least and hour.

Pour the granulated sugar and Kool-Aid drink mix into a 2-quart pitcher.  Add the tea and stir so that the sugar dissolves.  Add additional water if necessary to bring the tea to the 2-quart mark on the pitcher.  Chill well before serving.

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

Comments:  Here's a great technique for recreating the lemony zing in a can of Brisk Iced Tea that'll make those angry little celebrity puppets even angrier.  Kool-Aid lemonade drink mix has the perfect mixture of citric acid and lemon juice solids to help us whip this one up effortlessly just in time for the warm months ahead.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Sandwiches


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  cooked white chicken meat -- cubed
  1 1/2         pounds  chopped frozen spinach -- thawed
  1                     box Knorr vegetable soup mix - (1.4 oz)
  1                cup  mayonnaise

Add chicken to the bowl of a food processor; pulse 5 to 6 times to chop.  Place thawed spinach in a sieve.  Press, drain, squeeze and extract most of the moisture from the spinach.  It should be "wet to the touch and dry to the eyes," says Chef Guerrero.

Put spinach and Knorr soup mix in a large mixing bowl.  Mix well with "sanitized" hands.  Make sure there is no visible soup mix powder; it should be absorbed completely into the spinach.  Add the chopped chicken meat and mayonnaise to the spinach mixture and incorporate thoroughly.  Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours to allow the dehydrated vegetables to soften and for the flavors to meld.  The mixture will keep in the refrigerator for up to five days.

Serve on sourdough bread with alfalfa sprouts and tomato.

This recipe yields about 5 cups filling.

                     Maid-Rite's Loose Meat Sandwich

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground beef
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
  4                     plain hamburger buns
                        Yellow mustard -- as needed
                        Minced onion -- as needed
                        Dill pickle slices -- as needed

Brown ground beef in a large skillet over medium-low heat.  As the meat cooks use a wooden spoon (or a potato masher) to chop the meat into fine, rice-size pieces.  Drain fat.

Add salt and pepper and continue to stir over low heat for 5 more minutes.

Build each sandwich by pressing the hot ground beef into a 1/2 cup measuring cup.  Dump the meat onto the bottom of a plain hamburger bun.  Add mustard on the top bun, along with pickles and minced onion if desired.  Top off the sandwich, then heat it up in your microwave oven for 10 to 15 seconds to warm the buns.  Serve with a spoon as they do in the restaurants.

This recipe yields 4 sandwiches.

Comments:  It's been an Iowa tradition since 1926 and one of our long-time requested items at TSR.  Even TV comedienne Roseanne and her Iowa native ex-husband Tom Arnold spoke many salivating praises of Maid-Rites when they shared a home together in the state.  There are now 83 Maid-Rite stores located throughout Iowa and seven other Midwestern states.

Although the sandwich is not much more than a traditional hamburger with the ground beef arranged uncompressed on the bun, the product has a huge cult following.  And since the meat is loose, the sandwich is served with a spoon for scooping up the ground beef that will inevitably fall out.

This Top Secret Recipe isn't so much about ingredients as it is about technique.  You want to be sure to chop the ground beef thoroughly as it cooks so that you get tiny rice-size pieces.  Then when you build your sandwich, you firmly press the beef into a 1/2-cup measuring cup.  Dump the meat onto the bottom of plain hamburger bun; add your choice of mustard, onions, and pickles; ready a spoon, and dig in.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
     1/2           cup  salted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
     1/4           cup  confectioners' sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  flour
                        === CREAM CHEESE FILLING ===
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  confectioners' sugar
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  lemon extract
                        === LEMON CURD ===
  4              large  egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     3/4           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  salted butter -- softened
                        === TOPPING ===
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar

Preheat oven to 325.

Prepare the shortbread crust:  Cream butter and sugar in medium bowl with electric mixer set on high speed.  Add vanilla and mix until combined.  Add flour and mix at low speed until fully incorporated.

Press dough evenly into bottom of an 8- by 8-inch baking pan.  Refrigerate until firm, approximately 30 minutes.

Prick shortbread crust with fork and bake for 30 minutes or until crust turns golden brown.  Cool on rack to room temperature.

Prepare the cream cheese filling while the crust is baking:  Beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth in medium bowl with electric mixer set on high speed.  Add egg and lemon extract and beat on medium speed until light and smooth.  Cover bowl tightly and refrigerate.

Prepare the lemon curd:  Blend the egg yolks with cornstarch and sugar in medium non-aluminum saucepan.  Place over low heat and slowly whisk in water and lemon juice.  Increase heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Remove from heat.  Add lemon peel and butter and cool for 10 minutes.

Assemble the bars:  Sread chilled cream cheese filling evenly over cooled shortbread crust with spatula.  Spread lemon curd evenly over cream cheese filling.  Place pan in center of oven.  Bake 30 to 40 minutes or until edges begin to turn light golden brown.  Cool to room temperature on rack.  Chill in refrigerator 1 hour before cutting into bars.  Dust top with confectioners' sugar.

                  O'Charley's Restaurant's Beef Monterey

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  salad oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  7             ounces  marinated beef tips
                        Seasoning salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  freshly-sliced mushrooms - (1/4" hand cut)
     1/2           cup  julienne red onion - (1/4" by 2 1/2")
  1              ounce  Burgundy wine
  4             ounces  rice pilaf
  1              slice  Monterey Jack cheese
  1              piece  kale - (fist size) -- for garnish
                        Sprinkle of chopped parsley -- for garnish

Note:  You will also need an 8 ounce rarebit dish and a larger dinner dish.

Ladle 1 ounce of oil into heated sautÈ pan.  Add minced garlic and cook for 10 seconds.  Place 7 ounces of beef tips into pan and generously season with seasoning salt.  After tips have cooked for 1 1/2 minutes, add vegetables.  When vegetables are 50% done, add burgundy wine.  Cook tips to medium doneness.  If you're cooking beef tips medium-well or well done, do not add garlic until wine is added because garlic will burn.

When tips are done, portion rice into bottom of a large rarebit dish and place tips and veggies on top of rice.  Do not drain.

Place a slice of Monterey Jack cheese over tips, covering beef tips completely.  Tuck the cheese around the beef tips so it is contained within the dish.  Place rarebit dish into a cheese melter, broiler, or oven.  Carefully remove dish when cheese is completely melted.

Serve rarebit on dinner dish.  Garnish with a fist size piece of kale and a sprinkle of parsley and serve.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

                           Old Bay Seasoning II

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Spice Blends

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  celery salt
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1              pinch  ground dry mustard
  1              pinch  mace
  1              pinch  cinnamon
  1              pinch  cardamom
  1              pinch  allspice
  1              pinch  ground clove
  1              pinch  ginger

Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.  Store in a sealed container.

This recipe yields 4 teaspoons.

Comments:  With spice grinder in hand, Gustav Brunn traveled to America from Germany, and settled down in Baltimore on the Chesapeake Bay.  There on the bay steamed crabs are a staple.  So Gustav started grinding.  In 1939 Gustav found just the right mix for his top secret blend of spices that for generations would be the most used seasoning on steamed crabs, shrimp, lobster and other tasty seafood dishes.  But the celery salt-based blend is not just for seafood, according to McCormick & Co., which purchased Old Bay in 1990.  You can also use the blend on chicken, French fries, popcorn, baked potatoes, deviled eggs, hamburgers, and even pizza.  If you've got a recipe that requires Old Bay, but don't have any in the cupboard, head to the spice cabinet and throw these ingredients together to make the perfect clone.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  white milk
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  grated imported Parmesan cheese
     1/2           cup  grated imported Romano cheese
  6                     fresh jumbo egg yolks
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat the milk and cream in a heavy bottom saucepan until it comes to a simmer.  Slowly whip in all the cheese, then remove from heat.

In a separate bowl, place the egg yolks and slowly whip in a portion of the hot milk and cream mixture.  Slowly add the egg yolk mixture back into the remaining cream mixture.  (This will increase the temperature of the egg yolks which is called tempering.)  Season to taste with the salt and fresh cracked black pepper.  Refrigerate until needed or heat, stirring, until the sauce thickens to the desired consistency.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                      P. F. Chang's Garlic Snap Peas

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  fresh sugar snap peas
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced

Prepare snap peas by cutting off the tips on each end of the pods.

Preheat oil in a wok or medium skillet over medium/high heat.

SautÈ snap peas in oil with salt and black pepper for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes until peas are cooked, but still crispy.  The pods should have some dark brown spots developing on them when they're done.

Add minced garlic and stir well to combine.  Remove from heat immediately and serve.  The garlic should not stay in the pan for longer than 15 to 20 seconds or it could burn and turn bitter.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Comments:  It's an awesome side dish at one of the country's hottest dinner chains, and it'll take you just minutes to clone at home as a side for any entrÈe you whip up.  You can use a wok if you've got one, but a medium skillet works fine.  The trick is to only sautÈ the peas until they are hot, but still crispy.  And you've got to watch the garlic closely when you add it.  If you cook the garlic too long over high heat it'll burn and give an otherwise fab dish a big bummer of a bitter taste.

                    P. F. Chang's Orange Peel Chicken

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  4                     green onions -- sliced
  1                cup  tomato sauce
     1/2           cup  water
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  chili garlic sauce
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
                        === CHICKEN ===
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
  4                     chicken breast fillets
  1                     egg -- beaten
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  flour
                        Peel from 1/4 orange -- julienned
                        = (into 1/8"-thick strips)

Prepare sauce by heating 1 tablespoon of oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add minced garlic and sliced green onions.  Add tomato sauce and water quickly before the garlic burns.  Add sugar, chili garlic sauce and soy sauce and bring to a boil.  Simmer 5 to 6 minutes or until sauce thickens, then turn off the heat.

Prepare the chicken by heating 1/2 cup oil in a wok over medium heat.  Slice chicken breast fillets into bite-size pieces.

Combine beaten egg with milk in a medium bowl.  Pour the flour into another medium bowl.  Coat chicken pieces by dropping them into the flour a few at a time, then into the egg/milk mixture and back into the flour.  Arrange coated chicken on a plate until all chicken is coated.

When oil in the wok is hot, add about half of the chicken to the oil and cook for a couple minutes or until brown on one side, then flip the chicken over.  When chicken is golden brown, remove the pieces to a rack or paper towels to drain.  Repeat with the remaining chicken.  When all of the chicken is cooked rinse the oil out of the wok with water and place it back on the stove to heat up.

When wok is hot again add julienned orange peel and chicken.  Heat for 20 to 30 seconds or so, stirring gently.  Add sauce to the pan and cook for about 2 minutes.  Stir dish a couple times but do it gently so you don't knock the coating off the chicken.  Cook until the sauce thickens then serve up the dish with white or brown rice on the side.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

Comments:  Cloning the addicting sweet sauce, which gets a spicy zing from chili garlic sauce, is the key to recreating the flavors that hook diners at America's hippest Chinese bistro chain.  You'll find chili garlic sauce near the Asian foods in your supermarket -- the rest of the sauce ingredients includes common stuff.  Slice the orange peel into thin julienne strips before adding it to the dish.  Since the flavor from the peel is so strong, we won't need to add it until the end.  Cook up some white or brown rice to serve alongside this dish and get the chopsticks ready.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PIE ===
  1                     sweet potato (abt 1 lb)
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  salted butter -- melted
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1              large  egg
  1                     prepared pie crust - (10" dia)
  4               cups  pecan halves
                        === FOR THE SYRUP MIX ===
  1                cup  dark corn syrup
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1         tablespoon  vanilla
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  1              pinch  salt
  3                     eggs

To make the sweet potato mix:  Prick sweet potato with a fork, wrap in plastic wrap and microwave for 10 minutes.  (Or you can bake in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour.)  Cool potato to room temperature and peel.  In an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, combine sweet potato, brown sugar, granulated sugar, butter, cinnamon and egg.  Mix on medium speed for 10 minutes and reserve.

To make the syrup mix:  In an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, combine corn syrup, granulated sugar, brown sugar, butter, vanilla, lemon juice and salt.  Mix on medium speed for 10 minutes.  Add the eggs and whip for an additional 10 minutes on medium speed and reserve.

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees:  Line a 10-inch pie plate with pie crust.  Spread a 1/4-inch thick layer of sweet potato mix across the bottom of the crust.  Add pecan halves and pour pie syrup over pecans to just fill the shell (do not over-fill).  Let the pie sit for 2 to 3 minutes to allow the syrup to settle.  Bake for 2 hours, or until pie sets in the center.  Remove from oven and cool at room temperature.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Per serving:  663 calories (percent of calories from fat, 55), 7 grams protein, 74 grams carbohydrates, 5 grams fiber, 41 grams fat, 87 milligrams cholesterol, 198 milligrams sodium.

Comments:  Pappadeaux's corporate office was kind enough to share the recipe for this truly yummy pie.  It couldn't come at a better time, with memories of an amazing Super Bowl and New Orleans cuisine fresh in our minds.  A standing mixer is highly recommended, as more than 30 minutes of mixing is involved.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                     box Jiffy Mix yellow cake mix -- prepared as directed
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
  5        tablespoons  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/4           cups  whole milk
  3                     egg yolks -- beaten
     1/3           cup  lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  8             ounces  Cool Whip -- thawed

For the Crust:  Crumble cooled prepared cake and measure 2 cups of crumbs, patting crumbs lightly down when measuring.  Place crumbs in small bowl and mix in the sugar.

Spray a 9-inch pie pan with Pam and pat cake crumbs in pie pan on the bottom and up the sides.  Place pie crust in a preheated 275 degrees oven for 7 minutes.  Watch crust carefully so the crumbs will not scorch.  When done, remove and cool crust.

For the Filling:  In a 2-quart sauce pan mix sugar, flour, salt and milk.  Bring ingredients to a low boil and cook for two or three minutes, stirring constantly, until filling becomes thick.  Remove pan from heat and add 1/2 cup of hot mixture to beaten egg yolks and whisk together.

Place filling back on stove at a low heat and slowly pour egg yolks into filling while whisking together.  Pour lemon juice and vanilla into filling and bring to a soft boil and cook for two to three minutes longer.

When filling is thick, remove from heat and set aside to cool.  The filling may be poured into the crust while still a little warm but not hot.

Place pie in refrigerator for several hours to set and chill completely.  When chilled, top with Cool Whip and sprinkle the two tablespoons of crumbled cake crumbs over the top.  Garnish with fresh lemon zest.

  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- cold
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
     1/4           cup  milk
                        === TO BRUSH ON TOP ===
  2        tablespoons  butter -- melted

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Mix together flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a medium bowl.

Slice cold butter into cubes and use a pastry knife or potato masher to cut butter into dry mixture until no large chunks of butter remain.

Add buttermilk and milk and stir with a spoon until dough forms.  Roll out to 1/2-inch thick on a floured surface.

Cut biscuits with a 3-inch biscuit cutter and arrange on a lightly-greased or parchment paper-lined baking sheet.  Bake for 22 to 24 minutes or until tops begin to turn light brown.  Remove biscuits from the oven and cool for a couple of minutes, then brush each biscuit top with melted butter.

This recipe yields 10 biscuits.

Comments:  This year the number one Cajun-style restaurant celebrates its 30th birthday with 1,620 stores worldwide.  But Popeye's didn't start out with the name that most people associate with a certain spinach-eating cartoon character.  When Al Copeland opened his first Southern-fried chicken stand in New Orleans in 1972, it was called Chicken On The Run.  The name was later changed to "Popeyes" after Gene Hackman's character in the movie "The French Connection."  In addition to great spicy fried chicken, Popeyes serves up wonderful biscuits that we can now easily duplicate at home.  The secret is to cut cold butter into the mix with a pastry knife so that the biscuits turn out flaky and tender like the real deal.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1                     chicken gizzard
  2        tablespoons  minced green bell pepper
  2 1/2         ounces  ground beef - (1/4 cup)
  2 1/2         ounces  ground pork - (1/4 cup)
  2               cups  water
  1                can  Swanson beef broth - (14 oz)
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  flour
  2          teaspoons  milk
  2          teaspoons  distilled white vinegar
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/8      teaspoon  onion powder
  1               dash  dried parsley flakes

Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.  SautÈ chicken gizzard in the oil for 4 to 5 minutes until cooked.  Remove gizzard from the pan and let it cool so that you can handle it.  Finely mince the chicken gizzard.

Combine ground beef and ground pork in a small bowl.  Smash the meat together with your hands until it's well-mixed.  Add bell pepper to the pan and sautÈ it for 1 minute.  Add ground beef and pork to the pan and cook it until it's brown.  Use a potato masher to smash meat into tiny rice-size pieces as it browns.

Add water and beef broth to the pan.  Immediately whisk in cornstarch and flour.

Add remaining ingredients and bring the mixture to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer gravy for 30 to 35 minutes or until thick.

This recipe yields 3 cups.

Comments:  Chicken gizzard.  It took more than ten years to get around to cloning a recipe that absolutely requires chicken gizzard.  I've seen the official ingredients list for the Cajun gravy from Popeyes, and if we're gonna do this one right there's just got to be some gizzard in there.  Pour this delicious stuff over the Popeyes Buttermilk Biscuits clone from last week, or onto whatever begs to be swimming in pure flavor.  Cajun or not, get ready for some of the best gravy that's ever come off your stovetop.

                      Popeyes' Red Beans And Rice II

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beans                           Rice/Grains


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BEANS ===
  2             pounds  smoked ham hocks
  2               cans  red beans - (15 oz ea)
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  brown sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  garlic powder
  1               dash  onion powder
                        === RICE ===
  2 1/4           cups  water
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  converted rice

First you must render the fat from the smoked ham hocks.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees and place the ham hocks in a deep pan.  Cover pan with foil and bake for 4 to 5 hours or until 1/4 cup of fat has rendered from the hocks.

Combine 1/4 cup pork fat with one 15-ounce can red beans plus liquid in a medium saucepan.  Add 1/2 cup water, brown sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.  Use a potato masher to smash beans into a paste-like consistency.  Add entire contents of remaining can of beans to the mixture and cook for an additional 10 minutes.

Prepare rice for 4 servings.  For Uncle Ben's converted rice you bring 2 1/4 cups water to a boil.  Add 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Add 1 cup of rice, reduce heat to low and simmer rice for 20 minutes or until tender.

To prepare each serving scoop 1 cup of beans into a bowl.  Add 1 cup of rice on top of the beans and serve.

Comments:  I first created the clone for this recipe back in 1994 for the second TSR book, "More Top Secret Recipes" but I've never been absolutely pleased with the end result, and vowed to one day rework it.

After recently convincing a Popeyes manager to show me the ingredients written on the box of red bean mixture, I determined the only way to clone this one accurately is to include an important ingredient omitted from the first version: pork fat.  Emeril screams "pork fat rules" on his cooking show all the time, and now we get to play with the stuff here at TSR.

After some work, I found a good way to get the best flavor from the right type of fat is to render it from smoked ham hocks.  Ham hocks, which are pretty cheap at most markets, are placed in the oven for several hours so that the fat drains out.  There's your rendering.  As for the beans, find red beans (they're smaller than kidney beans) in two 15-ounce cans.  If you're having trouble tracking down red beans, red kidney beans will substitute splendidly.

First you must render the fat from the smoked ham hocks.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees and place the ham hocks in a deep pan.  Cover pan with foil and bake for 4 to 5 hours or until 1/4 cup of fat has rendered from the hocks.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine 1/4 cup pork fat with one 15-ounce can red beans plus liquid in a medium saucepan.  Add 1/2 cup water, brown sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.  Use a potato masher to smash beans into a paste-like consistency.  Add entire contents of remaining can of beans to the mixture and cook for an additional 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare rice for 4 servings.  For Uncle Ben&apos;s converted rice you bring 2 1/4 cups water to a boil.  Add 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Add 1 cup of rice, reduce heat to low and simmer rice for 20 minutes or until tender.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To prepare each serving scoop 1 cup of beans into a bowl.  Add 1 cup of rice on top of the beans and serve.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MEAT ===
  2             ounces  ground beef
  1                can  tomato sauce - (29 oz)
  5          teaspoons  granulated sugar
  4          teaspoons  olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced dried onions
  1 1/2      teaspoons  shredded romano cheese
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     bay leaf
                        === TOMATO, BASIL AND ITALIAN CHEESE ===
  1                can  tomato sauce - (29 oz)
     1/2           cup  canned diced tomatoes
  5          teaspoons  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  shredded romano cheese
  1           teaspoon  shredded parmesan cheese
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
     1/2      teaspoon  dried parsley
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     bay leaf

For the Meat Sauce:  Brown ground beef in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add remaining ingredients, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring often.  (Makes 2 1/2 cups)

For the Tomato, Basil And Italian Cheese Sauce:  Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring often.  (Makes 3 cups)

This recipe yields 2 1/2 to 3 cups.

Comments:  It's America's most popular pasta sauce and now you can whip up clones of two varieties at home at a fraction of the cost.  Just snag yourself a large can of tomato sauce and a few other common ingredients and get simmering.  These recipes duplicate the traditional "Meat" variety of the sauce and the newer "Chunky Garden Style" version with tomato, basil and Italian cheese.  Feel free to doctor these sauces up with your own creative additions just as many do to perk up real Ragu.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2            bottles  Skyy Vodka - (750 ml ea)
  1             bottle  Stoli Vanil Vodka - (750 ml)
  1             bottle  Malibu Rum - (750 ml)
  1                can  pineapple juice - (6 oz)
  1                cup  sugar
  1                     fresh pineapple -- sliced

Combine vodkas, Malibu rum, and pineapple juice in a large nozzled decanter or 5-quart jug.  Add sugar and stir until dissolved.

Slice the top and bottom off of a fresh pineapple.  Slice the pineapple in half then slice the halves in half to make quarters.  Cut the rind from each of the quarters, then slice the quarters into 1/2-inch thick slices.  This will make several bite-size wedges.  Add pineapple slices to decanter, and let mixture sit for 3 days.

To make the drink, shake 3 ounces of the martini blend with ice and strain into a chilled martini glass.  Garnish with one piece of pineapple from the decanter, speared on a toothpick.

This recipe yields about 36 servings.

Comments:  Roy Yamaguchi's national chain of Hawaiian fusion restaurants serves a martini that will have you singing "Tiny Bubbles" with your imaginary monkey friend Cecil.  Whole bottles of Skyy vodka, Stoli Vanil, and Malibu rum are dumped into a giant decanter along with some sugar and pineapple chunks.

After three days, when all the hunks of pineapple are floating, the cocktail's ready to be served -- shaken, not stirred -- in a chilled martini glass.  This is a perfect clone to prepare in advance of your next swinging cocktail party since the recipe makes around 36 drinks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BARBEQUE BUTTER ===
  1              pound  butter
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper - (scant)
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper - (scant)
  1 1/2       teaspoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  whole dried rosemary leaves
                        = (measured, then finely chopped)
  2             ounces  garlic -- finely chopped
  2           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  Tabasco sauce
  1 1/2       teaspoon  water
                        === SHRIMP ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1              pound  shrimp - (16-20 count) -- cleaned, peeled,
                        and deveined
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
                        Sourdough bread -- for serving

For Barbecue Butter:  Soften butter at room temperature to 70 to 80 degrees.  Place butter in mixing bowl; add pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, rosemary, garlic, Worcestershire, Tabasco, and water.  Whip on high speed 3 minutes or until thoroughly blended.  Refrigerate to 40 degrees.  The following shrimp recipe will use 1 cup of the butter; reserve extra for another use.  (Makes about 2 1/2 cups)

For Shrimp:  Pour olive oil in a hot sautÈ pan.  Add shrimp to the sautÈ pan and cook on one side for 1 to 2 minutes.  (Don't crowd; if necessary, use 2 pans.  A 12-inch pan will accommodate 1 pound of shrimp.)

Reduce heat to medium, turn shrimp, and add the chopped green onion.  Cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes.  Add white wine and cook until reduced to 1/4 cup.

Stir in 1 cup cold Barbecue Butter, reduce heat to low and cook and stir frequently until shrimp are just done (white throughout, moist and tender), approximately 1 1/2 minutes.  Take care not to overcook the shrimp.  Serve immediately in a bowl preheated to 160 degrees.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     Jello No-Bake Strawberry Cheesecake kit -- divided
  1                cup  milk
  3               cups  vanilla ice cream
     1/2           cup  strawberries and syrup
                        = (from the cheesecake kit)
  3        tablespoons  cheesecake mix powder
                        = (from the cheesecake kit)
                        === ON TOP ===
                        canned whipped cream
  2          teaspoons  graham cracker crumbs
                        = (from the cheesecake kit)

Combine milk, ice cream, strawberries and cheesecake mix in a blender and mix on high speed until smooth.  Pour into two 12-ounce glasses.

Garnish the top with a squirt of whipped cream from a can and about a teaspoon of graham cracker crumbs from the cheesecake kit.  Serve each shake with a straw.

This recipe yields 2 regular size drinks.

Comments:  The cool thing about this week's Top Secret Recipe is that many of the ingredients come in a kit designed for making strawberry cheesecake.  Find Jell-O No Bake Strawberry Cheesecake mix near the puddings in your supermarket and you have half of the ingredients locked up.

Inside the box are three separate packets: Strawberries, the cheesecake mix for flavoring and graham crackers crumbs to sprinkle over the top of your shake as they do at the restaurant.  To complete your clone you'll just need some vanilla ice cream, a cup of milk and a little whipped cream.

The recipe above makes two regular size shakes, but you can make another two drinks with the remaining strawberries that come in the mix.  If you thaw out some frozen, sweetened strawberries (those syrupy strawberries that come in a box), you can make as many as 8 more shake clones with the remaining cheesecake mix powder and graham cracker crumbs.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOPPING ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2           cup  chopped pecans
                        === CAKE ===
  1                cup  butter -- softened
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  2                     eggs
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/3           cup  milk

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Make topping by combining 1 cup flour with brown sugar, a stick of softened butter and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a medium bowl.  Mixture should have the consistency of moist sand.  Add 1/2 cup chopped pecans.

In a large bowl, cream together 1 cup butter, 3/4 cup light brown sugar and 1/2 cup granulated sugar with an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy.  Add eggs and vanilla and mix well.

In a separate bowl combine flour, baking powder and salt.  Add this dry mixture to the moist ingredients a little bit at a time.  Add milk and mix well.

Spoon the batter into a 9- by 13-inch baking pan that has been buttered and dusted with a light coating of flour.  Sprinkle the crumb topping over the batter.  Be sure the topping completely covers the batter.

Bake cake for 50 minutes, or until the edges just begin to turn light brown.  Cool and slice into 8 pieces.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A good coffee house will have good coffee cake, and Starbucks is no exception.  The world's biggest coffee house chain offers cake that is tasty and moist, with a perfect cinnamon streusel crumb topping that goes great with a hot cup of joe.  You may find slight variations of the cake at different Starbucks locations.  Sometimes there is a ribbon of cinnamon running through the middle of the cake, and sometimes the cake is dusted with a bit of powdered sugar.  You'll also find some versions with a few chopped pecans in the topping; and that's the version cloned here in our tasty original knockoff for the week.

Make topping by combining 1 cup flour with brown sugar, a stick of softened butter and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a medium bowl.  Mixture should have the consistency of moist sand.  Add 1/2 cup chopped pecans.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, cream together 1 cup butter, 3/4 cup light brown sugar and 1/2 cup granulated sugar with an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy.  Add eggs and vanilla and mix well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a separate bowl combine flour, baking powder and salt.  Add this dry mixture to the moist ingredients a little bit at a time.  Add milk and mix well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spoon the batter into a 9- by 13-inch baking pan that has been buttered and dusted with a light coating of flour.  Sprinkle the crumb topping over the batter.  Be sure the topping completely covers the batter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake cake for 50 minutes, or until the edges just begin to turn light brown.  Cool and slice into 8 pieces.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A good coffee house will have good coffee cake, and Starbucks is no exception.  The world&apos;s biggest coffee house chain offers cake that is tasty and moist, with a perfect cinnamon streusel crumb topping that goes great with a hot cup of joe.  You may find slight variations of the cake at different Starbucks locations.  Sometimes there is a ribbon of cinnamon running through the middle of the cake, and sometimes the cake is dusted with a bit of powdered sugar.  You&apos;ll also find some versions with a few chopped pecans in the topping; and that&apos;s the version cloned here in our tasty original knockoff for the week.

                   Starbucks' Mocha Coconut Frappuccino

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  shredded coconut
     3/4           cup  double strength coffee
  1                cup  low-fat milk
     1/3           cup  Hershey's chocolate syrup
  3        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  2               cups  ice
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Whipped cream

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Spread shredded coconut on a baking sheet and toast coconut in the oven.  Stir the coconut around every 10 minutes or so for even browning.  After 25 to 30 minutes the shredded coconut should be light brown.  Cool it off.

Make double-strength coffee by brewing with twice the coffee required by your coffee maker.  That should be 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per each cup of coffee.  Chill before using.

To make the drinks, combine cold coffee, milk, 1/3 cup of the toasted coconut, 1/3  cup chocolate syrup, and sugar in a blender.  Blend for 15 to 20 seconds to dissolve sugar.  Add ice and blend until ice is crushed and the drink is smooth.

Pour drinks into two 16-ounce glasses.  Garnish each drink with whipped cream, a drizzle of chocolate, and a pinch of some of the remaining toasted coconut.  Add a straw to each one.

This recipe yields 2 "grande" drinks.

Comments:  Here's Starbucks newest delight that's like a cold Mounds bar in a cup with a caffeine kick thrown in for extra buzzing.  Find shredded coconut in the baking aisle and toast 1/2 cup of it (store the leftover coconut in the fridge).  You'll use most of the toasted coconut in the blender, but save a little for the garnish when the drinks are done.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN ===
  2 1/2         pounds  chicken breast -- pounded thin
  2             ounces  olive oil
  8             ounces  sliced mushrooms

                          Taco Bell's Baja Sauce

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Sauces


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4                red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        coarsely chopped
  1              large  jalapeÒo -- chopped in half
  2        tablespoons  diced Spanish onion
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
  1               dash  garlic powder
  1               dash  cumin

Using a food processor, puree peppers and onion.

Mix 1 cup mayonnaise and 4 teaspoons of the vegetable puree in a medium bowl.  Add remaining ingredients and mix well.  Chill for several hours to let flavors develop.

This recipe yields 1 cup.

Comments:  This is the spicy sauce that you can order on your Gordita or Chalupa at Taco Bell, but you won't get much extra sauce -- even if you order it on the side -- to use later at home.  Too bad, since this stuff is good enough to use on all sorts of homemade Mexican masterpieces, from tacos to fajitas to breakfast burritos.  Now, with this original TSR clone of the creamy sauce, you'll have enough to hold you over for a while.

You need a food processor to puree the vegetables, but don't expect to use all the puree.  I've made the measurements for the puree larger than required so that your food processor will have something to grab onto.  And, by the way, this is a mayo-based sauce, so if you want to knock down the fat grams, use light mayonnaise in the recipe.  You won't even be able to tell the difference.

Comments:  This is the spicy sauce that you can order on your Gordita or Chalupa at Taco Bell, but you won&apos;t get much extra sauce -- even if you order it on the side -- to use later at home.  Too bad, since this stuff is good enough to use on all sorts of homemade Mexican masterpieces, from tacos to fajitas to breakfast burritos.  Now, with this original TSR clone of the creamy sauce, you&apos;ll have enough to hold you over for a while.
</DirT>
<DirT>
You need a food processor to puree the vegetables, but don&apos;t expect to use all the puree.  I&apos;ve made the measurements for the puree larger than required so that your food processor will have something to grab onto.  And, by the way, this is a mayo-based sauce, so if you want to knock down the fat grams, use light mayonnaise in the recipe.  You won&apos;t even be able to tell the difference.

                  Tony Roma's Carolina Honeys BBQ Salmon

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  ketchup
  1                cup  white distilled vinegar
     1/2           cup  molasses
     1/2           cup  honey
  1           teaspoon  hickory liquid smoke
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/4      teaspoon  Tabasco pepper sauce
                        === SEASONING ===
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        === SALMON ===
  4                     skinless salmon fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Canola oil or olive oil non-stick spray

Combine all ingredients for the sauce in a saucepan over medium-high heat.  Blend the ingredients with a whisk until smooth.  When the mixture comes to a boil, reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes or until mixture thickens.  Remove from heat.

Combine all ingredients for seasoning in a small bowl.  Preheat barbecue or indoor grill to high heat.

Sprinkle seasoning lightly over both sides of the salmon, spray each fillet lightly with olive oil or canola oil non-stick spray.  Grill the salmon for about 3 minutes then rotate it 180 degrees to make criss-crossing grill marks.  Grill for another 3 minutes then turn the salmon over for 3 minutes and rotate it again to make criss-crossing grill marks on that side.  Grill until done.  Remove salmon fillets from the grill, brush with the sauce and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Take one of Tony Roma's killer sauces, brush it over some grilled salmon and you've got a home run dish.  Now you can quickly clone the sweet, smoky sauce at home from scratch, as well as the special seasoning that makes the salmon taste just right when you grill it.

                     Tony Roma's Maple Sweet Potatoes

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  garnet yam
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2           cup  chopped yellow onion
  3        tablespoons  finely-chopped pecans
  3        tablespoons  maple syrup
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon

Bake yam for 40 to 45 minutes at 400 degrees.  This will bake the yam nearly all the way through, while still leaving it firm enough to slice when cool.  Remove the yam from the oven and let it cool so that you can handle it.  When the yam has cooled, remove the skin and slice it into 1-inch bite-size cubes.

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet.  Add onion slices and pecans and sautÈ for a couple minutes or until onion slices begin to brown.

Add sliced yams, maple syrup and cinnamon and sautÈ for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring often, or until yam pieces are hot and tender.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Comments:  Here's a clone for a new menu item at Tony Roma's that comes served alongside the "Carolina Honeys Salmon" (see recipe) at the restaurant.  It's a great new way for you to prepare sweet potatoes -- actually garnet yams -- that everyone at the table will scarf down with unbridled glee.  It's a side item that tastes like it should be served for dessert.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     racks St. Louis ribs - (abt 4 lbs) -- skin removed from
                        the backside of the ribs
                        Water -- as needed
                        Barbecue sauce (any variety) -- as needed

Place ribs on a rack inside a baking pan.  Fill pan with about 1 inch of water.  Cover pan with plastic wrap, then wrap with aluminum foil (to create a steaming effect); bake at 450 degrees for 2 hours. Remove from oven about 10 minutes before ready to serve.

Heat grill to high.  Place ribs meat-side down on the hot grill.  Baste with barbecue sauce.  When you notice the juice in the bone begin to bubble, turn over and baste the other side of the ribs with barbecue sauce.  Juice in the bone should begin to bubble again, then turn once more to cook briefly as the sauce caramelizes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

             Wendy's Garden Sensations Mandarin Chicken Salad

Recipe By     :Todd Wilbur
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SESAME DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  corn syrup
  3        tablespoons  white distilled vinegar
  2        tablespoons  pineapple juice
  4          teaspoons  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  rice wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
     1/4      teaspoon  ground mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  paprika
  1               dash  garlic powder
  1               dash  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  sesame seeds
                        === SALAD ===
  4                     chicken breast fillets
  1              large  iceberg lettuce head -- chopped
  4               cups  red leaf lettuce -- chopped
  1 1/3           cups  canned mandarin orange wedges
  1                cup  rice noodles
  1                cup  roasted sliced almonds

Prepare dressing by combining all dressing ingredients except vegetable oil and sesame seeds in a blender on high speed.  Slowly add oil to mixture (to create an emulsion).  Add sesame seeds and blend for just a couple seconds.  Pour dressing into a covered container (such as a dressing cruet) and chill until needed.

Rub each chicken breast fillet with oil, then lightly salt and pepper each piece.  Grill on medium-high heat until done.  Chill chicken breasts in refrigerator until cold.

When chicken is cold, build each salad by first arranging about 4 cups of iceberg lettuce in the bottom of a large salad bowl or on a plate.

Arrange a cup of red leaf lettuce on the iceberg lettuce.

Dice each chicken breast into bite-size pieces and sprinkle the pieces from each one over each salad.

Arrange about 1/3 cup of mandarin orange wedges on each salad.

Next, sprinkle about 1/4 cup of rice noodles and 1/4 cup of roasted sliced almonds on top of each salad.

Add desired amount of sesame dressing and serve.

This recipe yields 4 large salads.

Comments:  Of the four salads on Wendy's new "Garden Sensations" menu, this is the one that draws all the cloning requests.  It's the sesame dressing that everyone's nuts about.  The clone above gives you a nice 1 1/2 cups of the tasty stuff so it'll fit perfectly into a standard dressing cruet.  Once you've got your dressing made, building the rest of the salad is a breeze.
