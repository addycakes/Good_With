            Asparagus And Crab Meat Soup - {Mang Tay Nau Cua}

Recipe By     :Nicole Rauthier, "The Foods of Vietnam"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews                     Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc man) -- plus
  2          teaspoons  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc man)
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  6                     shallots -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  8             ounces  lump crab meat -- picked over,
                        and drained
                        Freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch or arrowroot -- mixed with
  2        tablespoons  cold water
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  1                can  white asparagus spears - (15 oz) -- cut 1" sections
                        with canning liquid reserved
  1         tablespoon  shredded coriander
  1                     scallion -- thinly sliced

Combine the broth, 1 tablespoon of the fish sauce, the sugar and salt in a 3-quart soup pot.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer. 

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a skillet.  Add the shallots and garlic and stir-fry until aromatic.  Add the crab meat, the remaining 2 teaspoons fish sauce and white pepper to taste.  Stir-fry over high heat for 1 minute.  Set aside. 

Bring the soup to a boil.  Add the cornstarch mixture and stir gently until the soup thickens and is clear.  While the soup is actively boiling, add the egg and stir gently.  Continue to stir for about 1 minute.  Add the crab meat mixture and asparagus with its canning liquid; cook gently until heated through. 

Transfer the soup to a heated tureen.  Sprinkle on the coriander, scallion and freshly ground white pepper. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  This soup was probably created by some homesick Frenchman.  White asparagus (a French import), packed in jars or cans, is used for this recipe.  Traditionally, crumbled, salted duck egg yolk is added to season the soup. 

If white asparagus is unavailable, use frozen or fresh asparagus (in this case, add the fresh asparagus to the broth from the very beginning and cook until tender, before adding the remaining ingredients).

                         Basic Vegetable Platter

Recipe By     :Bach Ngo and Gloria Zimmerman, "The Classic Cuisine of Vietn
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Vegetables
                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  soft lettuce leaves
                        (Boston or similar, not iceberg)
  1                cup  fresh mint leaves
  1                cup  fresh coriander (Chinese parsley)
  1                cup  cucumber slices

Peel cucumber in lengthwise strips and with green strips in between, then cut in half lengthwise and into thin horizontal slices, forming semi-circles. 

Arrange a mound of lettuce in the center of a platter.  Around the lettuce, and touching it, arrange separate mounds of mint and coriander. 

Arrange the cucumbers in overlapping slices around the complete outer rim of the platter. 

This is the basic arrangement of the vegetable platter.  On those occasions when a recipe calls for another vegetable, it can be added to this platter. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  A salad or vegetable platter is a very important part of a Vietnamese meal; indeed, it is served at practically every one.  The vegetables, which are eaten along with many dishes, are arranged on a platter, and diner helps himself to whatever he desires.  In Vietnam we used many more vegetables and herbs than we can find in the West.  But, in spite of that, the following platter makes a satisfactory accompaniment to the dishes we have prepared for this book.  All vegetables and herbs are those served in Vietnam, except that the variety is smaller.

                       Beef Balls - {Thit Bo Vien}

Recipe By     :Nicole Rauthier, "The Foods of Vietnam"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam) -- plus
  1         tablespoon  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1         tablespoon  potato starch -- plus
  1           teaspoon  potato starch
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2             pounds  trimmed boneless beef hind shank
  4                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  Oriental sesame oil
                        Vegetable oil -- for shaping meatball

In a shallow dish, mix the fish sauce, potato starch, baking powder, sugar and white pepper. 

Slice the meat into 1/8-inch-thick pieces.  Add to the marinade and mix well.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight. 

Before proceeding, transfer the meat to the freezer for 30 minutes.  Work with half of the beef at a time; do not overload the work bowl. 

In a food processor, combine half of the beef with half of the garlic and sesame oil.  Process to a completely smooth but stiff paste, about 3 minutes.  Stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the work bowl.  The completed paste should spring back to the touch.  Transfer the paste to a bowl.  Process the remaining beef, garlic and sesame oil the same way. 

Rub some vegetable oil on one hand.  Grab a handful of the meat paste and close your hand into a fist, squeezing out a small portion of the mixture, about 1 teaspoon, between your thumb and index finger.  Keep rolling and squeezing the same portion between your thumb and index finger until you obtain a smooth rounded ball.  Scoop out the meatball with an oiled spoon.  Repeat until all of the paste is used. 

Pour 1 inch of water into a wok or wide pot.  Place a steamer rack or bamboo steamer over the water.  Arrange the meatballs without crowding in a single layer on the rack.  Cover and steam for 5 minutes. 

Serve as an appetizer with chili sauce.  These beef balls can also be added to a well-seasoned beef broth, sprinkled with chopped scallions and white pepper and served as a soup (noodles may be added). 

Note:  These meatballs may be frozen.  Thaw them thoroughly, then   steam or simmer in boiling water until just heated through. 

This recipe yields about 60 meatballs. 

Comments:  These crunchy little beef balls are very popular among the Vietnamese.  They are served mainly as appetizers or added to noodle soups.  Chili sauce (tuong ot) is the usual accompaniment, but any hot red pepper sauce can be served alongside.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              stalk  fresh lemon grass
                        (or 1 tbspn dried lemon grass)
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2          teaspoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  6             ounces  fatty beef chuck -- sliced paper thin
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  2                     shallots or white part of 2 scallions -- sliced
  3               cups  water
  1 1/2                 beef bouillon cubes

  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh coriander (Chinese parsley)
  2                     scallions/ green part only -- chopped

If you are using fresh lemon grass, simply remove the outer leaves and upper two-thirds of the stalk, then chop.  If you are using dried, it must be soaked for 2 hours, then drained and chopped fine.

Heat the oil and fry the shallots over a high flame.  Add the lemon grass and fry for about 1 minute, then add the meat.  Cook until all traces of redness are gone.  Add the water, bring to a boil, and add the beef bouillon cubes, remaining 1 teaspoon fish sauce, and salt. 

Immediately before serving, bring the soup to a boil.  Pour into bowls and sprinkle with the chopped coriander and scallion.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  oxtail -- cut 1"-thick pieces
                        (double the amount if not using
                        the optional meats)
  8             ounces  beef brisket -- (optional)
  8             ounces  beef tendon -- (optional)
  1              large  yellow onion -- peeled
  5                     whole cloves
  4             ounces  fresh ginger -- peeled, and
                        cut into 4 slices and lightly crushed
  5                     star anise
  1                     cinnamon stick - (abt 2 1/2" to 3" long)
  1           teaspoon  white or black peppercorns
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste

Trim some of the fat off the oxtail pieces.  Put the oxtail with water to cover in a stockpot and bring to a boil over high heat.  Blanch for 15 minutes, then drain and rinse both meat and pot. 

Place the oxtail back in the stockpot, add the brisket and tendon (if using), cover with 5 quarts water, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low, add the onion studded with cloves, the ginger, star anise, cinnamon stick, and peppercorns, and season wtih salt.  Simmer, uncovered and undisturbed, occasionally skimming off foam, until the stock is reduced by 2 quarts, about 3 hours. 

Remove the brisket and tendon from stock, and reserve for use in another dish.  At this time, skim off as much fat as you desire.  Strain the stock, discard the solids, and use according to the recipe of your choice.  The stock can be kept up to 3 days in the refrigerator or 3 months in the freezer. 

This recipe yields 3 quarts. 

Comments:  Beef tendons are not only used in making this stock or eaten in pho, but they are sometimes brasied in soy sauce, a great delicacy.  Tendons are the white fibrous connective tissue that holds together muscle (or meat) to bone.  This part of the cow is not used in Western cooking, and so you will need to purchase it from a Chinese butcher in Chinatown.

                  Beef With Fine Rice Noodles - {Bun Ho}

Recipe By     :Terry Tan, "Little Vietnamese Cookbook"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish
                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  rice noodles
  1                     garlic clove -- crushed
  1             medium  onion -- sliced fine
  2             inches  lemon grass root -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  4        tablespoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1              pinch  sugar
  1              pound  fillet or sirloin steak -- thinly sliced
  3             ounces  bean sprouts
  4             ounces  crisp salad greens -- shredded
  3        tablespoons  shredded cucumber
  1        small bunch  mint
  2        tablespoons  oil
  4        tablespoons  chopped peanuts

Blanch rice noodles for 5 minutes, drain and set aside. 

Combine garlic, onion, lemon grass, salt, pepper, half the nuoc mam and sugar and marinate beef in this mixture for half an hour. 

Divide bean sprouts, salad greens, cucumber, and mint, put in individual deep bowls and top with rice noodles. 

Heat oil in skillet and fry beef to preferred taste.  Divide into four and add to bowls.  Dribble over with remaining nuoc mam, add chopped nuts, and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Rice and noodles are the pillars of Vietnamese cooking and each plays a different role in daily meals.  Rice noodles are more popular than wheat ones and are thick, round, or flat.  Unlike dry wheat noodles, those made with rice flour only require blanching in boiling water for a few minutes to cook.  This dish is interesting in its multi-layered presentation and can be served warm or cold.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry                         Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  dried tiger lilies
  8                     medium-large dried shiitake mushrooms
     1/4           cup  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  2         tablespoon  thick soy sauce
  2             pounds  whole chicken legs -- skinned, (optional)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- peeled and crushed
  2                     scallions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1"-long pieces, halved lengthwise
  3             ounces  fresh ginger -- peeled and julienned
  3                     or more dried red chilies
  2               cups  chicken stock
  6             ounces  bamboo shoots -- thinly sliced
                        into 2"-long by 1/2"-wide pieces

Soak the tiger lilies and mushrooms in hot water in a bowl until rehydrated and softened, about 30 minutes.  Drain and rinse.  Squeeze the excess water out of the lilies and mushrooms.  With a knife, remove and discard the hard stem ends of the lilies and stems of the mushrooms.  Tie each lily into a knot and cut mushroom caps in half. 

Whisk together the fish sauce, sugar, and thick soy sauce until the sugar is completely dissolved.  With a cleaver, split the chicken legs at the joints so you have 2 sets of drumsticks and thighs.  Then carefully chop each piece in half crosswise through the bone.  Add the chicken to the sauce and allow to marinate, refrigerated, for 2 hours. 

Put the oil, garlic, scallions, ginger, and chilies in a clay pot or heavy-bottomed pot over low heat.  Increase the heat to medium and stir-fry the ingredients until fragrant, about 5 minutes.  Add the chicken, marinade, stock, and mushrooms, cover, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, add the tiger lilies and bamboo shoots, and simmer, partially covered, until the chicken is cooked, about 45 minutes.  Serve with rice. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                     Braised Eggplant - {Ca Phao Kho}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables                      Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  Japanese eggplant -- halved lengthwise
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- peeled and minced
  6             ounces  ground beef
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Char the eggplants on all sides over an open flame on medium-high heat or in a dry skillet on an electric stove.  When the skin has blackened on all sides, allow to cool.  Peel the eggplant and cut into large chunks. 

Heat the oil in a clay pot or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.  Add the garlic and stir-fry until golden, about 10 minutes.  Add the ground beef and stir so the beef separates, about 5 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low, add the eggplant and fish sauce, and season with salt and pepper.  Braise, partially covered, until the eggplant has cooked down but is still slightly chunky, about 30 minutes. 

Variation:  If you do not like the smoky flavor of the charred eggplants, simply skip step 1.  Instead, cut the eggplants, skin on into large chunks and proceed with step 2. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     chicken or duck eggs - (to 6)
                        or 12 quail eggs
     1/3           cup  sugar
  3               cups  young coconut juice (if using fish sauce)
     1/2           cup  fish sauce or thin soy sauce
  2                     bone-in pork shanks with rind - (2 lbs ea)
  5                     scallions -- trimmed, halved,
                        and white bulbs lightly crushed
  2             ounces  fresh ginger -- sliced, and
                        lightly crushed
  3              large  garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        lightly crushed
  3                     or more dried red chilies
  5                     star anise
     1/2      teaspoon  five-spice powder

Gently place the eggs in a pot and just cover with water.  Bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat and cook until soft boiled, about 5 minutes (about 2 minutes for quail eggs).  Rinse under cold water and allow to cool completely.  Carefully shell the eggs, being careful to keep the eggs intact. 

Make a caramel by combining the sugar and 1/4 cup water in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.  When the sugar is melted and turns a rich gold, about 8 minutes, remove the pot from the heat and stir in the coconut juice and fish sauce (or 3 cups water and the soy sauce).  Reduce the heat to low and stir until the sauce is completely smooth. 

Add the pork shanks, turning them to coat evenly on all sides.  Add the scallions, ginger, garlic, chilies, star anise, and five-spice powder and simmer, covered, turning the shanks occasionally, until the meat is fork tender, about 4 hours. 

With a ladle, skim off the fat and add the eggs.  Continue simmering, ladling sauce over the eggs occasionally, until the eggs turn golden and cook through, about 5 minutes. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

               Brasied Tofu With Ginger - {Dau Hu Kho Gung}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              large  galic clove -- peeled and minced
  2             ounces  fresh ginger -- peeled and minced
  6             ounces  ground pork (70% lean)
  1           teaspoon  Vietnamese chili and garlic sauce -- or more to taste
  2                     scallions -- root ends trimmed,
                        cut 1 1/2" long and halved lengthwise
  1              pound  firm tofu -- cut into 1/2" cubes
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground white pepper -- to taste

Heat the oil in a clay pot or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.  Stir-fry the garlic and ginger until fragrant and lightly golden, about 5 minutes.  Add the pork and stir-fry so it separates into pieces and just cooks through, about 3 minutes. 

Reduce the heat to low, add the chili and garlic sauce, scallions, tofu, and fish sauce, and carefully mix (so as not to break up the tofu too much) until well combined.  Cover and cook for 5 minutes. 

Season to taste with salt and pepper and continue cooking, covered, until all the flavors have blended together, another 10 minutes.  Serve with rice. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  1              quart  water

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  ground pork
     1/2           cup  minced shrimp
  5                     shallots -- finely chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  white cabbage leaves -- blanched
  20             whole  baby leek or spring onion greens -- blanched
  6               cups  chicken or pork stock
  2        tablespoons  diced baby leek or spring onion stalks
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped cilantro
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)

The cabbage should be blanched first in boiling water (not in the stock) to remove the bitterness and to soften it for rolling. 

In a large bowl, mix pork, shrimp and shallots.  Season with salt and pepper.  Put a tablespoon of the mixture into each cabbage leaf, roll and use the baby leek greens to tie the rolls into parcels. 

Cook the parcels in salted water for 5 minutes and serve with the chicken or pork stock.  Sprinkle with baby leeks, cilantro and freshly ground pepper.  Serve with fish sauce, as a dip. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Poultry                         Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Pickled Bean Sprouts -- (see recipe)
                        Caramel Sauce -- (see recipe)
  2             pounds  chicken wings
  1         tablespoon  finely-shredded fresh gingerroot
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Prepare the Pickled Bean Sprouts and Caramel Sauce.  Set aside. 

Cut each chicken wing into 3 pieces; the main wing joint, the second joint and the wing tip.  Reserve the wing tips for soups or stocks. 

In a 3-quart saucepan, add the chicken wing pieces and shredded ginger to the cooled caramel sauce.  Stir to combine.  Set over high heat and bring the mixture to a rapid boil.  Cover the pan, reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the chicken is very tender.  Skim off any excess fat. 

Transfer the chicken wings and sauce to a serving dish.  Sprinkle with white pepper, if desired. 

To serve, spoon some of the sauce over rice and serve with Pickled Bean Sprouts. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  Instead of simmering, you can grill the marinated chicken wings over medium charcoals, basting regularly with the marinade.

               Chili, Garlic, And Fish Sauce - {Nuoc Cham}

Recipe By     :Terry Tan, "Little Vietnamese Cookbook"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Sauces
                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     red chilies
  2                     garlic cloves
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  2                     limes -- peeled and chopped
  1         tablespoon  hot water
  1         tablespoon  vinegar
  5        tablespoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)

Remove stalks from chilies and de-seed if you want a milder dip, though this defeats the purpose of nuoc cham.  Pound garlic in a pestle and add chilies one by one, processing until you get a fine paste.  Add sugar and lime pieces and pound to a pulp. 

Remove to a small sauce bowl and add water, vinegar, and fish sauce.  Mix well and serve. 

Variations on the sauce can include chopped coriander, chopped ginger, pineapple, and any fresh herbs. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Piquant dips do double duty as condiments and seasonings in Vietnamese cooking.  The base for these is always nuoc mam and you can add ingredients such as lime juice, chopped chilies, chopped nuts, spring onions, fried garlic, ginger and fresh herbs such as coriander, sweet basil, and mint.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Remove stalks from chilies and de-seed if you want a milder dip, though this defeats the purpose of nuoc cham.  Pound garlic in a pestle and add chilies one by one, processing until you get a fine paste.  Add sugar and lime pieces and pound to a pulp.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Remove to a small sauce bowl and add water, vinegar, and fish sauce.  Mix well and serve. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Variations on the sauce can include chopped coriander, chopped ginger, pineapple, and any fresh herbs.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields ?? servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Piquant dips do double duty as condiments and seasonings in Vietnamese cooking.  The base for these is always nuoc mam and you can add ingredients such as lime juice, chopped chilies, chopped nuts, spring onions, fried garlic, ginger and fresh herbs such as coriander, sweet basil, and mint.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Pork
                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless pork, preferable fresh ham
                        (weight after trimming fat)
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  3        tablespoons  water
     1/2    tablespoon  potato starch or rice flour
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1               dash  MSG -- (optional)
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  pork fat
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

Be sure pork is trimmed of all fat.  Slice the meat 1/4-inch thick, then cut into 1-inch squares.  Make a marinade by combining all the remaining ingredients, except for the pork fat and cinnamon, in a large bowl.  Add the pork slices to the marinade and mix well with your hands, then cover the bowl with wrap or foil.  Refrigerate for 5 hours, and after that period of time has elapsed, transfer the bowl to the freezer for 10 minutes. 

Remove the pork from the freezer, add the cinnamon, and reduce to a paste in a food processor only. 

Boil the pork fat for 10 minutes and dice into small pieces, the size of whole peppercorns.  Add the diced pork fat to the ground pork mixture. 

Coat an 8-inch-square baking pan with oil.  Put the meat paste into the pan and press down firmly with your hands, making sure the surface is smooth.  The meat will come halfway up the side of the pan. 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and bake the pate for 40 minutes or until the surface looks brown.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool.  Then slice and serve as an appetizer or with French bread for lunch or dinner, or use in any recipe where it is required.  It can be eaten hot or cold. 

This will keep fresh in the refrigerator for a week, or it can be stored for a longer period in the freezer.  To reheat, wrap in foil and place in a 300 degree oven for 15 minutes. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  This recipe is very tasty with an interesting texture.  Unless you're a fan of hard work, use a food processor.  The pate was originally pounded to the proper consistency in a mortar and pestle...  It can be used all sorts of ways -- made into balls for soup, sliced after cooking and added to lettuce or rice paper rolls, served with shrimp chips for munchies -- whatever inspires you.  The cinnamon flavor is discernible but not overpowering.

             Coconut Flan With Caramel - {Banh Dua Ca Ra Men}

Recipe By     :Nicole Rauthier, "The Foods of Vietnam"
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CARAMEL ===
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  hot water
                        === CUSTARD ===
  1                cup  fresh or canned coconut milk
  1                cup  milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
  4                     eggs
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. 

Make the caramel:  Cook the sugar in a small heavy saucepan over low heat, swirling the pan constantly, until brown.  Stir the hot water into the caramel, being careful to guard against splattering (the mixture will bubble vigorously).  Boil the mixture, swirling the pan occasionally, until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, about 2 minutes. 

Pour the caramel syrup into a 1-quart souffle dish or five 4-ounce ramekins.  Tilt the molds to coat all of the surfaces with caramel. 

Make the custard:  Combine the coconut milk, milk and sugar in a medium saucepan over low heat.  Scald until the sugar dissolves completely.  Remove from heat. 

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla.  Gradually whisk the hot coconut milk mixture into the eggs, blending thoroughly. 

Strain the custard through a fine sieve into a bowl.  Carefully pour into the caramel-lined souffle dish or ramekins. 

Line a large roasting pan with 2 layers of paper towels (see Note).  Put the souffle dish in the roasting pan and add hot water to reach halfway up the side of the dish.  Bake in the center of the oven for 50 minutes (30 minutes if using ramekins), or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Be careful not to let the water boil; do not disturb the custard while baking.  This is the only "secret" to producing a smooth and velvety custard. 

Remove the souffle dish immediately from the hot water.  Allow to cool in a cold-water bath.  Chill thoroughly. 

To serve, run a knife around the edge of the custard and turn out onto dessert plates.  Serve with shaved ice or whipped cream, if desired. 

Note:  The paper towels in the roasting pan serve a twofold purpose:  First, they allow the hot water to circulate under the souffle dish while baking to distribute the heat evenly; second, if using small ramekins, it stabilizes them and keeps them from moving around while baking. 

This recipe yields 5 servings. 

Comments:  This is the ultimate coconut dessert -- an adaptation of the classic "Creme renversee", or "Flan au caramel".  The technique used is distinctly French but the flavors are all Vietnamese. 

This custard is at its best when prepared a day in advance and refrigerated so the flavors can mellow.  If you just can't wait, you might try the Vietnamese method of rapid cooling for dishes such as this: place a small scoop of shaved ice on top of each custard before serving!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  red azuki beans -- soaked for 4 hours
                        and drained
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  canned unsweetened coconut milk
  1              pinch  salt
  2               cups  steamed sticky rice -- prepared just before
                        using and kept warm

Bring 2 cups of water just to a boil in a pot over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to low, add the azuki beans and 1/4 cup sugar.  Cover and simmer until the beans are cooked through, about 3 hours.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool. 

Meanwhile, bring the coconut milk to a boil in a pot over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low, add the remaining sugar, the salt, and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Remove from the heat and add the warm sticky rice.  Cover and allow the rice to soak up most of the coconut milk. 

Divide the rice among 4 dessert plates and place about 2 tablespoons cooked azuki beans on each serving. 

Variation:  Substitute 3/4 cup skinless split mung beans (soaked for 2 hours and drained) for the red azuki beans.  In step 1, cook the mung beans with 2 cups water until the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              whole  medium crabs
                        Peanut oil -- for deep-frying
  1         tablespoon  tamarind pulp
     1/2           cup  rice wine
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  chopped baby leeks
                        or white part of spring onions in 1"
                        pieces
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1           teaspoon  crushed white pepper

Clean the crabs, take off the tops, rinse thoroughly, cut in half and break the claws. 

Heat peanut oil in wok until very hot, deep-fry crabs for 30 seconds, or until color changes.  Set on paper towels to absorb excess oil. 

Dissolve tamarind pulp in rice wine.  In a large pan or wok, saute garlic in vegetable oil until soft, add crab and continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes on a high heat.  Add tamarind mixture, fish sauce and pepper.  Reduce for another 2 minutes, then add baby leeks.  Remove from heat.  Place crabs on a plater and pour tamarind sauce over.  Serve with steamed rice. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Although this dish is traditionally prepared in a wok, the use of a deep-fryer might make the cooking easier.  You can also substitute freshly ground black pepper, although white pepper is often the preferred ingredient of Vietnamese cooks.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  translucent rice vermicelli or
                        cellophane noodles -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  dried tree ears -- soaked until soft
                        and chopped (wood fungus or wood ears)
  3                     Chinese mushroom caps -- soaked until soft
                        and chopped
  6             ounces  minced pork
  4             ounces  water chestnuts -- chopped
  2                     spring onion stalks -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
  12            sheets  banh tranhg - (to 14 sheets)
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying
                        Cornstarch -- (optional)

Put all ingredients except skins or rice paper in a large mixing bowl and blend well.  Adding a tablespoon of cornstarch will give the mixture a smooth texture, but this is optional.  To adjust seasoning, boil a small nugget of mixture and taste.  Adjust seasoning if necessary. 

In a bowl of tepid water gently lower each sheet of bang tranhg or spring roll skin until soft and shake off excess water.  Very carefully, lay sheets on a clean chopping board.  Place a heaped tablespoon of mixture on sheet or skin, roll over once, and fold in sides.  Roll over once more and tuck in firmly, patting the ends down.  Finish making rolls as oil heats in the wok. 

Gently lower each roll in the oil to deep fry -- a few at a time until light brown and crisp.  Serve with fresh lettuce and mint leaves with nuoc cham. 

This recipe yields 12 to 14 rolls. 

Comments:  Quintessentially Vietnamese, these delicate, crispy rolls are a refinement from the more robust Chinese rolls.  The basic ingredient is minced pork, to which either prawns or crab can be added for savory flavor. 

The gossamer thin bang tranhg (rice paper) is hard to handle.  You can use conventional spring roll skins as an easy alternative, but you won't achieve the same crispy results.

                  Curried Frogs' Legs - {Ech Nau Ca-Ri}

Recipe By     :Nicole Rauthier, "The Foods of Vietnam"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     pair of jumbo frog's legs
  1                     fresh lemon grass stalk
                        (or 1 tbspn dried lemon grass)
  2                     fresh red chilies -- seeded and sliced
  2                     shallots -- sliced
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  curry paste
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  2             ounces  cellophane noodles
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              small  onion, chopped
  1                cup  chicken broth or water
     1/2           cup  coconut milk or heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Coriander sprigs -- for garnish

Cut the frogs' legs into bite-size pieces.  Rinse with cold water to remove any chipped bones.  Pat dry and refrigerate. 

If you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and upper half of the stalk.  Cut into thin slices and finely chop.  If you are using dried lemon grass, soak it in warm water for 1 hour.  Drain and finely chop. 

In a blender, combine the lemon grass with the chiles, shallots, garlic, sugar, curry paste, curry powder, salt and 1 tablespoon of the fish sauce.  Process to a very fine paste.  Rub the paste over the frogs' legs.  Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 

Meanwhile, soak the cellophane noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.  Drain.  Cut into 2-inch sections. 

Heat the oil in a saucepan over moderate heat.  Add the onion and saute until translucent.  Add the frogs' legs and brown well on all sides, about 3 minutes.  Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. 

Uncover the pan and add the coconut milk, the cornstarch diluted in 1 tablespoon of cold water and the remaining 1 tablespoon fish sauce.  Cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. 

Add the cellophane noodles and bring the mixture to a boil.  Remove from the heat.  Sprinkle with white pepper and garnish with coriander sprigs. 

Serve immediately with rice, French bread or over rice noodles. 

Note:  Instead of discarding the upper half of the lemon grass, crush it and cook it with the frogs' legs for extra flavor.  Remove the stalk before serving. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This delicious lemon grass and coconut-laced curry comes from southern Vietnam.  If you prefer a very hot curry, simply use more chile peppers.

     1/2           cup  vegetable stock or water
  4                     firm tofu cakes - (3 oz ea) -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/2"-thick slices

Add the stock, coconut milk, chili flakes, and tofu and simmer, stirring occasionally, to heat through and thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. 

Sprinkle with the ngo om and chopped peanuts and serve with rice.

  1         tablespoon  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  5               cups  chicken broth
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
  2               cups  thinly-sliced peeled daikon
  2                     scallions -- thinly sliced

In a bowl, combine the pork, 1 teaspoon of the fish sauce and white pepper to taste.  Let marinate for 30 minutes. 

In a 3-quart soup pot, combine the pork and chicken broth.  Bring to a rolling boil.  Reduce the heat and skim the surface to remove the foam.  Continue skimming until the foam ceases to rise.  Simmer until the broth is well flavored and the pork cooked, about 10 minutes. 

Stir in the salt, sugar and the remaining 1 tablespoon fish sauce; simmer for 5 minutes longer.  Add the daikon, cover and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat. 

Transfer the soup to a heated tureen.  Garnish with the scallions and sprinkle with freshly ground white pepper. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Poultry
                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  shelled peanuts -- red skin removed
     1/2           cup  chestnuts, either fresh or dried
     1/2           cup  ginkgo nuts, canned or fresh
     1/2           cup  dried lotus seeds
  8                     dried Chinese mushrooms
     1/2           cup  red dates (jujubes)
  1                     duck - (abt 5 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh ginger root
  3                     shallots -- chopped fine
  2                     eighteen-inch pieces of sugar cane
                        (if unavailable, omit)
                        Clear water from 1 coconut
  1           teaspoon  rock sugar
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  3                     scallions, green part and white -- cut 4 pieces
                        crosswise
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1              sprig  fresh coriander (Chinese parsley) -- chopped

Prepare the various nuts, the lotus seeds, dried mushrooms, and red dates as follows:  Soak the peanuts in hot water for 30 minutes; drain and set aside. 

If using dried chestnuts, boil for 20 minutes, drain, and set aside.  If using fresh ginkgo nuts, remove the shell and blanch to remove the thin inner skin; set aside.  Soak the Chinese mushrooms in hot water for 20 minutes, then drain, remove the stems and cut into quarters; set aside. 

Boil the dried lotus seeds for 20 minutes; drain and set aside.  Soak the red dates in hot water for 30 minutes.  (If they are very dry, boil for 10 minutes.)  Drain and set aside. 

Rinse and clean the duck.  Rub salt over the duck and rinse off; let dry for 10 minutes. 

Combine the ginger, shallots, and 1 teaspoon salt.  Rub the inside of the duck with the mixture.  Combine the peanuts, chestnuts, ginkgo nuts, lotus seeds, and 1 teaspoon salt and stuff the duck.  Sew the duck closed with heavy white thread, or else use skewers. 

Peel the sugar cane and cut into thin lengthwise strips, the same length as the duck.  Place 3 pieces of white kitchen string on a flat surface, long enough to tie the slices of sugar cane around the duck, covering the entire surface.  Bring the string around and tie as you would a roast.  Turn the duck over and slide the remaining strips under the string, covering the entire duck with the sugar cane. 

Pour the coconut water into a large pot.  Put the duck into the pot and add enough water to completely cover.  Add the rock sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt.  Bring to a boil and remove the scum continuously for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down, cover, and keep at a lively bubble for 2 hours.  Turn the duck every 30 minutes. 

After 2 hours, remove the duck from the pot; untie and discard the sugar cane.  To the liquid remaining in the pot add the mushrooms, red dates, 1 teaspoon salt, and the fish sauce.  Boil, covered, for 15 minutes, then return the duck to the broth, cover, and simmer for an additional 15 minutes.  Remove the duck and add the scallion pieces to the broth. 

To serve, break the duck, with the bones, into 8 pieces.  Put the pieces in individual bowls and add broth, some of the various nuts that were stuffed into the duck, red dates, and mushrooms.  Sprinkle with white pepper and chopped fresh coriander. 

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  cod steaks -- skinned, and
                        cut into bite-size chunks
                        Coarse sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black or white pepper -- to taste
  1                     white-fish head, such as cod
  3        tablespoons  tamarind pulp - (to 4 tbspns)
  7             ounces  ripe pineapple -- cut 1/4"-thick
                        slices, cored, cut bite-size chunks
  1             medium  ripe tomato -- peeled, halved,
                        seeded, cut into 8 equal wedges
  2                     or more fresh bird's eye or Thai chilies -- seeded, and
                        sliced thin diagonally
  10                    leaves holy basil -- julienned
  4                     saw leaves -- julienned
                        (or 1/4 cup cilantro leaves)
     1/4           cup  Fried Garlic Oil -- see * Note

* Note:  See the "Scallion Oil - {Hanh La Phi}" recipe for the "Toi Phi Dau" variation. 

Season the fish chunks with salt and pepper and let stand in a cool place. 

Put the fish head in a pot with 7 cups water and bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the liquid is reduced by 1 cup, about 30 minutes.  At this time you may discard the fish head if you wish. 

Add the tamarind pulp, pineapple, tomato, and chilies and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add the fish chunks, adjust the seasoning, and simmer until the fish is cooked, 3 to 5 minutes.  Serve hot-in a communal bowl or individual soup bowls-garnished with holy basil, saw leaves (or cilantro), and Fried Garlic Oil as desired. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  water
     1/3           cup  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
     1/2           cup  lime or lemon juice
                        (from abt 3 limes or 2 lemons)
  1              large  garlic clove -- crushed, peeled,
                        and sliced or minced
  1                     or more bird's eye or Thai chilies -- seeded, and
                        sliced or minced
  1                     shallot -- peeled, sliced thin,
                        rinsed, and drained (optional)

Whisk together the sugar, water, fish sauce, and lime or lemon juice in a bowl until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Add the garlic, chili, and shallot (if using), and let stand for 30 minutes before serving. 

This recipe yields about 2 cups. 

Comments:  I've been making nuoc cham ever since I can remember.  In fact, it was perhaps the first Vietnamese recipe I learned to make as a child.  Nobody liked chopping the garlic, so I was stuck doing it.  I became such an expert at making this sauce that every time we cooked, my mother would ask me to make it.  The one difficult thing was to please both my mother and father simultaneously.  She liked it sour, while he preferred it sweet.  I resolved this quandary by creating a finely balanced version that allowed all of the various flavors to come out, and I continue to use it to this day. 

A meal without nuoc cham is no meal at all.  Served as a dipping sauce with many dishes such as cha gio, spring rolls; banh xeo, sizzling "sound" crÍpes; and grilled meats and seafood; it is perhaps the most important sauce you will learn to make.  There are several variations on this recipe.  If you like your sauce spicier, mince rather than slice the chilies and garlic.  Sometimes distilled rice wine vinegar is used to round out the flavor.  My aunt Loan likes to slice and add shallots, saying they make the sauce sweeter.  Try it different ways, mild or hot, more sweet or sour, with or without shallots.  All are interesting.  Preceeding is my favorite version, which balances the sweet, sour, and spicy levels.  I suggest you make 2 cups, as it goes quickly.  Any left over can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2                     Chinese sweet pork sausages -- quartered lengthwise
                        and diced (or any leftover meat)
  1                     scallion -- root end and tough
                        green tops removed, sliced thin rounds
  8              large  napa cabbage leaves or any Asian greens -- thinly sliced
  4               cups  cooked long-grain rice -- refrigerated overnig
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Heat the oil in a wok or large nonstick skillet over high heat.  Add the sausages, scallion, and cabbage and stir-fry until the sausages render their fat, 3 to 5 minutes. 

Add the rice and continue to stir-fry and mix all the ingredients evenly.  Add the egg and stir-fry quickly until the rice dries out completely, about 10 minutes. 

Add soy sauce and season to taste with white pepper.  Stir-fry an additional 5 minutes and serve. 

Variation:  Rather than add the egg to the rice, you can whisk it and make a thin omelette.  Once cooked, julienne the omelette and place some over each serving of fried rice. 

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the wok.  Add the shallots and brown lightly.  Add the rice and stir-fry until heated through.  Stir in the fish sauce, soy sauce, chicken broth, hot chili sauce and sugar.  Stir and toss until the rice is well coated with the seasonings.  Add the scrambled eggs, meats and vegetables.  Stir until heated through. 

Transfer the fried rice to a large heated platter.  Sprinkle with white pepper and garnish with the coriander sprigs.

  1 2/3           cups  long-grain white rice
  6                     dried Chinese mushrooms - (abt 1 1/2" dia)

  2              large  scallions

Day before -- Prepare rice.  Bring 6 quarts of unsalted water to a boil over high heat in a large, heavy pot.  Stirring constantly, slowly pour in the rice in a thin stream.  Reduce the heat to moderate and let the rice boil uncovered for about 15 minutes, or until the grains are somewhat tender but are still slightly firm to the bite.  Drain the rice in a large sieve, fluffing it with a fork.  Transfer rice to a large bowl and set it aside to cool to room temperature.  Cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate overnight or for at least 12 hours. 

Day of -- Place mushrooms in a small bowl containing 1 1/2 cups hot water.  Soak for at least 30 minutes until soft.  Remove mushrooms.  Discard water.  Rinse mushrooms of any remaining grit and cut off and discard any stems.  Slice each cap crosswise into 1/2-inch strips. 

Cut onion in half lengthwise and slice lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips.  Wash and trim scallions, keeping most of the green tops.  Cut scallions into 1-inch pieces and slice pieces lengthwise into 1/4-inch side strips. 

Shell the shrimp.  Devein.  Chop into 1/4-inch bits and set aside. 

Cut sausage into 1 1/8-inch slices.  Fry the sausages in a wok over moderate heat, stirring constantly for about 2 minutes, or until the slices are delicately browned on both sides and the edges are crisp.  Drain on absorbent paper. 

Heat 1/4 cup oil in wok.  Drop in the onions and stirring constantly, cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are soft.  Regulate heat to prevent browning.  Add mushrooms, then the chilled rice and stirring constantly with a fork, cook for about 3 minutes, or until the rice is heated through. 

Stir in the fish sauce.  Push the rice to the edge of the wok to make a well in the center.  Pour in the remaining oil and drop the shrimp into it.  Without stirring rice, cook the shrimp, for about 2 minutes, turning as they become firm and pink. 

Mix the shrimp into the rice and still stirring, cook over moderate heat for 5 minutes.  Do not let the rice brown.  Stir in the crab meat and the sausage and cook for 2 minutes.  Break eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition. 

Mix in the scallions and taste for seasoning;  add salt or more fish sauce if rice seems too bland.  Serve the fried rice mounded on a large heated platter or bowl.

Recipe By     :Nicole Rauthier, "The Foods of Vietnam"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables                      Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
                        Vegetable Platter
  8             ounces  rice vermicelli (bun) or 2 bunches
                        Japanese alimentary paste noodles (somen)
                        Peanut Sauce or Nuoc Cham -- (see recipes)
                        === FILLING ===
  1              ounce  cellophane (bean thread) noodles
  1         tablespoon  dried tree ear mushrooms
  6                     dried Chinese mushrooms
  1              large  carrot -- finely shredded
  1              large  leek, white part only -- chopped
  6                     water chestnuts or 1/2 small Jicama -- peeled and chopped
  1              pound  firm bean curd (tofu) -- crumbled
  1                cup  fresh bean sprouts -- coarsely chopped
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  2                     eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === ASSEMBLY AND FRYING ===
     1/2           cup  Ssugar
  40             small  rice papers rounds (banh trang) 6 1/2"
                        Peanut oil -- for frying

Prepare the Vegetable Platter, noodles and dipping sauce.  Set aside. 

Soak the celophane noodles in warm water and the mushrooms in hot water for 30 minutes; drain.  Cut the noodles into 1/2-inch lengths.  Remove and discard the stems from the mushrooms; squeeze to extract most of the soaking liquid.  Mince all of the mushrooms. 

Combine all of the filling ingredients in a large mixing bowl; blend well with your hands.  Set aside. 

Assemble the rolls:  Fill a large bowl with 4 cups of warm water and dissolve the sugar in it.  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with only 4 sheets at a time, keeping the remaining sheets covered with a barely damp cloth to prevent curling.  Immerse the rice paper, one sheet at a time, into the sweetened warm water.  Quickly withdraw it and lay it flat on a dry towel.  Do this with 4 sheets without letting them touch each other.  The rice paper will become pliable within seconds.  Fold over the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Press it into a compact rectangle.  Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then the other side.  Roll from the bottom to the top to completely enclose the filling.  Continue until all of the mixture is used.  (The rolls can be prepared 1 day in advance.  Wrap and refrigerate.) 

Fry the rolls:  If possible use 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2 inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325 degrees.  Working in batches, add some of the rolls without letting them touch, or they will stick together.  Fry for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and crisp.  Remove the rolls from the oil with tongs and drain on paper towels.  Keep warm in a low oven until all of the rolls are cooked. 

To serve, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with some noodles and selected items from the Vegetable Platter and dips the package in the dipping sauce. 

NOTE:  The fried rolls can be frozen, then thawed and reheated in a 350 degree oven just to crisp and heat through. 

This recipe yields 40 rolls. 

Comments:  The book notes that true Buddhist vegetarians would not use garlic or fish sauce and would limit the dips to plain soy or plum sauce.  Unless you are in this category, Peanut Sauce (Nuoc Leo) and Nuoc Cham are great dips as well.

  2              small  red bell peppers -- each cut into
                        eighths
  1              bunch  scallions -- cut into 2" sections
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Coriander sprigs -- for garnish

Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet.  Add the ribs and cook on both sides until browned, about 25 minutes.  Add the sugar and stir for 10 minutes. 

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the wok.  Add the fish sauce and soy sauce and stir for 5 minutes.  Add the onions, garlic, bell peppers and scallions.  Stir-fry for 3 minutes longer, or until the onions are lightly browned and the peppers are slightly soft. 

Remove to a serving platter.  Sprinkle with white pepper and garnish with coriander sprigs.  Serve with rice. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                     Green Papaya Salad - {Goi Du Du}

Recipe By     :Corinne Trang, "Authentic Vietnamese Cooking: Food from a Fa
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  green papaya or green mango - (abt) -- peeled, halved
                        lengthwise, and seeded
                        Juice of 2 limes or lemons
  3        tablespoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2                     red bird's eye or Thai chilies -- seeded and julienned
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped unsalted roasted peanuts
  4             sprigs  cilantro -- root ends and
                        tough stems removed

Cut the papaya or mango into matchstick strips.  Whisk together the lime juice, fish sauce and sugar in a bowl until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Add the papaya and chilies and toss until well combined.  Let stand for 20 minutes. 

Transfer to a serving plate, sprinkle with peanuts and garnish with cilantro. 

Variation: Bring water to a boil in two separate saucepans over medium heat.  Add 6 small to medium shrimp in one saucepan and cook until opaque, about one minute.  Add a 4-ounce piece of pork tenderloin to the other saucepan and simmer until cooked through, about 8 minutes.  Remove the shrimp and run under cold water, then shell, cut in half lengthwise and devein.  When cool enough to handle, thinly slice the pork tenderloin against the grain.  Proceed with step 1 tossing in the shrimp and pork tenderloin. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Goi Du Du is a refreshing salad with tangy, sweet and spicy characteristics perfect with any barbecued meat.  It is also a great appetizer.  Its principal ingredient, green papaya, sometimes called pawpaw, varies in shape from round to elongated.  It has dark green skin and light green flesh.  Green papaya is used as a vegetable because, unlike the rich, orange-colored papaya, it is mild, not sweet and crunchy.  When green papaya is not available, use green mango.  Both can be purchased in Asian or Latin markets. 

One hint:  For a heartier variation of goi du du, add steamed shrimp and sliced cooked pork tenderloin.

                    Grilled Dried Beef - {Thit Bo Kho}

Recipe By     :Nicole Rauthier, "The Foods of Vietnam"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lean bottom round or sirloin -- in one piece
                        about 6" in diameter
  2                     fresh lemon grass stalks
                        (or 2 tbspns dried lemon grass)
  2              small  red chile peppers -- seeded
  2 1/2    tablespoons  sugar or honey
  1         tablespoon  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  3        tablespoons  light soy sauce

Cut the beef across the grain onto very thin 3- by 3-inch slices.  If you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and upper half of the stalk.  Cut into thin slices and finely chop.  If you are using dried lemon grass, soak in warm water for 1 hour.  Drain and finely chop. 

Combine the chiles and sugar in a mortar and pestle and pound to a fine paste.  Add the chopped lemon grass, fish sauce and soy sauce and stir to blend.  (If using a blender, combine all of these and blend to a very fine paste.)  Spread the paste over the beef pieces to coat both sides.  Let marinate for 30 minutes. 

Spread out each slice of marinated beef on a large, flat wire rack or baking sheet.  Let stand in the sun until both sides are completely dried, about 12 hours.  (You can also place a rack on a jelly roll pan and let the beef dry in the refrigerator for 2 days.) 

Grill the beef over a medium charcoal fire or transfer the rack from the refrigerator to the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven and bake until brown and crisp, about 10 minutes.  Serve with glutinous rice. 

Note:  After cooking, the meat may be kept for up to 1 week in a covered jar at room temperature. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  Here's a Vietnamese version of beef "jerky" made with red chilies and honey or sugar that sounds like it's off in the direction of your Chinese Dried Fried Beef recipe.  This Vietnamese-style "beef Jerky" is delicious served with drinks.  The Vietnamese enjoy eating it as a snack with glutinous rice.  It is also an ingredient in Green Papaya Salad.

<DirS>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Cut the beef across the grain onto very thin 3- by 3-inch slices.  If you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and upper half of the stalk.  Cut into thin slices and finely chop.  If you are using dried lemon grass, soak in warm water for 1 hour.  Drain and finely chop. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Combine the chiles and sugar in a mortar and pestle and pound to a fine paste.  Add the chopped lemon grass, fish sauce and soy sauce and stir to blend.  (If using a blender, combine all of these and blend to a very fine paste.)  Spread the paste over the beef pieces to coat both sides.  Let marinate for 30 minutes. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Spread out each slice of marinated beef on a large, flat wire rack or baking sheet.  Let stand in the sun until both sides are completely dried, about 12 hours.  (You can also place a rack on a jelly roll pan and let the beef dry in the refrigerator for 2 days.) 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Grill the beef over a medium charcoal fire or transfer the rack from the refrigerator to the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven and bake until brown and crisp, about 10 minutes.  Serve with glutinous rice. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Note:  After cooking, the meat may be kept for up to 1 week in a covered jar at room temperature. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  Here&apos;s a Vietnamese version of beef &quot;jerky&quot; made with red chilies and honey or sugar that sounds like it&apos;s off in the direction of your Chinese Dried Fried Beef recipe.  This Vietnamese-style &quot;beef Jerky&quot; is delicious served with drinks.  The Vietnamese enjoy eating it as a snack with glutinous rice.  It is also an ingredient in Green Papaya Salad.

              Grilled Lemon Grass Beef Cubes - {Bo Nuong Xa}

Recipe By     :Corinne Trang, "Authentic Vietnamese Cooking: Food from a Fa
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1         tablespoon  thick soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- plus additional
                        for the pan, if using
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2                     lemon grass stalks -- outer leaves and
                        tough green tops removed, root ends
                        trimmed and stalks finely minced
  2              large  garlic cloves -- crushed, peeled,
                        and finely chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  beef sirloin -- cut into 1" cubes
                        Bamboo skewers -- soaked in water
                        for 20 minutes
                        Table Salad - {Sa Lach Dia} -- (see recipe)
                        Traditional Herbs - {Rau} -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped unsalted roasted peanuts -- (optional)
                        Fish Dipping Sauce - {Nuoc Cham} -- (see recipe)

For the beef:  In a medium bowl, stir together the fish sauce, soy sauce, oil and sugar until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Add the lemon grass, garlic, and beef and stir to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.  Soak the bamboo skewers. 

Meanwhile prepare the Table Salad and Traditional Herbs. 

Slide 2 to 4 cubes of beef onto each skewer, depending on how long the skewers are, discarding the marinade. 

Preheat the grill or broiler or set a lightly oiled grill pan or nonstick skillet over high heat.  Grill, broil or sear the beef skewers until well browned on each side and crisp on the edges, about 1 minute per side.  Remove the beef from the skewers.  Set aside. 

For the assembly:  Toss the beef cubes with a little from each of the table salad items and Traditional Herbs.  Serve on individual plates or in large soup bowls (as is traditional), sprinkle with peanuts, drizzle with oil and Nuoc Cham and toss to combine well. 

* Note: Rice papers are traditionally used to wrap grilled meats. First, however, they must be soaked in lukewarm water to cover for about 3 minutes and drained on paper towels. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  This is an excellent way to prepare beef.  Marinated in lemon grass, fish sauce and sugar, it is robust in flavor, yet relatively light.  It is best grilled, which not only crisps the meat but gives it a smoky flavor.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1         tablespoon  thick soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     lemongrass stalks -- outer leaves and

Soak bamboo skewers for 20 minutes and drain. 

In a medium bowl stir together the fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and oil until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Add lemongrass, shallot, garlic, and pork, and mix to coat pork evenly.  Allow to marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour. 

Depending on how long the skewers are, slide 2 to 4 slices of pork onto each skewer so the meat is flat with the skewer threaded through each slice several times. 

Heat a well-oiled grill pan or nonstick skillet over high heat.  Grill pork in batches until the edges are crisp, about 1 minute per side.  Grill remaining pork tenderloin, oiling grill pan if necessary. 

Place skewers on Table Salad.  Sprinkle with peanuts, and drizzle with Fish Dipping Sauce.

                Grilled Lemongrass Prawns - {Tom Nuong Xa}

Recipe By     :Corinne Trang, "Authentic Vietnamese Cooking: Food from a Fa
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Seafood
                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16                    king prawns 8" to 9" long
                        or 24 medium prawns 4" to 5" long -- heads, shells intact
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2                     lemongrass stalks -- outer leaves and
                        tough green tops removed, root ends
                        trimmed, and finely ground
  1                     unripe star fruit -- sliced into thin
                        stars, (optional)

With a paring knife, make an incision through the shell along the back of the prawns.  Devein, leaving the shell intact; rinse the prawns and pat dry. 

Whisk together the sugar and fish sauce in a bowl until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Stir in the oil and lemongrass.  Add the prawns, and toss running your fingertips between the flesh and shells.  Place the prawns in a plastic bag and seal the bag.  Marinate the prawns, refrigerated, 2 to 3 hours, turning the bag over every 30 minutes or so. 

Grill over a barbecue (make sure the flames have subsided, and coals are red with white ashes), or in a well-oiled grill pan over medium-high heat, until prawns are cooked through and turn pink, about 3 minutes per side for king prawns, and 2 minutes for medium prawns.  Serve with star fruit on the side. 

Variation:  Muc nuong xa, grilled lemongrass squid, is equally delicious.  Substitute 1 pound whole squid, skinned and cleaned, for the prawns.  In Step 2, marinate for 1 hour, and in step 3, grill for 1 to 2 minutes, depending on the size of the squid. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  The best prawns for this recipe are king prawns, measuring about 8 to 9 inches long.  Plump and tender but firm, their heads that are full of sweet tomalley.  If these are not available, use medium prawns, usually about 5 to 6 inches long.  Marinated in a combination of lemongrass, fish sauce, and sugar, either is excellent grilled over a barbecue or in a grill pan any time of the year. 

If you cannot find fresh or frozen lemongrass, substitute garlic or ginger; although much different in flavor, the result will be equally tasty.  The optional star fruit slices are used not only as a beautiful garnish but also because the sourness is a perfect compliment to the sweetness and saltiness of the dish.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  cleaned squid
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/2           cup  cilantro leaves
                        Fish Sauce Dip -- (see recipe)
                        === MARINADE ===
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  2                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1           teaspoon  five-spice powder
  1           teaspoon  curry powder
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped lemongrass
  1         tablespoon  thick soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  1           teaspoon  sugar

Rub the squid with salt and rinse.  Slit and flatten the squid sac and make diagonal cuts on the inside surface.  Cut into bite-sized pieces.  Combine marinade ingredients, then marinate squid for 1 hour. 

Grill squid over a charcoal grill, until just tender (about 2 minutes each side).  Arrange on a serving platter and garnish with cilantro.  Serve with Fish Sauce Dip. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  Grilled meats and seafood are very popular in Vietnam and many recipes, like this one, rely upon the specific flavors imparted from the open wood burning grill. 

Helpful hint:  This is a versatile marinade, suitable for other types of fish or poultry.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  beef bones with marrow
  5             pounds  oxtails
  2             pounds  short rib plate or 1 lb steak
  2              large  onions -- unpeeled, halved,
                        and studded with
  8                     whole cloves
  3                     shallots -- unpeeled
  2             ounces  fresh ginger root -- unpeeled one piece
  8                     star anise
  1                     cinnamon stick
  4             medium  parsnips -- cut 2" pieces
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1              pound  beef sirloin
  2                     scallions -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  shredded coriander
  2             medium  onions -- sliced paper-thin
     1/4           cup  hot chili sauce (tuong ot
                        or sriracha sauce)
  1              pound  dried 1/4"-wide rice sticks (banh pho)
     1/2           cup  Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
  2               cups  fresh bean sprouts
  2                     fresh red chile peppers -- sliced
  2                     limes -- cut into wedges
  1              bunch  fresh mint -- separated leaves
  1              bunch  fresh Asian (holy) basil -- separated leaves

In order to cut the beef into paper-thin slices, freeze the pieces of meat for 30 minutes before slicing. 

The night before, clean the bones under cold running water and soak overnight in a pot with water to cover at room temperature.  (This will help loosen the impurities inside the bones.  When heat is applied, these impurities are released and come to the top much faster and can be removed, therefore, producing a clear broth.) 

Place the beef bones, oxtails and short rib plate in a large stockpot.  Add water to cover and bring to a boil.  Cook for 10 minutes.  Drain.  Rinse the pot and the bones. 

Return the bones to the pot and add 6 quarts of water.  Bring to a boil.  Skim the surface to remove the foam and fat.  Stir the bones in the bottom of the pot from time to time to free the impurities.  Continue skimming until the foam ceases to rise.  Add 3 quarts more water and bring to a boil.  Skim off all the residue that forms on the top.  Turn the heat to low and simmer. 

Meanwhile, char the clove-studded onions, shallots and ginger directly over a gas burner or under the broiler until they release their fragrant odors.  Tie the charred vegetables, star anise and cinnamon stick in a double thickness of dampened cheesecloth.  Add the spice bag, parsnips and salt to the simmering broth.  Simmer for 1 hour. 

Remove the short rib plates.  Pull the meat away from the bones.  Reserve the meat and return the bones to the pot.  Simmer the broth, uncovered, for 4 to 5 hours.  Keep an eye on it; as the liquid boils away, add enough fresh water to cover the bones. 

Meanwhile, slice the beef sirloin against the grain into paper-thin slices, roughly 2 by 2-inches in size.  Slice the reserved short rib meat paper-thin.  Set aside. 

In a small bowl, combine the scallions, coriander and half of the slice onions.  Place the remaining sliced onions in a small bowl and stir in the hot chili sauce.  Blend well. 

Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes.  Drain and set aside. 

When the broth is ready, remove and discard all of the bones.  Strain the broth through a strainer or colander lined with a double layer of dampened cheesecloth into a clean pot.  Add the fish sauce and bring the broth to a boil.  Reduce the heat and keep the broth at a bare simmer. 

In another pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil.  Drain the noodles, then drop them in the boiling water.  Drain immediately. 

Divide the noodles among 4 large soup bowls.  Top the noodles with the sliced meats.  Bring the broth to a rolling boil.  Ladle the broth directly over the meat in each bowl (the boiling broth will cook the raw beef instantly).  Garnish with the scallion mixture and freshly ground white pepper.  Serve the onions in hot chili sauce and the accompaniments on the side.  Each diner will add these ingredients as desired. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  This sublime recipe comes from my mother, a native of Hanoi.  She always made the beef stock in large quantities -- enough for at least 3 meals -- and froze it in batches until needed.

              Hanoi Chicken And Rice Noodle Soup - {Pho Ga}

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Soups/Stews                     Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  small or medium dried rice sticks
  8               cups  chicken stock
  8             ounces  chicken breast -- thinly sliced
                        against the grain
                        Traditional Herbs - {Rau} -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  mung bean sprouts -- root ends trimmed
  2                     or more bird's eye or Thai chilies -- stemmed, seeded,
                        and thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  fried shallots
  1                     lime -- quartered
                        Fish sauce (nuoc mam) -- to taste

Place the rice sticks in a dish with lukewarm water to cover.  Let stand until pliable, about 20 minutes. 

Meanwhile, pour the chicken stock into a pot and bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and partially cover until ready to use. 

Bring a pot filled with water to a boil over high heat.  Drain and divide the rice stick noodles into 4 equal portions.  Place noodles, one portion at a time, in a sieve and lower it into the boiling water.  Untangle the noodles with chopsticks and boil until tender but firm, about 7 seconds.  Remove and drain the noodles, then place them in a large soup bowl.  Repeat this step until you have 4 individual servings. 

Blanch the chicken pieces in the same boiling water for about 2 minutes per batch.  Divide and place atop each noodle serving.  Pour a generous amount of hot broth over each serving and garnish with some traditional herbs, mung bean sprouts, chilies, and fried shallots.  Squeeze a wedge of lime over each serving and adjust the seasoning with fish sauce. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Trieu Thi Choi and Marcell Isaak, "The Food of Vietnam"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pancakes                        Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  rice flour
  1 1/2           cups  water
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  1              small  pinch salt
  1           teaspoon  superfine sugar
     1/4           cup  mung beans - (optional) -- soaked overnight,
                        and steamed for 15 minutes
     1/2           cup  finely-sliced straw mushrooms
  3 1/2         ounces  small shrimp -- boiled and peeled
  3             strips  thinly-sliced cooked lean pork
                        (or 3 rashers of bacon, cooked)
     1/2           cup  bean sprouts
     1/4           cup  chopped spring onions
                        Fragrant herb sprigs (basil, mint
                        perilla and wild betel leaves)
     1/2           cup  iceberg lettuce leaves
  2        tablespoons  cooking oil
  1                cup  Soy Sauce Dip -- (see recipe)

Blend rice flour with water, eggs, salt and sugar, leave to rest for 10 minutes, then strain. 

Add one tablespoon of oil to the flying pan, and swirl it around.  Turn heat on high.  Ladle the rice flour mix into the hot pan, swirl it around quickly, then add the mung beans and mushrooms.  Cook covered for 1 minute. 

Remove the lid.  Add the shrimp, pork, bean sprouts and spring onions.  Cook uncovered until the pancake is golden brown and crispy. 

Serve with fragrant herbs, lettuce and Soy Sauce Dip. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  The Vietnamese version of an open-faced omelet or crÍpe, this specialty of many streetside restaurants is also called the "Happy Pancake."  The Vietnamese name, khoai, comes from the type of pan it is cooked in.  Banh xeo is the large southern version. 

Helpful hints:  Timing is very important in cooking this dish.  It should be prepared over a very high heat (to crisp the pancake).  An 8- to 10-inch non-stick pan is ideal.  The pancake should be wafer thin.

                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  long-grain rice, such as jasmine
  2 3/4           cups  chicken stock
  3                     shallots or 1 small red onion -- peeled and minced
  1                cup  julienned or finely-chopped mint leaves
  1              pound  cooked chicken breast meat -- skinned and shredded
                        Nuoc Cham -- (see recipe)

Put the rice in a bowl with a few cups of water.  Gently swirl your fingers in the bowl to allow the starch to separate from the grains.  Once the water becomes white, drain and repeat this process twice more.  With each time, the water will get less cloudy.  The idea is not to get rid of all the starch, just enough so that the rice will not be too sticky or too dry when cooked.  Three times has always given me the best results.  Put the rice in a sieve and drain until the rice is fairly dry. 

Put the rice and chicken stock in a medium clay pot or heavy-bottomed pot and stir to level the rice.  Cover the pot and cook the rice over medium heat until it has absorbed all the stock, about 25 minutes.  Turn off the heat and with a wooden spoon stir in shallots, mint, and chicken until evenly mixed.  Allow to rest covered for 5 to 10 minutes.  Drizzle nuoc cham over each serving. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled and minced
  1                     or more bird's eye or Thai chilies -- seeded and minced
  3             ounces  unsalted roasted peanuts -- 1 tbspn chopped,
                        the rest finely ground (not into butter)
  1                cup  chicken stock
     1/3           cup  canned unsweetened coconut milk
  1         tablespoon  hoisin sauce
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1         tablespoon  sugar

Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Stir-fry the garlic and chilies until fragrant, about 5 minutes.  Add the ground peanuts and stir until they give up some of their natural oil, about 5 minutes more. 

Add the chicken stock, coconut milk, hoisin sauce, fish sauce, and sugar, and bring just to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to low and cook until the oil from the peanuts starts surfacing, about 15 minutes.  Transfer sauce to a heatproof serving bowl, garnish with chopped peanuts, and serve. 

This recipe yields about 2 cups. 

Comments:  Throughout Southeast Asia, there are many recipes for peanut sauce, but the Vietnamese version is the lightest one I have ever tasted.  It seems that you can have the authentic one only in Vietnam or at home.  Most of the time in Vietnamese restaurants, peanut butter is mixed with hoisin sauce and some ground peanuts are tossed in.  The result is very pasty and not very refined.  This peanut sauce is true to the original in Vietnam, being fluid and light.  The secret is the chicken stock, which lightens the sauce and allows you to taste all the ingredients.

                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             quarts  water
  1         tablespoon  alum
  2               cups  distilled white vinegar
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2             pounds  pigs' ears

Boil 2 quarts of the water with the alum for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat and allow to cool. 

Boil the vinegar with the sugar and salt for a few minutes, or until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Remove from the heat and cool. 

Boil the remaining 2 quarts water and drop in the pigs' ears.  Boil for 20 minutes.  Remove the pigs' ears and cut them into lengthwise slices 1/4-inch wide.  After the sliced pigs' ears have cooled, return them to the alum water to soak for 2 hours, then drain and rinse under cold water.  Dry lightly. 

Place the pigs' ears in a jar, pressing them down.  Pour in enough cooled vinegar mixture to completely cover the contents of the jar.  Refrigerate. 

Note:  This can be eaten after 3 days and will keep for several weeks in the refrigerator. 

This recipe yields 2 quarts. 

Comments:  Lip-smacking, tangy, chewy, and exotic, these morsels go perfectly with drinks before dinner, and very well without drinks at any time.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  carrots -- peeled, and cut
                        into 2" long matchsticks
  3        tablespoons  coarse sea salt
  1              pound  daikon -- peeled, and cut
                        into 2" long by 1/2" wide thin planks
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  white rice vinegar
  1 1/2         pounds  cucumber -- peeled, halved
                        lengthwise
                        and sliced diagonally 1/8" thick

Put the carrots in a sieve set over a bowl.  Toss carrots with 1 tablespoon of the salt and let stand to get rid of excess water, about 45 minutes.  Gently press carrots against the sieve to remove any remaining moisture.  Rinse and drain.  Place the carrots in a clean kitchen towel, then twist the towel to squeeze out any excess water. 

Repeat the process using the daikon. 

Whisk together the sugar and vinegar until sugar is completely dissolved.  Divide this pickling mixture among 3 quart-size plastic bags, and set 1 bag aside to use in Step 4.  Add the carrots and daikon separately to the other 2 bags, seal and toss to coat evenly.  Lay bags flat on a plate and refrigerate at least 24 hours, turning the bags over every hour if possible. 

After about 20 hours, repeat step 1 using the cucumbers.  After draining, place the cucumbers in the third plastic bag of pickling mix, seal, and toss to coat.  Lay the bag flat on a plate and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours, turning bag every hour if possible.  The cucumber needs only 4 to 6 hours to absorb the flavor of the vinegar marinade. 

Drain the carrots, daikon and cucumbers well at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before serving. 

This recipe yields ?? servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     garlic cloves
  2                     shallots or white part of 2 scallions
  1 1/2    tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  6        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  light soy sauce
     3/8      teaspoon  five-spice powder
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2         pound  pork shoulder with rind, or pork butt

In a mortar, mash the garlic, shallots, and sugar; add the fish sauce, water, soy sauce, five-spice powder, and white pepper. 

Heat the vegetable oil in a small saucepan over a high flame.  Drop the pork into the pot to brown.  Keep covered, uncovering only to turn the meat from time to time.  After the meat is well browned, add the sauce mixture.  Cover and turn the flame down to medium. 

After 15 minutes, turn the pork in the sauce to color the meat.  Continue cooking for another 15 minutes, covered, uncovering periodically to check the progress of the cooking.  When you see only small bubbles and about 5 tablespoons of liquid, the cooking is completed. 

Remove the meat and allow to cool slightly, then slice, arrange on a plater and pour the remaining sauce over. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  cabbage -- diced
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  crushed ginger root
  2               cups  vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped polygonum (rau ram) leaves

Sprinkle the cabbage with salt and ginger and allow to stand for 30 minutes.  With a dry towel, press the excess moisture from the cabbage (a salad spinner works well here). 

Place cabbage in a jar.  Mix vinegar, sugar and rau ram, and pour over the cabbage until completely covered.  After 1 day, as the cabbage begins to ferment, bubbles will appear.  When the liquid in the jar is clear and the bubbles are gone (roughly 3 days later), it is ready to eat. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  small or medium dried rice sticks
  8               cups  pork stock made with dried shrimp
                        and preserved cabbage
  1              pound  ground pork
  1                cup  cilantro leaves
  1                cup  mung bean sprouts -- root ends trimmed
  2                     scallions, white parts only -- thinly sliced
                        on the diagonal
  2                     bird's eye or Thai chilies - (to 3) -- steammed, seeded,
                        and thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  Fried Garlic Oil -- see * Note
  1                     lime -- quartered
                        Fish sauce (nuoc mam) -- to taste

* Note:  See the "Scallion Oil - {Hanh La Phi}" recipe for the "Toi Phi Dau" variation. 

Place the rice sticks in a dish with lukewarm water to cover.  Let stand until pliable, about 20 minutes. 

Pour the pork stock into a pot and bring to a gently boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low.  Place some ground pork in a ladle and slowly lower it into the stock.  Allowing some stock into the ladle, with a pair of chopsticks, stir the ground pork until it separates, then let it go into the stock.  Continue this process until you have added all the ground pork to the stock, and gently simmer for 30 minutes. 

Bring a pot filled with water to a boil over high heat.  Drain and divide the rice stick noodles into 4 equal portions.  Place them, one portion at a time, in a sieve and lower it into the boiling water.  Untangle the noodles with chopsticks and boil until tender but firm, about 7 seconds.  Remove and drain the noodles, then place them in a large soup bowl.  Repeat this step until you have 4 individual servings. 

Pour a generous amount of hot broth, along with an equal amount of ground pork, dried shrimp, and preserved tien sin cabbage, over each serving and garnish with some cilantro leaves, mung bean sprouts, scallions, chilies, and fried garlic oil.  Squeeze a wedge of lime over each serving and adjust the seasoning with fish sauce. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              small  shallot -- peeled and minced
     3/4           cup  short-grain rice
  8             ounces  ground beef or ground pork
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped roasted peanuts
  1                cup  cilantro leaves
  2                     scallions -- trimmed and sliced
                        into thin rounds
     1/4           cup  Fried Garlic Oil -- see * Note

Add 8 cups water and bring it to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/2 hours. 

Add the ground beef a bit at a time so the beef stays separated; stir for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the beef is completely cooked.  Divide the soup among 4 to 6 soup bowls.  Garnish each serving with some peanuts, cilantro, scallions, and Fried Garlic Oil.  Season with fish sauce and pepper. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  vegetable oil
  6                     scallions -- root ends and
                        tough green tops removed, thinly sliced

Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Add the scallions and fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool, then transfer to a heatproof jar. 

This recipe yields about 1 cup. 

Variation:  Toi phi dau, fried garlic oil, is especially complementary to seafood soups such as canh ca nau dua, pineapple and fish soup, and hu tieu do bien, noodle with seafood soup.  Reminiscent of roasted garlic in flavor and aroma, it should be used sparingly, as a little will go a long way. 

Heat 3 to 4 cups vegetable oil in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Add 8 peeled and minced large cloves of garlic and fry until light golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.  Allow to cool briefly and transfer the fried garlic and oil to a heat-resistant jar.  Allow to cool completely before sealing with a lid.  Fried garlic oil will keep about a week refrigerated. 

Comments:  Scallion oil, made with thinly sliced scallions and vegetable oil, is commonly brushed over grilled meats, seafood, and steamed meat p‚tÈs, or drizzled over rice or noodles.  There are several ways of making it.  For example, you can heat the oil first, turn it off, and then add the scallions.  Or you can add the scallions to the hot oil and keep the combined ingredients over the flame for just a minute or so.  Feel free to experiment.  Scallion oil can be kept refrigerated for up to a week.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  soy vinaigrette
  2                     white scallions -- cut up
  1 1/2         pounds  beef sirloin cubed
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  5                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2       large bunche  watercress torn
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              small  red onion -- thinly sliced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  dry sherry

Prepare the soy vinaigrette and set aside. 

In a large bowl, combine the beef with the garlic, soy sauce, sugar, sherry, scallion, pepper, and 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Cover and refrigerate 3 hours or overnight. 

When ready to serve, put the watercress and onion on a large platter and toss with the vinaigrette.

Let it sit in the pan undisturbed, until it forms a brown crust on the bottom, about 1 minute.  Now, shake the pan to release the beef, using chopsticks if needed.  Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, to desired doneness, about 4 minutes for medium-rare.  Spoon the hot beef over the watercress and serve. 

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  raw shrimp -- shelled and deveined
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepepr
  1             medium  potato -- peeled, and cut
                        paper thin, then cut very thin shoestring
                        slices
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable oil
                        Nuoc Cham -- (see recipe)

Wash the shrimp and dry well.  Mash half of the shrimp to a paste using a mortar and pestle, a blender, or a food processor.  Cut the remaining shrimp in half, lengthwise, and set aside. 

Put the flour in a bowl and add the water gradually, stirring until smooth; the batter should have the consistency of thick cream.  Add salt and pepper.  Transfer the shrimp paste to the batter.  Stir well to combine, then add the potato. 

In a wok or deep saucepan, heat the oil to 375 degrees.  With a round, shallow ladle, scoop up about 2 tablespoons of the batter.  Place a whole shrimp in the batter in the ladle.  Drop into the hot oil and fry for about 1 minute, then turn over.  Fry until the batter is a light golden brown and the shrimp is pink, about 3 minutes in all.  Serve hot or cold, with soft lettuce and Nuoc Cham. 

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                 Shrimp Mousse On Sugar Cane - {Chao Tom}

Recipe By     :Trieu Thi Choi and Marcell Isaak, "The Food of Vietnam"
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            ounces  shrimp -- minced (1 1/4 cups)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1              pinch  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  8                     sugar cane pieces - (ea 4" long)
  1                     red chili -- seeded and sliced
  1                cup  Sweet And Sour Sauce -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  cilantro leaves

Grind or pound shrimp with salt, sugar and pepper.  Using the oil, form the shrimp paste around the sugar cane until tight.  Grill over medium charcoal heat until crisp and slightly browned. 

Serve with chili, Sweet and Sour Sauce and cilantro leaves. 

This recipe yields 8 pieces. 

Comments:  This is a very important Vietnamese dish, from the imperial capital of Hue.  It uses fresh sticks of sugar cane as skewers.  The heated cane releases a burst of sweet cane juice when bitten into. 

Helpful hints:  Although the pounding is normally done in a mortar, you can use a blender or a food processor.  Crab is a good substitute for shrimp.  If grilling is not possible, oven bake at 375 degrees for about 20 minutes.

                 Shrimp On Crab Legs - {Cang Cua Boc Tom}

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10                    crab legs or several hard shell crabs
                        shrimp paste -- prepared as for
                        Shrimp on Sugar Cane -- (see recipe)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
                        === NUOC CHAM ===
  1                     garlic clove
     1/2                fresh hot red chili pepper
                        (or 2 dried hot red chili peppers)
  2          teaspoons  granulated sugar - (heaping)
     1/8                fresh lime
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  2 1/2    tablespoons  water -- more if necessary

Boil the crab legs or crabs for about 10 minutes, then drain and cool; remove the claws from the crabs, if using, and reserve the bodies for another purpose. 

Have the shrimp paste ready; preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 

Pour the oil into a bowl.  Dip your fingers into the oil and pick up 2 tablespoons of the shrimp paste.  Mold it into an oval around and halfway down the crab claw, covering the part of the claw where it was attached to the body; this will leave a claw tip extended to serve as a handle.  Place the claws on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. 

Note:  In Vietnam, this dish is always barbecued over charcoal.  If you wish to prepare it this way, cook for 10 minutes on each side. 

Serve with Nuoc Cham and watercress. 

For the Nuoc Cham:  Peel the garlic.  Split the chili pepper down the center and remove the seeds and membrane.  Cut into pieces and put into a mortar, together with the garlic and sugar.  Pound into a paste.  Squeeze the lime juice into the paste, then with a small knife remove the pulp from the lime section and add it as well.  Mash this mixture and add the fish sauce and water. 

Note:  If you find this a trifle strong at first, dilute it with an additional 1/2 tablespoon of water. 

This recipe yields 10 legs. 

Comments:  Here we have a party dish that will bring out "oohs" and "ahs" from your guests on sight -- and a repeat performance on taste. 

Crab claws, alone, are sometimes available in fish stores.  If they aren't, boil several hard shell crabs and use the claws; you can use the bodies in many other dishes. 

The crab claws in fish stores are already partially peeled and serve not only as a handle but are edible as well.  If you prepare your own claws, peel the upper section around which you mold the shrimp paste. 

This exciting sauce is almost always served at Vietnamese meals, just as Westerners serve salt and pepper.  It's base is nuoc mam (bottled fish sauce).  Freshly prepared, it is a constant delight, and so addictive to Western palettes that it will appear with meals other than Vietnamese.  To best appreciate the results of its superb blending qualities at the table, use it sparingly at first, gradually adding more until the result is just right for your palate.

                Sour Fish Head Soup  - {Canh Chua Dau Ca}

Recipe By     :Bach Ngo and Gloria Zimmerman, "The Classic Cuisine of Vietn
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Soups/Stews
                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     scallions, white part only -- crushed with the
                        side of a knife
                        Freshly-ground white pepper
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam) -- plus
  4          teaspoons  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1              large  fish head or fish carcass -- split down the cente
  1              quart  water
     1/2           cup  canned sliced sour bamboo
     1/4                fresh pineapple -- cut in a lengthwise
                        section and sliced
  1               dash  MSG -- (optional)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh coriander (Chinese parsley)
                        Minced scallion greens

Sprinkle the scallions, white pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, and 4 teaspoons fish sauce over the fish head.  Allow to stand for 10 to 15 minutes. 

Bring 1 quart of water to a boil and drop in the sour bamboo and pineapple slices.  Cook at a lively boil for 5 minutes.  Drop fish head into the actively boiling water and, keeping at a boil, add the 2 tablespoons fish sauce, remaining teaspoon salt, and a dash of MSG.  Boil the fish head for a total of 10 minutes.  Transfer to a soup tureen, sprinkle on the coriander and scallion green, and serve. 

Note:  If the fish head is dropped into water that is not boiling, it will fall apart. 

This recipe yields 4 servings. 

Comments:  An excellent way to get twice the pleasure out of your fish purchase.  You can use either the fish head of the fish carcass if you wish.  To the people of the South, this is as much their traditional dish as Southern Fried Chicken is to our southerners -- and it will meet with instant praise

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Bring 1 quart of water to a boil and drop in the sour bamboo and pineapple slices.  Cook at a lively boil for 5 minutes.  Drop fish head into the actively boiling water and, keeping at a boil, add the 2 tablespoons fish sauce, remaining teaspoon salt, and a dash of MSG.  Boil the fish head for a total of 10 minutes.  Transfer to a soup tureen, sprinkle on the coriander and scallion green, and serve.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;Note:  If the fish head is dropped into water that is not boiling, it will fall apart.

<DirT>&#013;&#010;This recipe yields 4 servings. 
</DirT>
<DirT>&#013;&#010;Comments:  An excellent way to get twice the pleasure out of your fish purchase.  You can use either the fish head of the fish carcass if you wish.  To the people of the South, this is as much their traditional dish as Southern Fried Chicken is to our southerners -- and it will meet with instant praise

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  raw shrimp -- shelled, deveined
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated sugar
  2                     scallions,white and green parts
     1/2         pound  pork butt
  1           teaspoon  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  1                     garlic clove
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  10                    dried rice papers (banh trang)

Cut the shrimp into small pieces and sprinkle with the white pepper and the sugar.  Slice the scallions crosswise into very thin slices.  Slice the pork into thin pieces, 3- by 2- by 1/8-inch. 

Combine half the sliced scallion with the shrimp and meat, the fish sauce and a dash of white pepper. 

Chop the garlic fine; place on a platter near the stove, along with the remaining scallions. 

Heat the oil and fry the garlic and remaining scallion briefly until they brown slightly.  Add the pork-shrimp mixture and keep stirring over high heat until cooked, about 5 minutes. 

Cut or break the 10 rice papers into quarters.  Place the cut rice papers on a flat surface.  Using a pastry brush, or your fingers, paint water over the entire surface of each of the pieces; this is to make the brittle papers become soft and flexible.  Try working on about 10 quarters at a time.  This will help you work faster.  While some of the wrappers become pliable, you can be filling the others. 

Place 2 pieces of shrimp and 2 small pieces of pork on the pointed end of a paper, arranging the filling in a square shape.  Bend the pointed end over the filling and roll twice, then fold the sides over and continue to roll into a 2-inch-long cylinder about 1 inch thick.  Place on a tray, with the open end on the underside to prevent unrolling, while you fill the remaining rolls. 

Place the rolls in the oven, directly on the oven rack, without preheating.  (They can be crowded together while baking so that you can get many onto 1 rack.)  Again, be certain to place them open end down; turn the oven to 350 degrees and bake them for about 40 minutes, 20 minutes on each side. 

Note:  These can be filled several hours before cooking, covered with a plastic wrap, and refrigerated.  Or they can be baked and then kept at room temperature for several hours.  They never lose their crispness.  Use bamboo chopsticks or tongs for turning the rolls. 

This recipe yields ?? servings. 

Comments:  For dieters or the cholesterol conscious -- an oven baked version of spring rolls.  In Vietnam these are often baked over charcoal.

                 Stir-Fried Mung Bean Sprouts - {Gia Xao}

Recipe By     :Corinne Trang, "Authentic Vietnamese Cooking: Food from a Fa
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Vegetables                      Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     scallions, white and tender green parts -- cut 1 1/2"-long
                        pieces and halved lengthwise
  1 1/2         pounds  mung bean sprouts -- root ends trimmed
                        and discarded
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Heat the oil in a wok over high heat.  Add the scallions and stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the mung bean sprouts, season with fish sauce and pepper to taste and stir-fry until just beginning to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes.  Serve immediately. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  The mung bean sprout is used raw as a garnish in soups, preserved in salt brine and served as a table condiment and stir-fried with scallions as a main vegetable dish like this one.  A mung bean sprout has a small yellow head and a short, thin white stem.  (It should not be confused with a soybean sprout, which has a large yellow head.)

Bring a pot filled with water to a boil over high heat.  Place the rice vermicelli in a sieve and lower it into the boiling water for 5 seconds.  Remove the vermicelli and transfer to a bowl.  When cool enough to handle, divide the vermicelli into 12 equal portions. 

In the same boiling water, cook the pork tenderloin until cooked through, about 10 minutes.  When cool enough to handle, thinly slice the pork. 

In the same water, cook the shrimp until they turn opaque, about 1 minute.  When cool enough to handle, cut in half lengthwise and devein. 

Pour lukewarm water about 1 inch deep into a square or rectangular dish.  Separate and soak 4 wrappers at a time until pliable, about 5 minutes.  Place a clean kitchen towel on your work surface, then place each rice paper on the towel.  With another kitchen towel, gently blot each wrapper until it is no longer wet but remains sticky. 

Leaving 1 inch uncovered on the side closest to you and the adjacent sides, place a lettuce leaf, vermicelli portion on top, 3 shrimp halves (overlapped), 2 pork slices (overlapped), 2 mint leaves, and some carrot on each rice paper.  Fold wrapper once over the filling, then fold in the sides, and continue rolling tightly to the end. 

Repeat this process with the remaining ingredients to make 12 rolls.  Wrap in a damp towel or with plastic wrap until ready to eat.  Serve with Nuoc Leo. 

This recipe yields 12 rolls for 4 to 6 servings.

                       Table Salad - {Sa Lach Dia}

Recipe By     :Corinne Trang, "Authentic Vietnamese Cooking: Food from a Fa
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  Boston lettuce -- leaves separated,
                        (or 12 small round or triangle rice
                        papers, soaked)
     1/2                cucumber -- peeled, halved,
                        seeds removed, and thinly sliced
  2                     carrots - (to 3) -- peeled, and
                        julienned or shredded
  1                     unripe star fruit -- sliced thin stars
  1                cup  rice vermicelli -- (optional)

Arrange the lettuce (if using) or rice papers, cucumber, carrots, and star fruit on a large serving platter or several plates. 

Place vermicelli (if using) in a dish with lukewarm water to cover.  Let soak until pliable, about 20 minutes.  Bring a pot filled with water to a boil over high heat.  Drain the vermicelli and, working in batches, place them in a sieve and lower into the boiling water.  Untangle the noodles with chopsticks and boil until tender but firm, about 3 seconds.  Drain and set on the plate with the other ingredients. 

Note:  Rice papers are traditionally used to wrap grilled meats.  First, however, they must be soaked in lukewarm water to cover, about 10 minutes, and drained on paper towels.  A combination of lettuce leaves and a small amount of rice vermicelli is also acceptable. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  Traditionally, a table salad -- traditional herbs, cucumbers, carrots, star fruit, and rice vermicelli -- is served with finger foods such as cha gio, spring rolls, nem nuong, grilled pork meatballs, or banh xeo, sizzling "sound" crÍpes.  Often a bit of each ingredient is wrapped around a cooked morsel with a lettuce leaf.  The table salad and wrapper, however, can vary according to the dish you serve.  For example, if you were to serve nem nuong, you would use a softened rice paper rather than a lettuce leaf as a wrapper in order to add starch to the meal.  If you wanted to serve banh xeo, stuffed rice flour crÍpe, the rice vermicelli would be omitted because the crÍpe provides the starch.  It can be a little confusing, but one thing to remember is that your meal must be balanced with vegetable, protein, and starch.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              bunch  cilantro
  1              bunch  mint
  1              bunch  holy (Thai) basil
  1              bunch  saw leaf (ngo gai)

Keeping the stems and leaves intact, clean the cilantro, mint, holy basil, and saw leaves thoroughly, drain on paper towels, and arrange on a plate in individual piles. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  Some of these herbs are hard to get unless you live near a Southeast Asian food market.  Mint and cilantro, however, are available in most markets, lessening the problem of not finding the more exotic herbs.  Italian basil is not a substitute for holy, or Thai, basil, as its flavor is much different.  This traditional herb garnish is used in soups or served alongside the "table salad" to complement grilled or fried meats and seafood dishes.

                    Vegetable Platter - {Dia Rau Song}

Recipe By     :Nicole Rauthier, "The Foods of Vietnam"
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Vegetables
                Vietnamese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  Boston or other soft lettuce -- separated into
                        individual leaves
  1              bunch  scallions -- cut 2" lengths
  1                cup  coriander leaves
  1                cup  mint leaves
  1                cup  fresh Asian or regular basil leaves
  1                     cucumber -- peeled in
                        alternating strips halved lengthwise
                        and sliced thinly crosswise
  4             ounces  fresh bean sprouts
                        Pickled shallots -- (optional)

On a large platter, decoratively arrange all of the ingredients in separate groups.  Use in recipes where required. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  This is a basic thing in Vietnamese cuisine, served with all sorts of grilled foods.  Such uses of raw veggies herbs are one of the things about Vietnamese cuisine that makes it so fresh and appealing. 

Vietnamese meals include an abundance of fresh lettuce, herbs, unripe fruits and raw vegetables.  These are arranged attractively on a platter and are used for wrapping cooked foods at the table, usually dipped in Nuoc Cham and eaten out of hand. 

The following herbs, both very important to the Vietnamese, would be authentic additions to the Vegetable Platter:  One is the "saw leaf herb" (Eryngium foetidium), or ngo gai in Vietnamese), a coriander relative.  The other is polygonum (P. pulchrum or rau ram in Vietnamese), with pinkish stems, pointed green leaves and purplish markings.  They can be found occasionally at Southeast Asian markets. 

If you have access to unripe mango, banana, papaya or apple and star fruit (carambola), add them to the platter.  You may select or substitute the ingredients according to availability and personal taste.

          Vietnamese Beef Grilled In Grape Leaves - {Bo La Lot}

Recipe By     :Corinne Trang, "Authentic Vietnamese Cooking: Food from a Fa
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  ground beef
  1                     shallot -- peeled, sliced thin
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled and minced
  2        tablespoons  minced lemongrass from the white bulb
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  24                    la lot leaves or small grape leaves
                        Bamboo skewers -- soaked in water
                        for 20 minutes and drained
                        Nuoc Cham (Dipping Sauce)

Mix together the beef, shallot, garlic, lemongrass, sugar and fish sauce in a bowl. 

If using grape leaves, rinse, drain and pat them dry.  Put about 2 teaspoons of filling in the center, slightly closer to the wider end.  Fold the wide end over the filling, fold in the sides, and then roll up carefully, making sure the filling is completely and tightly enclosed.  Repeat the process with the remaining leaves and beef mixture. 

Depending on length of skewers, slide 3 to 5 beef rolls crosswise onto each skewer.  Grill over a barbecue (make sure flames have subsided and coals are red, with white ashes) or on a well-oiled grill pan over medium-high heat, about 2 minutes per side.  Serve with Nuoc Cham sauce for dipping. 

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings. 

Comments:  Because la lot leaves are very hard to find in the West, this recipe is usually made using grape leaves, which make an excellent substitute.  Grape leaves are widely available in supermarkets and middle-eastern specialty shops.  This dish is often part of the "Beef Seven Ways" ritual in Vietnamese cooking.

                        Vietnamese Curry - {Cari}

Recipe By     :Bach Ngo and Gloria Zimmerman, "The Classic Cuisine of Vietn
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry                         Vietnamese


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fresh lemon grass stalk
                        (or 1 tbspn dried lemong grass)
  3 1/2      teaspoons  curry powder
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  4           teaspoon  salt
  3             pounds  chicken -- cut up
  7        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3                     sweet potatoes -- peeled, cubed
                        (or 3 white potatoes, peeled and cubed)
  4                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  3                     bay leaves
  1              large  onion -- cut into wedges,
                        and separated
  2               cups  water
  1                     carrot -- cut 2" slices
  2               cups  coconut milk
  1               cups  milk or water - (if you use canned coconut
                        milk, you must use water)

If you are using fresh lemon grass, simply remove the outer leaves and upper two-thirds of the stalks, then cut the remainder into 2-inch lengths.  If you are using dried, it must be soaked in warm water for 2 hours, then drained and chopped fine. 

Combine the curry powder, white pepper, sugar, add salt and marinate the chicken in the mixture for at least 1 hour.  Heat the oil and fry the potatoes over high heat until brown.  (It is not necessary to completely cook potatoes at this point, only to brown them.)  When well browned, remove from the pan and set aside until ready to cook the curry.  Pour off most of the oil from the pan, leaving 2 tablespoons for cooking the chicken. 

Heat 2 tablespoons oil over a high flame.  Fry the garlic for a few seconds, then add the bay leaves, onion, and lemon grass; stir briefly and add the marinated chicken, stirring long enough to sear the meat slightly.  Add the 2 cups of water and carrot, then cover and bring to a boil.  Turn the heat down and simmer for 5 minutes; uncover and stir, then cook, covered, for another 10 minutes.  Remove the cover and add the prefried potatoes, the coconut milk, and the milk.  Cover again and simmer another 15 minutes.  Serve with rice, Rice Sticks, or Japanese Alimentary Paste Noodles. 

This recipe yields 8 servings. 

Comments:  This is a real Vietnamese curry.  Although adapted from the Indian, which is always made with white potatoes, the Vietnamese version has the option of using white or sweet potatoes, the latter being greatly favored by the Vietnamese.  The Indian influence is greatest in the South, where curried dishes are more popular than elsewhere in Vietnam. 

This is usually served with noodles as a party dish.  When it is part of a family meal, it is eaten with rice.  Bach serves this to her children for breakfast, when it is served with French bread -- another influence on the cuisine of Vietnam.
