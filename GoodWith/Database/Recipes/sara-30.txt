--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  medium asparagus -- trimmed
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth -- heated
     1/2           cup  water -- heated
  7             ounces  mild goat cheese
                        = (such as Montrachet)
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated lemon zest -- or to taste
  6                     sheets instant (no-boil) lasagna - (7" by 
  1 2/3           cups  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1                cup  heavy cream

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.

Cut the tips off each asparagus spear and reserve them.  Cut the stalks of asparagus into 1/2-inch lengths.

In each of 2 large shallow baking pans toss half the asparagus stalks with half the oil, and salt to taste coating them well, and roast them, shaking the pans every few minutes, until they are crisp-tender, about 5 to 10 minutes.  Set them aside.  Lower oven temperature to 400 degrees.

In a saucepan melt the butter, add the flour, and cook the roux over moderately-low heat, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the broth and the water in a stream, whisking, simmer the mixture for 5 minutes, and whisk in the goat cheese, zest, and salt, to taste, whisking until the sauce is smooth.

Arrange 1 sheet of pasta in each of buttered 9- by 13-inch baking dishes, and spread each sheet with 1/4 of the sauce.  Top the sauce in each dish with 1/4 of the reserved roasted asparagus, and sprinkle the asparagus with 1/3 cup of the Parmesan.  Continue to layer the pasta, sauce, asparagus, and Parmesan in the same manner, ending with a sheet of pasta.

In a bowl beat the cream with a pinch of salt until it holds soft peaks.  Arrange the reserved asparagus tips on the pasta, spoon the cream over the pasta and the asparagus tips, spreading it with the back of a spoon, and sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan on top.

Bake the lasagna in the middle of the oven for 30 minutes, or until it is golden and bubbling, and let it stand for 10 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
                        === FOR MERINGUE ===
  1                cup  egg whites
                        =(abt 8 large egg whites)
  1              pinch  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1                cup  sugar

Make the ice cream center:  Line a 2 1/2-quart bowl that is 9 inches across in diameter with plastic wrap so that the wrap comes over the sides of the bowl.  Soften the ice cream (either in a microwave or by letting it sit at room temperature until soft).  Using a rubber spatula, spread the ice cream into the bottom of the bowl evenly.  It should fill the bowl about 3/4 full.  Smooth the top.  Sprinkle ice cream with nuts or chocolate chips if using.  You can make a multi-flavored Alaska by using different flavors of ice cream, freezing each layer before adding a new one.  Cover the ice cream and bowl with plastic wrap and place into the freezer until hardened, at least 4 hours, or overnight.

Make the brownie base:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly grease the bottom and sides of an 8-inch round cake pan.  Line the pan with aluminum foil so that the excess foil comes up and over the sides of the pan.  Lightly grease the inside of the foil in the pan.

Melt chocolate and butter in a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring, until smooth.  Remove bowl from pan and whisk 3/4 cup sugar into chocolate mixture (it will seem a little bit grainy).  Whisk in eggs and salt, then sift cocoa over, and whisk until just combined.

Pour batter into pan, spreading evenly, and bake in middle of oven until a tester comes out with a few crumbs adhering, 25 to 35 minutes.  Cool brownie in pan on a rack 5 minutes, then carefully lift foil and cake out of the pan together by lifting the excess foil on the sides of the pan.  Cool to room temperature.

To assemble:  Remove the bowl with the ice cream from the freezer and remove the plastic wrap covering the top.  Open the plastic wrap covering the ice cream so that the ice cream is exposed.  Carefully invert the brownie on the foil and place it directly on top of the ice cream.  Press down slightly so it adheres.  Peel off the foil and wrap the plastic wrap over the brownie.  Tightly cover the bowl with another piece of plastic wrap and return to the freezer for about 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees and set the rack in the middle of the oven.

After ice cream and cake have been freezing 20 minutes, beat egg whites and a pinch of salt with an electric mixer until foamy, then add lemon juice, and continue to beat until whites hold soft peaks.  Gradually add the sugar, beating, and continue beating until whites just hold stiff, glossy peaks.

Fill a large bowl halfway with hot water.  Remove ice-cream base from freezer and briefly dip it into the bowl with hot water to loosen it, being careful not to get any water into the bowl.  Invert the ice-cream base/bowl onto an oven-safe, decorative platter (or sheet tray).  Lift the bowl off of the ice-cream mound and remove the plastic wrap.  With an offset spatula, mound meringue over it, spreading to cover brownie layer completely.  Form decorative peaks in the meringue by making short vertical strokes with the spatula.  Bake in middle of oven until golden brown, about 6 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  The base can be assembled 1 week ahead and frozen, tightly wrapped.  Make meringue and, after topping base, bake Alaska 10 minutes.

Caution:   The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  cake or all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  double-acting baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  vegetable shortening
     3/4           cup  buttermilk
                        Milk -- for brushing

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Into a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and blend in the shortening until the mixture resembles meal.

Add the buttermilk, stir the mixture until it just forms a dough, and gather it into a ball.  On a lightly floured surface knead the dough gently 6 times and pat it out into a rectangle, roughly 1/2-inch thick.

Using a knife, divide the dough into 12 even-sized squares.  Separate the squares and invert the squares onto a lightly greased baking sheet.

Brush the tops of the squares with the milk, bake the biscuits in the middle of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are pale golden, and transfer them on to a rack.  Serve the biscuits at room temperature.

This recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === APPLE FILLING ===
  3                     Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into small dice
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  bourbon
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1              pinch  ground cloves
  1         tablespoon  finely-diced candied ginger - (heaping)
                        === EGG ROLLS ===
  12                    lumpia wrappers
                        = (available at Asian markets)
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  cold water
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying
     2/3           cup  powdered sugar
  1              quart  vanilla ice cream -- as accompaniment

To prepare the Filling:  Toss the apples with about 1 tablespoon of the sugar and set aside.

Place the remaining sugar in a large saute pan over high heat and cook, without stirring, until the sugar starts to caramelize and turns golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes (it happens fast, so don't leave the stove).

Add the apples and toss to coat with the sugar.  Remove the pan from the heat, add the bourbon, and then place it back over the heat.  (The bourbon can flame up, so be very careful.)

Bring the bourbon to a boil, add the butter, vanilla extract, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves, and cook over high heat until the apples are tender, about 4 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and let cool until tepid.  Add the candied ginger and mix well.

To prepare the Egg Rolls:  Place 1 lumpia wrapper on a flat surface, with a corner pointing toward you (as you look down on it, the wrapper should be a diamond shape).

Place a heaping tablespoon of the filling on the wrapper about 1/2-inch from the corner closest to you, and then fold the corner over the filling.  Fold the side corners over the filling, then roll to the opposite corner to form a cylinder.  Brush the edge of the wrapper with the beaten egg to seal.  Continue with the remaining wrappers and filling.

Heat about 4 inches of vegetable oil in a large saucepan over high heat until it reaches 350 degrees.  (You can check the temperature with a candy thermometer, or place a piece of bread in the oil; if it turns brown in about 40 seconds the oil should be at about 350 degrees.)

Add as many egg rolls as will fit without overcrowding, and fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.  Let cool for 3 to 4 minutes, then dust with powdered sugar.  Continue with the remaining egg rolls.

Serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe yields 12 egg rolls.

                       Caramelized Flan From Pinhao

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CARAMELIZED SUGAR SYRUP ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  boiling water
                        === FLAN ===
  2               cups  half-and-half cream
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  sugar
  4                     strips orange zest - (abt 2" by 1/2") -- pith removed
  2        tablespoons  caramelized sugar syrup
  12                    jumbo egg yolks
     1/4           cup  tawny Port
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Portuguese flan mold or souffle dish

For the caramelized sugar syrup:  Place the sugar in a medium-size heavy skillet (not iron), set over moderately-low heat, and allow to melt and caramelize to a rich golden brown.  Do not stir the sugar as it melts but do shake the skillet from time to time.

Add the boiling water, stirring briskly to dissolve the caramelized sugar.  Simmer uncovered 8 to 10 minutes until the consistency of maple syrup.

Reserve 2 tablespoons of the caramelized syrup for the flan; pour the balance into a chilled, well-buttered, shallow fluted 2-quart mold.  Set the mold in the freezer while preparing the flan.

For the flan:  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Combine the half-and-half, heavy cream, and sugar in a large heavy saucepan; add in the orange zest and bring to a simmer over moderately-low heat, stirring now and then; blend in the 2 tablespoons of reserved caramelized syrup.

Beat the egg yolks until frothy; blend 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the yolks, stir back into pan, and heat, stirring constantly for 1 minute, until it lightly coats the back of a spoon.  Remove from the heat and mix in the Port.  Strain all through a fine sieve, then pour into the prepared mold.

Set the mold in a shallow baking pan and pour in enough hot water to come halfway up the mold.  Bake uncovered for 1 1/2 hours, or until a toothpick inserted near the center of the flan comes out clean.  Remove from the oven and the water bath; cool for 1 hour, then refrigerate for 4 to 5 hours until firm.

To invert the flan, dip the mold quickly in hot water, then turn out on a dessert plate with a turned up rim; the caramel syrup will come cascading down over the flan.  Don't worry if the flan cracks, it will still be creamy and luscious.  Cut into slim wedges, if possible, or scoop out, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

For the caramelized sugar syrup:  Place the sugar in a medium-size heavy skillet (not iron), set over moderately-low heat, and allow to melt and caramelize to a rich golden brown.  Do not stir the sugar as it melts but do shake the skillet from time to time.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the boiling water, stirring briskly to dissolve the caramelized sugar.  Simmer uncovered 8 to 10 minutes until the consistency of maple syrup.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reserve 2 tablespoons of the caramelized syrup for the flan; pour the balance into a chilled, well-buttered, shallow fluted 2-quart mold.  Set the mold in the freezer while preparing the flan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the flan:  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Combine the half-and-half, heavy cream, and sugar in a large heavy saucepan; add in the orange zest and bring to a simmer over moderately-low heat, stirring now and then; blend in the 2 tablespoons of reserved caramelized syrup.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat the egg yolks until frothy; blend 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the yolks, stir back into pan, and heat, stirring constantly for 1 minute, until it lightly coats the back of a spoon.  Remove from the heat and mix in the Port.  Strain all through a fine sieve, then pour into the prepared mold.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Set the mold in a shallow baking pan and pour in enough hot water to come halfway up the mold.  Bake uncovered for 1 1/2 hours, or until a toothpick inserted near the center of the flan comes out clean.  Remove from the oven and the water bath; cool for 1 hour, then refrigerate for 4 to 5 hours until firm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To invert the flan, dip the mold quickly in hot water, then turn out on a dessert plate with a turned up rim; the caramel syrup will come cascading down over the flan.  Don&apos;t worry if the flan cracks, it will still be creamy and luscious.  Cut into slim wedges, if possible, or scoop out, and serve.

  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  3        tablespoons  black-olive paste
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves - (loosely packed) -- washed, spun dry,
                        and cut crosswise into thin strips
     1/4           cup  ricotta
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan - (abt 3/4 oz)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  chicken thighs with skin and bone
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2                     red bell peppers -- cut 3/4" pieces
  2                     jarred hot cherry peppers in vinegar - -- (to 4), drained,
                        and finely chopped
  5                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
     1/3           cup  chicken broth
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh parsley

Hack each thigh in half (or into thirds if large) across the bone with a cleaver or a sharp heavy knife.  Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper.

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking.  Saute the chicken in 2 batches, beginning skin-sides down, turning occasionally and adjusting heat to keep from burning, until cooked through and well browned on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes (add another tablespoon of oil to skillet for second batch).  Transfer chicken as cooked with tongs to a plate and keep warm, covered with foil.

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet.  Add remaining tablespoon oil and cook onion, bell peppers, and cherry peppers (to taste) over moderate heat, covered, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 7 minutes.  Add garlic and cook, stirring, until garlic is golden, about 2 minutes.  Add wine and broth and boil, uncovered, until most of liquid is evaporated, about 4 minutes.  Add chicken (with any juices accumulated on plate) and parsley and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until cooked through, then season with salt.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  If you can't find cherry peppers, substitute 1/4 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes, which you can add along with the garlic.

In a heavy 10- to 12-inch skillet, cook shallots in oil moderately-high heat, stirring, until golden brown.  Transfer shallots with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season with salt.

Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  Spanish onions -- peeled, and
                        sliced thin
  3              large  garlic cloves -- peeled, minced
  2              large  sweet green bell peppers -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut in thin strips
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              large  dried bay leaf -- crumbled
  1                can  water-packed tomatoes - (16 oz) -- do not drain
  1                can  tomato sauce - (6 oz)
  2             ounces  lean prosciutto -- cut small dice
     1/4         pound  lean smoked ham -- cut small dice
     1/4         pound  chourico, chorizo, or pepperoni -- cut small dice
  4              dozen  uniformly-small clams in the shell -- scrubbed clean
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Cataplana pot - (15" across) or a large
                        heavy Dutch oven type of kettle
                        === ACCOMPANIMENT ===
                        Pao or other rough country bread

Prepare the sauce:  Cook the onions, garlic, and green peppers in the oil in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or until limp and golden.

Add the bay leaf, tomatoes, and their juice.  Break up any large clumps of tomatoes, bring mixture to a simmer, cover and cook slowly for 30 minutes; add the tomato sauce, prosciutto, smoked ham, and chourico; cover, and cook 30 minutes longer.

The sauce can be made as much as 2 days ahead of time but do not buy the clams until the day you plan to serve the cataplana.  The sauce should be covered and refrigerated until you are ready to proceed.

To assemble the cataplana:  Spoon 1/2 the tomato mixture into the bottom of a very large cataplana pot, and bring to a simmer over moderate heat.  Adjust the heat so that the mixture barely boils, arrange the clams on top, spoon in the remaining tomato sauce and wine, cover tightly, cook 10 minutes over moderately-low heat; do not lift cover.

Open the cataplana or kettle, scatter the parsley evenly on top, and then toss the clams lightly.  If clams have not opened, cover and cook slowly for 5 to 10 minutes longer or until the clams open.  Discard any that do not.

Carry the cataplana or kettle to the table, take off lid, and ladle into large soup plates.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Types of small clams to use are West Coast butter clams or small Littleneck clams.  Also, be sure to put out a large bowl for empty clamshells.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              large  white onion -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano -- crumbled
  1 1/2         pounds  baking potatoes, like russets
  6               cups  chicken broth
  1                cup  water
  2             pounds  yellow-fleshed potatoes, like Yukon Gold -- peeled, and
                        cut 1/2" cubes, covered with water
  3               ears  corn -- cut crosswise
                        into 1" pieces
                        === ACCOMPANIMENTS ===
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  1                cup  heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  drained capers
  3                     ripe Hass avocados -- quartered, pitted,
                        peeled, cut into 1/2" cubes

Pat chicken dry and season with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Heat butter in a wide, heavy 7- to 8-quart pot over moderately-high heat until foam subsides, then brown chicken in 2 batches, skin-side down first, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes.  Transfer chicken as browned to a plate.

Add onion to pot, along with oregano and 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper, and saute, stirring, until light golden, about 5 minutes.  Peel and coarsely grate the baking potatoes with a box grater, and add to the pot.  Add back the chicken, broth, and water.  Simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes.

Transfer chicken with tongs to a cutting board to cool.  Drain the cubed yellow potatoes and add to pot.  Simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until cubed potatoes are almost tender, about 10 minutes.  Add corn and simmer, covered, until tender, 5 to 10 minutes more.  While corn is cooking, remove skin and bones from chicken and coarsely shred meat.  Add meat to pot and heat through.

Serve stew with accompaniments in separate bowls.

                          Couscous Mango Mousse

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Kitty Morse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  water
     3/4           cup  couscous
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  2                     juice oranges
                        = (preferably Valencia)
  2        tablespoons  orange-flavored liqueur
  1                     ripe mango - (abt 1 1/4 lbs)
  1                cup  heavy (whipping) cream -- chilled
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                     container vanilla yogurt - (8 oz)

In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the water to a boil.  Add the couscous in a stream.  Stir once.  Remove from the heat.  Cover and let stand until the couscous is tender, 12 to 15 minutes.  Mix in 2 tablespoons of the sugar.  Cover tightly set aside.

Scrub one of the oranges under running water and pat dry.  With a vegetable peeler, remove the zest, being careful not to peel away any of the white pith.  Finely mince the zest.  Set aside.

Squeeze the oranges to obtain about 3/4 cup of juice.  Strain through a medium-meshed sieve into a small saucepan.  Over medium heat, boil down the juice until it has reduced to about 2 tablespoons, and has the consistency of molten honey, 4 to 5 minutes.  Stir in the liqueur.  Set aside.

Peel the mango and cut the flesh away from the seed.  Cut half into thin wedges and coarsely dice the rest.  Set aside.

In chilled metal bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form.  Fold in the vanilla and the remaining sugar.  Refrigerate 1 cup of the whipped cream for serving.  In a medium bowl, combine the rest of the whipped cream with the yogurt and the diced mango.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

Before serving, combine the yogurt-mango mixture with the couscous.  Spoon equal amounts into 6 parfait glasses or small bowls.  Top each dessert with a generous dollop of the reserved whipped cream and mango wedges.  Drizzle with orange sauce, sprinkle with minced orange zest, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  beer -- plus
                        more as needed for thinning
  1                cup  mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  chopped pitted kalamata olives
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2             medium  zucchini - (abt 1 lb) -- washed
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Whisk 1 cup of the flour with the beer in a large bowl until smooth.  Pour through a strainer into another bowl and let stand for 1 hour.  Thin with additional beer just before frying, if necessary.  It should be the consistency of pancake batter.

Meanwhile, mix the mayonnaise with the olives and lemon juice in a small bowl.  Thin with 1 to 2 tablespoons water, if you like.  Keep covered in the refrigerator until ready to serve the zucchini.  (Makes about 1 1/4 cups)

Cut the zucchini into sticks that measure 3/4-inch wide and 4 inches long.

Heat 3 to 4 inches of oil in a large deep saucepan until a deep-fat frying thermometer reaches 360 degrees.

Combine the remaining 1/2 cup flour with salt and pepper in a shallow bowl or pie plate.  Add the zucchini and toss to cover in flour.  Transfer to a sieve and shake to remove excess flour.

Working in batches, dip in the batter, letting the excess drip off.  Fry until golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.  Serve the olive mayonnaise on the side for dipping.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer servings.

  4              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  4             ounces  good-quality bittersweet or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        Lightly sweetened whipped cream -- (optional)

Place sugar in a large bowl.  Sift over it the cornstarch, cocoa and salt.  Add 1/2 cup of the milk and stir the mixture to make a thick paste.  Lightly beat the egg yolks, then add these to the cornstarch mixture, whisking to blend well.  Wrap a damp towel around the base of the bowl to prevent it from sliding around when the scalded milk is added.

Meanwhile, in a heavy-bottomed 2-quart saucepan, combine the remaining 2 cups milk and the cream.  Bring these just to the boil, then remove the pot from the heat.  Pour a small amount of the hot liquid into the cornstarch-cocoa mixture, whisking constantly.  Continue to whisk the milk-cream mixture into the bowl gradually, until all of the liquid has been incorporated, and the mixture is smooth.  Rinse out the pot used to scald the milk and the cream, but don't dry it: this will help prevent the pudding from scorching on the bottom.  Pour the custard into the clean pot and add the vanilla.

Have ready a clean mesh sieve over a medium-sized bowl.  Return the pot to the stove and stir with a wooden spoon over low to medium-low heat until the custard thickens, about 5 to 7 minutes.  It should approach but never quite reach, a boil and be about the consistency of mayonnaise when it's done.  This custard behaves strangely, you may fear something has gone terribly wrong, but press on!  It will get increasingly lumpy to the point where, just as it reaches the right thickness, it will seem downright chunky: never mind!  Quickly remove the pot from the element and pour through the sieve into the clean bowl, pressing the custard through with a rubber spatula.

Add the finely chopped or grated chocolate in 2 additions, stirring gently with a clean wooden spoon or rubber spatula until the chocolate is melted smoothly into the pudding.  Spoon the pudding into 6 to 8 serving dishes or goblets and chill at least 6 hours or overnight.  If you like the pudding with no skin on the top, press plastic wrap onto the surface of the warm pudding in the serving dishes.  If a skin on your chocolate pudding makes you happily nostalgic, wait until the puddings are cold before covering.  The pudding can be made up to 2 days ahead of time.

Serve just as it is, or with a dollop of lightly sweetened whipped cream for a truly decadent dessert.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CREAMY SESAME DRESSING ===
  1                cup  mayonnaise
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh ginger
  1                     garlic clove -- chopped
  4          teaspoons  dark sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh cilantro
                        === ASIAN SPICE RUB ===
  2        tablespoons  Szechwan peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  anise seeds
  4          teaspoons  coarse salt
  1           teaspoon  Chinese five-spice powder
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
                        === FOR THE BEEF ===
  4             pounds  beef tenderloin roast - (to 5) -- trimmed and tied
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        Snipped fresh chives -- for garnish
                        Snipped fresh tarragon sprigs -- for garnish

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

To make the Dressing:  Put mayonnaise, sour cream, ginger, garlic, sesame oil and rice vinegar in a blender or food processor mix until combined.  Scrape down the sides of the blender or work bowl with a rubber spatula, mix for another 15 seconds.  Transfer to a bowl, add the cilantro and mix well with whisk.  Set aside.

Make the Spice Rub:  Toast peppercorns and anise seeds in a dry large heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Finely grind toasted mixture in an electric coffee/spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle.  Sift mixture through a coarse sieve into a bowl and stir in salt, five-spice powder, and ginger.

Halve beef crosswise and sprinkle rub all over both pieces, pressing to adhere.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet with a metal handle over moderately-high heat until just smoking, then brown 1 piece of beef on all sides, about 1 minute.  Transfer to a large plate.  Wipe the skillet clean with paper towels and brown remaining beef in same manner.

Arrange beef pieces, 2 inches apart, in the skillet.  Roast in middle of oven 25 to 35 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted diagonally 2-inches into centers of each piece registers 120 degrees.  Let beef stand in pan on a rack for 25 minutes.  Beef will continue to cook as it stands, reaching 130 degrees (medium-rare).  Discard string and slice beef.

Serve with dressing at room temperature.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

                        === MIXED GREEN SALAD ===
  1                     bag store-bought mixed salad greens - (10 
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste

Blend the mayonnaise, egg, and lime juice in a large mixing bowl.  Flake the cod into small pieces and add to the bowl.  Mix in the celery and salt.

Pulse the bread in a blender or food processor to make fine crumbs.  Pour the crumbs on a sheet of waxed paper.

Form the cod mixture into 8 patties.  Gently place each patty in the bread crumbs and using a pancake spatula, turn to coat evenly.  Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat.  Place 4 fish cakes in the skillet and cook until the crumbs are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side; turn carefully.  Repeat with the remaining fish cakes, adding more oil as necessary.  Serve with the chipotle cream.

Chipotle Cream:  Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.

Sauteed Peppers and Onions:  In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and saute the vegetables until tender.

Mixed Green Salad:  Dress the salad greens lightly with olive oil and vinegar.  Sprinkle with coarse salt, to taste.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                  Frankfurters In Mustard Caraway Pastry

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Hors D'Oeuvres

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cut into bits
  1              large  egg -- beaten lightly
  1         tablespoon  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  Dijon-style mustard
  8                     kosher beef frankfurters
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  water -- for egg wash
  2          teaspoons  caraway seeds

Into a bowl sift together the flour and the salt and blend in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  In another bowl beat together the egg and the sour cream, add to the flour mixture, and stir the mixture with a fork until it forms a dough.  Form the dough into a ball, dust it with flour, and flatten it slightly.  Chill the dough, wrapped in waxed paper, for at least 1 hour or overnight.

Roll the dough into a rectangle 1/8-inch thick and trim it into a strip whose width is equal to the length of 1 frankfurter.  Spread the strip with a thin layer of the mustard and arrange 1 frankfurter lengthwise along a short side.  Roll the dough around the frankfurter to just enclose it, leaving a 1/2-inch overlap at the seam, and cut off the dough-enclosed frankfurter from the rest of the rectangle.  Seal the seam on the frankfurter, cut the frankfurter crosswise into thirds, and arrange the pieces on an ungreased baking sheet.

Roll up the remaining frankfurters in the remaining dough in the same manner, re-rolling the dough scraps and spreading the dough with the mustard when necessary, and cut them into thirds.  (The frankfurters may be made 2 days ahead up to this point and frozen, covered tightly.  Let the frankfurters thaw before baking them.)

Brush the dough with the egg wash, sprinkle it with the caraway seeds, and bake the frankfurters in a preheated 375 degree oven for 20 minutes, or until the dough is golden and flaky.  Serve the frankfurters warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 24 hors d'oeuvres.

Categories    : Egg Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SOUFFLES ===
     3/4           cup  walnuts -- toasted lightly,
                        cooled, and chopped fine
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  milk
  4              large  eggs -- separated, and
                        the whites at room temperature
  1 1/2           cups  crumbled mild goat cheese - (abt 9 oz)
                        = (such as Montrachet)
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 1/4 tspn crumbled dried thyme)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  cream of tartar
                        === FOR THE SALAD ===
  3        tablespoons  Sherry vinegar
     3/4      teaspoon  Dijon-style mustard
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  walnut oil
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     large bunche watercress - (to 4) -- rinsed, spun dry,
                        and coarse stems discarded - (abt 5 cups)
  5               cups  torn frisee -- rinsed, spun dry
                        = (French or Italian curly chicory
                        available at specialty produce markets)

To make the souffles:  Coat the bottom and sides of each of 8 buttered 1/2-cup ramekins with about 1 tablespoon of the walnuts and arrange the ramekins in a jelly-roll pan.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a small saucepan melt the butter over moderately-low heat, whisk in the flour, and cook the roux, whisking, for 3 minutes.  Add the milk in a stream, whisking, and boil the mixture over moderate heat, whisking, for 2 minutes, or until it is thick and smooth.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and let it cool slightly.

Whisk in the yolks, 1 at a time, the goat cheese, the thyme, and salt and pepper, to taste, and whisk the mixture until it is combined well.

In another bowl beat the whites with a pinch of salt until they are frothy, add the cream of tartar, and beat the whites until they just hold stiff peaks.  Whisk 1/3 of the whites into the cheese mixture and fold in the remaining whites gently but thoroughly.  Divide the souffle mixture among the ramekins, sprinkle each souffle with about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the remaining walnuts, and bake the souffles in the upper third the oven for 20 minutes, or until they are puffed and golden.

Transfer a ramekin to each plate and serve the souffles immediately.

To make the salad while the souffles are baking:  In a bowl, whisk together the vinegar, the mustard, and salt and pepper, to taste, add the oils in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified.

In a bowl toss the watercress and the frisee with the dressing and divide the salad among 8 plates.

To make the souffles:  Coat the bottom and sides of each of 8 buttered 1/2-cup ramekins with about 1 tablespoon of the walnuts and arrange the ramekins in a jelly-roll pan.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small saucepan melt the butter over moderately-low heat, whisk in the flour, and cook the roux, whisking, for 3 minutes.  Add the milk in a stream, whisking, and boil the mixture over moderate heat, whisking, for 2 minutes, or until it is thick and smooth.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and let it cool slightly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk in the yolks, 1 at a time, the goat cheese, the thyme, and salt and pepper, to taste, and whisk the mixture until it is combined well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In another bowl beat the whites with a pinch of salt until they are frothy, add the cream of tartar, and beat the whites until they just hold stiff peaks.  Whisk 1/3 of the whites into the cheese mixture and fold in the remaining whites gently but thoroughly.  Divide the souffle mixture among the ramekins, sprinkle each souffle with about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the remaining walnuts, and bake the souffles in the upper third the oven for 20 minutes, or until they are puffed and golden.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer a ramekin to each plate and serve the souffles immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the salad while the souffles are baking:  In a bowl, whisk together the vinegar, the mustard, and salt and pepper, to taste, add the oils in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl toss the watercress and the frisee with the dressing and divide the salad among 8 plates.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     eggplants - (1/2 lb ea)
  2           teaspoon  salt -- divided
  4         tablespoon  olive oil -- divided
  2               cups  chopped onion
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1              pound  lean ground lamb
     1/3           cup  minced fresh parsley leaves
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh mint leaves
  3                     plum tomatoes -- halved lengthwise,
                        seeded, and cut into julienne strips
  1                cup  crumbled feta

Halve 2 of the eggplants lengthwise, score their pulp deeply with a sharp knife, being careful not to pierce the skins, and with a grapefruit knife scoop out the pulp, reserving it and leaving 1/2-inch-thick shells.  Sprinkle the shells with 1 teaspoon of the salt and invert them on paper towels to drain for 15 to 30 minutes.  Cut the reserved pulp and the remaining whole eggplant into 1/2-inch pieces, in a colander toss the pieces with the remaining salt, and let them drain for 15 to 30 minutes.

Pat the shells dry with paper towels, brush them with 1 tablespoon of the oil, and broil them on the rack of a broiler pan, skin-side down, under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat until they are tender, about 5 minutes.

In a skillet, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil over moderately-high heat until it is hot but not smoking.  Saute the onion and the garlic until translucent.  Add the ground lamb and the eggplant pieces, patted dry, stirring, until meat loses all color and eggplant is tender.

Remove the skillet from the heat, stir in the parsley, mint, tomatoes, feta, and salt and pepper to taste, and divide the filling among the shells, mounding it.  Broil the stuffed eggplants in a large flameproof baking dish for 5 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and golden.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  2             pounds  tender young green beans -- washed, tipped
  3             quarts  boiling water -- with
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt -- added
  2              large  garlic cloves -- peeled, minced

Cook the chicken, skin-side up, for 20 minutes.  Turn the pieces and cook an additional 15 to 20 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted reaches 155 degrees and the chicken is fork-tender and the juices run clear when a thigh is pricked with a fork.  (It should measure 180 degrees on an instant read thermometer).  Alternately, roast the chicken in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes.

Serve 1 bird hot and reserve the other for Cilantro-Infused Chicken Sandwiches (see recipe).

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     London broil - (2 to 2 1/2 lbs)
                        === FOR MARINADE ===
  4              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  4        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  4        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  dried basil -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme -- crumbled
     1/2      teaspoon  dried hot red pepper flakes
     2/3           cup  olive oil

To make marinade:  In a bowl, whisk together marinade ingredients until combined well.  Put London broil in a large resealable plastic bag and pour marinade over it.  Seal bag, pressing out excess air, and set in a shallow dish.  Marinate meat, chilled, turning bag once or twice, for 8 hours.

Remove meat from the marinade, discarded the marinade, and pat the meat dry.

Preheat a grill and on an oiled rack set about 4-inches over glowing coals, grill the meat, turning each once, 9 to 10 minutes on each side, or until it registers 125 to 130 degrees, on a meat thermometer for medium-rare meat.  (Alternatively, meat may be broiled.)

Transfer meat to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes.  Cut meat diagonally across the grain into thin slices.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  28                    bamboo skewers - (10" long)
                        === FOR SWEDISH MEATBALLS ===
     3/4         pound  ground chuck
     3/4         pound  ground pork
  1 1/4           cups  fine fresh bread crumbs
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR MUSTARD SAUCE ===
     1/3           cup  Dijon mustard
     1/3           cup  brown sugar - (packed)
  3        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
                        leaves
                        === FOR THE KEBABS ===
  2             medium  yellow squash
  1                     onion
  2                     yellow bell peppers
  1               pint  vine-ripened yellow cherry tomatoes

In a large dish soak bamboo skewers in warm water to cover for 30 minutes.

Make meatballs:  In a large bowl, with your hands, blend the meatball ingredients until just combined well (do not overmix).  Form mixture into 1 1/4-inch balls and arrange on a tray.  Meatballs may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.

Make sauce:  In a bowl whisk together all sauce ingredients until brown sugar is dissolved.  Sauce maybe made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.

Halve squash lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch thick pieces.  Quarter onion and then cut the onion and bell peppers into 1-inch pieces.

Assemble kebabs:  Thread 2 meatballs alternately with assorted cut vegetables and tomatoes onto each skewer.  Kebabs may be assembled 8 hours ahead and chilled, covered.

Prepare grill.

Grill kebabs on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning kebabs frequently, 10 minutes.  Brush kebabs with sauce and grill, turning them and brushing frequently with the sauce and grill, until meatballs are cooked through, about 5 to 10 minutes more.  (Alternatively, kebabs may be broiled under a preheated broiler about 3-inches from heat.)  Discard any remaining sauce.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

                      Ham Georgia With Peach Garnish

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Jacques Pepin
Serving Size  : 18    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ham                             Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fully-cooked ham - (16 to 17 lbs)
                        === PEACH-MUSTARD GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  peach preserves
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  dried mustard
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  1                cup  water -- for deglazing
                        drippings from baked ham
  3               cups  demi-glace -- store bought
                        === PEACH SAUCE ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3             pounds  large ripe peaches - (abt 10) -- each pitted but
                        not peeled and cut into 8 wedges
     1/3           cup  sugar
  4             ounces  dried peaches -- cut 1/2" slices
  3        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  4               cups  combined demi-glace and deglazed drippings
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  potato starch -- dissolved in
  1         tablespoon  water -- for thickening if
                        needed
  1                cup  julienned basil leaves

Put the ham in a large stockpot, and fill the pot with enough cold water to cover the ham.  Bring the water to 170 to 180 degrees (below the boil; if boiled, the ham will crack open at the joint).  Cook at that temperature for 3 hours, then let cool in the cooking water.

When ready to proceed with the recipe, remove the ham from the water.  With a knife, remove the skin from the ham, and trim the surface of the meat where it is brown and skin-like around the shank bone.  To make carving easier later, remove the pelvis or hipbone by running a knife around it.  When the skin has been removed, trim off all but a thin layer of white fat from the surface of the ham.

Run the point of your knife in a crisscross pattern through the remaining fat on the top of the ham, cutting slightly into the surface of the meat.  This scoring will help the glaze adhere to the meat while it cooks.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a small bowl, mix the preserves, pepper, mustard, balsamic vinegar, and allspice together.

Spread the glaze coating on the top surface of the ham, place it in a roasting pan, and bake in the 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 325 degrees, and continue cooking the ham for 1 hour.  Sprinkle the powdered sugar on top, and cook for another 30 minutes, until nicely glazed.  Transfer the ham to a platter, and set it aside in a warm place while you make the peach sauce.  Discard the accumulated fat in the roasting pan, and add the 1 cup of water to the drippings in the pan, stirring to loosen and mix in the solidified juices.  Add the demi-glace, and bring to a boil.  Reserve for use in peach sauce.

For The Peach Sauce:  Heat the butter in two large skillets, 2 tablespoons of butter per skillet.  When it is hot, add half of the peach wedges to each skillet, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes.  Sprinkle with the sugar, dividing it between the skillets, and continue cooking for 3 to 4 minutes longer.  Add the dried peach julienne and the vinegar, half to each skillet, and stir to mix.  Combine the contents of both skillets in one saucepan.  Strain the reserved demi-glace mixture over the peaches, and stir in the salt.  If the sauce is thinner than you would like, add the dissolved potato starch, and bring to a boil.  Boil 1 or 2 minutes.  At serving time, stir in the basil.

To make carving easier, make a vertical cut down into the ham approximately 1-inch above the shank bone.  The object is to make a guard that your knife will not go beyond when you slice the ham; this will give a clean bottom edge to the slices and also protect your hand from the knife in case it happens to slide while you are slicing the meat.  Slice the ham on the bias, stopping at the cut edge, and arrange the meat on a warm platter.  Serve 3 or 4 slices of ham per person with few slices of the peaches and the sauce spooned around and over the meat.

This recipe yields 16 to 18 servings.

     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced scallions
     1/2           cup  chopped drained bottled pimiento

  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  4          teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  3                     bottled pickled jalapeÒo peppers -- or to taste,
                        seeded, and minced
  1           teaspoon  celery salt
  1              pound  crabmeat -- thawed, and
                        drained if frozen, picked over
     1/3           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted lightly
                        === PITA TRIANGLES ===
  8              large  pita loaves with pockets
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted
                        Salt -- to taste

In a small heavy skillet cook the bell pepper in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until it is softened and let it cool.

In a large bowl combine the bell pepper, artichokes, mayonnaise, scallion, pimiento, parmesan, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, jalapeÒo peppers, and celery salt, blend the mixture until it is combined well, and stir in the crab meat gently.

Transfer the mixture to a buttered ovenproof 2-quart chafing dish or baking dish and sprinkle it with the almonds.  The dip may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.

Bake the dip in a preheated 375 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top is golden and the mixture is bubbly.  Serve the dip with the pita triangles.

Pita Triangles:  Cut each pita loaf into 8 wedges and separate each wedge into 2 triangles.  Arrange the triangles rough-side up in 1 tight layer in a jellyroll pan, brush them lightly with the butter, and season them lightly with salt.  Bake the triangles in the upper third of a preheated 375 degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are crisp and light golden, and let them cool in the pans.  The triangles may be made 1 day advance and kept covered in an airtight container at room temperature.  (Makes 128 triangles)

This recipe yields 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  trimmed boneless leg of lamb -- cut 1 1/4" cubes
  1 1/4           cups  Herb-Garlic Marinade -- (see recipe)
  4              large  red bell peppers - (to 5) -- cut into 2"
                        by 1 1/2" pieces
  8                     rosemary-branch skewers - (10" long)

In a large heavy-duty plastic sealable bag combine lamb and 3/4 cup of the marinade and seal bag, pressing out excess air.  Marinate lamb, chilled, for at least 4 hours and up to 8.

Blanch the bell peppers in a large saucepan of boiling water 30 seconds.  Drain peppers in a colander and, while still hot, in a bowl stir together with 1/4 cup of the marinade marinade.  Marinate peppers, covered and chilled, for at least 4 hours and up to 8.

Prepare grill.  Soak skewers in warm water 30 minutes.

Drain lamb, discarding marinade.  In a sieve set over a bowl drain peppers and reserved bell pepper marinade for basting.  Thread 4 pepper pieces and 4 lamb pieces, alternating pepper with lamb, onto each skewer.  Kebabs may be assembled 1 hour ahead and chilled, covered.

Cover ends of skewers with aluminum foil so they don't burn.

Grill kebabs on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, basting with reserved marinade and turning them occasionally, about 12 minutes total for medium-rare meat.  (Alternatively, broil kebabs under a preheated broiler 2 to 3 inches from heat about 4 minutes on each side.)  Drizzle kebabs with remaining 1/4 cup marinade.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
     1/3           cup  plain yogurt
  2        tablespoons  horseradish
  2        tablespoons  Cognac
  2        tablespoons  minced onion
  1         tablespoon  ketchup
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     live lobsters - (1 1/2 lbs ea)
  3                     firm-ripe mangoes
  1                cup  finely-diced celery
  1                     avocado -- pitted, peeled,
                        and chopped into small cubes
  4              whole  Belgian endives -- trimmed, and
                        sliced crosswise thinly -- plus
  12             whole  endive leaves -- for garnish
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh chives -- plus
  24             whole  chives -- for garnish

In a small bowl whisk together mayonnaise, yogurt, horseradish, Cognac, onion, ketchup, and lemon juice.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Cover and chill the sauce.

Plunge the lobsters into a large kettle of boiling salted water and boil them, covered, for 10 minutes.  Transfer the lobsters with tongs to a bowl and let them cool until they can be handled.  Crack the shells, remove the meat, and cut it into 3/4-inch pieces.  Transfer the lobster meat to a large bowl and chill it, covered.  The lobster cocktail may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance.

Halve the mangoes by cutting just to the sides of each pit.  Using a 3/4-inch melon-ball cutter, scoop the flesh from the mango halves (There should be about 2 cups).  To the lobster meat add the mango, celery, avocado, sliced endives, chives, and sauce and toss mixture until it is combined.  Divide the lobster mixture among 12 chilled small glasses and garnish each serving with 1 of the endive leaves and 2 of the whole chives.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Categories    : Appetizers                      Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR DRESSING ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lime juice
     1/2      teaspoon  smoked paprika (sweet or hot)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  5        tablespoons  mild extra-virgin olive oil
                        === FOR SALAD ===
  2               cups  cantaloupe flesh in 1" pieces
  2               cups  honeydew flesh in 1" pieces
  2                     large bunche arugula - (3/4 lb) -- coarse stems
                        discarded
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced serrano ham -- cut crosswise
                        into 3/4"-wide strips

To make dressing:  Whisk together lime juice, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and add oil in a slow stream, whisking until well blended.

To make salad:  Toss cantaloupe and honeydew with half of dressing in a bowl.  Decoratively arrange the arugula on a platter and then add the melon.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste an drizzle with remaining dressing.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer servings.

Comments:  It is important that the ham not be sliced as thinly as prosciutto usually is.  Slightly thicker ham is easier to cut into strips and will stay separated in a salad instead of clumping together.

                              Mix-In Muffins

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Muffins

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1                cup  sour cream
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla

Preheat oven to 400 degrees and line 12 (1/3-cup) muffin cups with paper liners.

Into a bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Melt butter and in a small bowl whisk together with sour cream, egg, and vanilla.  Stir butter mixture (and additional ingredients; see comments, below) into flour mixture until just combined.  Divide the batter among muffin cups (this batter is thick and will not run easily like other muffin batters) and bake in middle of oven until golden and a tester comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

This recipe yields 12 muffins.

Comments:  Becoming a muffin master is easy.  Flavor the basic muffin batterabove by adding, for example: 1 chopped banana and 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips; or 1 cup toasted almonds, 3/4 cup dried cranberries, and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract; or 1 cup chopped drained canned pineapple and 1 cup sweetened flaked coconut; or 1 cup chopped dried apricots and 1 tablespoon poppy seeds.

Categories    : Condiments                      Pickles/Relishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    unblemished lemons of equal size
                        Sea salt or table salt -- as needed

Scrub the lemons under running water and pat dry.  Cut a thin slice from each end of a lemon.  Set on end and make a vertical cut 3/4 of the way through the fruit, leaving the 2 halves attached.  Turn the lemon upside down, rotate 90 degrees, and make a second vertical cut, again 3/4 of the way through the fruit.

Fill each cut with as much salt as it will hold.  Place the lemon in a sterilized, 1-quart size, wide-mouth canning jar.  Proceed in this manner for the remaining lemons, pressing as many into the jar as possible.  Seal and set aside at room temperature.

Add additional lemons over the next few days as the rinds of the first lemons begin to soften.  By this time, the juices should have risen to cover the lemons.  If not, add 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice mixed with 1 teaspoon of salt.  This will prevent the top lemons from darkening.

Store at room temperature until the rinds become tender, and the pulp acquires the consistency of jam, 3 to 4 weeks.  Refrigerate.  Use within 6 months.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  finely-chopped onion
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  paprika
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (14 oz) -- drained, seeded
  4                     skin-on bone-in chicken breast halves
     1/2           cup  chicken broth or water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  all-purpose flour -- stirred with
  1         tablespoon  water
  2        tablespoons  sour cream -- plus
                        additional for serving
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley -- (optional)
                        === SUGGESTED ACCOMPANIMENT ===
                        Egg noodles or rice

Cook onion with salt in fat in pot over moderately-high heat, covered, stirring occasionally and reducing heat if necessary, until onion is very tender but not browned, about 5 minutes.

Add paprika and cook, stirring, 1 minute.  Stir in tomatoes and broth, stirring vigorously to break up tomatoes.  Add chicken and simmer, meat-side down, covered, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes.  Simmer, uncovered, until chicken is just cooked through, about 5 to 10 minutes longer.  Remove the chicken from the sauce and keep warm.

Stir flour mixture and stir into sauce.  Simmer, stirring, until sauce is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.

Remove from heat, then season with salt and stir in 2 tablespoons sour cream.  Add chicken back to the sauce to warm and coat with the sauce.  Serve, sprinkled with parsley, over noodles or rice, with additional sour cream on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Chicken can be prepared, without the sour cream, 2 days ahead and cooled, uncovered, before chilling, covered.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  fresh medium thickness asparagus -- tough ends trimmed
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated fresh lemon zest
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  penne, malfade, or preferred shape pasta
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

Cut asparagus into 1-inch pieces; reserve tips separately.  Cook asparagus stems in 5 to 6 quarts boiling water with 2 tablespoons salt until very tender, 6 to 8 minutes.  Transfer with a slotted spoon to a colander, reserving cooking water in pot, and rinse under cold water.  Drain asparagus well and transfer to a food processor or blender.

Cook asparagus tips in same boiling water until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes.  Transfer with slotted spoon to colander, reserving boiling water in pot, and rinse under cold water.  Drain tips well.

Puree asparagus stems with zest, oil, and 1/2 cup asparagus cooking water.  Transfer sauce to a 4-quart saucepan.

Cook pasta in boiling asparagus cooking water for about three-fourths of the recommended cooking time (very al dente).  Reserve 2 cups cooking water and drain pasta.

Add pasta, asparagus tips, and 1/2 cup reserved water to asparagus sauce and cook over high heat, stirring, 3 to 5 minutes, or until pasta is almost al dente and sauce coats pasta.  Add more cooking water, 1/4 cup at a time, until sauce coats pasta but is a little loose (the cheese will thicken it slightly).

Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano and salt and pepper, to taste and cook, stirring, until cheese is melted.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- cut into bits
  4             ounces  cold cream cheese -- cut into bits
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2                     containers plain yogurt - (1 pt ea)
  5             ounces  salmon roe
                        Dill sprigs -- for garnish
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
  2                     inch madeleine molds - (to 3")
                        = (or other shell molds of the same size)

In a food processor, blend butter, cream cheese, flour, and salt until the mixture forms a ball of dough.  Flatten the ball, wrap in waxed paper, and chill it for 1 hour.  Press small pieces of the dough into the madeleine molds, pressing the dough as thin as possible and trimming away any excess dough around the edges.

Chill the shells for 10 minutes, press a 2-inch square of foil into each mold to weigh the dough, and bake the shells on a baking sheet in a preheated 375 degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are pale golden.  (If the dough is not pressed into the molds evenly, some of the shells may brown faster than others.)

Remove the pastry shells from the molds, transfer them to racks, and let them cool.  The shells may be made in advance and kept in an airtight container for up to 2 days or frozen for several weeks.

In the refrigerator let the yogurt drain through a sieve lined with a double thickness of rinsed and squeezed cheesecloth set over a bowl, covered with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the yogurt, for 2 days.  Transfer the yogurt to a bowl and discard the liquid.

Just before serving, in each of half the shells put about 1/2 teaspoon of the yogurt, add about 1/4 teaspoon of the roe and a dill sprig, and top the filling with a second shell.

This recipe yields 24 to 28 hors d'oeuvres.

  1 1/2         pounds  pork tenderloin
                        = (2 whole tenderloins)
                        === FOR THE MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  dry Sherry
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
                        === FOR THE DISH ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4                     scallions, green and white parts -- minced
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1             medium  green bell pepper -- seeded, diced
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- seeded, diced
     1/4           cup  hoisin sauce

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  Lemon Olive Oil -- (see recipe)
                        = (or olive oil)
  2                     garlic cloves -- mashed with
     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- to a paste
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated lemon zest
  2          teaspoons  fennel seeds -- coarsely ground
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2                     pork tenderloins - (1 1/2 lbs total) -- trimmed
                        === FENNEL VARIATION ===
  1                     fennel bulb -- trimmed, and
                        cut into long thin strips
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     3/4           cup  cool water
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Combine 1 tablespoon of the lemon oil, garlic paste, zest, fennel seeds, and pepper in a small bowl.  Rub the mixture over the pork tenderloins and let stand at room temperature, covered, for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons lemon oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Brown the pork tenderloins, about 5 minutes total.  Transfer to a baking pan and roast the pork for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until an inserted instant read thermometer reads 150 degrees, about 15 to 20 minutes, for medium, or to desired doneness.  Remove the pork to a platter and let sit for 10 minutes before cutting into thin slices.

Fennel Variation:  If you'd like to serve fresh fennel alongside the pork, after browning the pork, add the fennel to the same skillet.  Cook the fennel, stirring frequently, over medium heat until it begins to brown, about 10 minutes.  Add a minced garlic clove, a teaspoon of sugar and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add 3/4 cup cool water, bring to a boil and simmer until the liquid is all evaporated and the fennel is fork-tender, about 5 minutes.  Stir in 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

                  Raspberry Sherbet With Raspberry Sauce

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Jacques Pepin
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Ices/Sorbets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh raspberries, see * Note
  2               cups  seedless red or black-raspberry preserves
  2        tablespoons  raspberry brandy
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/2           cup  water
                        Mint, edible flowers, or lemon peel -- for decoration
                        Chantilly (sweetened whipped cream) -- as an accompaniment

* Note:  Or 1 1/2 pounds frozen unsweetened raspberries [2 packages, 12 ounces each] and 1 1/2 cups fresh raspberries.

Reserve 1 1/2 cups of the fresh berries to fill the sherbet receptacles at serving time.  Put the 1 1/2 pounds of fresh or defrosted frozen berries in the bowl of a food processor with the preserves, and process until liquefied, or push through a food mill fitted with the fine screen.  Strain through a sieve to remove any remaining seeds.  You should have about 3 1/2 cups of raspberry coulis or puree.  Reserve 1 1/2 cups for the sauce, and add the brandy to this sauce.  Refrigerate until serving time.  Add the lemon juice and water to the remaining 2 cups to be used for the sherbet, and freeze, covered with plastic wrap, in a stainless-steel bowl for about 3 hours, until frozen but not too hard.

Break the frozen sherbet into pieces with a spoon, and dump them into the bowl of a food processor.  Emulsify in several batches or all together until the sherbet becomes creamy and lighter in color.  It should not be processed much more than 30 seconds; by then, it will have liquefied a little.  Return the puree to the stainless-steel bowl, cover, and put back in the freezer for a few hours.

To make the sherbet receptacles, line six 1-cup glass bowls with plastic wrap, and spoon a sizable scoop of sherbet inside each.

With a spoon, press on the center of each scoop to hollow it out, and push the sherbet up around the sides of the cup to create a "nest" in the center.  Fold the plastic-wrap edges over the sherbet, and place in the freezer for a few hours, until hard.  (This can be done several days ahead).

To serve:  Remove the frozen sherbet receptacles from the freezer, and pull back the plastic wrap to expose the center.  Fill each with about 1/4 cup fresh raspberries.

Invert the sherbet cups carefully in the center of six dessert plates, and remove the plastic wrap.  Pour the raspberry sauce around the cups, decorate with lemon peel, mint, or edible flowers, and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

* Note:  Or 1 1/2 pounds frozen unsweetened raspberries [2 packages, 12 ounces each] and 1 1/2 cups fresh raspberries.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reserve 1 1/2 cups of the fresh berries to fill the sherbet receptacles at serving time.  Put the 1 1/2 pounds of fresh or defrosted frozen berries in the bowl of a food processor with the preserves, and process until liquefied, or push through a food mill fitted with the fine screen.  Strain through a sieve to remove any remaining seeds.  You should have about 3 1/2 cups of raspberry coulis or puree.  Reserve 1 1/2 cups for the sauce, and add the brandy to this sauce.  Refrigerate until serving time.  Add the lemon juice and water to the remaining 2 cups to be used for the sherbet, and freeze, covered with plastic wrap, in a stainless-steel bowl for about 3 hours, until frozen but not too hard.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Break the frozen sherbet into pieces with a spoon, and dump them into the bowl of a food processor.  Emulsify in several batches or all together until the sherbet becomes creamy and lighter in color.  It should not be processed much more than 30 seconds; by then, it will have liquefied a little.  Return the puree to the stainless-steel bowl, cover, and put back in the freezer for a few hours.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  fennel bulb -- stalks discarded
  3             medium  carrots - (1/2 lb)
     1/2         pound  small red potatoes
     1/2           cup  Kalamata olives -- slivered
  2          teaspoons  finely-grated fresh lemon zest
  4          teaspoons  fresh thyme leaves
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              piece  center-cut salmon fillet - (1 1/2 lbs) -- skinned, and
                        fish cut into 4 square pieces
  4             ounces  butter - (1 stick) -- quartered evenly
  1                     lemon -- juiced
                        === SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ===
                        Mandoline or other manual slicer
  4             pieces  parchment paper
                        Kitchen string

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Halve fennel bulb lengthwise.  Remove most of core, leaving enough intact to keep layers together when sliced.

Using manual slicer, cut fennel bulb (lengthwise), carrots (diagonally), and potatoes into 1/8-inch-thick slices, keeping vegetables separate.

Blanch vegetables, separately, in salted boiling water: fennel 2 minutes, carrots 1 minute, potatoes 2 minutes.  Transfer fennel and carrots with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice water then drain well.  Drain potatoes.

Toss fennel and carrots with olives, zest, thyme, half of garlic, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and salt and pepper, to taste.

Toss potatoes with remaining oil and garlic and salt and pepper, to taste.

Fold the parchment paper in half along the longest side.  Divide potato mixture among centers of parchment squares.  Season salmon with salt and pepper and place on top of potatoes, then top salmon the fennel mixture.  Add a pat of butter to the package and a squeeze of lemon juice.

Fold the parchment paper up over fennel mixture and crimp the edges.  Place packages directly on hot baking sheet in oven and cook 20 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  maple syrup
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
     3/4           cup  chopped pecans
  6                     bananas -- peeled, halved
                        lengthwise and then crosswise
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        Vanilla ice cream -- as an accompaniment
                        Banana Chips -- as a garnish

In a saucepan, combine the maple syrup, cream, and pecans.  Bring the liquid to a gentle boil over moderate heat, and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it is thickened, about 18 to 20 minutes.

In a large skillet saute the bananas in the butter over moderately-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until they are browned lightly.  Transfer the bananas to a heated platter and spoon the sauce over them or, if desired, use the bananas and the sauce as a topping for the ice cream.  Garnish with banana chips, if using.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10                    bamboo skewers - (7" long)
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  4                     garlic cloves -- forced through press
  2        tablespoons  Asian (toasted) sesame oil
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh peeled gingerroot
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sesame seeds -- lightly toasted
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless shell steak -- cut 1" cubes
  16                    scallions -- trimmed

Soak bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes.

In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, garlic, oil, gingerroot, sugar, vinegar, sesame seeds, and pepper.  Thread the steak cubes loosely onto 8 of the skewers and thread the remaining skewers crosswise through the middle of each scallion so that the scallions stand parallel to one another.  Put the beef and scallion kebabs in a shallow dish just large enough to hold them, pour the marinade over them, coating them well, and let the kebabs marinate, chilled, turning them frequently, for 25 minutes.

Grill the kebabs on an oiled rack set about 6 inches over glowing coals, turning them, for 10 minutes.  Alternatively, the kebabs may be broiled under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat in the same manner.)  Remove the beef and scallions from skewers before serving.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  Herb-Garlic Marinade -- (see recipe)
  16                    shiitake mushrooms -- trimmed
  24                    jumbo shrimp - (abt 1 1/2 lbs)
  8                     wooden skewers - (10" long)

Clean mushrooms.  Place mushrooms in a small bowl and mix with 1/4 cup of the marinade.  Marinate at least 1 hour (and up to 4) in a sealable bag.

If desired, shell shrimp.  In a large heavy-duty sealable plastic bag combine shrimp with 3/4 cup marinade and seal bag, pressing out excess air.  Marinate shrimp, chilled, for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.  Soak skewers in warm water 30 minutes.  Prepare grill.

Drain shrimp, discarding marinade.  In a sieve set over a bowl drain mushrooms and reserved mushroom marinade for basting.  Thread 3 shrimp and 2 mushrooms, alternating shrimp with mushrooms, and keeping the mushrooms flat onto skewers.  Kebabs may be assembled 1 hour ahead and chilled, covered.

Grill kebabs on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, basting with reserved marinade and turning them occasionally, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes on each side.  (Alternatively, broil kebabs under a preheated broiler 2 to 3 inches from heat about 2 1/2 minutes on each side.)  Drizzle kebabs with remaining 1/4 cup marinade.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     corn tortillas
  2               cans  low-sodium chicken broth - (32 oz ea)
                        Chicken bones -- reserved from
                        Cilantro-Infused Chicken Sandwiches -- (see recipe)
  1              large  red onion -- coarsely chopped
  2              large  tomatoes -- diced
  2             medium  jalapeÒos -- sliced
  1                     lime -- juiced
  2               ears  grilled corn -- reserved from
                        Grilled Summer Vegetables And Corn -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  fresh cilantro leaves -- coarsely chopped
  1                     ripe avocado -- peeled, cubed
  8             ounces  crumbled feta, queso fresco, or
                        other fresh white cheese

Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut tortillas into 1/2-inch-thick strips and arrange them on a cookie sheet in a single layer.  Bake them 5 to 10 minutes, or until crispy.

In a large saucepan, bring the chicken broth and chicken bones to a boil.  Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer for 20 minutes.  Place a colander over a second large saucepan and strain the broth through it.  When the bones are cool enough to handle, pick off the remaining meat and add it to the strained broth.  Stir in the onion, tomatoes, jalapeÒos, and lime juice.  Heat about 5 minutes more to blend flavors.

Cut the corn from the cobs and add it to the soup.  Divide the baked tortilla strips among 4 bowls.  Ladle in the soup and serve with bowls of cilantro leaves, cubed avocado, and crumbled cheese to use as toppings at the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  mussels
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2             medium  onions -- coarsely chopped
  1                     garlic head -- peeled, crushed
  3        tablespoons  red curry paste
  1           teaspoon  ground turmeric
  2               cups  dry white wine
  2               cups  clam juice
  10                    Kaffir lime leaves
  4                     lemongrass stalks, white part only -- very thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  cilantro leaves - (loosely packed)

With a vegetable brush, clean the mussels under cold running water.  Pull off and discard any beards.  Discard any mussels with a broken shell or those that do not close when sharply tapped.  Drain well.

In a stainless steel or coated-aluminum wok, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the onions and garlic, and stir-fry until the onion is wilted.  Add the curry paste and turmeric, and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute, until aromatic.  Add the wine, clam juice, lime leaves, and lemongrass.  Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.  Remove the limes leaves and discard.

Add the mussels, cover the wok tightly, and steam over moderate heat for 5 minutes.  The mussels will begin to open.  Continue cooking until all the mussels have opened; transfer those that opened to a platter and discard any that fail to open.  Add the cream and cilantro leaves to the wok, and stir to blend.  Pour over the mussels and serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings as a first-course.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MUSHROOM SHRIMP STUFFING ===
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  sliced shallots
     1/2         pound  wild or cultivated mushrooms -- thinly sliced
                        = (chanterelles, oyster, cremini,
                        shiitake, or a mixture)
  4             ounces  shrimp -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  chopped chives
                        === SALMON ===
  2 1/2         pounds  boneless skinless salmon flesh
  1            package  store-bought puff pastry
  1              large  egg
                        === FOAMY LEMON SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  potato starch
  3                     egg yolks from large eggs
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1               dash  cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice

To make the Mushroom-Shrimp Stuffing:  Heat the tablespoon of butter in a skillet.  When it is hot but not smoking, add the shallots.  Saute for about 1 minute, until the shallots have softened, then add the mushrooms, and cook over medium to high heat until they have released their juice.  When that juice has evaporated and the mixture starts sizzling again, add the shrimp, and cook for about 1 minute, just long enough for the shrimp pieces to change color.  Season with the pepper, salt, and chives.  Cool.

When ready to assemble the dish, line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Roll the dough into a 16-inch square.  Cut a 16-inch-long strip from the dough measuring 5 to 6 inches wide, and place it on the diagonal on the parchment paper.  Place one of the salmon fillets on top, and sprinkle it lightly with salt and pepper.  Spread the cooled mushroom-shrimp stuffing evenly on top, then cover the stuffing with the remaining salmon fillet.

Take care to arrange the fillets so that the thinner part of the fillet on the bottom corresponds to the larger, thicker part of the fillet on top (tail to head and head to tail), and the shape and thickness are the same throughout.  This way the salmon will cook evenly.

Roll the remaining, wider strip of dough up onto your rolling pin, then unroll it on top of the second fillet.  Brush off any flour from the surface of the dough, and press it all around the edges, so it conforms to the fish shape underneath.  The large top layer of dough will stick around the edge to the layer of dough underneath.  Press the two layers of dough gently around the edge so they adhere well together, then place in the freezer for about 10 minutes to firm up the dough.  This will make trimming and decorating the "fish" easier.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

After 10 minutes, remove the "fish" from the freezer, and trim the excess dough all around the edge to create a fish outline with dorsal fins as well as a tail from the extra dough around the salmon.  Make a gill with a strip of the trimmed dough, and cut and position a round piece of dough for the eye.  Continue decorating as you fancy.

Break the whole egg into a small bowl, and remove about half the white.  Beat the remaining egg in the bowl with a fork to make a wash for coating the "fish".  Brush the salmon with the egg.  Holding the tip from a pastry bag (large end down) at an angle, press it lightly into the "fish" to simulate scales.  Bake in the 375 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove and set aside, uncovered, in a warm place while you make the sauce.

Foamy Lemon Sauce:  Whisk together 1 cup of the chicken stock and the potato starch in a saucepan, and bring to a boil.  Whisk the egg yolks and the remaining chicken stock in a bowl, then pour into the hot stock, and whisk constantly over medium heat for about 2 minutes, or until the sauce thickens and foams, but don't let it boil.  It should reach a temperature of 180 degrees, the temperature needed to cook the eggs and the starch and to thicken the sauce.  Whisk in the salt and cayenne, then remove the saucepan from the heat, stir in the lemon juice, and set aside.  The sauce should have doubled in volume.

Using 2 long hamburger spatulas, transfer the "fish" to a serving platter.  To serve, cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch slices, and arrange on warm individual plates.  Spoon some sauce around the slices, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

        Sweet Polenta Crostini With Mascarpone, Raspberries, Honey

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  water
                        = (preferably still spring or
                        filtered water)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  medium-grain yellow cornmeal
                        = (preferably stone-ground)
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  mild-flavored vegetable oil -- plus
                        extra for greasing the pan
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar - (to 3)
     3/4           cup  mascarpone
     1/2          pint  red raspberries
     1/3           cup  shelled skinned pistachio nuts -- lightly toasted,
                        and coarsely chopped
     1/4           cup  dark flavorful honey
                        = (such as lavender or wild forest,
                        although preferably not buckwheat)

Prepare the polenta:  Line an 8- by 4-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap and set aside.

Bring the water to a rolling boil in a large pot.  Add the salt, then gradually sprinkle in the cornmeal, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.  Keep stirring after the last of the cornmeal has been added: the mixture will begin to thicken quite quickly.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook the polenta for about 30 to 40 minutes, stirring frequently.  Spoon a little of the polenta onto a plate and taste it: when it is no longer crunchy and granular, it's done.

Scrape the polenta into the loaf pan, flattening the top and pressing the mass into a rough rectangle, ending halfway to two-thirds down the length of the pan.  This sounds a little confusing, but you should now have a 2-inch-thick rectangle of polenta pressed into the loaf pan.  It will be very stiff and have no trouble staying put.  Cool the polenta to room temperature, then press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours, or up to 3 days.

No more that 2 or 3 hours before you plan to serve the dessert, remove the loaf pan from the refrigerator and unmold the polenta.  With a long, thin-bladed knife, slice the loaf into 1/4-inch thick slices and cut each of these in half.  You should end up with about 24 (2-inch) squares, 1/4-inch thick.

Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large frying pan (non-stick is fine) over medium heat.  When the foam subsides, add half of the polenta slices and fry about 4 minutes, turning once, until golden and crisp on both sides.  Carefully transfer the slices to a platter lined with paper towels and sprinkle the slices with half of the sugar.  Repeat with the remaining butter, oil, polenta, and sugar.  Cool the sugared polenta slices to room temperature.

To assemble the crostini, spoon the mascarpone into a piping bag fitted with a medium star tip (about 1/2-inch or so).  Pipe a generous amount of mascarpone on each polenta square and arrange two or three raspberries on the cheese.  Press some pistachio pieces around the berries into the cheese and drizzle the crostini with a little of the honey (a honey dripper or even a teaspoon dipped into the jar then waved over the squares works really well, don't even bother measuring the honey!).  The finished crostini should be eaten as soon as possible, but can be kept covered at room temperature for a few hours.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  demerara - (tightly packed)
                        = (unrefined granulated sugar)
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- sifted
     1/2           cup  cold unsalted butter -- plus
  1         tablespoon  cold unsalted butter -- diced
     1/3           cup  sweetened shredded coconut
     1/3           cup  raw unsalted macadamia nuts -- chopped
                        === FRUIT ===
  1                     ripe pineapple -- peeled, eyes
                        removed, and cored
  1                     ripe papaya -- peeled, seeded
  1              large  ripe mango - (or 2 small) -- peeled, and
                        oblong pit removed
  1              large  ripe but not brown banana - (or 2 small)
     1/2                lime -- juiced
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar -- or more or less,
                        = (depending on the sweetness of fruit)
  2        tablespoons  instant (small pearl or minute) tapioca

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Select a wide 2- to 2 1/2-quart baking dish or casserole, large enough to hold 8 cups of fruit and 1 to 2 inches of crumble, and set aside.

Prepare the topping:  In a large bowl combine the sugars and stir with a fork to break up any lumps of demerara.  Blend in the flour.  With a pastry blender or by rubbing the mixture roughly between your fingers, cut in the butter until the crumble begins to lump together.  (The crumble may also be prepared up to this point in a food processor fitted with a steel blade: whir the sugars together to break them up, then add the flour and whir just to mix.  Add the diced butter and use quick pulses to reduce the mixture to a lumpy crumble.  Transfer the crumble to a bowl and proceed with the rest of the recipe by hand.)  Add the coconut and the macadamias and work these by hand, kneading the mixture until evenly moist and crumbly, then set aside.

Prepare the fruit:  Cut the pineapple, papaya, and mango flesh into roughly 1-inch chunks and combine in large, non-reactive bowl.  Peel and slice the banana, then add to bowl.  Sprinkle the fruit with lime juice and toss gently to coat.

In a small bowl, combine the sugar and tapioca, then toss with the fruit.  Don't forget to taste!  If not sweet enough for your liking, add another few tablespoons of sugar.  If the sweetness is more that you care for, add another squeeze of lime.

Spoon the fruit into the baking dish.  Sprinkle the crumble mixture evenly over the top.  Be generous!  I like to have every bit of fruit covered with a good inch or so of sweet crunchy topping.  Set the dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 45 minutes, or until the topping is a rich golden brown in spots and the juices from the fruit are visibly bubbling up through the crumble.

Remove from the oven and cool at least 20 minutes before serving.  (The crumble may be baked up to 2 days ahead and reheated in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes before serving.)  Serve warm or at room temperature, with vanilla ice cream or a dollop of thick yogurt, lightly sweetened with flavorful honey.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              small  artichokes - (6 to 7 oz ea)
                        = (use larger 8- to 9-oz artichokes if
                        using a regular pot)
  1                     lemon -- halved
  4                     thin slices provolone
                        === FOR STUFFING ARTICHOKES ===
  2               cups  fine fresh bread crumbs - (4 oz)
                        = (from an Italian loaf)
     1/2           cup  finely-grated Parmesan - (1 1/2 oz)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  finely chopped garlic
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
     1/4           cup  minced sweet soppressata - (1 1/4 oz)
                        = (dried Italian sausage)
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated fresh lemon zest -- (optional)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        === FOR COOKING ARTICHOKES ===
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely-chopped garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Special equipment:  A melon-ball cutter; a 6 to 8-quart pressure cooker or a wide 4- to 6-quart heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid

Make stuffing:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spread bread crumbs in a shallow baking pan and bake in middle of oven until pale golden, about 10 minutes.  Cool crumbs completely, then toss with Parmesan, garlic, parsley, soppressata, zest if using, salt, and pepper.  Drizzle oil over crumbs and toss to coat evenly.  (Stuffing may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.)

Trim and stuff artichokes:  Cut off artichoke stems and discard.  Cut off top 1/2-inch of 1 artichoke with a serrated knife, then cut about 1/2-inch off all remaining leaf tips with kitchen shears.  Rub cut leaves with a lemon half.  Separate leaves slightly with your thumbs and pull out purple leaves from center and enough yellow leaves to expose fuzzy choke.  Scoop out choke with melon-ball cutter, then squeeze some lemon juice into cavity.

Trim remaining artichokes in same manner.

Spoon about 2 tablespoons stuffing into cavity of each artichoke and, starting with bottom leaves and spreading leaves open as much as possible without breaking, spoon a rounded 1/2 teaspoon stuffing inside each leaf.  Top each artichoke with a slice of provolone.

Cook artichokes:  Put water, wine, oil, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in pressure cooker (without insert) or pot and arrange stuffed artichokes in liquid in 1 layer.

Seal pressure cooker with lid and cook at high pressure, according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 minutes.  Put pressure cooker in sink (do not remove lid) and run cold water over lid until pressure goes down completely.

If using a regular pot, simmer artichokes, covered, until leaves are tender, about 50 minutes.  Transfer artichokes with tongs to 4 soup plates and spoon cooking liquid around them.

This recipe yields 4 first-course servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  whole wheat spaghetti - (16 oz)
     1/3           cup  Lemon Olive Oil -- (see recipe)
                        = (or olive oil)
  1              large  red onion -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
  1 1/2    tablespoons  julienned strips peeled fresh ginger
                        = (from a 1" piece of ginger)
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated lemon zest
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  salt
