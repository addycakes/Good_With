Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  thick-cut bacon -- cut 1/2" thk pieces
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  4             pounds  beef chuck roast -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 2" cubes
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2             medium  onions -- coarsely chopped
  2              large  carrots -- coarsely chopped
  2               cups  water -- divided
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  5        tablespoons  flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  tomato paste
  2               cups  beef stock or rich chicken stock
                        = (or low sodium canned chicken broth)
  1             bottle  red wine, preferably burgundy
     1/2         bunch  fresh parsley stems
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1                     garlic head -- halved crosswise
  3                     bay leaves -- torn
     1/2      teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
     1/4         pound  pearl onions -- peeled
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2         pound  white button mushrooms -- stem ends trimmed
                        = (or cremini mushrooms)
     1/4         pound  baby carrots -- peeled, ends trimmed
     1/4         pound  baby turnips -- peeled, ends trimmed
  3        tablespoons  cognac
     1/4           cup  minced parsley leaves
  1                     box frozen puff pastry -- thawed refrigerated
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten

In a heavy Dutch oven over medium heat, render bacon in the vegetable oil until lightly browned and beginning to crisp.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a large bowl and set aside.

Season the meat with the salt and pepper, and brown in the bacon fat, in batches if necessary and turning often to promote even cooking.  When the meat is browned on all sides, transfer the pieces to the bowl with the bacon.  (If the bits on the bottom of the pan begin to burn, deglaze with a bit of water or some of the wine, and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to remove all browned bits.  Transfer this liquid to the bowl along with the beef.)

When all of the beef is browned, add the chopped onions and carrots to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring frequently, until browned around the edges, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Transfer the browned vegetables to another bowl and set aside.

Deglaze the pan with 1 cup of water and transfer this liquid along with the released browned bits to the bowl with the browned meat.

Add 3 tablespoons of the butter to the Dutch oven and stir in the flour and cook until the flour is reddish-brown, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Add the tomato paste, stir to combine, then slowly whisk in the stock and 3 cups of the wine.  Bring to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.

Using a large piece of cheesecloth, make a bundle containing the reserved caramelized veggies, parsley stems, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, garlic and peppercorns and secure with a piece of kitchen twine.  Add this to the pot, along with the reserved bacon and browned meat.  Cover the pot and simmer very slowly for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until the beef is very tender.

Remove the cheesecloth bundle from the sauce and set in a strainer over a medium bowl.  Press down on the bundle with the back of a spoon and transfer any accumulated liquids to the Dutch oven.  Discard the cheesecloth bundle.

Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer the meat to a medium bowl and set aside.  Using a large spoon, skim any fat from the surface of the sauce.  Increase the heat to medium-high, and cook the sauce until it reduces to heavy cream consistency, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally so that sauce does not burn on the bottom of the pot.

While the sauce is reducing combine the pearl onions, remaining tablespoon of butter, sugar and 1 cup of water in a large skillet and bring to a boil over high heat.  Cover, reduce heat to medium and simmer for about 3 minutes.  Stir in the mushrooms, cover the pan, and cook for another minute or two, until the mushrooms have given up their liquid.  Add the baby carrots and turnips, cover, and continue to cook until the vegetables are crisp-tender, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove the cover and cook, shaking the pan frequently, until the vegetables are tender and golden brown.  Transfer to the sauce and add the remaining cup of red wine and cognac and continue to cook until the sauce is thickened and coats the back of a spoon.  Add the parsley and reserved beef, stir to combine well, then set aside to cool.

When the filling has cooled completely, divide the filling evenly among 6 (2-cup) ramekins.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  On a lightly floured work surface, roll out 1 sheet of puff pastry to measure 12- by 12-inches.  Using a small plate or cup saucer just slightly wider than the rim of the ramekins as a guide, cut out 4 circles of pastry by running the tip of a sharp knife around the edge of the guide.  Repeat with the second sheet of puff pastry, but only cut 2 circles out of this sheet and save the remaining puff pastry for another project.

In a small bowl using a fork, beat the egg lightly.  Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the edges of each circle of pastry with some of the beaten egg.  Top each ramekin with 1 of the pastry circles, egg side down, and fit the edges around the rim of the ramekin with your fingers.  Press to seal well.  Using the tip of a sharp knife, cut a few decorative vent holes in the top of the pastry circle.  Repeat with the remaining ramekins and pastry circles.  Using a pastry brush, brush some of the remaining egg over the tops of each pastry circle.

Place the ramekins in the middle of the oven and bake until the puff pastry is puffed and golden and the filling is bubbly and hot throughout, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

       'Oat-Cuisine' Horseradish Crusted Trout, Mustard Cream Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse

Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TROUT AND CRUST ===
                        Flour -- for dredging
  2                     eggs -- beaten
  2               cups  rolled oats
     1/4           cup  finely-grated fresh horseradish
  4                     skinned boned trout fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Kosher salt -- as needed
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        === SAUCE ===
  1           teaspoon  garlic
  1           teaspoon  chopped chives
     1/3           cup  Cognac
                        = (or brandy)
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  whole-grain mustard
  1         tablespoon  minced flat-leaf parsley
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Worcestershire sauce -- to taste

To make the Trout And Crust:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Put the flour and egg in separate shallow dishes.  Mix the oats and horseradish together in a third shallow dish.

Pat the trout fillets dry with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper.  (If the fillets taper down to a very thin tail, fold the tails back to make a more uniformly thick fillet.)

Dredge the flesh sides of the trout fillets (leave the skin sides dry) in the flour then egg, and finally in the oat mixture.  Shake off any excess.  Put on a piece of waxed paper or baking sheet.

Heat 1 large skillet over medium heat.  Add the oil and heat until hot.  Lay the fish in the skillet oat-side down and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Add the butter during the last minute of cooking.  Turn, cook on the other side, until golden, about 1 minute more.  Transfer to a baking sheet, place in the oven, and bake until cooked through, about 3 minutes.

To make the Sauce:  Drain off any oil left in the skillet; add garlic and chives and saute for 1 minute.  Add the Cognac away from the heat.  Return the skillet to high heat, step back and flambe.

To make the Trout And Crust:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Put the flour and egg in separate shallow dishes.  Mix the oats and horseradish together in a third shallow dish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pat the trout fillets dry with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper.  (If the fillets taper down to a very thin tail, fold the tails back to make a more uniformly thick fillet.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dredge the flesh sides of the trout fillets (leave the skin sides dry) in the flour then egg, and finally in the oat mixture.  Shake off any excess.  Put on a piece of waxed paper or baking sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat 1 large skillet over medium heat.  Add the oil and heat until hot.  Lay the fish in the skillet oat-side down and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Add the butter during the last minute of cooking.  Turn, cook on the other side, until golden, about 1 minute more.  Transfer to a baking sheet, place in the oven, and bake until cooked through, about 3 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Sauce:  Drain off any oil left in the skillet; add garlic and chives and saute for 1 minute.  Add the Cognac away from the heat.  Return the skillet to high heat, step back and flambe.  Scrape up any browned bits that cling to the pan with a wooden spoon, and simmer until syrupy.  Add the heavy cream, bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes.  Whisk in the mustard, parsley, salt, and thyme.  Season with the pepper, to taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  dried salted fish
                        = (such as cod)
  6             slices  thick-cut bacon
  4        tablespoons  butter or coconut oil
  3              large  onions -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     green bell pepper -- sliced into strips
  1                     red or yellow bell pepper -- sliced into strips
  2                     thyme sprigs
  6                     green onions -- finely chopped
     1/4                hot red pepper -- finely chopped
                        = (such as Scotch bonnet)
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
  1                can  whole tomatoes - (28 oz) -- broken by hands
  2               cans  ackee* - (18 oz ea) -- drained
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

* Please Note:  Eating unripe fresh ackee is unsafe.  Only ripened canned ackee is available in the United States.  It is regulated and certified by the U.S. government to be ripened fruit and safe for consumption.

In a bowl of cold water, soak fish at least 8 hours or overnight, changing water at least two times.  Drain and transfer the fish to a saucepan.  Discard soaking water.

Cover the fish with fresh cold water by 1-inch and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes.  Drain again and set the fish aside to cool.  Discard water.  When cool enough to handle, remove, and discard any bones and/or skin, and flake the fish into small pieces.  Set aside.

In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat until very crispy and all of the fat is rendered.  Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain and set aside.

Pour off most of the fat, then add the butter to the skillet.  Add the onions, cayenne, garlic, bell peppers, thyme, green onions, red pepper, and allspice and cook until the vegetables are tender but not browned, about 4 to 6 minutes.

Add the tomatoes, fish, and drained ackee and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and serve alongside a plate of white rice or rice and beans cooked in coconut milk.  Crumble the reserved bacon strips over the top of the ackee and serve.

     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  ground nutmeg

  1                     green bell pepper -- finely diced
  1              large  carrot -- peeled, shredded
     1/2           cup  grated yellow onion
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley
                        === FRIED PICKLES ===
  1                jar  whole dill pickles - (16 oz)
  1                cup  buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  hot red pepper sauce
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
  2        tablespoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  4               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Salt -- to taste

Place the pork in a baking dish.  In a bowl, combine the sugar, Essence, salt, cumin, paprika, pepper, and cayenne.  Rub the seasoning evenly over the pork to coat.  Cover with plastic and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.

Preheat an oven or smoker to 225 degrees.

Bring the pork to room temperature and place in a roasting pan, fat-side up.  Slow cook in the oven, basting with the Wet Mop Basting Sauce every 45 minutes, until tender and the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees.  (The cooking should take about 6 to 7 hours.)  Remove from the oven and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes.

With a knife and fork or two forks, pull the meat apart into small slices or chunks.  Toss with the barbecue sauce, to taste, and divide among the hamburger buns.  Top with the Kicked Up Cole Slaw.  Serve with the Fried Pickles and additional Barbecue Sauce on the side.

Wet Mop Basting Sauce:  The night before you cook the pork, combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and whisk well.  Refrigerate and let the flavors blend overnight.  (Makes 2 1/4 cups)

Barbecue Sauce:  In a bowl, combine all the ingredients and whisk well to dissolve the sugar.  Place in a squeeze bottle and dress the pulled pork sandwiches to taste.  (Makes about 2 cups)

Kicked Up Cole Slaw:  In a bowl, combine the mayonnaise, mustard, sugar, vinegar, buttermilk, celery seeds, salt, pepper, and cayenne, and whisk well to dissolve the sugar.

In a large bowl, combine the remaining ingredients.  Toss with the dressing until evenly coated.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.  Place in the refrigerator, covered, to chill slightly before serving.  (Makes 8 servings)

Fried Pickles:  Drain the pickles in a colander, then spread on paper towels to drain completely.

Combine the buttermilk and hot sauce in a bowl.  In a separate bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, and 2 tablespoons of Essence.

Heat the oil in a medium pot to 350 degrees.

Submerge the pickles in batches in the buttermilk, then dip into the flour mixture, tossing to evenly coat.  Shake in a strainer to remove any excess batter.  Add to the oil in batches, turning, until golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes.  Drain on paper towels, and season with Essence and salt, to taste.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 sandwiches.

  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  minced yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  8             ounces  exotic mushrooms -- cleaned, chopped
                        = (such as shiitakes, morels,
                        chanterelles, wood ears)
  1           teaspoon  salt -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-ground black pepper -- divided
  1              pound  lean ground beef
     1/2         pound  ground pork
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  chopped sage
  2          teaspoons  chopped thyme
  2                     egg whites
  10            slices  prosciutto - (to 12)
                        === COGNAC MUSTARD SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  dry mustard
     1/2           cup  brandy or Cognac
  1         tablespoon  honey
  2        tablespoons  Champagne vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Cornichons -- for serving

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper, and cook until they give off their liquid, about 5 minutes.  Remove the mushrooms from the pan and cool.

In a mixing bowl, combine the beef, pork, buttermilk, sage, thyme, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, egg whites, and the cooled mushrooms.  Stir well to blend.  Line a 6-cup (12- by 3- by 3-inch) terrine mold with prosciutto slices, overhanging the strips over the edges of the mold.  Pour the pate filling into the mold and cover with the prosciutto.  Wrap the terrine loosely in plastic wrap.  Top with an equal sized terrine, or a piece of cardboard wrapped in aluminum foil.  Place a brick on top of the terrine mold and bake for 1 hour.

Remove from the oven and allow pate to stand for 30 minutes before removing the weight and unwrapping.  Pour off any accumulated juices and allow pate to cool completely.  Cover pate with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely cooled.  Serve slices of pate either cold or at room temperature, lightly drizzled with the Cognac Mustard Sauce, with cornichons on the side.

Cognac Mustard Sauce:  In a bowl, combine all the ingredients and whisk until well incorporated.  (Makes about 1 cup of sauce)

This recipe yields 1 pate, serving 8 to 12 people as a first course.

Once the lobsters are cool enough to handle, remove the tails from the shells and use a chef's knife to cut the tails in half lengthwise.

To prepare the salsify, wear rubber gloves.  (Salsify releases a milky sap when peeled.)  Using a vegetable peeler, peel the salsify.  Use a sharp paring knife to trim the ends.  Cut the salsify into 2-inch lengths and place in a non-reactive bowl with 4 cups of cold water and the white vinegar.

In a medium saucepan, combine the milk, water, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper.  Place the salsify pieces in the pan and bring to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes.  Remove from the liquid and set aside to cool.  Once cool enough to handle, sprinkle the salsify with the cornstarch.  Shake to release any excess cornstarch.

Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the pan.  Once the oil is hot, place the salsify in the pan and sear for 1 minute.  Add 2 tablespoons of the butter to the pan and turn the salsify over on to the other side.  Continue to sear the salsify, turning occasionally, until all sides are evenly browned.  Add the chervil leaves and toss until coated.  Remove the pan from the heat and set aside until ready to serve.

Place a 10-inch saute pan over medium-high heat and add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the pan.  Once the oil is hot, place the lobster tails, cut-side down in the pan and sear for 2 minutes.  Add the remainding two tablespoons of butter to the pan and continue to sear the lobster for another 2 minutes.  Turn the lobsters and cook for 30 seconds on the other side.  Remove from the pan and set aside.

Assemble plates by dividing the salsify evenly among 4 plates.  Top each portion of salsify with one piece of lobster tail.  In a small mixing bowl, gently toss the mache with the extra-virgin olive oil and remaining salt and pepper.  Place 1/2 cup of the mache on top of each lobster tail and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1              pound  cream cheese -- room temperature
  4                     eggs

                        === PEAR VINAIGRETTE ===
  1                     firm-ripe pear - (abt 4 oz) -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1/4" thick slices
     1/4           cup  Champagne vinegar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  Champagne vinegar
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  green onions
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
                        === CANDIED WALNUTS ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  walnut halves
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar - (packed)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine bread crumbs, walnuts and melted butter and process until thoroughly combined.  Press the mixture on the bottom and partially up the sides of an 8-inch springform pan.  Set aside.

In a mixing bowl combine blue cheese and cream cheese and mix until smooth.  Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add the garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper and combine well.  Using a spatula, transfer cheese mixture to the prepared pan and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the cake is golden brown and not loose in the center.

While the cake is baking, make the Pear Vinaigrette and Candied Walnuts.

Pear Vinaigrette:  Combine the pear, Champagne vinegar, shallots, sugar, rosemary and black pepper in a skillet and bring to a simmer.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the pears are tender, about 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a blender or food processor.

Add the mustard, soy sauce, kosher salt, and green onions, and puree on high speed.  With the motor running, add the oil in a thin stream and process until emulsified.  Remove from the blender and refrigerate in an airtight container until ready to serve.  (Makes 1 generous cup.  The vinaigrette will keep for up to 1 week refrigerated.)

Candied Walnuts:  Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the walnuts and cook, stirring, until golden brown and toasted, 3 minutes.  Add the sugar and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Transfer to a piece of waxed paper to cool.  (Makes 1/2 cup)

When the cake is puffed, golden brown and not loose in the center, transfer to a cooling rack and allow to cool at least 30 minutes before serving.

Serve the cake warm, with a salad of baby greens tossed with the Pear Vinaigrette, garnished with the Candied Walnuts.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BASIC SWEET PIE CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut 1/4" pieces,
                        and chilled
  2        tablespoons  vegetable shortening -- chilled
  3        tablespoons  ice water -- or as needed
                        === TORTE ===
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2             pounds  Bosc pears - (abt 4) -- peeled, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  water
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  blueberries
                        === WHITE CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM ===
  3               cups  heavy cream
  2               cups  milk -- divided
  1                     vanilla bean
  12             large  egg yolks
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  white chocolate

For the Basic Sweet Pie Crust:  Sift the flour, sugar and salt into a large bowl.  Add the butter and shortening.  Rub the fats between your fingertips and thumbs, or use a pastry blender, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

One tablespoon at a time, work in enough ice water just until the dough comes together, being careful not to over mix.  Shape into a smooth ball, flatten into a disc, and wrap in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, and up to 2 days.

Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 10- to 12-inch round that is 1/8-inch thick.  Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie pan.  Trim off any overhanging dough to make a 1/2-inch wide overhang.  Flute the edges of the dough with your fingertips.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Line the pastry with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake until the crust is set, about 12 minutes.  Remove the paper and weights and bake until golden brown, about 8 minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place a large 12-inch saute pan over medium-high heat and melt the butter.  Once the butter has melted, add the pear slices to the pan, add the sugar, lemon zest, and cinnamon to the pan and saute with the pears.

Make a slurry using the lemon juice, water and cornstarch, add this to the saute pan and cook for 3 minutes longer.  Toss to blend, season with the salt, and remove from the heat.  Add the blueberries to the pan and stir to blend.  Place the fruit filling in the piecrust and place the tart in the oven.  Bake the tart for 30 minutes and remove.  Let cool for 15 minutes or longer.

For the White Chocolate Ice Cream:  Combine the cream and 1 cup of the milk in a large heavy saucepan.  Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Scrape the vanilla bean seeds into the cream mixture and add the bean pod.  Whisk the yolks and sugar in a medium bowl.  In a slow and steady stream, whisk 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture.  Gradually whisk the egg mixture back into the saucepan.  Add the white chocolate to the custard, and stir constantly over medium-low heat until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes.

Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof medium bowl.  Stir in the remaining 1 cup milk into the ice cream base and cover with plastic wrap, press the wrap against the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming.  Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours.

Pour the chilled custard into an ice cream machine.  Churn according to the manufacturers' instructions.  Pack into an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.

Serve the torte with the White Chocolate Ice Cream.  Garnish with blueberries, mint and powdered sugar.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === QUATRE EPICES ===
  1           teaspoon  allspice berries
  1           teaspoon  whole cloves
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  cinnamon
                        === BRAISED SHANKS ===
  4                     meaty lamb shanks - (abt 1 lb ea) -- do not trim
                        external fat
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  Banylus wine, vin doux naturel from
                        Provence
                        = (or Port)
  1              quart  chicken stock
                        === GARLIC CONFIT ===
  4                     plump fresh garlic heads -- separated into
                        cloves, but not peeled
  1                cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Quatre Epices:  Grind the allpsice in a spice grinder.  Grind the cloves in a spice grinder.  Combine the spices in a small bowl and add grated nutmeg and ground cinnamon.  Use immediately.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Braised Shanks:  Rub quatre epices all over the surface of the lamb shanks.  Season with sea salt and white pepper.  Stand the shanks, wider-side down, narrow-end up, in a large roasting pan.  Place the pan in the center of the oven and roast, uncovered, for 1 hour.

Transfer the lamb to a platter and set aside.

Off the heat, deglaze the pan with wine, scraping up any cooked bits that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan.  Return the lamb to the pan standing on end, wider-side down.  Add the stock, cover, and return to the oven.  Braise, without disturbing the meat, until the meat is very tender and just beginning to fall off the bone, about 1 1/2 hours.

For the Garlic Confit:  Place the garlic in a small saucepan and cover with the olive oil.  Cook, uncovered at the barest simmer, over the lowest possible heat, until the garlic is soft and a small knife inserted into a clove, meets no resistance, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Remove lamb from oven and place on a platter.  Strain the juice through a fine mesh strainer into a gravy boat.  Drain the garlic and serve with the lamb.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
     3/4           cup  medium-grain bulgur
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill -- plus
                        generous sprigs for garnish
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley -- plus
                        generous sprigs for garnish
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh mint -- plus
                        generous sprigs for garnish
  3        tablespoons  pine nuts -- toasted
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt -- plus more as needed
  4                     scallions, white and green -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              large  egg -- beaten
     1/2           cup  crumbled Greek feta - (abt 3 oz)
  4                     Cornish game hens -- backbone and
                        breast bone removed (butterflied)
                        === CHARRED TOMATO COULIS ===
  4             medium  ripe tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  2           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Bring the stock to a boil in a small saucepan.  Meanwhile, toast the bulgur in a medium skillet over medium heat until fragrant and nutty, about 4 minutes.  Stir in the bulgur, lower the heat, and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside for 5 minutes.

Transfer the bulgur to a medium bowl and fluff with a fork.  Add 1/4 cup of the olive oil, chopped herbs, pine nuts, 2 teaspoons salt, scallions, and garlic and season with pepper, to taste.  Cool slightly and add the egg and feta, and mix to combine.  Set the stuffing aside.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Lay the hens on a work surface.  Starting from the neck of a hen, slip a couple fingers between the skin and breast, and loosen the skin.  Take a large spoonful of the stuffing and slip the spoon between the skin and breast.  With your free hand, hold the stuffing in place and gently pull the spoon out, leaving the stuffing behind.  Press the skin down to evenly distribute the stuffing over the breast.  Repeat until the hens are evenly stuffed.  Cross the legs of the birds at the breastbone and tie them with a piece of kitchen twine.

Arrange the hens breast-side up on a baking sheet.  Brush all over with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.

Roast the birds until well browned and crispy, and an instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees when inserted into the thigh, about 40 minutes.

To serve, split the hens in half lengthwise.  Pour the Charred Tomato Coulis onto a platter and arrange the hens on top.  Garnish with the herb sprigs and serve.

Charred Tomato Coulis:  Put the tomatoes over 2 gas burners on high and cook, turning occasionally, until charred and peeling.  Alternatively, broil the tomatoes until charred.  Put the tomatoes in a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap.  Set aside to steam for 5 minutes.  Peel and seed the tomatoes.

Transfer the tomatoes to a blender with the vinegar and garlic and puree until smooth.  While the motor is running, drizzle in the oil until incorporated.  Season with pepper, to taste.  (Makes about 2 cups)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  yellow cornmeal

  2          teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  hot red pepper sauce
     1/4           cup  minced onions

  6               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
  2        tablespoons  Creole seasoning

Combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, hot sauce, onions, bell peppers, jalapeÒos, and cayenne in a large mixing bowl and mix well to break up any lumps.  Stir in the eggs, buttermilk, and water, and blend well.

Heat the oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat to 360 degrees.

In batches, drop the batter by tablespoons into the hot oil and fry until golden brown on all sides, turning with a long-handled spoon, about 2 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Repeat with the remaining batter.  Sprinkle with the Creole seasoning and serve hot.

This recipe yields 18 hush puppies.

                              Cafe Brulot II

Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     orange peel -- cut 1" by 1/8"
                        strips, plus
  1                     orange -- peel cut into 1
                        long intact spiral
  1                     lemon peel -- cut 1" by 1/8"
                        strips
  4                     sugar cubes
  6                     whole cloves
  1                     cinnamon stick - (2" long)
     1/2           cup  orange flavored liqueur
  2               cups  hot freshly-brewed strong black coffee

Light the burner under a brulot bowl or chafing dish and adjust the flame to low.  Into the bowl place the orange and lemon peels, sugar, cloves, cinnamon stick and orange liqueur.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly with a long-handled ladle, to dissolve the sugar and warm the ingredients.

When the mixture is warm, stir in the hot coffee, and ignite with a match.

Quickly, while the mixture is still flaming, hold the spiraled orange peel with the prongs of a fork over the bowl, and ladle the flaming coffee mixture down the peel several times into the bowl for a spectacular presentation.

Ladle the Cafe Brulot into brulot or demi-tasse cups, being careful to leave the flavorings (peels, cloves, cinnamon) in the bowl.  Serve immediately while hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The coffee is prepared in and served from a special decorative bowl positioned over a flame, and the finale consists of the flaming coffee being ladled down a long spiral of orange peel back into the bowl.  A Brulot ladle is specially designed with a small strainer at the end so that the bits of peel, cloves and cinnamon do not get served to guests.  The finished beverage is served in tall, thin, footed mugs, often decorated with a full-length portrait of the devil, reference to the drink's other name, "Cafe Diabolique" or "Devil's Coffee," perhaps so named for the punch it packs!

Cafe Brulot has long been a favorite New Orleans treat, served as a festive after-dinner digestive at old line New Orleans restaurants, such as Antoine's, Arnaud's and Galatoire's.  Emeril's Delmonico Restaurant is among the new generation of New Orleans eateries keeping up the tradition and features Cafe Brulot on its menu.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     pompano fillets - (4 to 6 oz ea) -- scaled, trimmed
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise

                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        === SALSA ===
     1/2           cup  chopped seeded plum tomatoes
  1                     mango -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SWEET POTATO-BOURBON DRESSING ===
  1              large  sweet potato - (abt 3/4 lb) -- rinsed, patted dry
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
     1/4           cup  dark corn syrup
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  water
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  Kentucky bourbon
  1         tablespoon  chopped shallots
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  allspice
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
                        === SALAD ===
  4                     ham steaks, 3/4" thk - (abt 3/4 lb ea)
  2              heads  Bibb lettuce -- split lengthwise,
                        gently washed to keep the leaves attached
                        to the stems, and patted dry
                        === CANDIED PECANS ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  pecan halves
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar - (packed)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Place the sweet potato on a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 375 degrees and bake until tender and the syrupy sugars start to break through the skin, about 45 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.  Cut a slit down the potato and remove the peel.

Place the cream in a small saucepan and bring to a low simmer.  Remove from the heat.

Combine the brown sugar, corn syrup, butter, and water in a small pot and bring to a boil.  Boil for 1 minute.  Add the hot cream and boil for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

Combine the sweet potato, warm sugar mixture, vinegar, bourbon, shallots, pepper, allspice and salt in the barrel of a food processor and puree for 30 seconds.  Gradually pulse in the oil through the feeder tube in the top.  Keep warm.

In a large skillet over high heat, sear the ham steak until golden brown and caramelized on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Place the ham steaks on serving plates, then arrange a lettuce half, cut-side up, on top of each ham steak.  Sprinkle with the Candied Pecans.  Drizzle 2 ounces of the warm dressing over the salad and ham steak.  Serve immediately.  (Leftover dressing can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.)

Candied Pecans:  Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the pecans and cook, stirring, until golden brown and toasted, 3 minutes.  Add the sugar and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Transfer to a piece of waxed paper to cool.  (Makes 1/2 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  shelled pumpkin seeds
                        = (very important these are shelled)
  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  dried Mexican oregano
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1              bunch  cilantro, stems and leaves
  2                     jalapeÒos -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves
  2                     romaine lettuce leaves
  5                     tomatillos -- husked, washed,
                        and coarsely chopped
                        Radish tops
  1                     chicken -- cut into 8 pieces
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2 1/2           cups  chicken stock
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  cinnamon -- (optional)
                        Cooked rice -- as an accompaniment
                        Sliced radishes -- for garnish

In a large skillet over low heat, toast pumpkin seeds, cumin seeds, and oregano until fragrant and pumpkin seeds begin to pop, 6 to 7 minutes.  Reserve 2 tablespoons toasted seeds, and transfer the remaining seeds to a blender or spice grinder and process until finely ground.  Set aside.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine onion, cilantro, jalapeÒos, garlic, lettuce, tomatillos, and radish tops and puree until smooth.

In a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown chicken on all sides in vegetable oil over medium-high heat, about 10 minutes, turning the pieces as they cook.  Transfer chicken to a platter.

Add the pureed vegetables to the hot skillet and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.  Stir in chicken stock and ground seeds, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper, and add the cinnamon, if desired.  Add the chicken pieces to the pan and return to a boil.  Reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook, partially covered, until the chicken is cooked through and tender, about 40 minutes.

Serve over white rice with sliced radishes and reserved toasted pumpkin seeds.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (abt 4 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Cayenne pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  flour
  1                cup  finely-diced yellow onion
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped bell pepper
  2                     bay leaves
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1             bottle  dark lager or amber beer
  1              quart  cold chicken stock
  2          teaspoons  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  hot sauce
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire Sauce
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley

Season the chicken pieces with salt and cayenne pepper.

Heat the oil in a large dutch oven over medium-high heat and sear chicken pieces on both sides until golden brown.  Remove to a platter and reserve.

Add butter to pan and when melted, add flour, and stir to combine well.  Continue to cook roux, stirring constantly, until chocolate brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.

Immediately add onion, celery, bell pepper, and bay leaves and cook until soft, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add garlic and cook another 2 minutes, then add the beer and stir well to loosen any brown bits from pan bottom.  Add the stock, brown sugar, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce and stir to combine well.  Bring to a boil, return chicken pieces to the pot, and simmer for 1 hour and 15 minutes, until chicken is very tender.

Remove chicken pieces to a platter and when cool enough to handle, remove chicken meat from the bones.  Return chicken meat to etouffee and continue to cook another 30 minutes, until sauce is thickened and flavorful and chicken is beginning to fall apart.  Add chopped parsley and stir well to combine.  Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary, and serve immediately over rice or other starch of choice.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut 1" cubes
  3        tablespoons  sweet Hungarian paprika
  2          teaspoons  hot Hungarian paprika
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt -- divided
  3        tablespoons  butter, bacon fat, or lard
  1                cup  finely-chopped yellow onion
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
  1                cup  chicken stock - (to 1 1/2)
     1/2           cup  sour cream
                        === HERBED SPAETZLE ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1 3/4      teaspoons  salt
  3              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
     1/3           cup  whole milk
     1/4           cup  minced mixed herbs
                        = (such as parsley, chives,
                        tarragon, or basil)
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice

Season the chicken with 2 tablespoons of the sweet and 1 teaspoon of the hot paprika, and 1 teaspoon of the salt.

Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and remaining tablespoon of sweet paprika, 1 teaspoon of hot paprika, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the chicken and cook, stirring, until golden, about 4 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook for 1 minute.  Add enough stock to cover the chicken and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat, cover, and simmer until the chicken is tender and cooked through, about 25 minutes, adding more stock as needed.

Uncover and add the sour cream.  Cook gently until incorporated and warmed through, about 2 minutes.  Season, to taste.

To serve, divide the Herbed Spaetzle among 4 large plates, spoon the chicken and sauce over the noodles, and serve immediately.

Herbed Spaetzle:  Combine the flour and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt in a large bowl.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk, then add to the flour, whisking until smooth.  Add the oil and mix well.

Prepare an ice bath in a large bowl and set aside.

Bring 4 quarts of water and the remaining teaspoon of salt to a rolling boil in a large stockpot.  Pour half of the batter into a spaetzle maker or a medium colander set over the boiling water.  With a rubber spatula, force the batter through the holes of the spaetzle maker or colander into the water.  (The water will rise and foam quickly.)  Cook the dumplings, stirring, until they rise to the surface, about 5 minutes.  Transfer with a long-handled spoon or strainer to the ice bath.

Repeat with the remaining batter.  Drain and place in a clean container.  (The spaetzle can be prepared to this point up to 2 hours in advance, and kept tightly covered in the refrigerator until ready to assemble.)

Melt the butter in a large non-stick skillet or saute pan over medium-high heat.  When the butter is foamy, add the spaetzle, parsley, and lemon juice, and stir to combine.  Cook until the spaetzle is warmed through and the flavors are well blended.

Remove from the heat and serve immediately with the Chicken Paprikas.  (Makes 4 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Season the chicken with 2 tablespoons of the sweet and 1 teaspoon of the hot paprika, and 1 teaspoon of the salt.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and remaining tablespoon of sweet paprika, 1 teaspoon of hot paprika, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the chicken and cook, stirring, until golden, about 4 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook for 1 minute.  Add enough stock to cover the chicken and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat, cover, and simmer until the chicken is tender and cooked through, about 25 minutes, adding more stock as needed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Uncover and add the sour cream.  Cook gently until incorporated and warmed through, about 2 minutes.  Season, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, divide the Herbed Spaetzle among 4 large plates, spoon the chicken and sauce over the noodles, and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Herbed Spaetzle:  Combine the flour and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt in a large bowl.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk, then add to the flour, whisking until smooth.  Add the oil and mix well.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare an ice bath in a large bowl and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring 4 quarts of water and the remaining teaspoon of salt to a rolling boil in a large stockpot.  Pour half of the batter into a spaetzle maker or a medium colander set over the boiling water.  With a rubber spatula, force the batter through the holes of the spaetzle maker or colander into the water.  (The water will rise and foam quickly.)  Cook the dumplings, stirring, until they rise to the surface, about 5 minutes.  Transfer with a long-handled spoon or strainer to the ice bath.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Repeat with the remaining batter.  Drain and place in a clean container.  (The spaetzle can be prepared to this point up to 2 hours in advance, and kept tightly covered in the refrigerator until ready to assemble.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt the butter in a large non-stick skillet or saute pan over medium-high heat.  When the butter is foamy, add the spaetzle, parsley, and lemon juice, and stir to combine.  Cook until the spaetzle is warmed through and the flavors are well blended.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the heat and serve immediately with the Chicken Paprikas.  (Makes 4 cups)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  milk
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split, scraped
  3        tablespoons  ground espresso beans
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  6        tablespoons  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  semi-sweet chocolate chips

Heat the heavy cream, milk, vanilla bean and espresso in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.  Place the egg yolks and sugar in a heatproof mixing bowl and beat until pale yellow in color and all of the sugar has dissolved.  Temper about 1/2 cup of the cream mixture into the egg mixture and whisk vigorously to incorporate well.  Add the egg mixture to the saucepan with the cream mixture and cook, stirring constantly with a whisk, or wooden spoon.  Be sure to stir in the corners of the pot and lower the heat slightly.  Stir the pot for 4 to 5 minutes or until the custard has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon.

Remove from the stove and strain the custard through a fine mesh sieve into a clean bowl.  Place the bowl in another bowl half-filled with ice and water to cool the custard.  To chill the custard faster, stir it occasionally with a spoon.

Pour the chilled custard into an ice cream machine.  Churn according to the manufacturer's instructions, and fold the chocolate chips into the partially frozen custard.  Pack into an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.

This recipe yields about 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CORN CAKES ===
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  corn kernels
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  2          teaspoons  minced jalapeÒo
  1           teaspoon  fine salt
  1                cup  buttermilk
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
                        === CONFIT TOPPING ===
     1/4           cup  demi-glace
  2        tablespoons  hot pepper jelly
  2                     confit duck legs -- boned, and
                        finely shredded - (abt 1 1/2 cups)
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped red and yellow bell peppers
  1              pinch  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        About 30 fresh cilantro leaves

To make the Corn Cakes:  Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the corn, shallot, jalapeÒo, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring, until the corn is tender and fragrant, about 3 minutes.  Set aside to cool.

In a medium bowl, whisk the buttermilk and egg.  Stir in the cooled corn mixture.

In another medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, cornmeal, flour, baking powder, soda, and cayenne.  Add the buttermilk mixture and stir to form a thick batter (take care not to overmix).  Set batter aside while making the confit topping.

To make the Confit Topping:  In a small saucepan, whisk together the demi-glace and jelly and cook over medium heat until just thickened.  Add the duck and diced peppers and cook, stirring occasionally until heated through.  Add the Essence and set aside, covered, while you make the corncakes.

Place a paper towel-lined baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 100 degrees.

Preheat a large skillet over medium heat.  Pour in enough of the vegetable oil to lightly film the skillet.  Add about a tablespoon of the batter at a time, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.  Cook until golden brown, turning once, about 2 minutes per side.  Using a slotted spatula, transfer the corncakes to the baking sheet to keep warm.  Repeat with the remaining batter to make about 30 corncakes in all.

To serve, place the warm corncakes on a serving platter and top each with some of the duck mixture.  Garnish each corncake with a cilantro leaf and serve.

This recipe yields 30 hors d'oeuvres.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PUFF PASTRY ===
  2           packages  frozen puff pastry
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  milk
                        === FOR THE ETOUFFEE ===
  6        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2           cups  chopped onions
     1/2           cup  chopped celery
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2                     bay leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  2             pounds  crawfish tails -- any fat reserved
  2               cups  fish or shrimp stock
  1                cup  diced seeded peeled tomatoes
                        Hot sauce -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce
  4        tablespoons  flour
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
  1                cup  chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley

For the Puff Pastry:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Roll the puff pastry out to 1/8-inch thick.  With a 4-inch round cutter, cut out 16 circles.  Using a 2 1/2-inch cutter, cut the centers out of 8 of the circles.  Place the whole circles on a parchment lined baking sheet.

In a small bowl, beat the egg with the milk to make an egg wash.  Brush the whole circles with the egg wash.  Lay the circles with the center cut out on top of the whole circles.  Place in the oven and bake for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove from the oven and cool.

In a large, heavy saucepan, melt the butter.  Add onions, celery, garlic, bay leaves and thyme and cook until vegetables are soft, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Season with salt and crushed red pepper.  Add crawfish tails.  Add stock, tomatoes, salt, red pepper, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce and bring to a boil.

Make a slurry with the flour and water.  Add the slurry and bring to a boil.  Add lemon juice, green onions, and parsley and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add remaining butter and stir to combine well.  Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.  Serve in the puff pastry.

Roll the puff pastry out to 1/8-inch thick.  With a 4-inch round cutter, cut out 16 circles.  Using a 2 1/2-inch cutter, cut the centers out of 8 of the circles.  Place the whole circles on a parchment lined baking sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, beat the egg with the milk to make an egg wash.  Brush the whole circles with the egg wash.  Lay the circles with the center cut out on top of the whole circles.  Place in the oven and bake for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove from the oven and cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large, heavy saucepan, melt the butter.  Add onions, celery, garlic, bay leaves and thyme and cook until vegetables are soft, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Season with salt and crushed red pepper.  Add crawfish tails.  Add stock, tomatoes, salt, red pepper, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce and bring to a boil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Make a slurry with the flour and water.  Add the slurry and bring to a boil.  Add lemon juice, green onions, and parsley and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add remaining butter and stir to combine well.  Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.  Serve in the puff pastry.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1              pound  cooked crawfish tails
     1/2         pound  halibut or sole
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
  3                     egg whites
     1/4           cup  minced green onions
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh dill
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Fresh watercress -- rinsed, spun dry
                        === HOMEMADE HERB MAYONNAISE ===
  1              large  egg
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
  1 1/4           cups  vegetable oil
                        = (or mild olive oil)
  2          teaspoons  chopped tarragon
  2          teaspoons  chopped parsley
  2          teaspoons  chopped dill
  2          teaspoons  chopped basil
                        French bread croutons -- accompaniment

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 8 (4-ounce) ramekins or baking dishes, and set aside.

In a food processor, puree 1/2 of the crawfish and all of the halibut.  With the machine running, add the salt, white pepper, cayenne, and garlic, and with the machine running, add the cream and white wine.  Add the egg whites.  Transfer to a bowl and fold in the green onions, dill, and remaining crawfish tails.

Put the ramekins in a large roasting pan, and pour hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides.  Bake until the custards are just set and puffed, and lightly golden brown on top, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours and up to a day.

Arrange the watercress around the rims of 8 small plates.  Remove the molds from the refrigerator and carefully run a thin, sharp knife around each mousse.  Shake gently and unmold onto the plates.  Serve cold with Homemade Herb Mayonnaise, and small French bread croutons.

Homemade Herb Mayonnaise:  In a food processor or blender, combine the egg, mustard, lemon juice, salt, and cayenne, and process on high speed until smooth.  With the machine running, slowly add the oil in a steady stream until an emulsion forms.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.  Place the mayonnaise in a mixing bowl and fold in the chopped herbs.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.  (Makes about 1 1/2 cups)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh spinach -- washed, and
                        tough stems removed
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic

Add the spinach and cook, stirring, just until the liquid is released.  Add the cream, salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and cook until the cream is reduced by half, about 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and serve immediately.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  water
                        Salt -- to taste
  1                cup  stone-ground cornmeal
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/4         pound  cream cheese or mascarpone
  2        tablespoons  butter or olive oil

     1/2           cup  finely-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

In a large, heavy saucepan, bring water to boil with salt, to taste.  While whisking constantly, pour the cornmeal into the water in a steady stream until thoroughly combined.  Continue whisking to make certain there are no lumps of unincorporated cornmeal.  Reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 20 minutes, uncovering frequently to stir.

Stir in the heavy cream, cream cheese, and butter and continue to cook, covered, another 20 minutes or so, stirring often.  When the polenta is smooth, with no taste of rawness, add salt and pepper, to taste (if polenta seems too thick, you may dilute with a bit of water or milk), and serve garnished with the grated cheese.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE CRESPELLE BATTER ===
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
  1         tablespoon  melted unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  whole milk -- plus
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  1              pound  fresh spinach -- washed, stemmed,
                        and steamed
     1/2         pound  ricotta
     3/4           cup  finely-grated Parmesan
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        === FOR THE BECHAMEL ===
  4        tablespoons  butter
  6        tablespoons  flour
  1 3/4           cups  milk
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        === TO FINISH ===
  2        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter -- more or less
  1                cup  prepared tomato sauce

For The Crepes:  In a bowl whisk together all the ingredients to form a smooth, thin batter.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before proceeding.

Heat a small skillet or crepe pan and when hot, brush lightly with butter.  Ladle about 1/4 cup of crepe batter into the pan, tilting the skillet to evenly coat the pan.  Cook until golden brown on the bottom and the top begins to look dry, 1 to 2 minutes.  Using a spatula, carefully turn the crepe and cook the second side until the bottom colors slightly, about 30 seconds.  Transfer to a plate and cover loosely to keep warm.  Repeat with remaining batter to yield 8 crepes

For The Filling:  Squeeze the spinach to extract any remaining moisture, then coarsely chop to yield about 1 cup.  In a bowl, combine the spinach, ricotta, Parmesan, eggs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and stir to thoroughly combine.  Set aside.

Assembly:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly butter a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish.

Divide the spinach filling evenly among the crepes (using about 1/3 cup filling for each).  Roll the crepes up around the filling and place in the buttered dish.  Set aside while preparing the sauce.

For The Bechamel Sauce:  In a saucepan, melt the butter.  Whisk in the flour until smooth and continue to cook for 3 minutes, being careful not to brown.  Slowly whisk in the cold milk, and cook, stirring, until the sauce comes to a boil and thickens, about 2 minutes.  Continue cooking until the floury taste is gone, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.

To Finish:  Pour the bechamel over the crepes, drizzle with butter, and bake for 20 minutes, until lightly browned on top.  Serve hot, with a little tomato sauce spooned over the top of each serving.

This recipe yields 8 first-course servings.

For The Crepes:  In a bowl whisk together all the ingredients to form a smooth, thin batter.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before proceeding.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a small skillet or crepe pan and when hot, brush lightly with butter.  Ladle about 1/4 cup of crepe batter into the pan, tilting the skillet to evenly coat the pan.  Cook until golden brown on the bottom and the top begins to look dry, 1 to 2 minutes.  Using a spatula, carefully turn the crepe and cook the second side until the bottom colors slightly, about 30 seconds.  Transfer to a plate and cover loosely to keep warm.  Repeat with remaining batter to yield 8 crepes
</DirT>

     1/2                hard boiled egg -- peeled, and

                        by 1" by 4" each
                        === CREAMY PARMESAN DRESSING ===
  1              large  egg
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped garlic
  2                     anchovy fillets
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire Sauce
  2              drops  hot pepper sauce

Make the Creamy Parmesan Dressing and set aside.

Bring 2 medium pots of salted water to a boil.  Add the potatoes to 1 pot and blanch until just tender, about 3 1/2 minutes.  Drain in a colander.

Add the green beans to the other pot and blanch until tender, 4 minutes.  Drain in a colander.

Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the drained potatoes, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper, and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until golden brown on both sides, 8 minutes.  Add the remaining tablespoon of oil, garlic, and drained green beans.  Stir to combine and cook for 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes and olives and cook until the tomatoes are warmed through, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Add the mayonnaise, lemon juice, minced onion, hard-boiled egg, capers, parsley, and tarragon and stir to combine.  Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary.

Combine the lettuce with the Creamy Parmesan Dressing and toss to coat.  Arrange 3 or 4 leaves along the side of 6 large plates.  Spoon the vegetables along the other side of the plate.  Let sit while cooking the tuna.

Season each tuna portion with 1/2 teaspoon of the remaining salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the remaining pepper.

Heat the remaining 1/4 cup of oil in 1 large skillet or 2 medium skillets, over medium-high heat.  Add the tuna and sear, about 15 seconds per side.  Remove from the pan and cut each crosswise into 4 equal pieces.  Arrange the tuna slices down the middle of each plate, and serve.

Creamy Parmesan Dressing:  Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil.  Add the egg and cook for 30 seconds until coddled.

In a small bowl, combine the salt, pepper, garlic, and anchovies.  Mash the anchovies with the back of a fork and mix into the other ingredients.  Add the egg and whisk well to combine.  Add the cheese, lemon juice, and mustard, and whisk well.  Add the olive oil in a steady stream, whisking constantly.  Add the Worcestershire and pepper sauces, and whisk well.  Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary.

  1                cup  buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  Essence -- plus
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2           cup  masa harina
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === GARNISH ===
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions -- green tops only
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley

Pour cold water into a 10-inch saute pan to a depth of about 2 inches.  Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat so that the surface of the water barely shimmers.  Add the vinegar.

Break four of the eggs into individual saucers, then gently slide them out one at a time into the water and, with a large spoon, lift the white over the yolk.  Repeat the lifting once or twice to completely enclose each yolk.  Poach until the whites are set and the yolks feel firm yet soft when touched gently, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and either serve immediately, or place in a shallow pan or large bowl of cold water.

Repeat with the remaining eggs, adding more water as needed to keep the depth at 2 inches, and bringing the water to a simmer before adding the eggs.

To serve, reheat the eggs as necessary by slipping them into simmering water for 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Place 2 toasted English muffin halves on each of 4 plates and lay 3 half strips of bacon on each.  Place 1 poached egg on top of each muffin half and drizzle with the Tasso Hollandaise.  Top with fried oysters, and garnish with the chopped green onions and parsley.  Serve immediately.

Tasso Hollandaise:  In a small skillet over medium-high heat, cook the tasso, stirring, until the fat is rendered.  Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels, reserving the fat

In the top of a double boiler, or in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water, beat the egg yolks and lemon juice until pale and thick.  Combine the butter and the rendered tasso fat, and whisking constantly, add to the egg mixture in a steady stream.  Season with the salt and pepper and continue whisking until thick.  Remove from the heat, fold in the tasso, and cover to keep warm until ready to serve.

Fried Oysters:  In a bowl, combine the buttermilk with 1 tablespoon of the Essence.  Add the oysters and marinate for 5 minutes.  In a shallow dish, combine the masa harina and flour with 1 tablespoon of the Essence.

In a medium, heavy pot with high sides, heat the oil to 350 degrees.

Dredge the oysters in the flour mixture and shake the pieces in a strainer to remove any excess.  Carefully add to the hot oil in batches, and cook, turning occasionally, until golden on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes.  With a slotted spoon remove and drain on a paper towels.  Season lightly with the remaining teaspoon of Essence.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Categories    : Casseroles                      Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh sauerkraut
  4        tablespoons  butter
                        = (or duck, chicken, or goose fat)
     1/4         pound  pancetta or bacon -- large diced
  3                     yellow onions -- peeled, sliced
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2                     bay leaves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  black peppercorns
  8                     juniper berries -- lightly crushed
  1                     garlic head -- split in half
  2                     ham hocks -- scored
  1                cup  chicken stock
  2               cups  dark or amber beer
                        = (such as Abita Amber)
  1              pound  garlic sausage, kielbasa, or knockwurst
  1              pound  bratwurst or veal sausage
  1 1/2         pounds  small red new potatoes -- well scrubbed,
                        and halved, if large
                        Creole, whole-grain, or Dijon mustard -- for serving

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Place the sauerkraut in a colander and rinse briefly to remove some of the salt from the brine: don't rinse it too much, or you will lose a lot of the flavor.  (Alternately, if sauerkraut is not excessively salty, use as is.)  Press to release most of the excess liquid and set aside.

In a large non-reactive skillet, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter over medium-low heat and add the bacon.  Cook for 5 minutes, not allowing the bacon to brown.  Add the onions and continue to cook until they are soft but not browned, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Transfer bacon-onion mixture to a 3 1/2- or 4-quart non-reactive ovenproof casserole or Dutch oven.  Add the drained sauerkraut and toss to combine.  Using a small piece of cheesecloth, make a bouquet garni with the thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns, juniper berries, and garlic and place in the baking dish.  Add the ham hocks, chicken stock, and beer and stir to combine.  Cover the pot and bake for 2 hours, undisturbed.

While the sauerkraut is baking, melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over high heat and brown the sausages on both sides.  Set aside.

When the sauerkraut and hocks have baked for 2 hours and the hocks are tender, remove the casserole from the oven.  Place the potatoes on top of the sauerkraut.  If the liquid has evaporated to below 2/3 full level, add a bit more water to the casserole at this time.  Cover the casserole and return it to the oven.  Cook for about 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.

Remove the casserole from the oven again and place the browned sausages on top of the sauerkraut mixture, cover, and return to the oven until the sausages are heated through and the potatoes are tender, about 15 more minutes.  Remove the bouquet garni and serve immediately, with each person receiving some of each of the sausages, part of a hock, potatoes and sauerkraut.  Pass the mustard at the table as a condiment.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

     1/3           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  2                     eggs
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Dijon mustard
     3/4           cup  ketchup -- divided
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce -- plus
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     2/3           cup  breadcrumbs
  1              pound  ground chuck
     1/2         pound  pork sausage
                        = (such as breakfast sausage)
     1/2         pound  ground veal
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2 1/4      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper -- divided
  4             slices  bacon -- cut in half
  2        tablespoons  white or red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  canned tomatoes -- chopped or crushed

In a large skillet heat the butter over medium-high heat until melted.  Add all but 1/4 cup of the onions, the celery and all but 2 tablespoons of the bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and beginning to caramelize around the edges, about 6 minutes.  Add 2 teaspoons of the garlic, the thyme, rosemary, and parsley and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

When the vegetable mixture is cooled, transfer to a mixing bowl and add the eggs, mustard, 1/4 cup of the ketchup, 1 teaspoon of the Worcestershire sauce, and heavy cream and mix until thoroughly combined.  Add the breadcrumbs, ground chuck, pork sausage, ground veal, 1 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper and mix until just combined.  Do not overmix.  Transfer meat mixture to a 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan and using your hands, form mixture into a loaf shape.  Arrange the slices of bacon on the top of the meatloaf and set aside.

In a small saucepan combine the remaining 1/4 cup of chopped onion, remaining 2 tablespoons of green pepper, remaining teaspoon of garlic, remaining 1/2 cup of ketchup, remaining 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, remaining 2 teaspoons of pepper, vinegar, and canned tomatoes and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.

Pour the sauce over the uncooked meatloaf and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the bacon and sauce are slightly caramelized on the top of the meatloaf.  Remove from the oven and cover loosely with aluminum foil.  Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.  Slice and serve along with the Macaroni With 4 Cheeses (see recipe).

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  3        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  flour
     2/3           cup  dark beer
                        = (such as Abita Turbodog)
  4             ounces  sharp English cheddar cheese -- grated
  4             ounces  Caerphilly cheese* -- grated
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  dry English mustard
  1               pint  raw oysters
  12            slices  French bread, 1/2" thick -- toasted
  6             slices  crispy-cooked bacon -- crumbled

*Note: If you cannot find Caerphilly cheese, substitute cheddar.

In a medium saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat.  Add the flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Slowly whisk in the beer.  When the bubbles have begun to subside, add the cheeses, 1 handful at a time, stirring constantly and in 1 direction only, until smooth and creamy.  Add 1 teaspoon of the Essence, the Worcestershire sauce, and the dry mustard and stir to combine.  Keep warm while you prepare the oysters.

In a small skillet or saucepan, melt the remaining tablespoon of butter over medium-low heat and add the oysters.  Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, or until the oysters are just cooked and have begun to curl around the edges, stirring occasionally.  Season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of Essence.

To serve, divide the French bread toast between 6 plates, and divide the cooked oysters among the toasts.  Top with the cheese mixture, and garnish with the crispy bacon.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  finely-chopped yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2             pounds  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes
  9               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-sodium chicken broth)
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/2         pound  chorizo or linguica -- sliced crosswise
                        into 1/4" pieces
     1/2         pound  kale
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
     1/2           cup  chopped cilantro
  2        tablespoons  chopped mint
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Crusty bread -- as an accompaniment

In a large soup pot, heat olive oil and saute onion and garlic until vegetables are wilted, about 4 minutes.  Add potatoes, chicken stock, and minced crushed red pepper.  and bring to a boil.  Season with salt and pepper, reduce heat to a simmer and cook, covered, until potatoes fall apart, about 1 hour.  To speed up this process, the potatoes can be mashed with a potato masher.

While the soup is cooking, roll the kale leaves so that they may be inserted into a meat grinder or shredder fitted with a small die and finely grind the kale.  Alternatively, they can be shredded in a food processor fitted with a shredder blade.  Set aside.

When the soup is thick and the potatoes have broken up, whisk to break up the remaining potato pieces.  Add the sausage and cook for 15 minutes.  Stir in the shredded kale and simmer until the leaves are softened but still slightly crunchy and flavors have melded, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Stir in the parsley, cilantro, mint, and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Serve with crusty bread.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  flour
  1 1/2    tablespoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  4                     veal shanks, abt 1 1/2"-thk -- tied tightly around
                        the middle with kitchen string
  2               cups  chopped onions
  1                cup  diced celery
  1                cup  diced carrots
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  3                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  red wine
  1              quart  rich veal or beef stock
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  1              pound  uncooked dried orzo pasta
     1/2           cup  finely-grated Parmesan -- for serving

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat.  Add the olive oil and heat until very hot.  In a shallow bowl or plate combine the flour with the Essence and dredge the shanks in the seasoned flour mixture.  Shake to remove any excess flour, then transfer shanks to the pot and saute until well-browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove the shanks to a plate and set aside.

Add the onions, celery and carrots to the pot and saute until softened and lightly browned around the edges, 4 to 6 minutes.  Add the garlic, bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper and cook for 1 minute.  Deglaze the pot with the red wine, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned particles.  Add the stock and return the shanks to the pot.  Bring to a boil.  Cover the pot and transfer to the oven.  Cook until the shanks are very tender, for about 2 1/2 hours.

Remove from the oven and add the parsley and orzo to the pot and stir to distribute evenly.  Replace the cover and return the pot to the oven for 20 minutes.  Remove the pot from the oven and stir gently.  Cover and let sit for 10 minutes.  Serve immediately, 1 shank per person on top of a bed of orzo "risotto".  Garnish with some of the grated Parmesan.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat.  Add the olive oil and heat until very hot.  In a shallow bowl or plate combine the flour with the Essence and dredge the shanks in the seasoned flour mixture.  Shake to remove any excess flour, then transfer shanks to the pot and saute until well-browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove the shanks to a plate and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the onions, celery and carrots to the pot and saute until softened and lightly browned around the edges, 4 to 6 minutes.  Add the garlic, bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper and cook for 1 minute.  Deglaze the pot with the red wine, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned particles.  Add the stock and return the shanks to the pot.  Bring to a boil.  Cover the pot and transfer to the oven.  Cook until the shanks are very tender, for about 2 1/2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the oven and add the parsley and orzo to the pot and stir to distribute evenly.  Replace the cover and return the pot to the oven for 20 minutes.  Remove the pot from the oven and stir gently.  Cover and let sit for 10 minutes.  Serve immediately, 1 shank per person on top of a bed of orzo &quot;risotto&quot;.  Garnish with some of the grated Parmesan.

  1                     bay leaf
  2 1/2           cups  shrimp or fish stock

     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 1/3)
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Season the monkfish on all sides with the Creole seasoning.

In a large Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the monkfish and sear, about 2 minutes per side.  Remove from the pan and set aside.

Add the chorizo to the oil in the pan and cook, stirring, until brown, about 3 minutes.  Add the onions and bell peppers and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the tomato paste and cook until browned, about 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook for 1 minute.

To make the Garlic Croutons, place the sliced bread on a baking sheet and lightly toast on 1 side for 5 minutes.  Remove from the oven and rub the toasted side with crushed garlic cloves.  Turn and rub on the other side with the garlic.  Using a pastry brush, brush the top (untoasted) side lightly with the oil.  Return to the oven and bake until just starting to brown.  Remove from the oven.

Divide the monkfish and pan juices among 4 large, deep bowls.  Sprinkle each portion with the cheese and parsley and stand the toasted garlic bread up inside the bowls.  Serve immediately.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  shrimp stock
  1                     Maine lobster - (1 1/2 lbs)

     1/2         pound  chorizo -- roughly chopped
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  roughly-chopped seeded tomatoes
  12            medium  shrimp - (10/15 count) -- peeled, deveined
  1         tablespoon  Emeril's Original Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  12                    clams -- scrubbed, and
                        rinsed in several changes of water
  12                    mussels -- scrubbed, rinsed,
                        and debearded
  12                    shucked oysters -- drained
     1/2           cup  grated Parmiggiano-Reggiano
     1/4           cup  finely-sliced basil
                        === PIRI PIRI SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     fresh jalapeÒos -- coarsely chopped,
                        = (stems, seeds and all)
  1                     fresh poblano -- coarsely chopped,
                        = (stems, seeds and all)
  5 1/2      teaspoons  crushed red pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4                freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic

In a medium stockpot, bring the shrimp stock to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced to 3 cups, about 25 minutes.  When reduced, remove from the heat.

Meanwhile, fill a large stockpot three-fourths full with salted water and bring to a boil.  Plunge the lobster headfirst into the boiling water and cook, covered, for 7 minutes.  Transfer with tongs to a large bowl filled with ice water to cool.  When the lobster is cool enough to handle, crack the shell, and remove the meat from the tail and claws.  Discard the shells.  Roughly chop the meat and set aside.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add 1 teaspoon of salt and the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, about 8 minutes.  Drain in a colander and return to the pot.  Toss with 1 tablespoon of oil and 1/4 cup of the piri piri sauce.

Meanwhile, heat the remaining 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add the chorizo, and cook, stirring occasionally, until brown, about 4 minutes.  Add the shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the tomato, shrimp, and Essence, and cook, stirring, until the shrimp start to turn pink, about 2 minutes.

Once the shrimp start to turn pink, add the clams, mussels, the remaining 1/4 cup of piri piri sauce, the reduced shrimp stock, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper.  Cover the pan and simmer until the clams and mussels open, about 5 minutes.  Add the oysters and the chopped lobster, and cook, stirring, until the oysters start to curl around the edges, about 2 minutes.  Discard any unopened clam or mussel shells.

To serve, place the pasta in the center of a large platter, and arrange the seafood around the edges.  Pour the broth over the pasta, garnish with the cheese and basil, and serve immediately.

Piri Piri Sauce:  Combine all of the ingredients except the garlic in a medium, heavy saucepan over high heat.  Cook, stirring, for 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, remove from heat, and cool to room temperature.  When the mixture is cool, pour into the bowl of a food processor or blender and pulse several times until smooth.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container, and refrigerate, tightly covered, for 7 days before using.  (Makes 1 1/2 cups)

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     pork tenderloins - (1 to 1/2 lbs ea)
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2           cup  Rosemary-Apple Vinaigrette -- (listed below)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === ROSEMARY-APPLE VINAIGRETTE ===
  1                     Granny Smith apple - (4 oz) -- cored, peeled,
                        and cut into 1/4" thick slices
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2        tablespoons  sugar -- plus
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh rosemary
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  green onions
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil

Using a sharp knife, trim all fat and silver skin from the tenderloins and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the mustard, vinaigrette and vegetable oil and whisk to combine.  Transfer contents to a resealable plastic bag and add the tenderloins.  Turn the tenderloins so that they are evenly coated with the marinade, then seal the bag, trying to remove as much air as possible.  Refrigerate for 45 minutes before proceeding.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Heat a large saute pan or skillet over high heat.  When hot, add the tenderloins and brown on all sides, turning occasionally to ensure even cooking, about 6 minutes.  Transfer the pan to the oven and cook until the tenderloins are medium to medium-well, or registers 140 to 150 degrees on a meat thermometer, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Remove the meat from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.  Slice the meat into 1/2-inch thick slices on the diagonal, and serve immediately, with some of the remaining Rosemary Apple-Vinaigrette spooned over the top.

Rosemary-Apple Vinaigrette:  Combine the apples, cider vinegar, shallots, sugar, rosemary and black pepper in a skillet and bring to a simmer.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the apples are tender, about 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a blender or food processor.

Add the mustard, soy sauce, kosher salt, and green onions, and puree on high speed.  With the motor running, add the oil in a thin stream and process until emulsified.  Remove from the blender and refrigerate in an airtight container until ready to serve.  (The vinaigrette will keep for up to 1 week refrigerated.)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
     3/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne or hot paprika
  6               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
  3               cups  flour
  3        tablespoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2         pound  whole squid -- well rinsed,
                        = (or larger squid cut into 1" rings)
     1/2         pound  medium shrimp -- peeled, and
                        heads removed
  2              small  fennel bulbs -- thinly sliced
  12                    asparagus spears
  1              small  sweet potato -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4"-thick rounds
  1              small  beet -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4"-thick rounds
  1              small  red pepper -- stem, ribs and
                        seeds removed, cut into 2" pieces
     1/2           cup  very finely-grated pecorino Romano

Preheat the oven to 225 degrees.

Prepare the dipping sauce by combining the egg yolks, lemon juice, garlic, and mustard in the bowl of a food processor.  Process on high speed for 30 seconds.  With the machine running, slowly add the olive oil and extra virgin olive oil and process until the mixture becomes a smooth emulsion.  Add the salt and cayenne, and adjust seasoning to taste.  Transfer to a decorative bowl and refrigerate until needed.

In a heavy 6-quart pot, heat the vegetable oil to 350 degrees.

In a bowl, combine the flour and Essence.  In batches, add the squid and shrimp and toss to coat.  Shake to remove any excess.

In batches, add the squid and shrimp to the oil and cook until golden and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Transfer to a baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm while cooking the remaining ingredients.

Toss the vegetables in batches in the seasoned flour and add to the oil, ensuring that the oil has returned to 350 degrees before cooking each batch.  Cook the vegetables until crisp and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels, and place in the oven as needed while cooking the remaining vegetables.  Sprinkle vegetables with grated cheese.

Serve the fritto misto hot on a large platter with the lemon-garlic dipping sauce.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  chestnut flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  chestnut flour
     1/2           cup  wheat flour - (scant)
  1                cup  milk - (to 1 1/4)
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
  7        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
  12                    apples
                        = (such as Golden Delicious)
  2                     lemons -- juiced
                        = (or 1/4 cup juice)
     3/4           cup  sugar
     2/3           cup  chestnut honey

In a large bowl combine chestnut flour, wheat flour, milk, eggs and 3 tablespoons of the melted butter and stir until thoroughly combined and smooth.  Add more milk as needed to make a thin batter.  Let rest, chilled, for 30 minutes.

Peel, core, and thinly slice apples.  In a large bowl toss apples with lemon juice.  In a very large skillet melt 3 tablespoons of the remaining butter over medium-high heat.  Add the apples and sugar and cook until the apples are soft and caramelized, 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.  (You may have to do this in batches.)

Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter.  Heat a small skillet or crepe pan until hot and brush lightly with some of the melted butter.  Pour crepe batter into skillet in 1/4 cup amounts and swirl to evenly coat pan bottom.  Cook until crepe is golden brown on bottom, 1 to 2 minutes, then flip with a spatula and cook until lightly browned on the second side, about 30 seconds.  Transfer the crepe to a plate and cover to keep warm.  Repeat with the remaining batter until all crepes are made.

Assemble the dessert by alternating layers of crepes with layers of the caramelized apples until all apples and crepes are used.  Warm honey in a small saucepan and drizzle over the top of the crepe cake.  Cut cake into wedges and serve warm, drizzled with any remaining honey.

This recipe yields 1 layered "cake" for 6 to 8 servings.

        Gaufrette Potatoes With Gravlax, Sour Cream, Osetra Caviar

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     baking potato, like russet - (12 oz) -- peeled, and in
                        enough water to cover
  6               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  sliced gravlax or cured salmon
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  3          teaspoons  osetra caviar -- or more to taste
                        Fresh dill -- for garnish

To make the gaufrette potatoes, adjust the mandoline so that the ridged blade is exposed by about 1/8 of an inch.  Remove the potato from the water and pat dry with a paper towel.  Hold the potato at an angle of 45 degrees, and run the potato over the ridged blade of the mandoline.  (The first slice will not be usable, so discard it.)  Turn the potato sideways 45 degrees in the opposite direction, this will make your first waffle-cut potato slice.

Repeat the process, turning the potato after each pass over the blade to maintain the waffle-cut.  Place the potato slices in cold water to keep them from oxidizing.

Heat the oil to 350 degrees in a 1-gallon pot.

Working in batches, add the potato slices a few at a time to the hot oil.  Turn occasionally to ensure even browning, and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon or strainer, remove the chips from the oil and place on a paper-lined plate and sprinkle with the salt.

To assemble the dish, cut the gravlax slices into small 1- to 2-inch length pieces and arrange 1 piece of gravlax on top of each potato chip.  Top each chip with a small dollop of sour cream, and place 1/4 teaspoon or more of caviar on top of the sour cream.  Garnish with a small sprig of fresh dill, and serve.

This recipe yields 20 to 24 chips.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  milk
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split, scraped
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  4              pints  mixed berries -- picked over,
                        washed and dried
     1/4           cup  Creme de Cassis -- or more to taste
  1         tablespoon  powdered sugar

Heat the heavy cream, milk, vanilla bean and minced ginger in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.  Place the egg yolks and sugar in a heatproof mixing bowl and beat until pale yellow in color and all of the sugar has dissolved.  Temper about 1/2 cup of the cream mixture into the egg mixture and whisk vigorously to incorporate well.

Add the egg mixture to the saucepan with the cream mixture and cook, stirring constantly with a whisk, or wooden spoon.  Be sure to stir in the corners of the pot and lower the heat slightly.  Stir the mixture for 4 to 5 minutes or until the custard has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon.

Remove from the stove and strain the custard through a fine mesh sieve into a clean bowl.  Place the bowl in another bowl half-filled with ice and water to cool the custard.  To chill the custard faster, stir it occasionally with a spoon.

Combine the berries, Creme de Cassis and the powdered sugar in a mixing bowl and gently fold to mix.  Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving and divide among 8 small bowls or martini glasses and ladle 1/3 to 1/2 cup of the Anglaise over each cup to serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  5             medium  baking potatoes - (abt 4 lbs) -- scrubbed
                        = (such as russets)
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  diced yellow onions
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  Essence

  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Place the whole potatoes in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer until half-cooked and almost tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain and let sit until cool enough to handle.  Slip the skins from the potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch dice.

Heat the oil and melt the butter in a skillet over high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the garlic, and cook, stirring, for 20 seconds.  Add the potatoes, Essence, thyme, salt, and pepper, and cook without stirring, but shaking the pan occasionally to keep from burning, until the potatoes begin to color and crisp on the underside, about 4 minutes.  Turn the potatoes with a spatula being careful not to mash, and continue cooking until uniformly golden.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === HERB ROASTED CHICKEN ===
  1              whole  chicken - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped thyme leaves
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped sage leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley leaves
                        = (reserve the parsley stems)
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1                     lemon -- quartered
  2                     bay leaves
                        === BABY ROOT VEGETABLES ===
     1/4         pound  baby turnips -- peeled, and
                        stem ends trimmed
     1/4         pound  baby red carrots -- peeled and stem
                        ends trimmed
     1/4         pound  orange carrots -- peeled, and
                        stem ends trimmed
     1/4         pound  baby golden beets -- peeled, and
                        stem ends trimmed
     1/4         pound  baby beets -- peeled, and
                        stem ends trimmed
     1/4         pound  fingerling potatoes -- halved
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  olive oil

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.

Wash the chicken and pat dry.  Season well inside and out with the salt and pepper.  In a small bowl, combine the garlic, thyme, sage, parsley and olive oil.  Rub the olive oil and herb blend into the cavity of the chicken as well as all over the exterior.

Place the parsley stems into the cavity of the chicken, and squeeze each lemon quarter into the chicken and place the rind in as well.  Put the bay leaves inside the chicken and place the bird in a roasting pan or a saute pan, and put it into the oven.

Roast for about 1 hour, or until the chicken is golden brown, and the juices run clear.  Remove from the oven and let sit for 10 minutes before carving.

For the Baby Root Vegetables:  Place the vegetables in a large mixing bowl, and season with the salt and pepper.  Drizzle with the olive oil and place in a roasting pan or on a sheet pan.  Place in the oven and roast for 30 minutes, turning once midway during cooking to ensure even browning.  Serve with the herb roasted chicken.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                          Homemade Fromage Blanc

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cheese

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  whole milk -- as fresh as possible
  1                cup  heavy cream -- (optional)
  2               cups  fresh buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice -- strained
     1/4      teaspoon  salt - (to 1/2) -- if desired
                        Heavy Cream -- for serving

In a large, heavy saucepan, add the milk and the cream for a richer fromage blanc.  In a mixing bowl, combine the buttermilk and lemon juice and stir to combine well.  Add the buttermilk-lemon juice mixture to the milk and begin to heat the milk, over low heat and very slowly, to 175 degrees.  While the milk is heating, stir only twice, making 2 strokes each time, with a heat-proof spatula or other flat utensil.  Check the temperature often.  As soon as the temperature reaches 175 degrees, remove the pot from the heat and allow to sit, undisturbed, for 10 minutes.

Line a large colander with 2 layers of fine cheesecloth and set over a large bowl.  Gently ladle the curds and whey into the colander and allow to drain until the drips of whey slows, about 2 minutes.  Tie the corners of the cheesecloth together to form a hanging pouch, and hang pouch over a bowl and allow to drain until the cheese reaches the desired consistency.

Serve as is, with preserves, honey or fresh fruit, or add salt or fresh herbs, to taste, and enjoy as a savory appetizer.  If a rich cheese is desired, spoon or pour a bit of heavy cream over the top before serving.  Also, if a very smooth product is desired, beat the cheese briefly with an electric mixer before serving.

Refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 1 week.  If cheese is marinated in oil with fresh herbs, it will keep, refrigerated, for up to 1 month.

This recipe yields about 1 pound (2 cups).

  12                    chicken thighs

  4                     garlic heads -- cloves separated,
                        and peeled
  2               cups  olive oil
  2               cups  white wine
  3                     lemons -- quartered
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the chicken in a large bowl and lightly coat with salt, pepper, and cayenne.

Crush half of the garlic cloves with the back of a heavy knife.  Leave the remaining cloves whole.

Add the crushed garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and add the remaining ingredients, stirring well to evenly distribute.  Cover the pan tightly and roast for 1 hour.  Uncover and roast until the chicken is brown and tender, and the garlic is caramelized, about 30 minutes, basting occasionally.

Remove from the oven.  Transfer the chicken to a platter and sprinkle with the parsley.  Spoon the pan juices over the chicken, or serve on the side.  Serve with Spaghetti Bordelaise.

This recipe yields 6 to 10 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PASTRY ===
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  dried turmeric or annatto
  2          teaspoons  salt
  8        tablespoons  vegetable shortening
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- cold
     1/2           cup  cold water -- plus
  2        tablespoons  cold water
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil or butter
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
                        = (1 1/2 cups chopped)
  6                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh ginger
  1              pound  ground beef
     1/4      teaspoon  ground turmeric or annatto
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     3/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
  1                     scotch bonnet pepper -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped, (optional)
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme -- finely chopped
  3                     scallions -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley
  1              pound  ripe tomatoes -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  water or beef stock
  3        tablespoons  Jamaican rum
                        === TO ASSEMBLE THE PATTIES ===
                        Flour -- for rolling out
                        dough
  2                     egg yolks -- beaten with
  1           teaspoon  rum

For the pastry:  Sift the flour, turmeric, and salt into a large bowl.  Using your fingers, two knives, or a pastry blender, cut in the shortening and butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Working quickly, add only enough water to form a firm dough.  Do not overwork pastry.  Form dough into a disc, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 1/2 hours or overnight.

In a large skillet, heat the oil until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion and cook until softened, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute.  Add the ground beef, turmeric, cumin, allspice, cardamom, hot peppers, and thyme and cook until the beef is browned and spices are fragrant, about 10 minutes.

Add the scallions, parsley, tomatoes, and stock and simmer for about 25 minutes, until the flavors have come together and almost all of the liquid has evaporated.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper, remove from the heat and stir in the rum.  Set aside to cool before assembling the patties.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out pastry and cut into circles about 6 to 7 inches in diameter.  Spoon a scant 1/4 cup of the cooled filling onto the center of one side of each circle, and lightly brush the edges of the circle with a little of the beaten egg yolk mixture.  Fold the other half of the pastry over so that the edges meet, and use a fork to crimp the edges together.  Lightly brush the top of each patty with a little of the beaten egg yolk mixture.  Place the patties on parchment-lined baking sheets and bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 patties.

                         Jamaican Rice And 'Peas'

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fresh coconut -- cracked, and
                        meat removed from shell
  4               cups  water
  1                cup  dried red kidney beans -- soaked overnight in
  3               cups  water
     1/2         pound  smoked pork hocks, tails, or
                        other meat for flavoring -- (optional)
  4                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  4                     scallions -- crushed*
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
  3          teaspoons  salt
  1                     Scotch bonnet -- halved, seeded
  2 1/2           cups  long-grain rice -- washed, drained

* It is traditional to "crush" scallions by placing them on a cutting board and lightly tapping them with the handle of a knife.  They can then be removed before serving but still impart their wonderful flavor to the rice and peas.

Break the coconut meat into small chunks with your hands.  Add the water to a blender, and blend on high speed, adding the coconut chunks little by little until the mixture resembles a coarse puree.  Strain the mixture through a fine sieve and press to extract as much liquid as possible.  Discard the solids, measure the coconut milk, and set aside.

Place the beans, along with the soaking liquid into a large heavy pot or dutch oven.  Add the pork hock and garlic and bring to a boil over high heat.  Cover the pot, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until beans are just tender, about 1 hour.

Add the coconut milk, scallions, thyme, allspice, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil.  Stir in the rice and, once the mixture has returned to a boil, stir, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the rice is tender and has absorbed all of the liquid.

Allow to sit for 15 minutes before serving.  Remove the thyme sprigs and Scotch bonnet pepper halves and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  3                     strips bacon -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1              large  onion -- minced (1 cup)
  3                     carrots -- chopped 1/4" pieces
                        = (abt 1/2 cup)
  1                     celery rib -- finely chopped
                        = (abt 1/2 cup)
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced (1 tbs)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh ginger
  2 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1              pound  dried lentils
  2             quarts  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  creme fraiche or sour cream
  1         tablespoon  curry powder
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley leaves
                        === LENTIL CRACKERS ===
     1/2           cup  cooked lentils -- reserved from above
     1/4           cup  lentil soup
     3/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/4      teaspoons  kosher salt
                        === PARSLEY OIL ===
  1              bunch  parsley -- leaves picked,
                        washed
  3                     garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  olive oil - (to 3/4)
  2                     limes -- juiced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FRIED CARROTS ===
     1/2         pound  carrots -- peeled
     1/2           cup  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large saucepan cook the bacon over medium heat until it has rendered most of its fat, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook until vegetables are softened, about 4 to 6 minutes.  Add garlic, cumin, chopped ginger, salt and cayenne pepper and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until fragrant.  Add the lentils and chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Use a spoon to skim any foam from the top of the soup, cover the pot and reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are very tender, about 30 to 35 minutes.

While the soup is cooking, make the Curry Crema by combining the creme fraiche and the curry powder in a small bowl and set aside.

When the lentils are very tender, use a slotted spoon to remove approximately 1/2 cup of the lentils for the crackers and set aside to cool.  Puree the soup using a hand-held immersion blender until smooth.  (Alternately, puree the soup in batches in a blender after it has cooled slightly.)  Add water if necessary to achieve the desired consistency.  Add the lime juice and parsley, stir to combine, and adjust seasoning, if necessary.  Remove 1/4 cup of the pureed soup and set aside to use for the lentil crackers.  Keep the soup warm while you make the lentil crackers.

Make the lentil crackers.

Serve soup garnished with a rounded tablespoon of Curry Crema, drizzle with Parsley Oil, and Fried Carrots.  Serve the Lentil Crackers on the side.

Lentil Crackers:  Place the reserved lentils and reserved lentil soup in a food processor and process to a chunky puree.  Transfer to a mixing bowl and add 1/2 cup of the flour.  Mix with your hands or a wooden spoon until a dough is formed.  While continuing to mix, add the remaining 1/4 cup of flour 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough is moist and malleable but not at all sticky.  The dough should resemble clay.  Roll the dough into a disk shape, cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 10 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Remove the dough from the freezer and cut the dough into 6 equal portions.  Using your hands, flatten each portion of dough to a thickness of 1/4-inch and lightly coat each portion with flour.  Pass each portion of the dough through a pasta roller set on the #2 setting.  Change the pasta roller setting to #4 and pass each portion of dough through the pasta roller.  You should now have very thin long strips of dough, approximately 14 to 16 inches long and about 2 1/2 to 3 inches wide.  Place each strip of rolled out dough (diagonally) onto a parchment lined baking sheet and, using a pastry brush, brush the strips lightly with some of the extra virgin olive oil.  Sprinkle the strips with some of the kosher salt.  Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, turning the sheet pan after 10 minutes, until the crackers are dry and brittle. (Makes six 14- to 16-inch long lentil crackers, break into desired lengths  Note:  These crackers will lose their crispiness quickly.  If you do not need or want to make this many crackers at once, this dough freezes exceptionally well.)

Parsley Oil:  In a food processor, add parsley, garlic, olive oil, and lime juice and puree until smooth.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Fried Carrots:  Preheat a fryer to 350 degrees.  Cut the carrots into long, thin strands on a turning slicer.  Alternately, cut the carrots into a julienne on a mandoline.  In a large bowl, toss the carrots with flour, salt and pepper, just to coat the carrots with flour.  Shake the carrots, to remove excess flour.

Place in the fryer and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the oil, place on a paper towel-lined plate, and season, to taste, with salt.

This recipe yields 8 servings (2 quarts).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7        tablespoons  butter -- divided
  4        tablespoons  flour
  2               cups  half-and-half
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  Emeril's Red Hot Sauce
  8 1/2         ounces  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano - (abt 2 cups)
                        = (or other good-quality parmesan cheese)
  1              pound  elbow macaroni
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  4             ounces  grated cheddar cheese
  4             ounces  grated fontina cheese
  4             ounces  grated gruyere cheese
     1/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs
     1/2      teaspoon  Essence or Creole Seasoning
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)

In a heavy, medium saucepan melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over low heat.  Add the flour and stir to combine.  Cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes.  Increase the heat to medium and whisk in the half-and-half little by little.  Cook until thickened, about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Remove from the heat, season with the salt, pepper, hot sauce and 4 ounces of the grated parmesan.  Stir until cheese is melted and sauce is smooth.  Cover and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Add salt to taste and, while stirring, add the macaroni.  Return to a boil, reduce the heat to a low boil and cook for about 5 minutes, or until macaroni is very al dente (slightly undercooked).  Drain in a colander and return the macaroni to the pot.  Add 2 tablespoons of the butter and the garlic and stir to combine.  Add the bechamel sauce and stir until well combined.  Set aside.

Using the remaining tablespoon of butter, grease a 3-quart baking dish or casserole and set aside.

In a large bowl combine 4 ounces of the remaining parmesan cheese, cheddar, fontina and gruyere cheeses.  Toss to combine.

Place one-third of the macaroni in the bottom of the prepared baking dish.  Top with one-third of the mixed cheeses.  Top with another third of the macaroni and another third of the cheese mixture.  Repeat with the remaining macaroni and cheese mixture.  In a small bowl combine the bread crumbs, remaining 1/2 ounce of grated parmesan, and the Essence and toss to combine.  Sprinkle this over the top of the macaroni and cheese.

Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the macaroni and cheese is bubbly and hot and the top is golden brown.  Remove from the oven and allow to sit for 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Add salt to taste and, while stirring, add the macaroni.  Return to a boil, reduce the heat to a low boil and cook for about 5 minutes, or until macaroni is very al dente (slightly undercooked).  Drain in a colander and return the macaroni to the pot.  Add 2 tablespoons of the butter and the garlic and stir to combine.  Add the bechamel sauce and stir until well combined.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Using the remaining tablespoon of butter, grease a 3-quart baking dish or casserole and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl combine 4 ounces of the remaining parmesan cheese, cheddar, fontina and gruyere cheeses.  Toss to combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place one-third of the macaroni in the bottom of the prepared baking dish.  Top with one-third of the mixed cheeses.  Top with another third of the macaroni and another third of the cheese mixture.  Repeat with the remaining macaroni and cheese mixture.  In a small bowl combine the bread crumbs, remaining 1/2 ounce of grated parmesan, and the Essence and toss to combine.  Sprinkle this over the top of the macaroni and cheese.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the macaroni and cheese is bubbly and hot and the top is golden brown.  Remove from the oven and allow to sit for 5 minutes before serving.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  veal cheeks
  2               cups  red wine
  2               cups  Madeira
  2 1/2           cups  finely-chopped onions
  1 1/2           cups  finely-chopped celery
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced garlic
  2                     bay leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh rosemary
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  finely-chopped carrots
  1                cup  water
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1           teaspoon  Italian seasoning
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper -- or more to taste
                        Creamy Polenta II -- (see recipe)

Using a very sharp knife, trim the extra fat and the tough silverskin from the veal cheeks.  You should have approximately 3 pounds of cleaned meat remaining.

Transfer the cheeks to a large non-reactive bowl or casserole and add 1 cup of red wine, 1 cup of the Madeira, 1/2 cup of the onions, 1/2 cup of the celery, 1/2 tablespoon of the garlic, bay leaves, rosemary and peppercorns.  Stir gently to blend and make sure that the wine covers the meat, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight or at least 8 hours.

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.

In a large, ovenproof Dutch-oven or rondeau, heat oil over high heat until almost smoking.  Remove meat from marinade, pat dry, and season on both sides with some of the salt and pepper.  Sear meat in hot oil, in batches if necessary, until well browned on all sides.  Remove from pan and set aside.

Add remaining onion and celery to the pan along with the carrots and cook for about 6 minutes, stirring frequently, until vegetables are very soft and beginning to caramelize.  Add remaining garlic and cook 2 minutes.

Strain the marinade and add to pan along with remaining red wine and Madeira.  (Discard vegetables).  Bring to a boil, skim any foam off top of liquid, and add water, tomato paste, Essence, Italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper, and return to a boil.

Add meat and any accumulated juices, stir well, cover tightly, and place in the oven.  Cook for 4 1/2 to 5 hours, undisturbed, or until cheeks are very tender.  Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary and serve over hot polenta.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             pounds  quahog or large cherrystone clams -- scrubbed, rinsed,
                        and opened clams discarded
  4             slices  bacon -- cut 1/2" lengths
  2               cups  finely-chopped onion
  1                cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/2           cup  chopped bell pepper
     3/4           cup  diced carrot
  1 1/2    tablespoons  minced garlic
  3                     bay leaves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano leaves
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  1 1/4         pounds  potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" cubes - (abt 3 cups)
  1                cup  chicken stock
  3               cups  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
                        = (or 28-oz can whole tomatoes/ chopped
                        and juices reserved)
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a large stockpot bring 2 cups of water to a boil.  Add clams, cover and cook for 5 minutes.  Uncover, quickly stir clams well with a wooden spoon, and re-cover.  Allow clams to cook 5 to 10 minutes longer (this will depend on the type and size of clams you are using), or until most of the clams are opened.

Transfer clams to a large bowl or baking dish and strain broth through a fine-meshed sieve into a bowl.  (You should have about 6 cups of clam broth.  If not, add enough water to bring the volume up to 6 cups.)  When clams are cool enough to handle, remove them from their shells and chop into 1/2-inch pieces.  Set clams and broth aside.

In a large heavy pot add bacon and render until golden and crispy.  Pour off all fat except 4 tablespoons.  Add onions, celery, bell pepper and carrots and cook for 10 minutes, until vegetables are softened.  Do not allow to color.  Add garlic, bay leaves, oregano, thyme and crushed red pepper and cook an additional 2 minutes.

Increase heat to high and add potatoes, reserved clam broth, and chicken stock and bring to a boil, covered.  Cook for 20 minutes, or until potatoes are tender and the broth has thickened somewhat.  Add tomatoes and continue to cook for 10 to 15 minutes.

Remove the pot from the heat and add reserved clams and parsley and season with pepper and salt, if necessary.  Allow chowder to sit for up to 1 hour to allow flavors to meld, then reheat slowly over low fire if necessary.  Do not allow to boil.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 main course servings.

                       New England Clam Chowder II

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish
                Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             pounds  small quahogs or large cherrystone clams -- scrubbed, rinsed,
                        and opened clams discarded
  4             slices  bacon -- cut 1/2" pieces
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2               cups  finely-chopped yellow onions
  1                cup  finely-chopped celery
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  6             sprigs  fresh thyme leaves
  2                     bay leaves
  3               cups  cubed (1/2") peeled potatoes - -- (abt 1 1/4 lbs)
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut 12 pieces
     1/4           cup  minced parsley leaves
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped chives or green onions

In a large stockpot bring 2 cups of water to a boil.  Add clams, cover and cook for 5 minutes.  Uncover, quickly stir clams with a wooden spoon.  Cover and cook 5 to 10 minutes longer (this will depend on the type and size of clams you are using), or until most of the clams are opened.

Transfer the clams to a large bowl or baking dish and strain the broth twice through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, being careful to strain out the sand.  (You should have about 6 cups of clam broth.  If not, add enough water to bring the volume up to 6 cups.)  When the clams are cool enough to handle, remove them from their shells and chop into 1/2-inch pieces.  Set clams and broth aside.

In a large heavy pot cook the bacon until crisp and the fat is rendered.  Pour off all bacon fat except 2 tablespoons.

Add the butter, onions and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, thyme and bay leaves, and cook until the vegetables are thoroughly wilted, about 3 minutes, being careful not to brown.

Add the potatoes and reserved clam broth, and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the broth thickens slightly and the potatoes are very tender.  (If you like a thicker broth, mash some of the potatoes against the side of the pot with a wooden spoon.)  Remove from the heat, stir in clams and heavy cream and season with pepper and salt, if necessary.

Set aside for 1 hour, covered, to allow the flavors to marry.  Place the pot over low heat, and slowly reheat, being careful not to bring to the boil.  Serve hot, garnished with 1 or 2 pats of butter, parsley and chives.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 main course servings.

Categories    : Cheesecake                      Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  graham cracker crumbs
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  6        tablespoons  melted butter
                        === CHEESECAKE FILLING ===
  1 1/2         pounds  cream cheese -- softened
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon peel
  1           teaspoon  grated orange peel
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  4              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
                        === APPLE TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  2               cups  thinly-sliced peeled and cored
                        Granny Smith apples - (abt 4 apples)

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a bowl, mix together the crumbs, sugar, and cinnamon.  Add the butter and mix well.  Using the back of a spoon, press evenly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan.  Bake until golden, about 8 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool before filling.

In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with the paddle attachment of an electric mixer, or with a large, heavy wooden spoon until creamy and smooth.  Add the sugar a few tablespoons at a time, and when well incorporated, add the flour, lemon peel, orange peel, and vanilla extract.  Add the eggs and heavy cream, beating on low speed just until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl to incorporate all the ingredients.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake in the middle of the oven until set, but the center is still slightly soft (but not wobbly), about 55 minutes to 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven, loosen the outer ring, and let cool in the pan on a wire rack.  Refrigerate the cake, loosely covered, for 6 hours or overnight.

Remove the cake from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature.

To make the topping, in a heavy, medium saucepan, combine the 1/2 cup sugar and water, and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved.  Continue cooking until amber in color, 7 to 10 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally.  Add the butter, stir, and cook over low heat until the butter is melted and evenly incorporated.  Add the apples and stir to coat with the caramel.  Cook, stirring, over medium heat until the apples are tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool before topping the cheesecake.

Top the cheesecake with the caramelized apple topping and serve.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) cheesecake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  boneless beef New York strip roast -- fat trimmed
                        = (top loin)
                        Essence -- to taste
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === BEURRE MAITRE D'HOTEL ===
  2             sticks  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley
  3          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat a grill or the oven to 450 degrees.

Sprinkle the meat with Essence, salt, and pepper, on both sides.  Place on the hot grill and cook to desired doneness, turning once, about 1 hour 30 minutes for medium-rare.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat registers 130 degrees for medium-rare, or 140 degrees for medium.  (Alternately, roast on a rack set on a baking sheet for 15 minutes in a 450 degree oven.  Lower the temperature to 350 degrees and continue to cook for about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes for medium-rare.)

Remove from oven; let stand 20 minutes.  Cut crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices.  Arrange slices on platter and top with pats of the Beurre Maitre d'Hotel.

Beurre Maitre d'Hotel:  Place the butter in a medium bowl and cream with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula.  Add the remaining ingredients and mix well.  Place on a large sheet of plastic wrap and form into a cylinder, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Roll up in the plastic wrap, pushing in as you go, to form a tight log.  Refrigerate or freeze until needed.

To use, unwrap, cut 1/2-inch slices, and serve on top of the New York Strip.  (Makes 1/2 pound)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

        Old Fashioned Chocolate Mousse With Toasted Hazelnut Cream

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  7             ounces  good quality semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  1              ounce  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream -- divided
  2                     eggs -- separated
  3        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar -- divided
  1              pinch  salt
  3        tablespoons  Frangelico or Nocello -- divided
  1         tablespoon  strong coffee -- cooled
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
     1/4           cup  toasted hazelnuts -- finely chopped

Combine both chocolates in a medium bowl set over simmering water and heat until melted, stirring occasionally.  Set aside to cool to lukewarm.

In a large bowl, whip 1 cup of the cream to just beyond soft peaks but not quite stiff.  Set aside, refrigerated.

In a medium bowl whisk the egg yolks until smooth.  Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water.  Add 2 tablespoons of the Frangelico, the coffee, and melted chocolate and cook, whisking, until pale and thick and forms a ribbon.

In another bowl, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks.  Add 2 tablespoons of the confectioners' sugar little by little until whites are stiff and glossy but not dry.  Set aside.

Using a large rubber spatula, fold in the whipped cream.  Very gently fold in the egg whites.

Spoon the mousse into individual bowls or festive glasses such as martini glasses, cover, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours before serving.

When you are ready to serve the mousse, make the Toasted Hazelnut Cream by placing the remaining 1/2 cup of heavy cream in a medium bowl and whipping to soft peaks.  Add the remaining tablespoon of confectioners' sugar, the remaining tablespoon of Frangelico, and the vanilla, and continue to whip until just stiff.  Serve a healthy dollop on top of each mousse, and top with some of the toasted hazelnuts.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  butter -- softened
  1                     ortanique* -- zested
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  4                     eggs
  1 3/4           cups  flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  3        tablespoons  Jamaican rum
                        === FOR THE GLAZE ===
  4        tablespoons  ortanique juice
  8        tablespoons  guava jelly
     1/2           cup  Jamaican rum
                        === FOR ASSEMBLING ===
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
  3                     ortaniques -- supremed

* Ortanique is a hybrid of a tangerine and a sweet orange.  If you are unable to find ortaniques, simply substitute equal parts of tangerine and any sweet orange.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and grease and lightly flour 2 (8- or 9-inch) round cake pans.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and zest.  Add the sugar little by little, until mixture is very light and fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

Sift the flour and baking powder together and add to butter mixture in three stages, alternating with 1 tablespoon of the rum after each addition.  Mix on low speed until just incorporated.

Divide the mixture between the two prepared cake pans, and bake for about 25 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and springs back when lightly touched.  Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for a few minutes, then turn out onto cooling racks lined with waxed paper.

In a small saucepan, combine the ortanique juice and guava jelly and heat until jelly is softened and combined with the fruit juice.  Remove from the heat and stir in the rum.

Use a toothpick to make small holes all over the bottoms of the cakes, then brush with 1/3 of the glaze each.  Once the cakes are completely cool, combine the heavy cream and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl and beat to soft peaks.  Add the confectioners' sugar and continue to beat until cream holds stiff peaks.

Place each cake layer on a serving platter (glazed-side up) and spread the whipped cream evenly on top of the cakes.  Decoratively arrange the ortanique segments around the edges of the top of the cakes, then brush the segments with the remaining glaze.  These cakes are best when eaten the day they are made, just after being assembled.

This recipe yields 2 cakes, serving 10 to 12.

  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  Red Pepper Paint -- plus
  2        tablespoons  Red Pepper Paint -- (listed below)
  2          teaspoons  rice wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  4             ounces  field greens or mache
     1/4           cup  Basil-Oil -- (listed below)
                        === RED PEPPER PAINT ===
  1              pound  red peppers - (abt 2 large)
  3                     garlic cloves -- smashed
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  white wine
  1                cup  rice wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  whole black peppercorns
                        === BASIL-OIL ===
  10                    fresh basil leaves - (to 12)
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt

Heat a large skillet or saute pan over high heat.  When hot, add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil and heat until hot but not quite smoking.

Season the scallops with salt and pepper.  Dredge in the instant flour, shaking off any excess.  Add the scallops to the pan and sear for 2 minutes on the first side.  Add the butter to the pan and swirl to evenly distribute.  Turn the scallops and continue to cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on the second side, or until golden brown and just cooked through.  Transfer to 4 serving plates and season with salt and pepper.

In a small bowl combine 2 tablespoons of the Red Pepper Paint with the rice wine vinegar, lemon juice and olive oil and whisk to combine.  Toss the greens with the dressing and serve on top of the scallops.  Drizzle some of the remaining Red Pepper Paint decoratively over the plates, then drizzle some of the basil oil over all.  Serve immediately.

Red Pepper Paint:  Core and stem the red peppers and place them along with the other ingredients in a small saucepan.  Bring the pan to a boil over medium-high heat and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove the pan from the heat and, using a slotted spoon, transfer the peppers to the bowl of a blender.  Strain the cooking liquid and discard the solids.  Add 3 tablespoons of the cooking liquid to the blender and process on low for 1 minute, or until smooth and thick.  If the puree is too thick, thin by adding a bit more of the cooking liquid.  Season the puree with a pinch of salt, then pass the puree through a fine mesh sieve and reserve until ready to use.  (Makes 1 cup)

Basil-Oil:  In a small bowl combine 1 cup of ice with 1 cup of water and set aside.

In a small saucepan bring 2 cups of water to a boil.  Add the basil leaves all at once, stirring to make sure they are all submerged.  Cook for 5 to 10 seconds, then remove by using a skimmer or slotted spoon.  Transfer the leaves immediately to an ice bath.  Remove the leaves from the ice bath and squeeze firmly in your hands to release as much liquid as possible.  Transfer the leaves to a blender along with the olive oil and salt, and process until the leaves are finely pureed, about 1 to 2 minutes.  (Strain the basil oil through a fine sieve or coffee filter if a clear oil is desired.)  Otherwise, place the oil in a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap.

Use the oil at room temperature, drizzled over salads, vegetables, sandwiches or grilled items.

Basil-oil will keep, refrigerated and tightly covered, for up to 1 week.  If strained, the oil will keep for up to 2 months, refrigerated and tightly covered.  (Makes 1/2 cup basil oil)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  If you want to kick up your basil oil, try adding a clove or 2 of minced garlic and 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper...this makes a great dipping oil for crusty French bread!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  vegetable oil
  1                     red beet - (4 oz) -- peeled
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1 1/4       teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  8                     sea scallops
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  instant flour
  1         tablespoon  butter
                        === ENGLISH PEA PUREE ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  blanched English peas
     1/2           cup  vegetable stock or water
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  8                     leaves fresh mint
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === CURRY OIL ===
  1 1/2      teaspoons  curry powder
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Place the oil in a 1-gallon pot and heat to 350 degrees.

To make the red beet nest, place the peeled beet on the turning vegetable slicer with the thin string blade and crank the handle.  You will have long thin strips of beet that look like thick string.  Place the beets in a medium-sized bowl and sprinkle with the cornstarch.  Toss to coat the beet strips.

Carefully transfer beet strips to the hot oil and fry until most of the bubbles have subsided and the beets are crispy, about 30 to 45 seconds.  Remove from the oil and place on a paper-lined plate.  Season with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and the white pepper.

Heat a medium skillet or saute pan over high heat.  When the pan is hot, add the olive oil and heat until hot but not quite smoking.  Season the scallops with the remaining salt and black pepper.  Dredge in the instant flour, shaking off any excess.  Add the scallops to the pan and sear for 2 minutes on the first side.  Add the butter to the pan and swirl to evenly distribute.  Turn the scallops and continue to cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on the second side, or until golden brown and just cooked through.

To serve, divide the English Pea Puree among the centers of 4 plates and place 2 scallops, side by side, on top of the puree.  Top each plate with some of the beet nest and drizzle the Curry Oil around the puree.

English Pea Puree:  In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter.  Add the onions and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic to the pan and sweat for 30 seconds.  Add the English peas and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes.  Add the vegetable stock and bring the liquid to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes.

Remove from the heat and transfer the peas and liquid to a bar blender.  Add the heavy cream, mint, salt, and pepper and process on low speed for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the peas form a smooth puree.  Be careful blending the hot ingredients: make sure to hold the lid securely with a thick kitchen towel.  (Makes 1 cup)

Curry Oil:  Toast the curry powder in a small, dry skillet for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring often.  Add the olive oil to the skillet and swirl to combine well.  Add salt.  Let cool completely and store in the refrigerator when not in use.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  finely-grated Parmesan
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     grouper - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs) -- fillets removed,
                        with scales intact
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped fresh herbs
                        = (such as tarragon, thyme,
                        basil or chives)
                        === ARUGULA AND ORANGE SALAD ===
  2               cups  arugula -- cleaned
  2               cups  baby spinach -- cleaned
     1/2                red onion -- sliced thinly
  1                     orange -- supremed
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  orange juice
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the grill to medium-high.

In a small bowl combine the butter, garlic, Parmesan, Essence, and olive oil and whisk to combine.

Lay the fillets on the grill, scale-side down, and brush generously with the melted butter mixture.  Close the grill cover and cook for 3 minutes.  Open and brush again with the melted butter mixture.  Repeat this process until the flesh is firm and opaque, for a total cooking time of about 12 to 15 minutes for this size fish.  The last minute of cooking time, sprinkle with the fresh herbs.  Remove from the grill and serve immediately with Arugula and Orange Salad.

Arugula And Orange Salad:  In a large salad bowl, combine the arugula, spinach, red onion, and orange segments.

In a small bowl, whisk together the mustard, orange juice, and vinegar.  While whisking, slowly drizzle in the oil.  Whisk until emulsified and season with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  turned carrot balls
                        = (from about 1 lb of carrots)
  1                cup  turned zucchini balls
                        = (from about 1/2 lb of zucchini)
  1                cup  turned yellow squash balls
                        = (from about 1/2 lb of yellow squash)
  1              pound  penne pasta
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1 1/4       teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped thyme
  1         tablespoon  freshly-chopped parsley
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmiggiano-Reggiano

Peel the carrots and pierce with the parisienne scoop at a slight angle (this may require a little effort because carrots are so fibrous), then twist the scoop back and forth until the small ball is formed and slips from the carrot.  Continue this process with the carrots, zucchini, and yellow squash until you have 1 cup each.

Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil.  Add the carrot balls and cook for 1 minute, or until the water returns to a boil.  Remove and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking.  Set aside.

In a large 1 1/2-gallon pot, bring 1 gallon of water to a boil and season with salt.  Place the penne pasta in the pot and return to a boil.

While the pasta is cooking, heat a large 12- to 14-inch saute pan over medium-high heat.  When hot, add the olive oil and heat for 30 seconds.  Add the onions and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until translucent and slightly browned around the edges, stirring frequently.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the zucchini and squash and continue sauteing the vegetables for an additional 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the carrots and cook for 1 minute.  Season with the salt, pepper, thyme, and parsley and toss to evenly combine.

When the pasta is al dente, drain in a large colander and transfer the cooked penne to the saute pan along with the cooked veggies.  Add 1/4 cup of the Parmigiano-Reggiano and toss to blend.  Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.

To serve, divide the pasta among 4 pasta bowls and sprinkle with some of the remaining freshly grated Parmiggiano-Reggiano.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  zucchini
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        more if necessary
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              small  eggplant -- cut into
                        eight 1/3"-thk slices
  4             ounces  mild goat cheese
                        = (such as Montrachet)
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream or milk
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh garlic
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh herbs
                        = (such as basil, thyme, oregano and
                        parsley)
     1/2           cup  oil packed sun-dried tomatoes -- drained, plus
  2        tablespoons  oil from sun-dried tomatoes
                        === TOMATO VINAIGRETTE ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  extra virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped basil
  1           teaspoon  chopped oregano
     3/4         pound  very ripe tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced

Preheat the broiler to 500 degrees.

Cut each zucchini diagonally into slices about 1/4-inch thick and about 2 1/2 inches long.  Transfer the slices to a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Using a pastry brush, lightly brush each slice with a little of the olive oil, and season lightly with salt and pepper, to taste.  Position the oven rack about 6-inches away from the flame and broil the zucchini slices for about 4 minutes, or until slices appear shriveled and golden brown in spots.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a cooling rack.

Repeat the above procedure with the eggplant slices, brushing with olive oil and seasoning lightly with salt and pepper as before.  Broil until slices soften and are golden brown in spots, about 4 minutes.  Transfer to a cooling rack to cool.

In a small bowl combine the goat cheese with the cream, 1 teaspoon of the garlic and the fresh herbs and stir to thoroughly combine.

Combine the sun-dried tomatoes with 2 tablespoons of the packing oil and the remaining teaspoon of garlic in the bowl of a food processor.  Process until smooth, about 2 minutes.

Decrease the oven temperature to 300 degrees.

Lightly brush the insides of 6 (1/2-cup) ramekins with some of the remaining olive oil and line the bottoms and sides of the ramekins with 8 to 10 zucchini slices, in pinwheel fashion and with slices slightly overlapping one another.  Place 1 slice of eggplant on top of the zucchini slices in the bottom of each ramekin.

Divide the goat cheese mixture among the ramekins, using the back of a spoon to press down and smooth the tops.  Divide the sundried tomato puree evenly among the ramekins, again using the back of a spoon to evenly distribute the puree over the goat cheese.  Divide the remaining eggplant slices among the ramekins and press down firmly to pack contents.  Place the ramekins on the middle rack in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes, or until just heated through.  Make the Tomato Vinaigrette while charlottes are heating.

Tomato Vinaigrette:  In a mixing bowl combine the vinegar, lemon juice, salt and pepper and whisk together.  While continuing to whisk, add the oil in a slow, steady stream until combined and slightly emulsified.  Stir in the basil, oregano and diced tomatoes and serve immediately.  (Makes about 1 cup)

Unmold the charlottes onto plates and spoon some of the Tomato Vinaigrette around them.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Preheat the broiler to 500 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cut each zucchini diagonally into slices about 1/4-inch thick and about 2 1/2 inches long.  Transfer the slices to a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Using a pastry brush, lightly brush each slice with a little of the olive oil, and season lightly with salt and pepper, to taste.  Position the oven rack about 6-inches away from the flame and broil the zucchini slices for about 4 minutes, or until slices appear shriveled and golden brown in spots.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a cooling rack.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Repeat the above procedure with the eggplant slices, brushing with olive oil and seasoning lightly with salt and pepper as before.  Broil until slices soften and are golden brown in spots, about 4 minutes.  Transfer to a cooling rack to cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl combine the goat cheese with the cream, 1 teaspoon of the garlic and the fresh herbs and stir to thoroughly combine.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the sun-dried tomatoes with 2 tablespoons of the packing oil and the remaining teaspoon of garlic in the bowl of a food processor.  Process until smooth, about 2 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Decrease the oven temperature to 300 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly brush the insides of 6 (1/2-cup) ramekins with some of the remaining olive oil and line the bottoms and sides of the ramekins with 8 to 10 zucchini slices, in pinwheel fashion and with slices slightly overlapping one another.  Place 1 slice of eggplant on top of the zucchini slices in the bottom of each ramekin.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the goat cheese mixture among the ramekins, using the back of a spoon to press down and smooth the tops.  Divide the sundried tomato puree evenly among the ramekins, again using the back of a spoon to evenly distribute the puree over the goat cheese.  Divide the remaining eggplant slices among the ramekins and press down firmly to pack contents.  Place the ramekins on the middle rack in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes, or until just heated through.  Make the Tomato Vinaigrette while charlottes are heating.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tomato Vinaigrette:  In a mixing bowl combine the vinegar, lemon juice, salt and pepper and whisk together.  While continuing to whisk, add the oil in a slow, steady stream until combined and slightly emulsified.  Stir in the basil, oregano and diced tomatoes and serve immediately.  (Makes about 1 cup)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Unmold the charlottes onto plates and spoon some of the Tomato Vinaigrette around them.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  ground pork
  8          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  flour -- plus
     3/4           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
     1/4           cup  chopped bell peppers
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne
  1                cup  cooked medium-grain rice
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  2               cups  dried fine bread crumbs
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  milk
  6               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
                        === SPICY DIP ===
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  minced green onions
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  Creole mustard
                        = (or other hot whole-grain mustard)
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  hot red pepper sauce
  1              pinch  salt

In a large skillet, combine the pork and 3 teaspoons of the Essence, and cook, stirring, until brown over medium-high heat, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and drain on paper towels.

In a medium pot, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add 3 tablespoons of the flour and, stirring constantly for 5 minutes, make a dark brown roux.

To the pork, add the onions and bell peppers, and cook, stirring, until soft, 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the pork mixture to the roux and cook for 1 minute.  Add the water, salt, and cayenne, and bring to a boil.  Simmer until thick, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the rice, green onions, and 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.

Remove from the heat and spread on a baking sheet or platter until cool enough to handle.

In a shallow bowl, season the remaining 3/4 cup of flour with 2 teaspoons of the Essence.  In another shallow bowl, season the remaining 1 cup of bread crumbs with the remaining tablespoon of Essence.  In a third shallow bowl, whisk the egg and milk together.

Preheat the oil to 360 degrees.

Shape the pork and rice mixture into balls the size of walnuts.  Dredge the pork balls first in the flour, then dip in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off.  Dredge the balls in the seasoned bread crumbs, turning to coat evenly.

Using a slotted spoon, slide the balls in batches into the oil and fry, turning until golden, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate.  Season lightly with salt, and repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Serve hot with the Spicy Dip.

Spicy Dip:  In a bowl, combine the ingredients and mix well.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, and serve with the Pork Boulettes.  (Makes about 1 1/4 cups)

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  ground veal
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  buttermilk
  2              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        Oil -- for pan-frying
                        === SPICY PORTUGUESE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     3/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  2                     anchovy fillets -- minced
     1/4           cup  chopped black olives -- such as Kalamata
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (16 oz)
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a bowl combine veal, salt, red pepper, garlic, cilantro, parsley, buttermilk, 1 egg, and 1/4 cup of the bread crumbs and mix quickly but thoroughly to combine.  Form into meatballs the size of a large walnut, about 2 tablespoons each in size.

Beat the remaining egg with 2 tablespoons of water and 1 teaspoon of the Essence in a shallow bowl.  Combine the flour and 1 teaspoon of the remaining Essence in a shallow bowl.  Combine the bread crumbs with the remaining teaspoon of Essence in a shallow bowl.

Dip each ball first into the seasoned flour, then into the egg wash, and finally into the bread crumbs.  Flatten the balls slightly to form a patty and place on a waxed paper-covered baking sheet.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to cook.

In a large saute pan, add enough oil to come 1/2-inch up the side of the pan.  Heat the oil to 350 degrees.  Fry the meat pies in the oil in batches until deep golden brown and cooked through, about 3 or 4 minutes each side, turning as they cook.  Drain on paper towels and repeat with the remaining meat pies.  Serve hot with Spicy Portuguese sauce.

Spicy Portuguese Sauce:  In a saucepan, heat olive oil and saute onion and garlic until soft and fragrant, about 4 minutes.  Add crushed red pepper, anchovy fillets, and olives and cook for 2 minutes.  Add tomato paste, tomatoes, and water and stir well to combine.  Simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, until flavors have blended and sauce is thickened.  Add parsley and cilantro, and season with salt and pepper, to taste, and serve warm.

This recipe yields about 36 meat pies.

  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  2                     oranges -- sliced crosswise
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro

Season the flour with the Essence and lightly dredge the fish in the flour, shaking to remove any excess.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the fish and cook until just done, 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to a glass or ceramic baking dish large enough to fit the fish in one layer.

In a bowl, combine the remaining ingredients.  Pour over the fish, cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 12 and up to 24 hours, turning the fish and basting occasionally.

Remove from the refrigerator.  Transfer the fish to a platter, garnish with the orange slices and sprinkle with the cilantro.  Serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2                     bay leaves
  1                cup  dry white wine
  3             quarts  water
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
  5                     parsley stems
  3           teaspoon  salt -- divided
  1 1/2         pounds  Idaho potatoes -- peeled, cubed
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  heavy cream
  12            slices  gravlax
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh dill

In a large stockpot over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the pot as well as the chopped onion, chopped celery, chopped carrots, chopped lovage stalks and smashed garlic cloves.  Sweat the vegetables for 5 to 7 minutes.

Add the salmon bones and the bay leaves and continue to cook the bones and vegetables for 5 minutes.  Deglaze with the white wine.  Add the water, peppercorns, parsley stems, and 1 teaspoon of the salt and bring to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the broth is very flavorful.  After 45 minutes, strain the stock and reserve for the soup.  Discard the solids.

In a 6-quart stockpot set over a medium-high heat, add the remaining olive oil and cook the finely diced onion, celery and carrots for 5 minutes or until the onions are translucent.  Add the minced garlic and sweat for 30 seconds.  Pour the stock over the vegetables, and add the potatoes.  Bring the pot to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.  Cook the soup for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the potatoes begin to burst.  Season the soup with the remaining salt, Essence and black pepper.

Puree the soup using an immersion blender until smooth, and then add the cream and chopped lovage to the soup.  Adjust the seasoning, and remove from the heat.

To serve, ladle 1 cup of soup in a bowl and make a rosette with a slice of gravlax.  Place the gravlax in the center of the soup, and sprinkle the dill around the rosette.

             Praline Charlotte Russe With Butterscotch Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  store-bought soft ladyfingers - (3 oz)
     1/4           cup  milk
  1           envelope  unflavored gelatin - (abt 2 1/2 tspns)
     1/4           cup  almond or walnut liqueur -- plus
  2        tablespoons  almond or walnut liqueur
  2 1/4           cups  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/4            cup  crumbled Pecan Pralines -- (see recipe)
                        === BUTTERSCOTCH SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  water
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  butter

Line the bottom and sides of 2-quart charlotte mold or souffle dish with a piece of waxed paper.  Line the sides of the mold with the ladyfingers, fitting them in side by side, with the lightly browned side facing outward.  Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the ladyfingers with 2 tablespoons of the liqueur.  Set the mold aside.

Place the milk in a small saucepan and sprinkle the gelatin over the top.  Allow to sit for 5 minutes, until the gelatin softens.  Heat over low heat until the gelatin dissolves, stirring frequently.  Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining liqueur.  Set aside.

In a cold bowl, whip the cream with the vanilla until the mixture is thickened.  Pour the cooled gelatin mixture into the bowl, and continue whipping until the mixture forms soft peaks.  Using a balloon whisk, fold in 3/4 cup of the crumbled pralines.  Do not over beat.  Gently pour the mixture into the lined mold.  Cover the mold with plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly set, at least 2 hours.

When ready to serve, gently unmold the charlotte by inverting the mold onto a serving plate and giving a sharp tap onto a solid surface.  Return to its upright position and top with some of the remaining 1/2 cup crumbled pralines.  Serve immediately, with some of the Butterscotch Sauce spooned over the charlotte and around the plate.

Butterscotch Sauce:  In a medium saucepan combine the sugar and water and cook over medium heat, undisturbed, until the sugar reaches an amber color, about 8 minutes.  Swirl the pan occasionally to ensure even cooking.  (If the sugar syrup splatters up the sides of the pan while cooking, use a clean pastry brush to wash down the sides with some cold water.)  As soon as the sugar reaches the desired color, remove from the heat and slowly add the heavy cream and butter.  (Be very careful of splatters.)  Swirl the pan until the sauce is thick and smooth, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool to lukewarm before serving.  (Makes 1 cup)

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dried red beans -- rinsed, and
                        sorted over
  3        tablespoons  bacon grease
     1/4           cup  chopped tasso
                        = (or chopped ham)
  1 1/2           cups  chopped yellow onions
     3/4           cup  chopped celery
     3/4           cup  chopped green bell peppers
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  cayenne
  3                     bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme
     1/2         pound  smoked sausage -- halved lengthwise,
                        and cut into 1" pieces
  1              pound  smoked ham hocks
  3        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  10              cups  chicken stock -- or water
  4               cups  cooked white rice
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions -- for garnish

Place the beans in a large bowl or pot and cover with water by 2 inches.  Let soak for 8 hours or overnight.  Drain and set aside.

In a large pot, heat the bacon grease over medium-high heat.  Add the tasso and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the onions, celery and bell peppers to the grease in the pot.  Season with the salt, pepper, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are soft, about 4 minutes.

Add the bay leaves, parsley, thyme, sausage, and ham hocks, and cook, stirring, to brown the sausage and ham hocks, about 4 minutes.

Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.  Add the beans and stock or water, stir well, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender and starting to thicken, about 2 hours.  (Should the beans become too thick and dry, add more water, about 1/4 cup at a time.)

Remove from the heat and with the back of a heavy spoon, mash about 1/4 of the beans against the side of the pot.  Continue to cook until the beans are tender and creamy, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and remove the bay leaves.

Serve over rice and garnish with green onions.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  butter
  1                cup  flour
  2                     onions -- chopped
  2                     celery ribs -- finely chopped
     1/2                green bell pepper -- finely chopped
  6             cloves  garlic -- minced
  3                     bay leaves
  2             quarts  shrimp or seafood stock
  4                     blue crabs -- halved
  1              pound  raw shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1              pound  fish fillets -- cut into pieces
                        = (such as redfish or another
                        firm-fleshed fish)
     1/4           cup  chopped parsley
  1              bunch  green onions -- chopped
  1               pint  oysters -- in their liquor
                        Cooked white rice -- for serving

In a large, heavy saucepan or dutch oven melt butter and whisk in flour until smooth.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until roux is a peanut butter color, about 20 minutes.

Immediately add onions, celery, bell pepper, garlic, and bay leaves and cook until vegetables are very soft, about 8 minutes.  Add stock and whisk to combine.  Bring to a boil, skim surface, and reduce heat to a simmer.  Add crabs and cook for 1 1/2 hours, until thickened and flavorful.  If gumbo seems too thick, thin with water or seafood stock.

Add shrimp and fish and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until shrimp turn pink and fish is cooked through.  Add oysters (with their liquor), parsley, and green onions, and cook until edges of oysters curl, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary, and serve in large bowls over hot white rice.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              stick  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  flour
  2               cups  chopped yellow onions
  1                cup  chopped celery
     1/2           cup  chopped green bell peppers
     1/2           cup  chopped red bell peppers
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  cayenne
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1                cup  water
  2          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2                     bay leaves
  1                cup  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
                        = (or dry white wine)
  2        tablespoons  fresh chopped parsley
  2          teaspoons  fresh chopped thyme
  1 1/2         pounds  shrimp -- peeled
  3        tablespoons  chopped green onions
  4               cups  steamed long-grain white rice
                        === FRIED MIRLITON STRIPS ===
  2             medium  mirlitons (chayote squash) -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into strips
  2        tablespoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Salt -- to taste

In a large pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the flour to make a roux and cook to peanut butter color.  Add the onions, celery, bell peppers, salt, pepper, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the water and stir well.  Add the Essence, and bay leaves, and reduce the heat to medium.  Add the tomatoes, sherry, parsley, and thyme, and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes.

Reduce to a simmer, and cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens, about 4 minutes.  Add the shrimp and cook just until they curl and turn pink, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the green onions and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Remove and discard the bay leaves.  Serve hot over steamed rice with the Fried Mirliton Strips.

Fried Mirliton Strips:  Season the mirliton strips with 1 tablespoon of the Essence.  Combine the flour with the remaining tablespoon of Essence in a shallow dish.  Dredge the mirlitons in the seasoned flour, shaking to remove any excess.

In a medium pot with high sides, heat the oil to 350 degrees over medium-high heat.  Add the mirliton pieces in batches and fry until golden brown, turning with a long-handled spoon, about 2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Season lightly with salt.  Repeat with the remaining mirlitons, and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a large pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the flour to make a roux and cook to peanut butter color.  Add the onions, celery, bell peppers, salt, pepper, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the water and stir well.  Add the Essence, and bay leaves, and reduce the heat to medium.  Add the tomatoes, sherry, parsley, and thyme, and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Reduce to a simmer, and cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens, about 4 minutes.  Add the shrimp and cook just until they curl and turn pink, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the green onions and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Remove and discard the bay leaves.  Serve hot over steamed rice with the Fried Mirliton Strips.

<DirT>
Fried Mirliton Strips:  Season the mirliton strips with 1 tablespoon of the Essence.  Combine the flour with the remaining tablespoon of Essence in a shallow dish.  Dredge the mirlitons in the seasoned flour, shaking to remove any excess.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium pot with high sides, heat the oil to 350 degrees over medium-high heat.  Add the mirliton pieces in batches and fry until golden brown, turning with a long-handled spoon, about 2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Season lightly with salt.  Repeat with the remaining mirlitons, and serve hot.

  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  3        tablespoons  ice water

Combine the flour, brown sugar, butter and salt in a small bowl, and mix with your fingertips until it resembles coarse crumbs.  Set aside.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  egg
  1                cup  milk
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  melted butter

                        Sour cream -- as accompaniment
                        Lingonberry jam -- as accompaniment

Preheat a Swedish pancake pan (round, cast-iron pan with shallow 3-inch indentations for pancakes) over medium heat.

Beat the egg and milk in a small bowl.

  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
  1                     cinnamon stick -- (abt 2" long)
  4                     whole cloves
     1/4           cup  fresh Mexican oregano leaves
                        = (or 2 tspns dried oregano)
     1/4           cup  fresh thyme leaves
                        = (or 2 tspns dried thyme)
     1/4           cup  shelled and skinned almond -- roasted
     1/4           cup  shelled peanuts -- roasted
     1/4           cup  raisins
  2               cups  chicken stock - (to 2 1/2) -- hot
                        = (plus a little more if necessary)
  4 1/2    tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4             ounces  Mexican chocolate - (2 tablets) -- chopped
  1                can  tomato puree - (14 oz)
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  chopped cilantro
                        Fresh tortillas -- for serving

Place chicken pieces in a large resealable plastic bag.  Combine the tequila, lime juice, garlic, cilantro and brown sugar in a mixing bowl and whisk until the sugar is dissolved.  Pour over chicken pieces and seal the bag, trying to release as much air as possible.  Refrigerate the chicken for 45 minutes to 1 hour, turning occasionally.

While the chicken is marinating, make the sauce.

Preheat the broiler to 500 degrees and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.

Combine the tomatoes, onion, and garlic cloves on the baking sheet and broil until slightly caramelized around the edges, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and transfer the garlic to a small plate to cool.  Using a spatula or large spoon, turn the tomatoes and onions so that the uncooked sides are up.  Return to the broiler until slightly caramelized on the second side, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.

In a large skillet over high heat, toast the chiles on all sides until lightly browned and fragrant.  Do not allow to burn.  Transfer to a medium bowl, cover with hot water and allow to sit until softened, about 30 minutes.

In the same skillet, combine the sesame seeds and reserved chile seeds and toast until light brown and fragrant.  Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.  Add the peppercorns, cinnamon stick, cloves, oregano and thyme to the hot skillet and "toast" for a few seconds, just until their perfume is released.  Transfer to the bowl with the sesame seeds.

When cool enough to handle, peel the garlic cloves and add these, along with the charred tomatoes and onion, to the bowl of a food processor.  Add the seeds and spices.  Drain the liquid off of the chiles and add these to the processor as well.  Add the roasted nuts and raisins, and 1 cup of the chicken stock and puree the mixture until very smooth and thick, scraping down the sides of the blender frequently.

In a large deep pot, heat 3 tablespoons of the vegetable oil until very hot.  Carefully pour the pureed mixture into the pot (be careful, it will splatter) and bring the mixture to a boil.  Lower the heat so that the mixture simmers, and add 3 1/2 ounces of the chocolate to the pot.  Cover and cook, stirring frequently, for about 1 hour, or until the mole paste is very thick and flavorful.  At this point you should have about 3 1/2 cups of mole paste.  Reserve 1 cup to make the Mole sauce, and reserve the remaining paste for another use.  The mole paste will keep for at least 6 months, refrigerated, or up to 1 year if frozen.

Preheat the broiler to 500 degrees.

To make the sauce, heat the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until very hot.  Add the tomato puree and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add the cup of reserved mole paste and the remaining 1 to 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock and stir to combine well.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the mixture is a nice sauce consistency.  Add the remaining 1/2-ounce of Mexican chocolate and the salt and cook another 2 minutes, or until the chocolate is melted and the sauce is thick, smooth and flavorful.  Keep warm while you cook the chicken.

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place the chicken pieces on the baking sheet.  Broil for 5 minutes, or until the chicken is charred in places.  Turn the chicken and continue to broil for an additional 5 minutes, or until the second side is charred.  Reduce the heat to 325 degrees and continue to cook the chicken until the juices run clear, about 10 more minutes.

Serve the chicken immediately, with some of the mole sauce spooned over the top, garnished with some of the chopped cilantro.  Pass tortillas at the table.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  milk
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split, scraped
  6              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  6        tablespoons  granulated sugar

Heat the heavy cream, milk, and vanilla bean in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat.  Place the egg yolks and sugar in a heatproof mixing bowl and beat until pale yellow in color and all of the sugar has dissolved.  Temper about 1/2 cup of the cream mixture into the egg mixture and whisk vigorously to incorporate well.  Add the remainder of the cream mixture to the bowl and whisk vigorously to incorporate.

Strain the brulee base through a fine mesh sieve and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Pour the custard into 6 (5-ounce) oval ramekins or gratin dishes, and place the dishes in a sheet pan or roasting pan.  Pour enough hot water into the pan to come up half way on the sides of the ramekins.  Place the pan in the oven on the middle rack and bake for 30 minutes, turning the sheet pan around after 15 minutes to ensure even cooking.

To test for doneness, jiggle the pan slightly to see if the custard is set, if so, remove from the oven and let cool at room temperature before placing them in the refrigerator for 2 hours to completely cool.

Once the brulee has cooled, evenly spread 1 tablespoon of sugar over each ramekin and using a blowtorch, caramelize the sugar to form a candy coating.  Be sure to keep the blowtorch moving in a circular motion to prevent the sugar from burning.  Serve once the sugar has cooled and is hard like candy.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Strain the brulee base through a fine mesh sieve and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Pour the custard into 6 (5-ounce) oval ramekins or gratin dishes, and place the dishes in a sheet pan or roasting pan.  Pour enough hot water into the pan to come up half way on the sides of the ramekins.  Place the pan in the oven on the middle rack and bake for 30 minutes, turning the sheet pan around after 15 minutes to ensure even cooking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To test for doneness, jiggle the pan slightly to see if the custard is set, if so, remove from the oven and let cool at room temperature before placing them in the refrigerator for 2 hours to completely cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Once the brulee has cooled, evenly spread 1 tablespoon of sugar over each ramekin and using a blowtorch, caramelize the sugar to form a candy coating.  Be sure to keep the blowtorch moving in a circular motion to prevent the sugar from burning.  Serve once the sugar has cooled and is hard like candy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === WILD MUSHROOM CONFIT ===
  1 1/2         pounds  assorted wild mushrooms
                        = (such as shiitake, portobello,
                        oyster, or cremini)
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3               cups  light neutral-flavored oil
                        = (such as safflower oil)
  3                     garlic cloves
  2                     bay leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary
                        === SALAD ===
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  3        tablespoons  Champagne vinegar
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  cooked barley
  2        tablespoons  finely-diced red radish
  2        tablespoons  finely-diced carrot
  2                     green onions, white and green -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  minced flat-leaf parsley
  2               cups  mesclun salad mixture
                        Truffle oil -- for drizzling
                        === CRISPY CARROTS CURLS ===
  3                     carrots (preferably thick) -- peeled
                        Oil -- for deep-frying
                        Instant flour -- as needed
                        Fine salt -- to taste

To make the Wild Mushroom Confit:  Stem and clean the mushrooms, leaving the caps whole, except the portobellos, which can be quartered.  In a colander, combine the mushrooms and sprinkle generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Set the colander aside in a bowl, for 30 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally, allowing the mushrooms to release as much liquid as possible (do not reserve the liquid).  Pat the mushrooms dry with a paper towel.

Preheat oven to 225 degrees.

In a large baking dish, combine the mushrooms with the oil, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, and black pepper.  Cover with foil, and bake for 1 1/2 hours, until the mushrooms are very tender.  Transfer the mushrooms to a strainer or colander set over a medium bowl to catch the oil.  Remove and discard the bay leaves, thyme, and rosemary.  Reserve 1/2 cup of the oil, and save the rest of the mushroom oil for other recipes.

To make the Salad:  In a small bowl, combine the garlic, vinegar, mustard, salt, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Gradually whisk in the 1/2 cup of reserved mushroom oil to make a creamy dressing.

In a medium bowl combine the mushrooms, barley, radish, carrots, green onions, and parsley; lightly toss with a little of the dressing.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

In another medium bowl, toss the mesclun with a little of the dressing and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Reserve the remaining dressing for another use.

To serve, divide the greens among 4 plates.  Top with the mushroom salad and drizzle with truffle oil.  Top with the Crispy Carrots Curls and serve immediately.

Crispy Carrots Curls:  With a Japanese-style rotary cutter cut the carrots into long curls.

Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed pot to a depth of 2 inches.  Heat over medium-high until the oil registers 360 degrees on a deep-fry thermometer.

In a medium bowl, toss the carrots with the instant flour to coat evenly, and shake off the excess.  Fry the carrot curls, in batches if needed, until crisp and very lightly browned.  Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.  Season with salt, to taste, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

To make the Wild Mushroom Confit:  Stem and clean the mushrooms, leaving the caps whole, except the portobellos, which can be quartered.  In a colander, combine the mushrooms and sprinkle generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Set the colander aside in a bowl, for 30 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally, allowing the mushrooms to release as much liquid as possible (do not reserve the liquid).  Pat the mushrooms dry with a paper towel.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat oven to 225 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large baking dish, combine the mushrooms with the oil, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, and black pepper.  Cover with foil, and bake for 1 1/2 hours, until the mushrooms are very tender.  Transfer the mushrooms to a strainer or colander set over a medium bowl to catch the oil.  Remove and discard the bay leaves, thyme, and rosemary.  Reserve 1/2 cup of the oil, and save the rest of the mushroom oil for other recipes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Salad:  In a small bowl, combine the garlic, vinegar, mustard, salt, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Gradually whisk in the 1/2 cup of reserved mushroom oil to make a creamy dressing.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium bowl combine the mushrooms, barley, radish, carrots, green onions, and parsley; lightly toss with a little of the dressing.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In another medium bowl, toss the mesclun with a little of the dressing and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Reserve the remaining dressing for another use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, divide the greens among 4 plates.  Top with the mushroom salad and drizzle with truffle oil.  Top with the Crispy Carrots Curls and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Crispy Carrots Curls:  With a Japanese-style rotary cutter cut the carrots into long curls.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed pot to a depth of 2 inches.  Heat over medium-high until the oil registers 360 degrees on a deep-fry thermometer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a medium bowl, toss the carrots with the instant flour to coat evenly, and shake off the excess.  Fry the carrot curls, in batches if needed, until crisp and very lightly browned.  Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.  Season with salt, to taste, and serve.

  1         tablespoon  bench flour - (to 2)
  1                     sheet puff pastry -- room temperature,
                        and covered with a damp cloth
  1                     lightly beaten egg white
  1           teaspoon  granulated sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1                cup  sweet Marsala wine
     1/4           cup  limoncello
                        = (or orange liqueur)
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
     1/2                vanilla bean -- scraped
  2           packages  raspberries - (6 oz ea) -- rinsed clean
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  confectioners' sugar
                        === CANDIED LEMON ZEST ===
  3                     lemons
  1                cup  water
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
                        === CHANTILLY CREAM ===
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  limoncello
  2        tablespoons  sugar

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Sprinkle a small amount of flour on a dry work surface.  Place the puff pastry on the counter, and using a rolling pin or dowel, roll the puff pastry sheet to a 1/8-inch thickness.  Using a 3-inch round cutter dipped in flour, cut the puff pastry into 8 circles.  Place the puff pastry rounds on a parchment-lined sheet pan.  Lightly brush the rounds with the egg white.

Combine 1 teaspoon of the sugar with the cinnamon to make a cinnamon sugar.  Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar evenly amongst the 8 puff pastry rounds and cover with another sheet of parchment paper.  Lay a second sheet pan on top of the first and place the sheet pans in the oven.  Bake the pastry rounds for 30 minutes, or until lightly browned and cooked through.  Remove from the oven and let cool completely.

In a 1-quart saucepan, combine the Marsala, 1/4 cup of limoncello, lemon juice, vanilla bean, and 1 tablespoon of sugar.  Bring the pan to a boil over a medium-high heat and reduce the liquid to a light syrupy consistency, about 10 to 12 minutes.

Once the liquid has reduced, strain the syrup and pour over the raspberries.  Toss to evenly coat the raspberries and set aside in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

For the Candied Lemon Zest:  Remove zest from the lemons with a vegetable peeler.  Cut lemon zest into 1-inch by 1/8-inch pieces.  Add zest to a pot of boiling water and blanch for 5 minutes.

Combine 1 cup water and 1 cup sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil and boil until sugar dissolves.  Add the blanched lemon zest to the simple syrup and remove from the heat and let steep for 10 minutes.  Remove the zest from the syrup and lay out onto a rack set over a half sheet pan.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar.

For the Chantilly Cream:  Combine the heavy cream, 1 tablespoon limoncello and remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar in a medium-sized mixing bowl and beat with a whisk until stiff, about 5 minutes.

Assembly:  place a small dot of whipped cream in the center of a medium-sized plate and place a pastry round on top of the whipped cream.  Repeat this process with three other plates, and then top each round with a dollop of whipped cream.  Reserve a 1/4 cup of the raspberries, and divide the remaining raspberries evenly amongst the four pastry rounds.  Place another pastry round on top of the raspberries, and then a small dollop of whipped cream on top of the pastry round.

Use the remaining 1/4 cup of raspberries as garnish on top of the mille feuille, and dust the tops with confectioners' sugar and garnish with candied lemon peel.  Serve immediately.
