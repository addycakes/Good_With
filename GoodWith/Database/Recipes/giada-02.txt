Categories    : Cakes                           Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CAKE ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  sugar
  3              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  orange zest
  2          teaspoons  lemon zest
     1/4           cup  whole milk
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     2/3           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted, and
                        coarsely crumbled
                        Powdered sugar -- for sifting
                        === CITRUS COMPOTE ===
  2        tablespoons  grated orange peel
     3/4      teaspoon  orange blossom water -- (optional)
  3                     oranges -- segmented
  2                     pink grapefruits -- segmented

To make the Cake:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil an 8-inch-diameter cake pan.

Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl to blend.  Using an electric mixer, beat the sugar, eggs, and zests in a large bowl until pale and fluffy.  Beat in the milk.  Gradually beat in the oil.  Add the flour mixture and stir just until blended.  Stir in the almonds.

Transfer the batter to the prepared pan.  Place cake pan on baking pan to collect any possible spills.  Bake until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 35 minutes.  Transfer to a rack and cool for 15 minutes.  Remove cake and place on serving platter, top-side up.  Sift powdered sugar over the cake.

To make the Citrus Compote:  Stir the orange peel, blossom water, and 2 tablespoons of accumulated juices from the segmented fruit in a small bowl to blend.  Arrange the orange and grapefruit segments decoratively in a wide shallow bowl.  Pour the blossom water mixture over.  Cover and let stand 15 minutes for the flavors to blend.

Cut the cake into wedges and spoon the citrus compote alongside.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4          teaspoons  olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- coarsely chopped
  1              pound  ground beef
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  14                    manicotti - (an 8-oz pkg)
  1                     container whole-milk ricotta - (15 oz)
  3               cups  shredded mozzarella
  1                cup  grated Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  3               cups  marinara sauce
  2        tablespoons  butter -- cut into pieces

Heat a heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add 1 teaspoon of the olive oil, onion and ground beef.  Season with salt and pepper.  Saute until the meat browns and the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat, and cool.

Brush 1 teaspoon of oil over a large baking sheet.  Cook the manicotti in a large pot of boiling salted water until slightly softened, but still very firm to the bite, about 4 to 6 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the manicotti from the pot to the oiled baking sheet and cool.

Meanwhile, combine the ricotta, 1 1/2 to 2 cups mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan, and parsley.  Add the garlic, salt, and pepper to taste, and mix.  Stir the cooled meat mixture into the cheese mixture.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Brush the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil over a 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Spoon 1 1/2 cups of the marinara sauce over the bottom of the prepared dish.  Fill the manicotti with the cheese-meat mixture.  Arrange the stuffed pasta in a single layer in the prepared dish and spoon the remaining sauce over.

Sprinkle the remaining 1 1/2 cups of mozzarella cheese, then the remaining 1/2 cup of Parmesan over the stuffed pasta.  Dot entire dish with the butter pieces.  Bake the manicotti uncovered until heated through and the sauce bubbles on the sides of the dish, about 30 to 35 minutes.  Let the manicotti stand 5 minutes and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4         pounds  lean ground chuck
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3                     portobello mushrooms -- stems trimmed
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  4                     four-inch square or round ciabatta or
                        foccacia squares -- halved horizontally
  2               cups  fresh arugula

Combine the ground chuck, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.  Shape the mixture into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) patties.

Lightly drizzle both sides of the mushrooms with the oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Mix the mayonnaise, lemon juice, and garlic in a small bowl to blend.  (The patties, mushrooms, and garlic mayonnaise can be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead.  Cover them separately and refrigerate.)

Prepare the barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill the burgers until cooked to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Grill the mushrooms until just tender, about 5 minutes per side.  Grill the focaccia squares cut-side down, until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes.

Spread the garlic mayonnaise over the roll bottoms.  Cut the mushrooms into strips and arrange the mushroom strips over the mayonnaise.  Place the burgers atop the mushrooms.  Spread garlic mayonnaise on the cut side of the tops and arrange a handful of arugula on each.  Cover the burger with the roll tops and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                         Butternut Squash Lasagna

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     butternut squash - (1 1/2 to 2 lbs) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  water
  3                     amaretti cookies -- crumbled
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  3 1/2           cups  whole milk
  1              pinch  nutmeg
     3/4           cup  fresh basil leaves - (lightly packed)
  12                    no-boil lasagna noodles
  2 1/2           cups  shredded whole-milk mozzarella cheese
     1/3           cup  grated Parmesan

Heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the squash and toss to coat.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Pour the water into the skillet and then cover and simmer over medium heat until the squash is tender, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.  Cool slightly and then transfer the squash to a food processor.  Add the amaretti cookies and blend until smooth.  Season the squash puree, to taste, with more salt and pepper.

Melt the butter in a heavy medium-size saucepan over medium heat.  Add the flour and whisk for 1 minute.  Gradually whisk in the milk.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly, whisking often, about 5 minutes.  Whisk in the nutmeg.  Cool slightly.  Transfer half of the sauce to a blender.  Add the basil and blend until smooth.  Return the basil sauce to the sauce in the pan and stir to blend.  Season the sauce with salt and pepper, to taste.

Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees.

Lightly butter a 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Spread 3/4 cup of the sauce over the prepared baking dish.  Arrange 3 lasagna noodles on the bottom of the pan.  Spread 1/3 of the squash puree over the noodles.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese.  Drizzle 1/2 cup of sauce over the noodles.  Repeat layering 3 more times.

Tightly cover the baking dish with foil and bake the lasagna for 40 minutes.  Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses over the lasagna.  Continue baking uncovered until the sauce bubbles and the top is golden, 15 minutes longer.  Let the lasagna stand for 15 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Cook's Notes:  The no-boil lasagna noodles can be substituted with fresh spinach lasagna sheets.  Look for fresh lasagna sheets in the refrigerated section of specialty markets.

When blending hot liquids:  Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes.  Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway.  If using a blender, release one corner of the lid.  This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions.  Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1                     celery stalk -- chopped
  1             medium  eggplant -- cut 1/2" pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     red bell pepper -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
  3        tablespoons  raisins
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano leaves
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  drained capers
  1                     loaf ciabatta bread -- cut crosswise
                        into 6 equal pieces
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  6             slices  fresh water-packed mozzarella, 1/3" thick -- drained
                        Missing Ingredient

Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add the celery and saute until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.  Add the eggplant and saute until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes.  Season with salt.  Add the red pepper and cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes.  Add the diced tomatoes with their juices, raisins, and oregano.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Simmer over medium-low heat until the flavors blend and the mixture thickens, stirring often, about 20 minutes.  Add the vinegar, sugar, and capers.  Season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Cut the bread pieces horizontally in half.  Grill the bread cut-side down on a grill pan over medium-high heat until golden, about 2 minutes.  Rub the whole garlic cloves over the toasted side of the bread.  Add a slice of mozzarella to bread bottom, spoon the caponata on top, cover with the other bread half and serve.

     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
     1/3           cup  grated Gruyere
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary leaves

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     chicken thighs
  2                     chicken breasts with skin and backbone -- halved crosswise
  2          teaspoons  salt -- plus more to taste
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- plus more to taste
     1/2           cup  all purpose flour -- for dredging
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  red bell pepper -- chopped
  1                     onion -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- finely chopped
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
  1                can  diced tomatoes with juice - (28 oz)
     3/4           cup  reduced-sodium chicken broth
  3        tablespoons  drained capers
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano leaves
     1/4           cup  coarsely-chopped fresh basil leaves

Sprinkle the chicken pieces with 1 teaspoon of each salt and pepper.  Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour to coat lightly.

In a large heavy saute pan, heat the oil over a medium-high flame.  Add the chicken pieces to the pan and saute just until brown, about 5 minutes per side.  If all the chicken does not fit in the pan, saute it in 2 batches.  Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.

Add the bell pepper, onion and garlic to the same pan and saute over medium heat until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the wine and simmer until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Add the tomatoes with their juice, broth, capers and oregano.

Return the chicken pieces to the pan and turn them to coat in the sauce.  Bring the sauce to a simmer.  Continue simmering over medium-low heat until the chicken is just cooked through, about 30 minutes for the breast pieces, and 20 minutes for the thighs.

Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a platter.  If necessary, boil the sauce until it thickens slightly, about 3 minutes.  Spoon off any excess fat from atop the sauce.  Spoon the sauce over the chicken, then sprinkle with the basil and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        All-purpose flour -- for dredging
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick)
  2        tablespoons  sliced shallots
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1 1/2           cups  dry white wine
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  2           packages  frozen cut-leaf spinach - (10 oz ea) -- thawed, drained

Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper.  Dredge the chicken in the flour to coat lightly.  Shake off any excess flour.  Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add the chicken and cook until brown, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer the chicken to a plate and tent with foil to keep it warm.

Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in the same skillet over medium heat.  Add the shallots and garlic and saute until the shallots are translucent, stirring to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet, about 1 minute.  Add the wine.  Increase the heat to medium-high and boil until the liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Add the cream and boil until the sauce reduces by half, stirring often, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the parsley.  Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Add the chicken and any accumulated juices to the sauce, and turn the chicken to coat in the sauce.

Meanwhile, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in another large skillet over medium heat.  Add the spinach and saute until heated through.  Season the spinach, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Arrange the spinach over a platter.  Place the chicken atop the spinach.  Pour the sauce over and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  8             ounces  pancetta -- cut 1/4" dice
  2              large  onions -- finely chopped
  2                     carrots -- peeled, chopped fine
  3                     celery stalks -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2               jars  roasted peeled chestnuts - (7.4 oz ea) -- coarsely broken
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  1              pound  day-old ciabatta bread -- cut 3/4" cubes
     2/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1                cup  canned low-salt chicken broth -- or more if needed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              large  eggs -- beaten to blend

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Butter a 15- by 10- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Add the pancetta and saute until crisp and golden, about 10 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a large bowl.

Melt the remaining butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, carrots, celery, rosemary, and garlic.  Saute until the onions are very tender, about 12 minutes.  Gently stir in the chestnuts and parsley.

Transfer the onion mixture to the large bowl with the pancetta.  Add the bread and Parmesan and toss to coat.  Add enough broth to the stuffing mixture to moisten.  Season the stuffing, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Mix in the eggs.

Transfer the stuffing to the prepared dish.  Cover with buttered foil, buttered-side down, and bake until the stuffing is heated through, about 30 minutes.  Uncover and continue baking until the top is crisp and golden, about 15 minutes longer.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

                    Creamy Ricotta Tart With Pine Nuts

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour -- plus
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2           cups  pine nuts - (abt 5 oz) -- toasted
  1              pinch  salt
  4             ounces  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- melted, and
                        cooled slightly
     1/2           cup  water
  1                cup  ricotta cheese
  6             ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
  2              large  eggs
  3              large  egg yolks

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In the bowl of a food processor, pulse flour, 2 tablespoons of sugar, 3/4 cup of pine nuts, and salt until finely ground.  Add the butter.  Pulse dough just until it comes together.

Place the dough into an 11-inch diameter tart pan with a removable bottom and press down to cover the bottom and sides of the pan.  Refrigerate until the dough is firm, about 30 minutes.

Line the tart shell with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake the tart shell in the lower third of the oven until just set, about 25 minutes.  Carefully remove the foil and pie weights.  Bake until the tart shell is lightly golden, about 10 minutes.  Cool completely.

Combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar with the water in a small saucepan over low heat.  You don't want to boil the water, you just want to heat it so that the sugar can dissolve thoroughly.  Stir until the sugar dissolves and remove from heat.

In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the ricotta cheese and cream cheese until smooth.  Add the eggs and egg yolks, 1 at a time, and process until smooth.  With the machine running, add the sugar syrup in a thin steady stream and process until smooth.

Pour the custard into the tart shell and bake until the filling is almost set, about 20 to 25 minutes.  Scatter the remaining 3/4 cup of toasted pine nuts atop the filling.  Bake until the custard is set, about 10 minutes longer.  Let the tart cool completely before serving.

The tart can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 3 days.  Return the tart to room temperature before serving.

This recipe yields 1 (11-inch) tart.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     lemons -- halved
  12                    baby artichokes
  3               cups  olive oil
                        Sea salt

Fill a large bowl halfway with water.  Squeeze the lemon halves into the water and add the lemons.  Trim the stem of 1 artichoke.  Starting at the base, bend the tough outer leaves back and pull off where they break naturally.  Using a vegetable peeler, peel the dark green skin from the base.  Halve the artichoke lengthwise and scoop out any choke.  Add to the lemon water.  Repeat with the remaining artichokes.

Heat the oil in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat until a thermometer registers 350 degrees.  Drain the artichokes and pat dry.  Working in 2 batches, add the artichokes to the hot oil and cook until they are tender and golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer the fried artichokes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.  Sprinkle with salt while artichokes are still warm and serve.

This recipe yields 6 appetizer servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  reduced-sodium chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2             ounces  pancetta -- chopped
  1                     link spicy Italian sausage - (abt 6 oz) -- casing removed
     3/4           cup  finely-chopped onion
  1                cup  chopped red bell pepper
  4             ounces  button mushrooms -- coarsely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  Arborio rice or medium-grain white rice
     3/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves

In a medium saucepan, bring the broth to a simmer.  Cover the broth and keep warm over low heat.

In a large heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the pancetta and sausage and saute until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Add the onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms and saute until tender, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan, about 8 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Add the rice and stir to coat.  Add the wine and simmer until the wine has almost completely evaporated, about 1 minute.  Add 1/2 cup of simmering broth and stir until almost completely absorbed, about 2 minutes.  Continue cooking the rice, adding the broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition of broth to absorb before adding the next, until the rice is tender but still firm to the bite and the mixture is creamy, about 25 to 30 minutes total.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in 3/4 of the Parmesan.  Transfer the risotto to a serving bowl.  Sprinkle with the parsley and remaining Parmesan and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     flat iron steaks - (16 oz ea)
                        = (or tri-tip steaks)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
                        extra for garnish
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
  2 1/2           cups  dry red wine

Prepare the grill or barbecue (medium-high heat).  Sprinkle the steaks with salt and pepper and drizzle with the 3 tablespoons of olive oil.  Grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Transfer the steaks to a cutting board.  Tent with foil and let stand 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and saute until tender, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt.  Add the garlic and oregano and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Whisk in the wine.  Simmer until the sauce reduces by half, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.

Remove the skillet from the heat.  Strain the sauce into a small bowl, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible.  Discard the solids in the strainer and return the sauce to the saucepan and bring back to a slow simmer.  Cut the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter into small 1/2-inch chunks and whisk in the sauce a little at a time.  Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Thinly slice the steaks across the grain.  Divide the steak slices among 6 plates.  Drizzle the sauce over the steak, drizzle a little more extra-virgin olive oil and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     potato - (abt 7 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" cubes
     1/2                onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
  2             ounces  sliced prosciutto -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil leaves
  1                     baguette -- cut 8 pieces
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter

Heat the oil in a heavy 9 1/2-inch-diameter skillet over medium heat.  Add the potato, onion, and garlic.  Season the potato mixture with salt and pepper, to taste.  Saute over medium-low heat until the potato is golden and crisp on the outside, tender inside, about 7 to 10 minutes.

Preheat the broiler.  Whisk the eggs, cream, Parmesan, prosciutto, and basil in a medium bowl to blend.  Stir the egg mixture into the potato mixture in the skillet.  Cook over medium-low heat until the egg mixture is almost set but the top is still loose, about 3 minutes.  Place the skillet under the broiler.  Broil until the top is set and golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Using a rubber spatula, loosen the frittata from skillet and slide the frittata onto a cutting board.  Cut the frittata into 12 wedges.

Split open each bread piece.  Toast the bread on a grill pan until golden.  You can also broil the bread cut-side up until golden, about 1 to 2 minutes, keeping a careful watch on the bread since they can easily burn.  Butter the cut sides of the toasted bread.  Arrange a frittata wedge on each bottom piece of bread.  Cover with the bread tops and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  whole milk ricotta cheese
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream -- plus
     1/3           cup  whipping cream
  3        tablespoons  powdered sugar
  1              pinch  ground cinnamon
  12            ounces  fresh strawberries -- hulled, and
                        quartered - (abt 2 1/2 cups)
     1/2                dry pint fresh raspberries - -- (abt 1 1/4 cups)

  2                     kiwi -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
  3        tablespoons  sliced almonds -- toasted

Stir the ricotta and 2 tablespoons of cream in a medium bowl to blend.  Using an electric mixer, beat the remaining 1/3 cup of cream, powdered sugar, and cinnamon in a large bowl until semi-firm peaks form.  Fold the ricotta into the whipped cream.  Place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to stiffen and yield a creamier filling.  (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Toss the strawberries, raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice in a medium bowl to combine.  Let stand until juices form, tossing occasionally, about 15 minutes.  Add the kiwi.

Spoon the fruit mixture into 4 dessert bowls.  Dollop the ricotta cream atop the fruit.  Sprinkle with the almonds and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  low-sodium chicken stock
     3/4           cup  semolina flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              large  egg
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper -- (optional)

Lightly oil a small baking sheet.  Whisk the stock, semolina flour, and salt in a heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat until the mixture bubbles and is very thick, about 10 minutes.  Beat the egg in a large bowl.  Gradually beat the semolina mixture into the egg.

Transfer the gnocchi mixture to the prepared baking sheet, spreading it to form a 1/2-inch-thick layer.  Cover and refrigerate until the gnocchi mixture is cold and firm, at least 1 hour.

Preheat the broiler.  Generously butter a 10-inch-diameter gratin dish.  Using a 2-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out rounds from the gnocchi mixture.  Arrange the gnocchi in the prepared baking/gratin dish, overlapping slightly.  Brush the remaining butter over the gnocchi.  Sprinkle with the cheese, and pepper, if desired.  Broil until the gnocchi are heated through and beginning to brown, about 6 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  salted capers -- soaked 30 minutes,
                        drained, coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh Italian flat leaf parsley
     1/3           cup  chopped scallions
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh mint leaves
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  grated lemon peel
  1                cup  olive oil
                        = (preferably extra-virgin)
  2          teaspoons  dried crushed red pepper flakes
  3 1/2      teaspoons  coarse salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                     butterflied boned lamb shoulder - -- (4 1/2 to 5 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
                        Nonstick cooking spray

Stir the first 7 ingredients and 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes in a large bowl to blend.  Whisk in 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper.  Set the salsa verde aside.

Place the lamb in a 15- by 10- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Rub the minced garlic, remaining 2 teaspoons of salt, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and remaining 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes all over lamb.  Pour 1/2 cup of salsa verde over the lamb, turning the lamb to coat evenly.  Use immediately, or cover the dish and remaining salsa verde separately with plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 1 day.

Spray the grill rack with nonstick spray and prepare the barbecue (medium-high heat).

Transfer the lamb to a work surface and let rest 15 minutes.

Cut the lamb across grain into thin slices.  Arrange the lamb slices on a platter.  Serve the remaining salsa verde alongside.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     pineapples -- peeled, cut
                        crosswise into 1/2"-thk slices and
                        core removed
     2/3           cup  mascarpone cheese -- room temperature
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     2/3           cup  chocolate-hazelnut spread
                        = (Nutella recommended)
  6        tablespoons  whipping cream
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  3        tablespoons  chopped toasted hazelnuts

Prepare the outdoor barbecue to medium-high heat.  If you do not have a barbecue, you can use an indoor grill pan set to medium-high heat.  Lightly oil the grill.  Grill the pineapple slices until heated through and beginning to brown, about 3 minutes per side.  It's important to leave the pineapples on the grill, untouched so that you can create the grill marks.

While the pineapples are cooking, whisk the mascarpone and vanilla in a small bowl to blend.  Set aside.

Combine the chocolate-hazelnut spread and cream in a small bowl and stir to combine.  Place in a microwave on high for about 2 minutes, stirring every 20 seconds to blend well.  Alternatively, you can combine the chocolate-hazelnut spread and cream in a small saucepan, set over low heat, and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Heat until satiny smooth and easy to pour, about 3 to 5 minutes.

Transfer the pineapple slices to a large platter.  Drizzle the warm chocolate-hazelnut sauce over.  Dollop the mascarpone mixture atop.  Sprinkle with the hazelnuts and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHRIMP ===
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped pepperoncini
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  24             large  shrimp - (abt 1 lb) -- peeled, deveined
                        === SALAD ===
     1/3           cup  full-flavored extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

  4             ounces  large button mushrooms -- thinly sliced

To make the Shrimp:  Heat the oil in a heavy medium skillet over medium heat.  Add the pepperoncini and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Set aside.

Grill the shrimp until just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.  Toss the shrimp with the remaining pepperoncini oil to coat.

Meanwhile, to make the Salad:  Whisk the extra-virgin olive oil and lemon juice in a medium bowl to blend.  Season the dressing, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Top the arugula with mushrooms in a large bowl.  Season the salad, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Surround with the warm grilled shrimp and shaved Parmesan.  Add dressing and toss before service.  Serve immediately.  Mound the salad in the center of large plates.

Toss the shrimp in a medium bowl with 2 teaspoons of the pepperoncini oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for high heat or preheat the grill pan over a high flame.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8                     beef scaloppini - (3 to 4 oz ea)
                        = (from London Broil or Top Sirloin)
                        All-purpose flour -- for dredging
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                     bay leaf
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
     1/4           cup  frozen peas
  1              ounce  thinly-sliced prosciutto -- coarsely chopped

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the carrot, onion, and garlic and saute until the carrots are tender, about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Remove from the heat and cool slightly.  Stir in the Parmesan.

Season beef with salt and pepper.  Using 2 tablespoons for each, divide the carrot mixture among the beef slices.  Roll up the beef slices to enclose the filling, tucking in the ends.  Secure the rolls with toothpicks.

Heat the remaining oil and the remaining tablespoon of butter in the same large frying pan over medium-high heat.  Dredge the beef rolls in flour to coat lightly.  Add the beef rolls and cook until brown on all sides, about 8 minutes.  Add the wine and stir to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet.

Add the tomatoes with their juices and the bay leaf.  Cover and simmer until the beef is cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Transfer the beef rolls to a platter.  Remove the toothpicks, then cover the beef rolls with foil to keep warm.

Add the peas and prosciutto to the sauce in the skillet and stir until the peas are heated through and the sauce reduces slightly, about 5 minutes.  Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Drizzle the sauce over the beef rolls and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter - (1 stick) -- softened
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              large  egg
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  miniature chocolate chips -- (optional)
     1/2           cup  strawberry, raspberry or
                        other fruit preserves

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with parchment paper.  Using an electric mixer, beat the butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt in a large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in the egg.  Add the flour and mix just until a dough forms.

Fit a pastry bag with a large star tip, and fill the pastry bag with the cookie dough.  Pipe the dough onto the prepared baking sheets into stars, spacing 1-inch apart.  If desired, press about 4 miniature chocolate chips into the center of each star at this point.  Bake the cookies until they are pale golden around the edges and on the bottom, about 15 minutes.  Cool the cookies for 5 minutes.  Using a metal spatula, transfer the cookies to a rack and cool completely.

When the cookies have cooled, spoon approximately 1/4 teaspoon of preserves atop the flat side of 1 cookie.  Press a second cookie onto the preserves.  Repeat with the remaining cookies and preserves.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store between sheets of waxed paper in an airtight container at room temperature.)

This recipe yields 50 cookies.

Cook's Notes:  Alternately, the cookies can be made into thumbprint cookies.  To do so, refrigerate the dough until it is cold, about 2 hours.  Roll 2 teaspoons of dough for each cookie into 1-inch-diameter ball.  Place the cookies on the baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.  Make a deep indentation in the center of each cookie by pressing the back of a teaspoon into the cookies.  Fill each indentation with 1/2 teaspoon of strawberry or raspberry preserves or chocolate chips, and bake as directed.

A chilled chocolate ganache may be used in place of the preserves to fill the indentations in these cookies.  To do this, do not fill the indentations before baking the cookies.  While the cookies bake, make the ganache by mixing equal parts of warm cream and chocolate until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth, then chill the ganache.  Once the cookies have baked and cooled, and the chocolate ganache is cold and firm but still spreadable, spoon or pipe the chilled ganache into the empty indentations on the cookies.

                Italian Caesar Salad With Polenta Croutons

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DRESSING ===
  3                     garlic cloves
  4                     anchovy fillets -- chopped
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === POLENTA CROUTONS ===
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  2               cups  Basic Polenta -- (see recipe)
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep frying
                        === SALAD ===
  3              small  romaine lettuce heads - (or 2 large) -- halved lengthwise
     1/2           cup  drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes -- cut thin strips
     1/2           cup  pine nuts -- toasted
  1 1/2         ounces  shaved Parmesan

To make the Dressing:  Finely chop the garlic and anchovies in a food processor.  Blend in the lemon juice and mustard.  With the machine running, gradually blend in the oil.  Season the dressing, to taste, with salt and pepper.

To make the Croutons:  Spread the olive oil over a small baking sheet.  Transfer the hot polenta to the baking sheet, spreading evenly to form an 8- by 5- by 3/4-inch-thick rectangle.  Cover and refrigerate until cold and firm, about 2 hours.

Cut the polenta into 3/4-inch cubes.  Pat the polenta cubes dry with paper towels.  Add enough vegetable oil to a heavy large frying pan to come 1-inch up the sides of the pan.  Heat the oil over high heat.  Working in batches of 10, carefully add the polenta cubes to the oil 1 at a time and fry until golden brown, stirring to keep the cubes separate, about 2 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the polenta croutons to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.

(The dressing and polenta croutons can be prepared 1 day ahead up to this point.  Cover the dressing and polenta croutons separately and refrigerate.  Rewarm the polenta croutons on a baking sheet in a 350 degrees oven before serving.)

To make the Salad:  Prepare the barbecue for high heat.  Grill the lettuce until lightly charred, about 2 minutes per side.  Cut the lettuce into bite-size pieces.

On a serving platter, mound the grilled chopped lettuce.  Decoratively scatter the sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts.  Drizzle with enough dressing to evenly coat.  Sprinkle Parmesan and scatter the warm polenta croutons over and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Heat the oil over high heat.  Working in batches of 10, carefully add the polenta cubes to the oil 1 at a time and fry until golden brown, stirring to keep the cubes separate, about 2 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the polenta croutons to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
</DirT>
<DirT>
(The dressing and polenta croutons can be prepared 1 day ahead up to this point.  Cover the dressing and polenta croutons separately and refrigerate.  Rewarm the polenta croutons on a baking sheet in a 350 degrees oven before serving.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the Salad:  Prepare the barbecue for high heat.  Grill the lettuce until lightly charred, about 2 minutes per side.  Cut the lettuce into bite-size pieces.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On a serving platter, mound the grilled chopped lettuce.  Decoratively scatter the sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts.  Drizzle with enough dressing to evenly coat.  Sprinkle Parmesan and scatter the warm polenta croutons over and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MEATBALLS ===
  1              small  onion -- grated
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic

  1              slice  fresh white bread -- crust trimmed,
                        bread torn into small pieces
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
  8             ounces  ground beef
  8             ounces  ground pork
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SOUP ===
  12              cups  low-sodium chicken broth
  1              pound  curly endive -- coarsely chopped
                        = (1 lb escarole would be a good
                        substitution)
  2              large  eggs
  2         tablespoon  freshly-grated Parmesan -- plus
                        extra for garnish
                        Salt -- to taste

To make the meatballs:  Stir the first 6 ingredients in a large bowl to blend.  Stir in the cheese, beef and pork.  Using 1 1/2 teaspoons for each, shape the meat mixture into 1-inch-diameter meatballs.  Place on a baking sheet.

To make the soup:  Bring the broth to a boil in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Add the meatballs and curly endive and simmer until the meatballs are cooked through and the curly endive is tender, about 8 minutes.

Whisk the eggs and cheese in a medium bowl to blend.  Stir the soup in a circular motion.  Gradually drizzle the egg mixture into the moving broth, stirring gently with a fork to form thin stands of egg, about 1 minute.  Season the soup to taste with salt and pepper.

Ladle the soup into bowls and serve.  Finish soup with parmesan cheese if desired.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  water
     3/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     2/3           cup  strained fresh lemon juice
     3/4           cup  whole milk ricotta cheese
  1              pinch  salt
  1                     lemon -- for zesting

Stir the water and 3/4 cup of sugar in a medium saucepan over high heat just until the sugar dissolves.  Whisk in the lemon juice.  Pour the lemon mixture into an 8-inch square glass dish.  Cover and freeze, stirring occasionally, until the liquid just becomes slushy, about 2 hours.

Using a fork, scrape the granita every 30 minutes until it is completely made up of ice crystals.  (The granita can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.  Cover and keep frozen, and scrape every so often so that the crystals stay loose.)

Whisk the ricotta, remaining sugar, and pinch of salt in a medium bowl to blend.  Spoon the granita into dessert bowls.  Top with a dollop of the ricotta.  Zest the lemon peel over the desserts and serve.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatballs
                Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MEATBALLS ===
  1              small  onion -- grated
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  1              large  egg
  3        tablespoons  ketchup
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     2/3           cup  grated Parmesan
     1/4           cup  dried Italian-style bread crumbs
  6             ounces  ground beef
  6             ounces  ground veal
  6             ounces  ground pork
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Marinara Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        = (or 26-oz jar store-purchased)
                        === SANDWICHES ===
  12                    Italian rolls - (3" to 3 1/2" dia) -- split, warm
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  3             ounces  sliced provolone

To make the Meatballs:  Whisk the first 7 ingredients in a large bowl to blend.  Stir in the cheese and bread crumbs.  Mix in the beef, veal, and pork.  Using about 2 tablespoons of meat for each, shape the meat mixture into 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch-diameter meatballs.  Place on a baking sheet.

Heat the oil in heavy large frying pan over medium-high heat.  Working in 2 to 3 batches, add the meatballs and saute until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meatballs to a plate.  Pour off any excess oil.  Return all the meatballs to the pan.  Add the Marinara Sauce.  Simmer over medium-low until the sauce thickens slightly and the flavors blend, about 10 minutes.  Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper.  (The meatball mixture can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool, then cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm over medium heat before continuing.)

To make the Sandwiches:  Spoon the hot meatballs with some sauce over the bottoms of the rolls.  Place 1/2 slice provolone on top of meatballs and sprinkle with the Parmesan.  Spread more sauce over the roll tops, then fold the tops of the rolls over and serve.

This recipe yields 12 sandwiches.

Cook's Note:  The sandwiches can be assembled then wrapped individually in foil.  Rewarm the sandwiches in the oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dry red wine
  1                cup  water
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2              whole  star anise
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  1                     basket fresh strawberries - (12 oz) -- hulled, sliced
  1                     basket fresh raspberries - (6 oz)
  1                     basket fresh blueberries - (4.4 oz)
  1               pint  vanilla bean gelato or ice cream

Combine the wine, water, sugar, star anise, and cinnamon sticks in a heavy large saucepan.  Add all but 1/2 cup of each of the berries.  Bring the liquids to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer gently until the fruit is very tender, about 10 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Discard the star anise and cinnamon sticks.

Transfer the berry mixture to a blender and puree until smooth.  Strain the soup through a fine mesh strainer and into a medium bowl.  Cover and refrigerate until very cold, stirring occasionally, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day ahead.

Cut the reserved strawberries into small pieces.  Place a small scoop of vanilla bean gelato or ice cream in the center of 8 decorative dessert glasses or soup bowls.  Divide the mixed berry soup among the glasses, being careful to pour around the gelato.  Sprinkle the reserved berries over the soup and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
  8             ounces  white button mushrooms -- quartered
     1/2           cup  walnuts -- toasted
  2                     garlic cloves
  1 1/2           cups  fresh Italian parsley leaves
     3/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  36            slices  baguette bread, 1/2" thick

Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl of hot water; press to submerge.  Let stand until the mushrooms are tender, about 15 minutes.  Scoop out mushrooms, being carefully not to stir any dirt that may have sunk to the bottom of the water.  Discard mushroom water.

Combine the porcini mushrooms, button mushrooms, walnuts, garlic, and parsley in a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped.  With the machine running, gradually add 1/2 cup of the oil, blending just until the mushrooms are finely chopped.

Transfer the mushroom mixture to a medium bowl.  Stir in the Parmesan.  Season the pesto with salt and pepper, to taste.  If not using mushroom pesto right away, cover tightly with plastic wrap to prevent possible discoloration of mushrooms.

Preheat a grill pan to medium-high heat.  Arrange the bread slices on pan, cut-side down.  Brush the remaining 1/4 cup of oil over the bread slices.  Cook until pale golden and crisp, about 5 minutes.

Alternatively, you can toast the bread in the oven.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Arrange the bread slices on 2 heavy large baking sheet.  Brush the remaining 1/4 cup of oil over the bread slices.  Bake until pale golden and crisp, about 15 minutes.

Spread the mushroom pesto over the crostini.  Arrange the crostini on a platter and serve.

This recipe yields 3 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  whole milk
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  amaretto liqueur
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
                        === BREAD PUDDING ===
  1                     loaf panettone bread - (16 oz) -- crusts trimmed,
                        bread cut into 1" cubes
  8              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  2 1/2           cups  whole milk
  1 1/4           cups  sugar

To make the Sauce:  Bring the cream, milk, and sugar to a boil in a heavy small saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently.  In a small bowl, mix the amaretto and cornstarch to blend and then whisk into the cream mixture.  Simmer over medium-low heat until the sauce thickens, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes.  Set aside and keep warm.  (The amaretto sauce can be made 3 days ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm before serving.)

To make the Bread Pudding:  Lightly butter a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish.  Arrange the bread cubes in the prepared dish.  In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, cream, milk, and sugar to blend.  Pour the custard over the bread cubes, and press the bread cubes gently to submerge.  Let stand for 30 minutes, occasionally pressing the bread cubes into the custard mixture.  (Recipe can be prepared up to this point 2 hours ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Bake until the pudding puffs and is set in the center, about 45 minutes.  Cool slightly.  Spoon the bread pudding into bowls, drizzle with the warm amaretto sauce, and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CINNAMON SYRUP ===
  1                cup  water
  1                cup  packed dark brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        === FRENCH TOAST ===
  1                     loaf panettone bread - (1.1 lbs) -- baking paper removed
  6              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
     3/4           cup  whole milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  mascarpone cheese
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting

To make the Syrup:  Combine 1 cup of water and brown sugar in a heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.  Boil until the syrup reduces to 1 cup, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the cream and cinnamon.  Keep the syrup warm.  (The syrup can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool, then cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm before serving.)

Meanwhile, prepare the French Toast:  Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Trim the bottom crust of the panettone.  Starting at the bottom end of the panettone, cut it crosswise into 6 (3/4-inch thick) round slices (reserve the top piece for toast!).

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until well blended.  Add the cream, milk, and sugar and whisk until well mixed.

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter on a large nonstick griddle over medium heat.  Dip 3 slices of panettone into the custard, turning to allow both sides to absorb the custard.  Grill the soaked panettone slices until they are golden brown and firm to the touch, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer the French toast to a baking sheet and keep them warm in the oven.  Repeat with the remaining butter, panettone slices, and custard.

Transfer the French toast to plates.  Dollop the mascarpone atop each.  Lightly dust with the powdered sugar.  Drizzle the cinnamon syrup over and around the French toast and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1              large  fresh rosemary sprig
  1                     bay leaf
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                cup  chopped onion
  3             ounces  pancetta -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  5 3/4           cups  low-sodium chicken broth
  2               cans  red kidney beans - (14 1/2 oz ea) -- drained, rinsed
     3/4           cup  elbow macaroni
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes -- (optional)
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil

Wrap the thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf in a piece of cheesecloth and secure closed with kitchen twine.  Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onion, pancetta, and garlic and saute until the onion is tender, about 3 minutes.  Add the broth, beans, and sachet of herbs.  Cover and bring to a boil over high heat, then decrease the heat to medium and simmer until the vegetables are very tender, about 10 minutes.  Discard the sachet.  Puree 1 cup of the bean mixture in a blender until smooth*.  Before putting the puree back into the soup, add the macaroni and boil with the lid on until it is tender but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.  Return the puree to the remaining soup in the saucepan and stir well.  Season the soup with ground black pepper and red pepper flakes.

Ladle the soup into bowls.  Sprinkle with some Parmesan and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil just before serving.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

* When blending hot liquids:  Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes.  Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway.  If using a blender, release one corner of the lid.  This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions.  Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  8             ounces  hot Italian sausage -- casings removed
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  2            bunches  fresh spinach - (12 oz ea) -- stemmed, and
                        coarsely chopped - (about 12 cups)
  1                     container whole milk ricotta - (15 oz)
  12            ounces  mozzarella cheese -- shredded
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan -- plus
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan
  4             ounces  thinly-sliced prosciutto -- coarsely chopped
  4              large  egg yolks -- beaten to blend
                        Pastry Dough -- (listed below)
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
                        === PASTRY DOUGH ===
  3 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  cold unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut into pieces
     1/4           cup  cold solid vegetable shortening -- cut into pieces
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3              large  eggs -- beaten to blend
  2        tablespoons  ice water - (to 4)

Position the rack on the bottom of the oven, and preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy large frying pan over medium heat.  Add the sausages and saute until golden brown, breaking the sausage into pieces, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Transfer the mixture to a small bowl and set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan over medium heat.  Add the spinach and cook until the spinach wilts and the juices evaporate, stirring often, about 10 minutes.  Cool to room temperature.  Squeeze the spinach to drain as much liquid as possible.

Into a large bowl, add egg yolks and beat lightly.  Stir in the ricotta, mozzarella, and 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese.  Add the sausage, the spinach and prosciutto to the mixture and stir to combine.

Roll out larger piece of dough on a lightly floured work surface to a 17-inch round.  Transfer the dough to a 9-inch springform pan.  Trim the dough overhang to 1 inch.  Spoon the ricotta mixture into the dough-lined pan.  Roll out the remaining piece of dough into a 12-inch round.  Place the dough over the filling.  Pinch the edges of the doughs together to seal, then crimp the dough edges decoratively.  Brush the beaten 1 large egg over the entire pastry top.  Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan over the top.  Bake on the bottom shelf until the crust is golden brown, about 1 hour.

Let stand 15 minutes.  Release the pan sides and transfer the pizza to a platter.  Cut into wedges and serve.

Pastry Dough:  Blend the flour, the butter, the shortening and salt in a food processor until the mixture resembles coarse meal.  Blend in the eggs.  With the machine running, add the water 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough forms.  Gather the dough into a ball.  Divide the dough into 2 pieces, with 1 piece twice as large as the second piece.  Flatten the dough pieces into disks.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until the dough is firm enough to roll out, about 30 minutes.  (Makes 2 dough pieces; enough for 1 Pizza Rustica)

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  yellow cornmeal
  2             pieces  homemade Pizza Dough - (8 oz ea) -- (listed below)
                        = (or purchased pizza dough)
  6          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/3           cups  grated pasteurized mozzarella
  2                     Roma tomatoes -- cut crosswise
                        into 1/4"-thick slices
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
  1              large  garlic clove -- (optional), minced
  6                     fresh basil leaves -- plus
                        extra for garnish
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === PIZZA DOUGH ===
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (105 to 110 degrees)
  2          teaspoons  dry yeast
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  olive oil

Position 1 oven rack in the center and the second rack on the bottom of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Sprinkle the cornmeal over 2 rimless baking sheets.  Roll out each piece of pizza dough into a 10- to 11-inch-diameter round.  Transfer 1 dough to each prepared baking sheet.

Drizzle 2 teaspoons of oil over each pizza dough.  Sprinkle the mozzarella over the pizza dough, dividing equaling and leaving a 1-inch border around each pizza.  Arrange the tomato slices in a single layer over the cheese.  Sprinkle with the Parmesan.  Arrange basil leaves on top, drizzle with a little more olive oil and sprinkle garlic all over.  Bake the pizzas until the crusts are crisp and brown on the bottom and the cheese is melted on top, about 15 minutes.  Drizzle 1 teaspoon of oil over each pizza.  Sprinkle with basil for garnish and salt.  Cut the pizza into wedges and serve immediately.

Pizza Dough:  Mix the warm water and yeast in a small bowl to blend.  Let stand until the yeast dissolves, about 5 minutes.  Mix the flour and salt in a food processor to blend.  Blend in the oil.  With the machine running, add the yeast mixture and blend just until the dough forms.  Turn the dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 1 minute.

Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl and turn the dough to coat with the oil.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm draft-free area until the dough doubles in volume, about 1 hour.  Punch the down dough and divide into 2 equal balls.  (The dough can be used immediately or stored airtight in the refrigerator for 1 day.)  Makes 2 (8-ounce) balls of pizza dough)

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  yellow cornmeal
  2             pieces  homemade Pizza Dough - (8 oz ea) -- (listed below)
                        = (or purchased pizza dough)
     3/4           cup  homemade Marinara Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        = (or purchased marinara sauce)
  1 1/3           cups  grated pasteurized mozzarella
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan
  4                     canned pineapple slices -- coarsely chopped
  4                     thin slices cooked ham -- coarsely chopped
                        === PIZZA DOUGH ===
     1/2           cup  warm water -- (105 to 110 degrees)
  2          teaspoons  dry yeast
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  olive oil

Position 1 oven rack in the center and the second rack on the bottom of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Sprinkle the cornmeal over 2 rimless baking sheets.  Roll out each piece of pizza dough into a 10- to 11-inch round.  Transfer 1 dough to each prepared baking sheet.

Spoon the marinara sauce over the dough, dividing equaling and leaving a 1-inch border around each pizza.  Sprinkle the cheeses over the sauce.  Arrange the pineapple pieces in a single layer over the cheeses.  Sprinkle with the ham.  Bake the pizzas until the crusts are crisp and brown on the bottom and the cheese is melted on top, about 12 minutes.  Cut the pizza into wedges and serve immediately.

Pizza Dough:  Mix the warm water and yeast in a small bowl to blend.  Let stand until the yeast dissolves, about 5 minutes.  Mix the flour and salt in a food processor to blend.  Blend in the oil.  With the machine running, add the yeast mixture and blend just until the dough forms.  Turn the dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 1 minute.

Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl and turn the dough to coat with the oil.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm draft-free area until the dough doubles in volume, about 1 hour.  Punch the down dough and divide into 2 equal balls.  (The dough can be used immediately or stored airtight in the refrigerator for 1 day.)  Makes 2 (8-ounce) balls of pizza dough)

This recipe yields 4 to 8 servings.

                      Pizzelle Ice Cream Sandwiches

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PIZZELLES ===
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2              large  egg whites
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4        tablespoons  butter -- melted
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
                        === ICE CREAM SANDWICHES ===
     3/4           cup  chocolate-hazelnut spread
                        = (such as Nutella)
  1               pint  good-quality ice cream or gelato
                        = (such as espresso, vanilla, chocolate)
                        Powdered sugar -- for dusting

To make the Pizzelles:  Preheat the pizzelle iron to medium-high heat.  Whisk the sugar, egg whites, vanilla, and salt in a large bowl to blend.  Whisk in 2 tablespoons of butter.  Add the flour and whisk just until blended.

Brush the pizzelle cooking surfaces with some of the remaining melted butter.  Spoon 1 tablespoon of batter in the center of the pizzelle iron.  Close the iron and cook until deep golden, about 3 minutes.  Transfer the pizzelles to a cooling rack.  Cool completely.  Trim off any excess pizzelle along the edges.  Store the pizzelles airtight at room temperature.

To make the Ice Cream Sandwiches:  Gently spread the chocolate-hazelnut spread over 1 side of 12 pizzelles.  Cut the ice cream carton to remove the ice cream from the carton in one piece.  Starting at the widest end of the piece of ice cream, cut the ice cream crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds.  Place 1 slice of ice cream atop each coated pizzelle.  (Alternately, the ice cream can be scooped atop the pizzelle.)  Top each with a second pizzelle, pressing gently to adhere.  Arrange the sandwiches on a baking sheet and freeze until firm.  (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store airtight and keep frozen,)

Dust the ice cream sandwiches with powdered sugar and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Cook's Note:  If the ice cream sandwiches are eaten immediately, the pizzelles will be crisp.  However, if the sandwiches freeze overnight, the pizzelles will soften just enough to allow the sandwiches to be cut into wedges, if desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
                        = (2 to 3 lemons, depending on size)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1              whole  frying chicken - (abt 3 1/2 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  olive oil -- (approximate amount)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour -- (approximate amount)
                        Lemon wedges -- for garnish
  6             sprigs  fresh Italian parsley -- for garnish

In a large casserole dish, whisk the lemon juice, extra-virgin olive oil, and salt to blend.  Add the chicken pieces and turn to coat.  Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 1 day, turning the chicken pieces occasionally.

In a large cast-iron frying pan or other heavy frying pan, add enough oil to come 1/3-inch up the sides of the pan.  Heat the oil over medium heat.  Meanwhile, drain the marinade from the chicken.  Pat the chicken dry with paper towels.  Sprinkle with pepper.  Working in 2 batches, dredge the chicken in the flour to coat completely.  Shake off the excess flour and then carefully add the chicken to the hot oil.  Fry until the chicken is golden brown and just cooked through, turning occasionally, about 25 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a paper towel-lined plate to drain the excess oil.

Arrange the fried chicken on a warm platter and serve with the lemon wedges and parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  large shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1           teaspoon  salt -- plus
                        additional as needed
  1           teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper flakes
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
  1                     teapoon olive oil - (to 2)
  1             medium  onion -- sliced
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 1/2 oz)
  1                cup  dry white wine

Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     boneless beef chuck roast - (abt 4 lbs)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     onions -- sliced
  6                     garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
  1                cup  dry red wine
  1 3/4           cups  canned beef broth
     1/2         ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
  1              large  fresh rosemary sprig -- plus
                        extra for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Pat the beef dry with paper towels.  Sprinkle the beef generously with salt and pepper.  Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy 6-quart roasting pan over medium-high heat.  Add the beef and cook until brown on all sides, about 15 minutes total cooking time.  Transfer the beef to a bowl.

Add remaining tablespoon oil to the pan, add the onions and saute until tender, scraping up the brown bits on the bottom of the pot, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and saute 1 minute.  Add the wine and boil 1 minute.  Stir in the broth and mushrooms.  Return the beef to the pan.  Bring the liquids to a boil.  Cover and transfer to the oven.  Braise until the beef is fork-tender, turning the beef over halfway through cooking, about 3 hours.

Transfer the beef to a cutting board.  Tent the beef with foil and let stand 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, spoon any excess fat off the top of the pan juices.  Transfer the pan juices and vegetables to a blender and puree until smooth.  Combine the sauce and rosemary sprig in heavy medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Cut the beef across the grain into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Arrange the sliced beef on a platter and garnish with rosemary.  Spoon the sauce over and serve, passing the remaining sauce in a sauce boat.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

                   Stuffed Shells With Arrabbiata Sauce

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     box jumbo pasta shells - (12 oz)
                        = (approximately 36 shells)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
                        extra for greasing baking sheet
  6             ounces  thinly-sliced pancetta -- diced
  2          teaspoons  dried crushed red pepper flakes
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  5               cups  marinara sauce
  2                     containers whole milk ricotta cheese - (15
  1 1/3           cups  grated Parmesan
  4              large  egg yolks
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
  3         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil leaves
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh mint leaves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  shredded mozzarella cheese

Lightly oil a 12- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish and set aside.  Lightly oil the baking sheet and set aside.

Partially cook the pasta shells in a large pot of boiling salted water until slightly tender but still quite firm to the bite, about 4 to 6 minutes.  You will continue cooking the shells in the oven after they have been stuffed.  Using a slotted spoon, drain pasta shells and place on oiled baking sheet, spreading them out so that they don't stick together and allow to cool.

Heat the oil in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the pancetta and saute until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Add the red pepper flakes.  Add the garlic and saute until tender, about 1 minute.  Add the marinara sauce.  Bring the sauce to a simmer, stirring often.

In a medium bowl, stir the ricotta, Parmesan, egg yolks, basil, parsley, mint, salt, and pepper.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spoon 1 1/4 cups of the sauce over the prepared baking dish.  Fill the cooked shells with the cheese mixture, about 2 tablespoons per shell.  Arrange the shells in the prepared dish.  Spoon the remaining sauce over the shells, then sprinkle with the mozzarella.

Bake in the lower third of your oven until the filling is heated through and the top is golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4                     anchovy fillets -- minced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  orange juice
  2         tablespoon  thinly-sliced fresh basil leaves
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  orange zest
  6                     skinless tilapia fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Cook the butter and 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil in a heavy medium saucepan over low to medium heat just until the butter is melted, stirring frequently.  Add the anchovies and stir until the anchovies dissolve, about 2 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in the orange juice, basil, and lemon and orange zests.  Season the sauce, to taste, with salt.

The bagna cauda sauce can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool, then cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm before using.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 200 degrees.

Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper and brush both sides of the fish with remaining 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil.  Working in 2 batches, fry the fish until just opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer fish to platter.  Cover with foil and keep warm in the oven while cooking the second batch of fish.  Drizzle the sauce over and around the fish and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Giada De Laurentiis
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  spaghetti
     1/2           cup  oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes -- drained, chopped
  4              large  eggs
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  grated Parmesan
     3/4           cup  grated fontina
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.  Drain.  Toss with the sun-dried tomatoes.  Set aside to cool completely otherwise the hot pasta could curdle the eggs when you add them later on.

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, salt, and pepper, Parmesan, and fontina to blend.  Add the cooled spaghetti mixture; toss to coat.

Preheat the broiler.  Melt the butter and oil in a 9 1/2-inch-diameter nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Transfer the spaghetti mixture to the skillet, pressing to form an even layer.  Cook until the bottom is golden brown, about 3 minutes.  Transfer the skillet to the broiler.  Broil until the top is golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Cool in the skillet to room temperature.

Invert the torta onto a platter.  Cut into wedges and serve at room temperature.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pieces  baguette bread, 6" long -- halved horizontally
     1/3           cup  pitted green olives
     1/4           cup  pitted kalamata olives
  1         tablespoon  drained capers
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  fresh Italian parsley leaves
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
  1                     anchovy -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     tuna steak - (12 to 14 oz)
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
     1/2           cup  purchased roasted bell peppers -- drained, and
                        sliced into 1/2"-wide strips
  4                     thin slices red onion
  4                     romaine lettuce leaves

Prepare the barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill the baguette pieces, cut-side down, until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes.  Remove and set aside.

Combine the olives, capers, 1 tablespoon of oil, lemon juice, parsley, lemon zest, and anchovy in a food processor.  Pulse just until the olives are finely chopped.  Season the tapenade with salt and pepper.

Drizzle the tuna with the remaining oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Grill the tuna until golden and seared on the outside, and just opaque in the center, about 2 minutes per side.

Stir the mayonnaise and mustard in a small bowl to blend.  (The tapenade and Dijon-mayonnaise can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover separately and refrigerate.  Bring the tapenade to room temperature before using.)

Spread the Dijon-mayonnaise over the bottom and top halves of the baguette pieces.  Top with red peppers and red onion.  Cut the tuna steaks across the grain into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Arrange the tuna slices atop the onions.  Spoon the tapenade over the tuna.  Top with the lettuce then the baguette tops, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                Turkey With Herbes De Provence And Citrus

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     turkey - (14 to 15 lbs) -- neck and
                        giblets reserved
  1                     orange -- cut into wedges
  1                     lemon -- cut into wedges
  1                     onion -- cut into wedges
  6                     fresh rosemary sprigs
  6                     fresh sage sprigs
  6                     fresh oregano sprigs
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  herbes de Provence
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  6               cups  canned low-salt chicken broth -- (approximate amount)
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour

To make the turkey:  Position the rack in the lowest third of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.

Rinse the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels.  Place the turkey on a rack set inside a large roasting pan.  Place the orange and lemon wedges, onion, and 2 sprigs of each fresh herb in the main turkey cavity.  Tie the legs together to hold the shape of the turkey.  Stir 2 tablespoons of butter, the herbes de Provence, oil, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of each the salt and pepper in a small saucepan over medium heat just until the butter melts.  Rub the butter mixture all over the turkey and between the turkey breast meat and skin.  Place the turkey neck and giblets in roasting pan.  (Recipe can be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before roasting.)

Cover the turkey breast with foil.  Roast for 20 minutes.  Pour 3 cups of broth into the pan and stir to scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan.  Add the remaining sprigs of fresh herbs to the pan.  Roast the turkey for 40 minutes.  Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Remove the foil from the turkey; pour 1 more cup of broth into the pan.  Continue roasting the turkey until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 to 175 degrees or until the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pierced with a skewer, basting occasionally with pan juices, about 1 hour and 30 minutes longer.  Transfer the turkey to a platter and tent with foil.  Let stand 30 minutes while preparing the gravy.

To make the gravy:  Strain the turkey pan juices from the roasting pan through a sieve and into a 4-cup glass measuring cup; discard the solids.  Spoon off the fat from atop the pan juices.  Add enough chicken broth, about 1 to 2 cups, to the pan juices to measure 4 cups total.  Melt the remaining butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the flour and whisk for 1 minute.  Gradually whisk in the broth.  Simmer until the gravy thickens slightly, whisking often, about 10 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Serve the turkey with the gravy.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  8                     veal cutlets - (abt 3 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (to 3)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil - (to 4)
  1              large  shallot -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- smashed
  2             ounces  assorted mushrooms -- sliced
     1/2           cup  sweet Marsala

Return the veal to the skillet.  Pour in all of the pan juices.  Cook just until heated through, turning to coat, about 1 minute.  Stir the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter into the sauce.  Season the sauce with salt and pepper, to taste.

Using tongs, transfer the veal to plates.  Spoon the sauce over the veal and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  eggs -- separated
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut 1/2" pieces
     1/4           cup  water
  3        tablespoons  coffee liqueur
  4          teaspoons  Chili Oil -- (see recipe)
  7             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        === Spicy Whipped Cream ===
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  granulated sugar
                        Cocoa powder
                        Ground cayenne pepper

Whisk the egg yolks, 1/4 cup of sugar, butter, 1/4 cup of water, coffee liqueur, and Chili Oil in a large metal bowl to blend.  Set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (do not allow the bottom of the bowl to touch the water); whisk constantly until the mixture is very thick and frothy, about 3 minutes.

Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites in another large bowl to soft peaks.  Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, beating until stiff and glossy peaks form.  Remove the chocolate from over the water.  Fold 1/3 of the meringue into the warm chocolate mixture to lighten, then fold in the remaining meringue.

Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours or overnight.  Spoon the mousse into 6-ounce bowls.  Top with spicy whipped cream and serve.

Spicy Whipped Cream:  With an electric mixer, whip cream gradually adding the sugar until soft peaks form.  Top with a dusting of cocoa powder and a pinch of cayenne.  Serve immediately.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell..."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Nonstick cooking spray
  1                     twelve-ounce loaf pound cake
     1/4           cup  brandy
  6             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
  2               cups  chilled whipping cream
     1/2      teaspoon  pure almond extract
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted, and
                        coarsely crumbled
                        Unsweetened cocoa powder

Spray a 1 1/2-quart bowl with nonstick cooking spray.  Line the bowl with plastic wrap.  Cut the pound cake crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices.  Cut each slice diagonally in half, forming 2 triangles.  Line the bottom and sides of the prepared bowl with the cake triangles.  Brush some of the brandy over the cake triangles lining the bowl.  Reserve the extra triangles.

Stir the chocolate in a large metal bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water until the chocolate melts.  Allow the chocolate to cool slightly.  Using an electric mixer, beat 1 cup of cream in another large bowl until it is thick and fluffy.  Fold 1/4 of the whipped cream into the chocolate.  Fold half of the remaining whipped cream into the chocolate mixture.  Fold in the remaining whipped cream.  Spread the chocolate cream over the cake, covering completely and creating a well in the center.  Cover and refrigerate if not assembling cake right away.

In another clean large bowl, add the remaining 1 cup of cream and almond extract.  Using an electric mixer with clean beaters, beat on medium speed and gradually add the powdered sugar.  Beat until firm peaks form.  Fold in the nuts.  Spoon the cream mixture into the center of the well of the filling.

Brush the remaining cake slices with brandy and arrange them, brandy-side down, over the cake, covering the filling completely and trimming to fit, if necessary.  Cover the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

Invert the cake onto a platter.  Remove the bowl and the plastic wrap.  Sift the cocoa powder over and serve.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Spray a 1 1/2-quart bowl with nonstick cooking spray.  Line the bowl with plastic wrap.  Cut the pound cake crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices.  Cut each slice diagonally in half, forming 2 triangles.  Line the bottom and sides of the prepared bowl with the cake triangles.  Brush some of the brandy over the cake triangles lining the bowl.  Reserve the extra triangles.

Stir the chocolate in a large metal bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water until the chocolate melts.  Allow the chocolate to cool slightly.  Using an electric mixer, beat 1 cup of cream in another large bowl until it is thick and fluffy.  Fold 1/4 of the whipped cream into the chocolate.  Fold half of the remaining whipped cream into the chocolate mixture.  Fold in the remaining whipped cream.  Spread the chocolate cream over the cake, covering completely and creating a well in the center.  Cover and refrigerate if not assembling cake right away.

In another clean large bowl, add the remaining 1 cup of cream and almond extract.  Using an electric mixer with clean beaters, beat on medium speed and gradually add the powdered sugar.  Beat until firm peaks form.  Fold in the nuts.  Spoon the cream mixture into the center of the well of the filling.
