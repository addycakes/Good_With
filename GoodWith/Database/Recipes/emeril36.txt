Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  bacon grease
                        = (or vegetable oil or shortening)
  2               cups  cornmeal
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  5        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  minced jalapeÒo
                        === ROASTED GARLIC ===
  3              heads  garlic
  2          teaspoons  olive oil

Preheat the oven temperature to 450 degrees.

Place the bacon grease in a 10-inch black cast-iron skillet and swirl to coat the sides and bottom evenly.  Place skillet in the oven to heat.

In a bowl, combine the cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pepper and mix well.

In another small bowl combine the buttermilk, egg, melted butter, jalapeÒos, and mashed roasted garlic.  Add to dry ingredients and stir to combine.

Remove the hot skillet from the oven and carefully swirl to evenly distribute the hot grease.  Quickly pour the cornmeal batter into the skillet and bake until firm and golden brown on top, 25 to 30 minutes.  Let sit for 5 minutes, then turn out onto a cutting board.  Cut into wedges and serve hot, with butter on the side.

For the Roasted Garlic:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment or aluminum foil.

Cut the top quarter from the heads of garlic and place, cut-side up, on the prepared baking sheet.  Drizzle each with oil and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.

Turn the garlic cut-sides down, and roast until the cloves are soft and golden brown, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.  Squeeze each head of garlic, gently pressing with your fingers to expel the cloves into a bowl.  Mash with a fork and blend thoroughly.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2          pound  beef rib-eye steak
  2        tablespoons  chopped assorted fresh herbs
                        = (such as parsley, chives, tarragon,
                        basil, and cilantro)
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  olive oil or vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3               cups  rice flour
  1                cup  cold seltzer water - (to 1 1/2)
  2 1/2      teaspoons  salt -- divided
  1 1/4      teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper -- divided
  10            ounces  arugula -- cleaned, stems
                        removed
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2              large  Vidalia onions -- peeled, and
                        sliced into 1/2" rings
                        = (or other sweet onions such as
                        Oso Sweet, Walla Walla, or Maui)
  6               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
     1/4           cup  shaved Parmesan -- as garnish
  1              pound  large round tomatoes -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar

Preheat a grill.

Season the rib eye with Essence, salt, and pepper.  Place the rib eye on the grill and cook until done.  Remove from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing into thin slices.

Combine the herbs, shallots, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl and whisk to blend.  Slowly add the olive oils in a steady stream, whisking constantly until the mixture thickens.

Combine the rice flour, seltzer water, 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper in a medium bowl, and whisk to form a smooth paste.  Combine the flour and Essence in a shallow bowl.  Toss the largest, outer onion rings in the seasoned flour, and dredge in the batter, shaking to remove any excess.  (Save the remaining, smaller onion rings for another use.)

Heat the oil in a large, deep pot or electric fryer 350 degrees.  Carefully add the onion rings to the hot oil, and cook, turning occasionally to prevent the pieces from sticking together, until golden on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Place the arugula in a large bowl, and toss with the vinaigrette and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper.  Set aside.

Place a tomato slice and 1 fried onion ring in the center of each salad plate and stuff with the dressed arugula and steak.  Garnish with the Parmesan and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  hot red pepper sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped red or yellow bell peppers
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped red onions
  2        tablespoons  minced green onions
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh dill
  1              pound  lump crabmeat -- picked over to
                        remove any cartilage
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan - (to 1/2)
                        Fresh chives -- for garnish
                        === WITH CREMINI MUSHROOM CAPS ===
  36                    cremini mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and stems removed
                        === WITH PORTOBELLO MUSHROOMS ===
  6              large  portobello mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and stems removed
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine the mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, pepper sauce, Worcestershire, salt, and cayenne.  Stir until well blended and set aside.

In a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the bell peppers, celery, and red onions, and cook, stirring, until wilted, about 2 minutes.  Add the green onions and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  When cool, add to the mayonnaise mixture with the parsley and dill, and stir until blended.  Gently fold in the crabmeat.

If using the cremini mushrooms, stuff each mushroom cap with about 1 tablespoon of the crabmeat imperial mixture.  Place on a baking sheet and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Bake until warmed through and bubbly on top, 8 to 12 minutes.

If using the portobello mushrooms, with a paring knife, cut out the gills on the underside of the mushrooms and discard.  Lightly oil both sides with olive oil and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Place on a baking sheet and bake until tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and when cool enough to handle, divide the crabmeat imperial mixture among the mushroom caps and sprinkle with the cheese.  Bake until the mixture is warmed through and bubbly on top, 12 to 14 minutes.

Remove from the oven and place on a platter.  Garnish with the fresh chives and serve.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  2        tablespoons  flour - (heaping)
  1 1/2           cups  evaporated milk
  3              large  eggs
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  30                    vanilla wafers -- crushed
                        = (abt 1 cup crumbs)
  3                     bananas - (to 4) -- sliced
                        === MERINGUE ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla

Mix sugar and flour in a saucepan.  Separate eggs.  Reserve whites for meringue.  Stir yolks with a fork until blended.  Add milk in same cup as egg yolks.  Slowly stir egg/milk mixture into sugar/flour mixture until well blended.  Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until very thick.  Remove thickened custard from heat, add butter and allow to melt.  Cool.  Add vanilla flavoring.

Divide half of the crushed wafers between 4 (8-ounce) glasses or goblets.  Top each with 5 to 6 slices banana.  Pour half of the cooled custard evenly into each glass over the bananas.  Repeat each layer with the remaining ingredients.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.

To make the Meringue:  Whisk together the reserved egg whites and sugar in a large heatproof bowl.  Set the bowl over a saucepan of gently simmering water and whisk constantly until the sugar is dissolved and whites are very hot to the touch.  Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a standing mixer.  Whip the whites until stiff, glossy peaks form and the meringue is cool.  Add the vanilla and mix well.  Spoon the meringue or pipe with a piping bag over the pudding in each glass.

Using a hand-held blowtorch, brown the meringue until golden.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  bread flour
  1 1/2           cups  Basic Sourdough Starter -- (see recipe)
     3/4      teaspoon  salt

In an electric mixer with the dough hook, combine the flour, starter and salt, and knead until it no longer sticks to the sides or bottom of the mixing bowl.

Place a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface.  Sprinkle lightly with flour and knead gently, removing any large air bubbles.  Knead into a small circle, then shape into a tight ball, pinching the seams together underneath.  Place on a well-floured board or baking peel, seam-side down.  Cover with a kitchen towels and let rest until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Preheat a baking stone, if available, on the bottom rack of an oven at 400 degrees.  With a sharp, serrated knife, cut a large "X" or cross-hatch pattern into the top of the dough.

Spray lightly with a mister and transfer to the baking stone (or place on a heavy baking sheet lightly dusted with cornmeal) and bake until golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom, about 60 minutes.  (Sourdough should have a darker crust than other breads, so leave in the oven 5 minutes after you think it is done.)

Remove the loaf from the oven and let cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before serving.

This recipe yields 1 loaf.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Condiments

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  warm water -- (110 degrees)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  3               cups  all-purpose flour

In a large bowl, combine the water, yeast, and sugar.  Let sit until the yeast becomes foamy, about 5 minutes.  (If the yeast does not foam, discard the mixture and begin again with a new yeast.)

Add the flour and stir vigorously to work air into the mixture.  Cover with a towel let rest in a warm, draft-free place (an oven with its pilot light or light bulb turned on works well) for 8 to 12 hours.  (The mixture should become very bubbly.)  Use immediately or cover loosely with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator.

Preserving the Starter:  Each time you remove a portion of the starter for a recipe, reserve at least 1/4 cup and replace the amount you have taken out with equal amounts of flour and water.

For example, if you remove 1 cup of starter, you must replace it with 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of warm water.  Whisk these ingredients into the starter until blended but not completely smooth, cover loosely, and return to the refrigerator.

Also, the starter must be maintained by feeding it every few days.  Refresh by removing 1 cup of the starter (give to a friend or discard it) and adding 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of warm water.  Whisk until blended but not smooth.  Cover loosely and return to the refrigerator.

If you plan to be away longer than a week, freeze the starter in a sterilized, airtight freezer container.  Thaw the starter 2 days before you plan to bake with it.  Refresh as indicated above with 1 cup each of flour and warm water.  Cover and leave at room temperature 12 hours or overnight before using.

This recipe yields 5 to 6 cups.

CAUTION:  Never keep your starter tightly closed!  The gasses expelled by the yeast will build up pressure and may cause the container (such as a glass jar) to burst!

In a large bowl, combine the water, yeast, and sugar.  Let sit until the yeast becomes foamy, about 5 minutes.  (If the yeast does not foam, discard the mixture and begin again with a new yeast.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add the flour and stir vigorously to work air into the mixture.  Cover with a towel let rest in a warm, draft-free place (an oven with its pilot light or light bulb turned on works well) for 8 to 12 hours.  (The mixture should become very bubbly.)  Use immediately or cover loosely with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preserving the Starter:  Each time you remove a portion of the starter for a recipe, reserve at least 1/4 cup and replace the amount you have taken out with equal amounts of flour and water.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For example, if you remove 1 cup of starter, you must replace it with 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of warm water.  Whisk these ingredients into the starter until blended but not completely smooth, cover loosely, and return to the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Also, the starter must be maintained by feeding it every few days.  Refresh by removing 1 cup of the starter (give to a friend or discard it) and adding 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of warm water.  Whisk until blended but not smooth.  Cover loosely and return to the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you plan to be away longer than a week, freeze the starter in a sterilized, airtight freezer container.  Thaw the starter 2 days before you plan to bake with it.  Refresh as indicated above with 1 cup each of flour and warm water.  Cover and leave at room temperature 12 hours or overnight before using.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 5 to 6 cups.
</DirT>
<DirT>
CAUTION:  Never keep your starter tightly closed!  The gasses expelled by the yeast will build up pressure and may cause the container (such as a glass jar) to burst!

     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2                     bay leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1                cup  roughly-chopped seeded plum tomatoes
  8             ounces  button mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        and quartered
  2               cups  dry red wine
  3               cups  reduced beef or chicken stock
  1              pound  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  1                cup  green peas
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
                        Fresh chives -- garnish
                        Chopped chives -- garnish
                        === CHEESY FRIED GRITS ===
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  5               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  old fashioned grits
  1                cup  grated white cheddar
  3        tablespoons  chopped green onions (scallions)
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  Essence
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  whole milk
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil - (to 1) -- for pan frying

Place the meat in a dish and season with 2 teaspoons of the Essence.  Combine the flour with the remaining teaspoon of Essence.  Dredge the meat in the flour to lightly coat, shaking to remove any excess.

In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the meat in batches and cook, stirring until evenly browned.  As the meat browns, remove to a plate.  Add the onions, carrots, and turnip, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the tomato paste and cook until brown, about 2 minutes.  Add the bay leaves, thyme, and tomatoes, and cook for 1 minute.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.

Add the wine and stir to deglaze the pan.  Add the stock and potatoes and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the meat is very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Add the peas to the stew during the last 5 minutes of cooking time.  Remove from the heat and discard the bay leaves and thyme stems.  Add the parsley and stir to combine.

Arrange the fried grit squares in shallow bowls and ladle the stew over the grits.  Garnish with chopped chives and fresh chive stems.

For the Cheesy Fried Grits:  Grease an 8- by 8-inch baking sheet with the butter and set aside.

In a large, heavy saucepan, bring the water to a boil.  Slowly add the grits, salt and pepper, whisking constantly.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until thickened, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat, add the cheese, green onions, and garlic, and adjust the seasoning to taste.

Turn out the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet and using an offset cake spreader or rubber spatula, spread evenly across the bottom.  Refrigerate until completely cooled and firm, at least 1 hour.  Cut the grits into squares and refrigerate until ready to work.

In a large, heavy skillet or saute pan, heat 1/2 cup of the oil to 350 degrees.

Combine the flour and Essence in a shallow dish.  Combine the eggs and milk in another shallow dish, whisking to combine.

Dredge the squares in the seasoned flour, dip into the egg wash, and then back into the flour, 1 at a time.  Fry in batches, turning, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, adding more oil as necessary.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Season fried grits lightly with Essence.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  apple cider
  1                cup  packed brown sugar
  1                cup  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  black peppercorns
  1           teaspoon  juniper berries
  2                     bay leaves
  1                     cinnamon stick
     1/2      teaspoon  whole cloves
  8               cups  dark beer
  1                     roasting chicken - (4 to 5 lbs) -- well rinsed and
                        patted dry, giblets reserved and chopped
  1 1/2           cups  diced yellow onions
     3/4           cup  diced celery
     3/4           cup  diced carrots
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, smashed
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  4          teaspoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
                        = (or chicken broth)
  1           teaspoon  chopped sage
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley

Combine the apple cider, brown sugar, salt, peppercorns, juniper berries, bay leaves, cinnamon, and cloves in a large pot or bowl.  Stir to dissolve the sugar and salt.

Combine the mixture with the beer in a plastic container.  Place the chicken in the brine and, if necessary, weigh down with a heavy dinner plate to completely submerge.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Spread the onions, celery, carrots, garlic, and chicken neck in the bottom of a roasting pan.  Remove the chicken from the brine and rinse well under cold running water.  Pat dry with paper towels and place on top of the vegetables in the roasting pan.

In a small saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons butter and Essence over medium heat.  Remove from the heat.  With a pastry brush, baste the top and sides of the chicken with half of the butter.  Place in the oven and roast breast-side up for 30 minutes.

Remove from the oven, turn breast-side down, and baste with the remaining seasoned butter.  Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees and roast for 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven, place breast-side up, and roast until golden and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and transfer to a platter or cutting board.  Tent with foil and let rest while making the sauce.

In a medium, heavy pot, melt the remaining tablespoon of butter and heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add the reserved giblets and cook, stirring, until brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add half of the vegetables from the roasting pan and cook, stirring, for 4 minutes.  Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.  Add the white wine and cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan.  Add the chicken stock and any juices accumulated in the roasting pan, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, add the sage, and cook at a heavy simmer until reduced by 50 percent in volume, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

With a hand-held immersion blender or in batches in a food processor, process to a thick liquid.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean bowl, pressing against the solids with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.

To serve, carve the chicken and serve with the gravy, garnished with parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  hot red pepper sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  small-diced seeded tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  small capers -- drained
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1              pound  lump crabmeat -- picked over for

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2                     T-bone steaks - (48 oz ea)
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- softened
  2          teaspoons  chopped chipotle chiles in abodo sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  adobo sauce - (to 1)
  1           teaspoon  fresh lime juice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        === TEXAS TOAST ===
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  Essence
  4                     thick slices bread
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

Combine the oil and Essence seasoning in a small bowl and mix well.

Spread both sides of the steaks completely with the mixture.  Place in a shallow dish, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.  Remove from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before grilling, about 30 minutes.

In a bowl, mix together the butter, chilis, adobo sauce, to taste, lime juice, coriander, and salt until smooth.  Transfer to a sheet of plastic wrap and roll up into a log.  Refrigerate until firm. Preheat the grill.

Remove the chipotle butter from the refrigerator and cut into 4 thick slices.  Set aside.  Place the steaks on the hot grill and cook for 5 minutes on each side.  Move to the cooler part of the grill, close the grill lid, and cook to desired temperature, 8 to 10 minutes additional time for medium-rare.

Place 2 slices of the butter on the top of each steak and leave on the grill until starting to melt, about 30 seconds.  Remove from the grill and place the steaks on platters.  Serve immediately with Texas Toast.

For the Texas Toast:  Preheat the grill.

In a small bowl, mix the butter, garlic, and Essence until smooth.  Place the toast on the grill and cook until lightly colored on 1 side.

Remove and spread 1 tablespoon of the seasoned butter on the toasted side.  Return to the grill and cook until lightly toasted on the bottom, and the garlic butter is melted across the top.  Remove from the grill and cut each toast in half on the diagonal.  Serve immediately.  (Makes 4 toasts)

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2            gallons  water -- divided
  1 1/2           cups  salt
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  3        tablespoons  coarsely-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  dried thyme
  8                     bay leaves
     1/4           cup  hot pepper sauce
  4                     mullets - (16 oz ea) -- cleaned, heads
                        removed
                        = (or catfish)
  1              large  yellow onion -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  whole black peppercorns
     3/4           cup  cane syrup
  3        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil - (to 2)

In a large container, combine 1 gallon of water, the salt, brown sugar, ground black pepper, dried thyme, bay leaves, and hot pepper sauce.  Stir until the salt and sugar are dissolved.  Add the fish, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 48 hours.

Soak wood chips of your choice in a bucket of water for 2 to 3 hours, then drain.  Prepare a home smoker according to the manufacturer's directions and place the soaked chips in the bottom tray.

In the upper container of the smoker, combine the remaining 1 gallon water, onions, and peppercorns.  Cover the smoker and let the fire burn for 30 minutes.

In a small saucepan, make a glaze by combining the cane syrup, shallots, thyme, and ground black pepper.  Cook over medium heat until reduced in volume by 25 percent.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

Lightly coat the grill with vegetable oil.

Remove the fish from the brine and pat dry inside and out.  Paint both sides of each fish with the reduced glaze.  Place on the grill above the water and cook, covered, until crisp and the skin is dry, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, turning once.  Remove from the smoker and serve either hot or chilled, as desired.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

In a small saucepan, make a glaze by combining the cane syrup, shallots, thyme, and ground black pepper.  Cook over medium heat until reduced in volume by 25 percent.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

Remove the fish from the brine and pat dry inside and out.  Paint both sides of each fish with the reduced glaze.  Place on the grill above the water and cook, covered, until crisp and the skin is dry, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, turning once.  Remove from the smoker and serve either hot or chilled, as desired.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs -- beaten lightly
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  Basic Sourdough Starter -- (see recipe)
     1/3           cup  melted butter
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil - (to 3) -- for greasing pan
  1 1/4           cups  fresh blueberries
                        Butter -- for accompaniment
                        Syrup -- for accompaniment

In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.

In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, starter, melted butter, and vanilla until well blended.  Add the dry ingredients, and stir just until combined, adding more milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, if necessary to bring the batter to the thickness of heavy cream.  Be careful not to overmix, and don't worry if batter is slightly lumpy.

Lightly grease a large, heavy griddle or skillet with vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat.  Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake, allowing space for spreading.  As the topsides start to bubble, about 1 minute, sprinkle blueberries into each pancake.  When the undersides of the pancakes are golden and the blueberries are set, flip with a wide spatula.  Cook until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.  Cook over break.  Serve immediately with fresh butter and syrup.

This recipe yields 16 (4-inch) pancakes.

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  duck livers -- cleaned, and
                        rinsed in cool water, patted dry
  1                cup  whole milk
  4          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried thyme
  4                     bay leaves
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4           cup  brandy
  12            ounces  cream cheese -- softened
  3             sticks  unsalted butter -- softened
                        === CREOLE MUSTARD SAUCE ===
  1              large  egg yolk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  soy sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Creole mustard
                        = (or other hot whole-grain mustard)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  vegetable oil
                        French bread croutons or crackers -- as accompaniment

In a bowl, combine the livers and milk to cover.  Soak, refrigerated, for at least 8 hours or overnight.  Drain well.

In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the livers, onions, thyme, bay leaves, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and the white pepper.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the livers are just slightly pink and the onions are soft, about 5 minutes.  Carefully add the brandy and cook until the liquid is evaporated and the livers are cooked through but still tender.

Remove from the heat and spread on a large plate to cool.  Transfer to a food processor.  Add the cream cheese and butter, and process on high speed until smooth.  Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pulse to blend.

Line a 5-cup loaf pan (8 1/2- by 4 1/2- by 3-inch) with plastic wrap, leaving an overhang of several inches.  Spoon the mixture into the terrine, smoothing out with a rubber spatula.  Wrap the terrine with the overhanging wrap and chill until firm, at least 8 hours.

To serve, unwrap the terrine, lift from the mold, and slice with a sharp knife.  Place 1 slice on each plate with a heaping tablespoon of the mustard sauce and serve with the croutons or crackers.

For the Creole Mustard Sauce:  In a blender or food processor, combine the egg yolk, soy sauce, Creole mustard, Worcestershire, salt, and pepper, and process for 20 seconds on high speed.

With the machine running, add the oil through the feed tube in a steady stream and process until it is smooth and thick.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.

This recipe yields 5 cups; 10 to 12 servings.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."

  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter -- softened, plus
  8             ounces  unsalted butter - (2 sticks)
  1                cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan with 1 teaspoon of the butter and set aside.

In a large bowl fitted with an electric mixer, cream the remaining 8 ounces of butter.  Add the sugar and beat until light.  Add the flour and salt, and mix just until incorporated, being careful not to overmix.

Press the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan.  Pierce the dough all over with the tines of a fork, and press the edges decoratively with the flat side of the tines.  Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle lightly over the dough.  Cut into 12 wedges before baking.  Bake until set and pale golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and release the sides of the pan.

  5               cups  mixed green and red leaf lettuces -- washed, patted dry,

                        === BUTTERMILK PARMESAN DRESSING ===
  1              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions (scallions) -- green tops only
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  buttermilk
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
                        === SPICED WALNUTS ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh rosemary
     1/2      teaspoon  Essence
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2           cups  walnuts

Preheat a grill.

Lightly brush corn, artichoke hearts, and red onions with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Place on grill and grill until tender.  Remove corn from grill and remove kernels from the cob.  Remove artichokes from grill and slice into 1/4-inch thick slices.  Set all aside.

In a large bowl, toss the chicken with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the Essence.  Add the buttermilk and let marinate at room temperature for 1 hour, or refrigerate and marinate for 3 hours.

Preheat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet or large saute pan to 350 degrees.

Combine the flour with the remaining 1 tablespoon of Essence in a paper bag.  Remove the chicken pieces from the buttermilk and add to the bag in batches, tossing to coat with the seasoned flour.  Shake to remove any excess breading and place on a plate until ready to fry.

Add to the hot oil in batches and cook, turning, until golden brown and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and season lightly with Essence.

Combine the lettuces, tomatoes, arugula, red peppers, corn, and artichokes in a large bowl and toss with 1/2 cup of the dressing, or more to taste.  Divide between 4 large plates and top with the fried chicken and spiced nuts.  Arrange the grilled onion rings over the top, drizzle with the remaining dressing, and serve.

For the Buttermilk Parmesan Dressing:  Place the egg, lemon juice, Parmesan, green onions, garlic, buttermilk, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor and process on high speed for 30 seconds.

With the motor running, add the oil through the feed tube in a slow, steady stream and process until it forms an emulsion.

For the Spiced Walnuts:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix well.  Spread onto a baking sheet in 1 layer.  Place in oven and roast for 10 minutes, shaking pan occasionally.  Remove from the oven and cool.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ICE CREAM ===
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  3               cups  buttermilk
     3/4      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1                cup  crumbled Homemade Pecan Pralines -- (listed below)
                        === FLAMBEED PEACHES ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  bourbon
  3               cups  sliced peaches
                        === FOR SERVING ===
                        Caramel sauce
                        Mint sprigs
                        === HOMEMADE PECAN PRALINES ===
  1                cup  light brown sugar
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                cup  pecan halves

For the Ice Cream:  In a small saucepan, combine the cream and sugar.

Simmer over medium heat, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved.  Remove from the heat and let cool completely.  In a bowl or pitcher, combine the buttermilk, milk mixture, and vanilla.  Refrigerate until well-chilled, about 1 hour.

Pour into an ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturer's instructions.  When the ice cream is nearly firm.  With the machine running, add the crumbled pralines through the feed tube.  Continue to churn until the ice cream freezes, about 5 minutes.  Place the ice cream in a plastic container and freeze until firm, 2 hours, or overnight.

For the Peaches:  In a saute pan over medium-high heat, add the butter and melt.  Add the brown sugar and cook, stirring, until the sugar is melted and bubbly.  Remove the pan from the heat and carefully add the bourbon.  Return the mixture to the heat and flame.  Cook until the flames die down.  When the alcohol has cooked out, add the peaches and simmer for 5 minutes.

Place some caramel sauce in the bottom of a decorative glass.  Top with 2 scoops of ice cream.  Places peaches on top of the ice cream and garnish with a sprig of mint.

For the Pecan Pralines:  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the light brown sugar, granulated sugar, heavy cream, butter, and water.  Place over a medium-high heat and stir constantly until the pralines reach the softball stage, 238 to 240 degrees.  Add the pecans to the candy, and pull the pan off of the stove.  Continue to stir the candy vigorously with a wooden spoon until the candy cools, and the pecans remain suspended in the candy, about 2 minutes.  Spoon the pralines out onto a parchment or aluminum foil lined sheet pan and cool completely before serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

For the Pecan Pralines:  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the light brown sugar, granulated sugar, heavy cream, butter, and water.  Place over a medium-high heat and stir constantly until the pralines reach the softball stage, 238 to 240 degrees.  Add the pecans to the candy, and pull the pan off of the stove.  Continue to stir the candy vigorously with a wooden spoon until the candy cools, and the pecans remain suspended in the candy, about 2 minutes.  Spoon the pralines out onto a parchment or aluminum foil lined sheet pan and cool completely before serving.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  finely-ground roasted peanuts
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  2 1/4      teaspoons  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  ground bay leaf -- plus a pinch
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cloves -- plus a pinch
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg -- plus a pinch
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon -- plus a pinch
  4                     chicken thighs -- skins on
  4                     chicken legs -- skins on
  1                     corn tortilla - (6" dia)
  1 1/4           cups  dark chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  fresh lime juice
  1           teaspoon  ground chili powder
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  smooth peanut butter

Preheat a grill to medium, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

To make the spice rub, combine the peanuts, brown sugar, salt, cayenne, ground bay leaf, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon in a bowl.  With a small, sharp knife, score each thigh and drumstick twice on each side, 1/2-inch deep.  Place the chicken in a large bowl.  Add the spice rub and toss to coat evenly.

Grill until marked, about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to a roasting pan or baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.  Roast in the oven until browned and cooked through, and the juices run clear when pierced with a fork, about 35 minutes.  Remove from the oven and transfer to a plate.  Cover to keep warm.

Place the tortilla on the hot grill and cook for 10 seconds on each side to mark.  Remove and tear or cut into small pieces.  (Alternately, fry the tortilla until crisp in 360 degree oil.)

Drain 1/4 cup of the pan juices into a small saucepan.  Add the chicken stock, lime juice, chili powder, salt, and tortilla pieces.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Transfer to a blender, add the peanut butter, and process on high speed until smooth.

Divide the chicken and sauce among 4 plates and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  fresh lime juice
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
     1/3           cup  rice syrup*

  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger
  3               cups  grated peeled daikon radish
  3               cups  grated peeled carrots
  2                     long French bread baguettes - (abt 30" ea)
  5                     Baked Catfish Fillets -- (listed below)
  1                cup  fresh cilantro -- stems trimmed
  3                     jalapeÒo or serrano chile peppers -- thinly sliced
                        === BAKED CATFISH FILLETS ===
  5                     catfish fillets -- halved
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
     1/3           cup  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced lime zest
                        Cayenne -- to taste

* Available in Asian markets.

In a blender, mix the lime juice, soy sauce, rice syrup, vegetable and sesame oils, garlic, and ginger on high speed for 10 seconds.

In a bowl, combine the radishes and carrots with 1/2 cup of the lime juice mixture.  Toss and refrigerate for 15 minutes.

Cut each baguette in half lengthwise without cutting all the way through.  Scoop out about 1/2-inch of the soft dough inside both sides of the bread.  Spread each side with the lime juice mixture and top with the baked catfish.  Drain the shredded vegetables and arrange on top of the fish.  Lay the cilantro and peppers over the vegetables.  Cover with the top piece of bread, pressing down to seal.  Slice each sandwich on the bias into 2-inch thick pieces, getting about 15 mini-sandwiches per baguette.

For the Baked Catfish:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Rinse catfish under cold running water and pat dry.  Lightly coat a large non-reactive baking dish with the vegetable oil and set aside.  In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, lime zest, and cayenne, and stir well to mix.  Lay the catfish in the prepared dish.  Pour the soy sauce mixture over the fish to coat but not saturate.  Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Bake until the fish is tender, opaque and starts to flake with a fork, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before making the sandwiches.

This recipe yields 30 mini-sandwiches, 8 to 12 servings.

  1         tablespoon  softened butter
  1                cup  all-purpose flour

To make the crusts, in a medium bowl, combine the yeast, water, and 1 tablespoon of the flour.  Whisk to blend.  Let sit until the mixture becomes slightly foamy, about 5 minutes.

Combine the remaining flour and salt in a large bowl and stir to blend.  Add the yeast mixture, 2 tablespoons of the oil, and the cream.  Stir well with a heavy wooden spoon until it begins to come together and pull away from the sides of the bowl.  Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 4 to 5 minutes into a smooth, but slightly sticky dough.  Oil a clean bowl with 1 teaspoon of the oil and turn the dough in the oil to lightly coat.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rise until doubled in size in a warm, draft-free place, about 40 minutes.

Lightly grease a baking sheet with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of oil.  Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and form into balls.  Place on the greased sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

Combine the strawberries, orange liqueur, and sugar in a medium bowl, and toss to coat evenly. Clean a grill very well with a brush, and lightly grease with vegetable oil.  Preheat the grill to medium heat.

Combine the goat cheese and 3 tablespoons honey in a bowl and mash with a fork until smooth. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll each ball into a 10-inch round on a lightly floured pizza paddle or large chopping board.  Transfer to the grill and cook on 1 side until golden brown, turning with a spatula to mark evenly, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the grill and place, cooked-side up on a pizza paddle or large chopping board.

Spread half of the goat cheese mixture across each piece of crust using a rubber spatula.  Spread half of the berries across the top, leaving the liquid in the bottom of the bowl.

Transfer the pizzas to the grill, cover, and cook until golden brown, rotating with a spatula to keep from burning, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer to serving plates, sprinkle each with a pinch of black pepper and half of the mint leaves.  Drizzle each pizza with 1 teaspoon of the remaining honey and serve.

Alternately, place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500 degrees.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll out into a 10-inch round on a lightly floured pizza paddle or large chopping board.  Make "dimples" with your fingertips on the top of the dough.  Spread half of the goat cheese mixture across the pizza using a rubber spatula.  Spread half of the berries across the top of the pizza, leaving the liquid in the bottom of the bowl.  Repeat with the remaining dough, goat cheese, and strawberries.

Transfer to the pizza stone (or 2 heavy baking sheets) and bake until golden brown, about 12 minutes.  Remove from the oven and transfer to serving plates.  Sprinkle a pinch of the black pepper and half of the mint leaves over the top of each pizza, and drizzle each with 1 teaspoon of the remaining honey.  Serve.

This recipe yields 2 (10-inch) pizzas.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  very finely-grated lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  very finely-grated lime zest
  1           teaspoon  very finely-grated orange zest
  1                cup  fine dry bread crumbs
  4        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  light brown sugar
  4                     skin-on pompano fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        === GRAPEFRUIT BUTTER SAUCE ===
  1 1/2           cups  fresh grapefruit juice
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated grapefruit zest
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  4 1/2      teaspoons  minced shallots
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
  2             sticks  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4           cup  seedless grapefruit segments

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil.  Add the zest and blanch for 30 seconds.  Remove with a slotted spoon and dry on paper towels.  In a bowl, combine the zests, bread crumbs, butter, shallots, salt, pepper, and sugar, and mix well.

Season the flesh side of the pompano fillets with the Essence.  Place the fillets on a non-stick baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Divide the crumb mixture evenly among the fillets and pack lightly to make a crust.  Return to the oven and bake for 10 minutes.

Remove from the oven and transfer to 4 large plates.  Top with the Grapefruit Butter Sauce and serve immediately.

For the Grapefruit Butter Sauce:  In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup of the grapefruit juice, the sugar and zest, and cook over medium heat until reduced to a thick syrup.

In a clean saucepan, combine the remaining 1/2 cup of grapefruit juice, the vinegar, and shallots.  Simmer until reduced to 3 tablespoons.  Add the heavy cream and cook for 30 seconds.  Gradually whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, adding each piece before the previous one has been completely incorporated.  Continue until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, removing the pan from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from getting too hot and breaking.

Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean pan.  Add the grapefruit gastrique, salt, pepper, and grapefruit segments, and stir gently to combine.  (Makes 1 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     boneless quail
  2        tablespoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  4                     strips bacon -- diced
  2               cups  julienned onions
  1         tablespoon  garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped thyme
     1/2           cup  Cognac
  1                cup  dry red wine
  4               cups  reduced dark chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cracked black pepper
  2        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
                        === GRILLED CROSTINI ===
                        Olive oil -- as needed
  1                     loaf french bread -- sliced 1/4" thk
                        slices

Season the quail on both sides with the Essence.

In a large, deep saute pan, cook the bacon over medium heat until brown and the fat is rendered, about 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Increase the heat to medium-high and add the quail, breast-side down, to the fat in the pan.  Sear for 2 minutes on each side.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until slightly caramelized, 7 to 8 minutes.

Add the garlic and thyme and cook for 30 seconds.  Remove the quail and drain on paper towels.  Carefully add the Cognac, and stir to deglaze and remove any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  When the Cognac has almost evaporated, add the red wine, chicken stock, thyme, salt, and pepper, and bring to a boil.

In a small bowl, make a beurre manie by combining the butter and flour and mashing with a fork until well combined.  Add the beurre manie, whisking to combine.  Return the quail to the pan and reduce the heat to a bare simmer.  Cover with the lid ajar and cook for 10 minutes.  Return the bacon to the pan and stir.  Remove from the heat and adjust seasoning, to taste.  Cover to keep warm until ready to serve.  Preheat a grill.

Using a pastry brush, spread the oil over 1 side of the sliced bread.  Place on the grill and cook until marked and slightly golden on both sides, about 2 minutes.

Place 2 crostini on each of 4 plates and arrange 1 quail on each.  Spoon the sauce over the quail and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  bay scallops
  1              small  onion -- sliced
     1/2                lemon -- sliced
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  water
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
  6             ounces  baby chanterelle mushrooms -- stems trimmed,
                        and wiped clean
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1              pinch  cayenne
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced green onions
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  shredded Gruyere
     1/2           cup  fine dry bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  melted butter
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan

Preheat the broiler.  Lightly butter the insides of 4 large ramekins and place on a baking sheet.  Set aside.  In a large skillet or saute pan, combine the scallops, onion slices, lemon slices, bay leaf, wine, and water.  Bring to a simmer and gently poach the scallops until just firm, about 3 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon.  Strain the scallop cooking liquid into a clean container.  Reserve the scallops on a plate.

In a clean large saute pan or medium saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until tender, about 4 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the pan the mushrooms were cooked in and melt over medium heat.  Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly for 2 minutes, to form a light roux.  Slowly add the strained poaching liquid, whisking constantly, and cook until thick, about 2 minutes.  Add the milk, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and cayenne, and whisk well.  Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute.  Add the parsley and green onions, and simmer for 1 minute.  Add the cream and Gruyere, stir well, and remove from the heat.  Fold in the scallops and mushrooms, and pour into the prepared ramekins.

In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, butter and Essence.  Sprinkle over the scallop mixture and top with the Parmesan.  Run under the broiler until just crisp and brown, being careful not to overcook, 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Sourdough Cornbread -- (listed below)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  chopped yellow onions
  2               cups  fresh sweet corn kernels
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  fresh jalapeÒo -- seeded, chopped
  8             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        === SOURDOUGH CORNBREAD ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  yellow cornmeal
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
  1                cup  Basic Sourdough Starter -- (see recipe)
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  2              whole  eggs -- beaten
     1/4           cup  butter -- melted

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Once the cornbread is completely cooled, cut in half horizontally and then into 3/4-inch cubes.  Spread on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes.  Turn with a spatula and bake until firm and lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven, and let cool and harden.

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the onion, corn, salt, and cayenne and cook, stirring, until very soft, 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and jalapeÒo, stir to mix, and cook for 1 minute.  Add the cheese and cream and cook gently over low heat, stirring, until the cheese melts and the mixture is smooth.  Remove from the heat and pour into a decorative bowl, surrounded by the cornbread cubes.  Serve immediately.

For the Sourdough Cornbread:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Pour the oil into a 9-inch cast-iron skillet or round pan, and preheat in the oven.

In a small bowl, combine the cornmeal, sugar, salt, and baking soda.  In a large bowl, combine the starter, buttermilk, eggs and butter, and blend well.  Add the dry ingredients, and stir until combined without overmixing.  Remove the hot skillet from the oven.  Pour the batter into the hot skillet and bake until golden, 25 to 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  1                cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest
  1         tablespoon  chopped rosemary
  1         tablespoon  chopped thyme
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  1              pinch  crushed red pepper
  2                     Cornish game hens - (abt 1 1/4 lbs ea)
  4                     bricks -- wrapped in
                        aluminum foil
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        === ORZO RISOTTO ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2         pound  orzo (rice-shaped pasta)
     1/2           cup  small dice onion
  5 1/2      teaspoons  garlic -- minced
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  4               cups  chicken stock -- kept hot in a
                        saucepan on the stove-top
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  2        tablespoons  parsley
     1/4           cup  grated Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  butter
                        === GRILLED ZUCCHINI ===
  2                     zucchini - (abt 12 oz ea) -- quartered lengthwise
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cracked black pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

In a small mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, lemon zest, rosemary, thyme, parsley, and crushed red pepper.  Mix to combine and set aside.

Place the hens on a cutting board.  With a boning knife, cut along the backbone and remove.  Place the hens breast-side down and using the heel of your hand, push down to break the breastbone and flatten.  Tuck the wing tips behind the joint of the wing that meets the breast.  Place in a 9- by 13-inch, non-reactive baking dish and add the marinade.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours, turning occasionally to evenly coat.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees and preheat the bricks for 20 minutes.  (Alternately, heat the bricks on the grill for 30 minutes.)

Preheat a grill to medium heat.

Remove the birds from the marinade and season on both sides with the Essence, salt, and pepper. Place the birds, breast-side down, on the grill.  Place 2 bricks on each bird to cover completely and flatten.  Cook for 5 minutes, turn at a 90 degree angle and cook, for 5 minutes.  Remove the bricks and turn the birds.  Cook on the second side for 2 minutes, then turn 90 degrees and cook for an additional 2 minutes.  Remove from the grill, place on a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes.  Cut each bird in half lengthwise.  Serve with the Orzo Risotto and Grilled Zucchini.

For the Orzo Risotto:  In a 2-quart saucepan set over a medium high heat, add the olive oil and butter.  Once the oil is hot and the butter is melted, add the orzo and toast lightly, about 3 minutes.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring.  Add the wine, stir, and cook to deglaze the pan.

Once the wine has nearly evaporated, add 2 cups of the stock, stirring constantly until the stock has evaporated, about 5 minutes.  Add the remaining 2 cups of stock, the salt, and white pepper, and cook until it has been absorbed by the orzo.  Add the parsley and stir to blend.  Remove the pan from the heat and add the cheese.  Stir in the butter and adjust the seasoning, to taste.

For the Grilled Zucchini:  Place zucchini, salt, pepper and olive oil in a large mixing bowl and toss well to evenly coat.  Place on a grill over low heat and cook, turning, for 3 to 4 minutes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

<DirT>
In a small mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, lemon zest, rosemary, thyme, parsley, and crushed red pepper.  Mix to combine and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the hens on a cutting board.  With a boning knife, cut along the backbone and remove.  Place the hens breast-side down and using the heel of your hand, push down to break the breastbone and flatten.  Tuck the wing tips behind the joint of the wing that meets the breast.  Place in a 9- by 13-inch, non-reactive baking dish and add the marinade.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours, turning occasionally to evenly coat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees and preheat the bricks for 20 minutes.  (Alternately, heat the bricks on the grill for 30 minutes.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat a grill to medium heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the birds from the marinade and season on both sides with the Essence, salt, and pepper. Place the birds, breast-side down, on the grill.  Place 2 bricks on each bird to cover completely and flatten.  Cook for 5 minutes, turn at a 90 degree angle and cook, for 5 minutes.  Remove the bricks and turn the birds.  Cook on the second side for 2 minutes, then turn 90 degrees and cook for an additional 2 minutes.  Remove from the grill, place on a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes.  Cut each bird in half lengthwise.  Serve with the Orzo Risotto and Grilled Zucchini.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Orzo Risotto:  In a 2-quart saucepan set over a medium high heat, add the olive oil and butter.  Once the oil is hot and the butter is melted, add the orzo and toast lightly, about 3 minutes.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring.  Add the wine, stir, and cook to deglaze the pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Once the wine has nearly evaporated, add 2 cups of the stock, stirring constantly until the stock has evaporated, about 5 minutes.  Add the remaining 2 cups of stock, the salt, and white pepper, and cook until it has been absorbed by the orzo.  Add the parsley and stir to blend.  Remove the pan from the heat and add the cheese.  Stir in the butter and adjust the seasoning, to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Grilled Zucchini:  Place zucchini, salt, pepper and olive oil in a large mixing bowl and toss well to evenly coat.  Place on a grill over low heat and cook, turning, for 3 to 4 minutes.

                        Chopped parsley
                        Essence -- to taste
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        === CRABMEAT RAVIGOTE ===
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  2          teaspoons  Dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/4      teaspoon  hot red pepper sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions

  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1                     hard boiled egg -- peeled and sieved
  1              pound  lump crabmeat -- picked over for
                        shells and cartilage
                        === COOKED ASPARAGUS ===
     1/2         pound  pencil-thin asparagus spears - (to 1 lb) -- tough woody ends
                        removed, spears trimmed to an even length
                        === CHIVE OIL ===
  1              bunch  fresh chives
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

In a bowl, toss the lettuces with the olive oil and vinegar.  Add salt and pepper, to taste.

Plating 1:  Soak rice paper wrappers in warm water until they are pliable, about 3 minutes.  Remove 2 softened wrappers and place on the work surface, slightly overlapping each other.  Place some lettuce on the wrapper.  Top with some of the ravigote and asparagus.  Roll the wrapper around the filling like a burrito.  Wet the edge to seal.

Slice the tomatoes thinly.  Place some tomato slices on a plate.  Slice the lettuce/ravigote wrap on the diagonal and place on top of the tomatoes.  Drizzle the plates decoratively with the herb oil, and garnish with chopped parsley and Essence.  Serve immediately.

Plating 2:  Have rice paper wrappers soaked.  Cut the rice paper into thin strips.  Add the rice paper strips in batches and fry until golden, turning with a slotted spoon, about 45 seconds.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season lightly with Essence, to taste.

Place 4 ring molds, about 3-inches in diameter and 2-inches high, in the center of 4 salad plates.  Arrange the lettuces around the molds.

Dice the tomatoes.  Spoon the crabmeat into each mold, pressing firmly with the back of a spoon to pack as tightly as possible.  Carefully remove the molds, leaving a tight stack of crabmeat.

In a small bowl, lightly dress the diced tomato with chive oil and salt to taste.  Gently spoon about 1 tablespoon of the dressed tomato onto each crabmeat stack.  Arrange 4 asparagus spears around each plate, placing a small dollop of the remaining tomato between each spear.  Stand chive spears against each crabmeat stack, top with the fried rice papers and decoratively garnish the plates with parsley and Essence, and serve.

For the Crabmeat Ravigote:  In a bowl, combine the mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, garlic, hot sauce, and salt.  Whisk to combine.  Fold in the green onions, capers, shallots, parsley and sieved egg.  Gently fold in the crabmeat, turning to gently coat with the dressing and being careful not to break up the lumps.  Adjust seasoning, to taste.

For the Cooked Asparagus:  Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil.  Add the asparagus and cook until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes, depending upon their thickness.  Transfer with tongs to an ice bath to refresh.  Remove from the water and pat dry.  Set aside.

For the Chive Oil:  Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil.  Add the chives and blanch for 10 seconds.  Drain and transfer to an ice bath.  Remove and pat dry on paper towels, squeezing to remove any excess water.  Roughly chop and transfer to a blender.  With the machine running, add the oil and salt through the feed tube and process until smooth.

Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate overnight.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer, pressing against the solids with the back of a spoon to extract as much oil as possible.  Transfer to a squirt bottle and refrigerate until needed, for up to 2 weeks.  Bring to room temperature before using.  (Makes about 1/2 cup)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

        Crawfish And Salmon Mousse With Tomato-Saffron Cream Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  softened unsalted butter -- plus
  3        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  12            ounces  cooked crawfish tails -- chilled
  10            ounces  boneless skinless salmon fillet -- cut 1/2" cubes,
                        and chilled
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped shallots
  1           teaspoon  chopped chives
  1           teaspoon  chopped parsley
  1           teaspoon  chopped dill
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  3              large  egg whites -- chilled
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  cold heavy cream -- divided
  20            ounces  baby spinach leaves -- blanched, drained
                        === TOMATO-SAFFRON CREAM SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
  1           teaspoon  saffron
  2        tablespoons  white wine
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2 1/2           cups  chopped seeded tomatoes
  2             sprigs  thyme
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
     1/2           cup  fish stock -- plus
  2        tablespoons  fish stock
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  chopped parsley
                        === GARNISH & ACCOMPANIMENT ===
                        Fresh chives -- garnish
                        Hot toast points -- accompaniment

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 6 (1-cup) ramekins with the softened butter, place inside a large roasting pan, and set aside.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the crawfish and salmon and puree on high speed.  Add the shallots, chives, parsley, dill, pepper, and Essence, and process on high speed.

With the machine running, add the egg whites through the feed tube and process until well combined.  Add the salt and melted butter and process (the mixture will tighten).  Puree on high speed, scraping down the sides several times.

With the machine running, gradually add 1 cup of the cream through the feed tube.  Transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until very cold, at least 1 hour.

Place the remaining cold cup of cream in a medium bowl and beat to medium peaks with an electric mixer.  Fold into the cold mousse base, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

To test the seasoning, poach a tablespoon of the mousse in boiling water.  Adjust seasoning to taste.  Divide among the prepared ramekins.  Fill the roasting pan with water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins.  Cover with buttered parchment paper and bake until the mousses are set and begin to pull away from the sides of the dishes, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and tip each ramekin onto its side to dispel any excess cooking liquid.

Arrange the spinach in the center of 6 small plates.  Run a thin knife around the edges of the molds and invert onto the blanched spinach.  Spoon the Tomato-Saffron Cream Sauce on top and around the mousses, garnish with chives, and serve with hot toast points.

For the Tomato-Saffron Cream Sauce:  Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the saffron and white wine and stir so the saffron permeates the wine.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the tomatoes, thyme and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and cook until the tomatoes give up their liquid, about 5 minutes, stirring from time to time.  Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the fish stock, bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes.  Add the cream and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt, the butter and parsley, and whisk to blend.  Remove from the heat and discard the thyme sprigs.  With a hand-held immersion blender, or in batches in a food processor, puree on high speed.  (Makes 2 cups)

This recipe yields 6 appetizer portions.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 6 (1-cup) ramekins with the softened butter, place inside a large roasting pan, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In the bowl of a food processor, combine the crawfish and salmon and puree on high speed.  Add the shallots, chives, parsley, dill, pepper, and Essence, and process on high speed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With the machine running, add the egg whites through the feed tube and process until well combined.  Add the salt and melted butter and process (the mixture will tighten).  Puree on high speed, scraping down the sides several times.
</DirT>
<DirT>
With the machine running, gradually add 1 cup of the cream through the feed tube.  Transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until very cold, at least 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the remaining cold cup of cream in a medium bowl and beat to medium peaks with an electric mixer.  Fold into the cold mousse base, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To test the seasoning, poach a tablespoon of the mousse in boiling water.  Adjust seasoning to taste.  Divide among the prepared ramekins.  Fill the roasting pan with water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins.  Cover with buttered parchment paper and bake until the mousses are set and begin to pull away from the sides of the dishes, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and tip each ramekin onto its side to dispel any excess cooking liquid.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the spinach in the center of 6 small plates.  Run a thin knife around the edges of the molds and invert onto the blanched spinach.  Spoon the Tomato-Saffron Cream Sauce on top and around the mousses, garnish with chives, and serve with hot toast points.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Tomato-Saffron Cream Sauce:  Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the saffron and white wine and stir so the saffron permeates the wine.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the tomatoes, thyme and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and cook until the tomatoes give up their liquid, about 5 minutes, stirring from time to time.  Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the fish stock, bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes.  Add the cream and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt, the butter and parsley, and whisk to blend.  Remove from the heat and discard the thyme sprigs.  With a hand-held immersion blender, or in batches in a food processor, puree on high speed.  (Makes 2 cups)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil - (to 1/2) -- for pan-frying
  1                cup  masa harina
  1         tablespoon  Essence -- plus more for
                        dusting
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1              pinch  sugar
  1                cup  milk -- hot
  1         tablespoon  bacon grease
     3/4           cup  grated queso blanco or mozzarella -- divided
     1/3           cup  chopped roast pork
                        = (or chopped smoked ham)
  1         tablespoon  minced jalapeÒo
                        = (or serrano peppers)
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
                        Sour cream (optional) -- for accompaniment

Heat about 1/4-inch of oil in a large, heavy skillet or saute pan over medium heat.

In a large bowl, combine the masa, Essence, and sugar.  Whisk in the milk, using as few strokes as possible.  Add the bacon grease, queso blanco, roast pork, jalapeÒo, and garlic and stir to combine, being careful not to overwork the dough.  Bring together into a ball.

Using your hands, form the dough into smaller balls and form into smooth patties 4-inches in diameter, about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

Cook the arepas in batches until golden, about 6 minutes per side, turning and lowering the heat as necessary if they begin to brown too quickly, and pressing down with a spatula to flatten slightly as they cook.  Remove and drain on paper towels, seasoning lightly with Essence.  Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more oil as needed.  Sprinkle each arepa with some of the remaining cheese and serve hot with the sour cream, if desired.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     beef brisket - (abt 4 lbs) -- trimmed
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  chili powder
  2        tablespoons  paprika
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  onion powder
  1         tablespoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  cayenne
  2          teaspoons  dry mustard
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
                        Mesquite wood chips
                        === BARBECUE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     3/4           cup  chopped yellow onions
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  4               cups  ketchup
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  cane syrup
     1/2           cup  apple cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  yellow mustard
     1/4           cup  Worcestershire sauce
  3        tablespoons  hot red pepper sauce
  2          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes -- or more to taste

Set the brisket on a large sheet of plastic wrap.  In a medium bowl combine the dark brown sugar, chili power, paprika, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, cayenne, dry mustard, and cumin thoroughly.  Rub the mixture onto the brisket and wrap tightly in the plastic wrap.  Place on a baking sheet and let marinate refrigerated at least 6 hours or overnight.  Remove the meat from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature.

Soak mesquite wood chips in a large bowl of water for 1 to 2 hours.  Remove, drain and set aside. Remove the meat from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature.

Prepare a smoker with charcoal and the wood chips according to the manufacturer's instructions to 180 to 200 degrees.  Place the water pan in the smoker and add water to the fill line, about 2/3 full.  Place the unwrapped brisket on the lower rack off the direct heat, close the lid, and cook, regularly stoking the fire and adding additional chips, until an instant-read thermometer registers an internal temperature of 140 to 145 degrees, about 4 to 5 hours.  Remove the meat from the grill and let rest for 20 minutes before carving the meat against the grain.

(Alternately, prepare a stove-top smoker according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Place the unwrapped brisket on the rack over low heat.  Close the lid and smoke for 1 hour.  Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.  Remove the meat from the smoker and wrap in a large sheet of heavy aluminum foil.  Place on a baking sheet and roast until tender and an instant-read thermometer registers an internal temperature of 140 to 145 degrees, about 2 to 3 hours.  Remove the meat from the oven and let rest for 20 minutes before carving the meat against the grain.)

Serve with Barbecue Sauce on the side for dipping.

For the Barbecue Sauce:  In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 4 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the ketchup, brown sugar, cane syrup, vinegar, mustard, Worcestershire, hot sauce, Essence, and red pepper flakes and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and the flavors marry, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly before serving.  (Makes about 4 cups)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  Idaho potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" thick slices
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  ale or beer
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  milk
  2        tablespoons  Essence -- plus
  2          teaspoons  Essence -- plus
                        more for dusting
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2             pounds  cod or pollack fillets -- cut 4-oz pieces
  6               cups  vegetable oil
                        Malt vinegar -- as accompaniment

Heat the oil in a deep fat fryer or large, heavy pot to 350 degrees.  Preheat the oven to 225 degrees.

Fry the potatoes in the oil until golden brown, turning to cook evenly, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season with Essence, to taste, and transfer to a baking sheet.  Place in the oven to keep warm until ready to serve.

In a bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour, the ale, egg, milk, 1 tablespoon Essence, baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Whisk to make a smooth batter the consistency of cream, adding more ale, as needed, to thin.  (Use the batter as soon as possible after making.)  Place the remaining 3/4 cup flour and 2 teaspoons Essence in a shallow dish.

Season the fish with the remaining tablespoon of Essence.  Dip the fillets first into flour to lightly coat, then into the batter, and back into the flour, shaking to remove any excess.  Fry in the oil until crisp and golden brown, turning, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season lightly with salt.  Serve immediately with the fried potatoes and malt vinegar.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === COCONUT ICE CREAM ===
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1 1/2            cup  unsweetened coconut milk
  1                cup  whole milk
     1/2           cup  coconut flavored rum
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
  6              large  egg yolks
                        === FLAMBEED PINEAPPLES ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2               cups  small-diced fresh pineapple
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
     1/2           cup  dark rum
     1/4           cup  toasted shredded sweetened coconut flakes -- or more to taste
  4                     round slices orange -- for garnish
  4                     maraschino cherries -- for garnish
  4                     cocktail umbrellas -- for garnish

To make the ice cream, in a large, heavy saucepan, combine the cream, coconut milk, whole milk, rum, and sugar.  Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Remove from the heat.  In a medium bowl, beat the eggs until pale yellow and frothy.  Add about 1/2 cup of the hot cream mixture, and whisk to combine.  Add the egg mixture to the saucepan with the remaining hot cream and whisk.

Return to medium heat and cook, stirring constantly with a heavy wooden spoon until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 4 to 5 minutes.

Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container.  Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 3 hours.  Pour into an ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer to a plastic container and freeze until ready to serve.

Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the butter and when melted, add the pineapples.  Cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Sprinkle the sugar over the pineapples and continue to cook until the sugar has completely dissolved and the pan starts to bubble, about 1 minute.  Remove the pan from the heat and add the rum.  Return to the heat and carefully tip the pan to ignite the alcohol (or, alternately, light with a match).  Remove from the heat when the flames extinguish.

To assemble the dessert, spoon 2 scoops of coconut ice cream in 4 frosted parfait glasses.  Top each portion with 1/2 cup of the pineapples and the glaze.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the toasted coconut into each glass, and garnish with an orange wedge, maraschino cherry, and a cocktail umbrella.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  ghee, clarified butter or vegetable oil -- plus
     1/4           cup  ghee, clarified butter or vegetable oil -- plus
                        extra for frying
  6        tablespoons  ice water - (to 8)
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander seeds
     1/2           cup  chopped yellow onions
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh ginger
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2                     hot green chile peppers -- minced
  1           teaspoon  garam masala
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  turmeric
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
  2              large  russet baking potatoes - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, and
                        cut 1/2" dice, boiled until just tender
     1/2           cup  par-cooked and drained green peas
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice

To make the dough, sift the flour and salt into medium bowl.  Add 1 tablespoon of the clarified butter and rub the mixture between the palms of your hands to evenly distribute, letting the fat-coated flour fall back into the bowl.  Continue until the flour is evenly coated.  Add 6 tablespoons of the water, mix, and work until the dough comes together.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 4 minutes into a firm dough.  Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes.

To make the filling, in a large saute pan or skillet, heat the remaining 1/4 cup of clarified butter over medium-high heat.  Add the coriander seeds and cook, stirring, for 10 seconds.  Add the onions and ginger, and cook, stirring, until starting to caramelize, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, chile peppers, garam masala, salt, turmeric, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds.  Add the potatoes and cook, stirring until the potatoes start to color and become dry, about 3 minutes.  Add the peas and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and add the cilantro and lemon juice.  Stir to combine, then adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Let sit until cool enough to handle.

On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough for 1 minute.  Divide into 2 equal portions and roll each into a 1/2-inch thick rope.  Cut each into 8 equal parts and roll into smooth balls.  Place each ball on the floured surface and roll into a thin circle, about 6-inches in diameter.  Cut each circle in half (2 semi-circles).  Spoon about 2 teaspoons of filling in the center of each semi-circle.  Brush the edges with water and fold the dough over the filling.  Press the edges together to seal.  Place on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Preheat the oil in a large pot to 350 degrees.  Add the pastries in batches and cook at 300 degrees , turning, until golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 32 pastries.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === GARLIC MOJITO SORBET ===
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
  3                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  1                cup  lime juice
     1/8           cup  mint leaves
     1/4           cup  rum
     1/4           cup  soda water
                        === SPICY HONEY GARLIC BRITTLE ===
  1                cup  water
  2               cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
     1/2           cup  spicy chile honey
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
                        Reserved puree from Mojito Sorbet
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda

For the Garlic Mojito Sorbet:  In a saucepan, combine the water, sugar, and garlic.  Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes, until sugar is dissolved, but not at all colored.  Remove from the heat, strain, reserving garlic, and cool completely.  Mash the reserved garlic in a mortar and pestle and set aside.

In a blender, combine the cooled sugar water, lime, mint, and rum.  Blend until well combined.  Add the soda water and place in an ice cream machine.  Process according to manufacturer's instructions.

For the Brittle:  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper.  Combine the water and sugar in a large nonstick heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir to dissolve the sugar, 4 to 5 minutes.  Add the corn syrup, honey, and salt, and stir constantly and slowly with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes to a gentle boil, about 2 minutes.  Continue stirring until the mixture reaches 290 degrees on a candy thermometer.

Remove the pan from the heat.  Add the butter, reserved garlic puree, and baking soda and stir until the butter is completely melted, about 1 minute.  Pour the mixture onto the baking sheets, being careful as it is very hot, and spread it evenly with a rubber spatula.  Let cool completely.

Break the brittle into shards.  Scoop the sorbet into decorative glasses.  Place a shard of brittle in the sorbet and garnish with mint sprigs and/or lime.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  16                    pita breads
                        === TZATZIKI SAUCE ===
  1             medium  cucumber -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely chopped
  1                cup  plain yogurt
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
                        = (or white wine vinegar)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

With a sharp knife, make 20 slits across 1 side of the lamb and insert the garlic slivers.  Place in a large non-reactive dish.

In a bowl, whisk together the oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper.  Pour over the lamb and rub evenly across the surface.  Cover with plastic wrap and marinate, refrigerated, for at least 2 and up to 6 hours, turning occasionally.

Remove from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature.  Season lightly on all sides with Essence.  Brush a grill lightly with olive oil and preheat to medium heat.

Remove the lamb from the marinade and place on the grill.  Cook, turning occasionally until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees for medium-rare, about 1 1/2 hours.  Remove from the grill and transfer to a platter.  Tent with foil and let rest for 12 minutes before carving.

Thinly slice the lamb and place the meat in the center of the pita breads.  Top with Tzatziki Sauce and chopped tomatoes, and serve.

For the Tzatziki Sauce:  In a medium bowl combine all the ingredients and chill for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to marry.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  Essence -- plus
  2        tablespoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  4                     beef rib eye steaks - (12 to 14 oz ea)
  2              large  green bell peppers -- cut 1/4" thk rings,
                        stems, cores and seeds discarded
  1                cup  flour
  1                cup  masa harina
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
  4               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
                        === EMERIL'S MAITRE D'HOTEL BUTTER ===
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley
  4          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped fresh parsley

In a mixing bowl, combine the oil and 1/2 cup Essence, stirring well.  Place the steaks on a baking dish and rub the oil mixture on both sides.  Let sit for at least 1 hour.  (If marinating longer, refrigerate the meat, then bring to room temperature before cooking.)

Preheat the grill, and preheat the oil in a deep fat fryer to 350 degrees.

Place the steaks on the grill and cook for 6 to 8 minutes on each side for medium-rare.

In a shallow bowl, combine the flour with 1 tablespoon of the Essence.  In another bowl, combine the masa with the remaining tablespoon of Essence.  In a third bowl, combine the eggs and milk and beat well.  In batches, dredge the pepper rings in the flour, egg wash, and masa mixtures, shaking to remove any excess.  Fry, turning, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the pepper rings from the oil and drain on paper towels.  Season lightly with Essence.

To serve, place the steaks on a plate.  Stack the pepper rings on top and place a 2 tablespoon slice of the compound butter on each steak in the center of the peppers.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.

For the Emeril's Maitre d'Hotel Butter:  Place the butter in a medium bowl and cream with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula.  Add the remaining ingredients and mix well.  Place on a large sheet of plastic wrap and form into a cylinder, about 1 1/2-inches in diameter.  Roll up in the plastic wrap, pushing in as you go, to form a tight log.  Refrigerate or freeze until needed.  (Makes 1/2 pound)

  1              pinch  cayenne
     1/3           cup  chopped toasted peanuts
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro

Preheat a grill.

In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, onions, mangos, and bell peppers.  Add the oil, lime juice, cinnamon, cumin, nutmeg, salt, and cayenne, and toss well to coat evenly.

Lay 2 large pieces of heavy aluminum foil in a stack on a work surface.  Mound the sweet potato mixture into the middle and wrap in the foil, turning up the edges to make a tight, well-sealed package.  Place directly on the grill and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.

(Alternately, preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Place the potato-mango package in the middle of the oven and roast until the potatoes begin to soften, 45 to 50 minutes.  Uncover and roast until tender and starting to caramelize, 15 to 20 minutes.)

Remove from the grill and let cool slightly before unwrapping.  Transfer the sweet potato mixture to a large, decorative bowl and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Sprinkle with peanuts and fresh cilantro and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

            Guinness Ice Cream With Dark Chocolate-Honey Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  Guinness stout
  2               cups  heavy cream
  2               cups  whole milk
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1                     vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  6                     egg yolks
                        === DARK CHOCOLATE-HONEY SAUCE ===
  2               cups  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  honey
  20            ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract

In a large saucepan, simmer the Guinness until reduced by 3/4 in volume, about 8 minutes.  Combine the cream, milk, and sugar in a medium, heavy saucepan.  Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the pan and add the vanilla bean halves.  Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.  Remove from the heat.

Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl.  Whisk 1 cup of the hot cream into the egg yolks.  Gradually add the egg mixture in a slow, steady stream, to the hot cream.  Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to keep a skin from forming.  Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.

Remove from refrigerator and add the Guinness reduction, whisking until well blended.  Pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.

For the Dark Chocolate-Honey Sauce:  In a medium saucepan, scald cream and honey medium heat.  Remove from the heat.  Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl.  Add the hot cream, let sit for 2 minutes, then whisk until smooth.  Whisk in the vanilla.  Let stand until cool but still pourable.  Serve over Guinness ice cream.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  dry Sherry
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  diced fresh mangoes
     1/4           cup  chopped green onions
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro -- plus
  8             sprigs  fresh cilantro -- for garnish
  1                     large head bibb lettuce -- cored, and
                        leaves separated
     1/2           cup  thinly-sliced peeled seeded and
                        drained cucumbers
  8                     chives

Preheat a fryer to 350 degrees.

In a bowl, season the shrimp with the Essence.  In a small skillet, stirring, dry cook the sesame seeds over medium heat until lightly toasted.  Remove from the heat.  Add the cellophane noodles to the fryer and fry quickly until puffed and golden.  Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.  Season lightly with salt.  Set aside.

In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil and 1/2 teaspoon of the sesame oil over high heat.  Add the shrimp, ginger, and garlic, and quickly cook, stirring, until the shrimp are just pink and firm, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon.

Add the sherry and vinegar, and stir to deglaze the pan over medium heat.  Add the sugar and stir to dissolve.  Cook until the mixture is reduced by half.  Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, mangoes, green onions, and pepper flakes, and stir to warm through and wilt.  Remove from the heat and add the shrimp and ginger mixture, and cilantro.  Stir to warm through and adjust seasoning, to taste.

Divide the lettuces among 4 plates and top with the shrimp mixture.  Arrange cucumber slices on top and sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds.  Garnish with fried noodles, cilantro sprigs, and chives, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  diced pineapple
  1                cup  diced mango
     1/2           cup  diced papaya
  1                cup  honeydew balls
  1                cup  sliced strawberries
  1                cup  sliced peaches
     1/2           cup  blueberries
     1/2           cup  raspberries
  1                cup  sliced bananas
     1/4           cup  Citrus-Ginger Infusion -- (listed below)
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
     1/4           cup  toasted flaked coconut
                        Oil -- for frying
  8                     large square wonton wrappers
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar
  1                cup  whipped cream
  1         tablespoon  powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  coconut rum
                        === CITRUS-GINGER INFUSION ===
  2 1/2           cups  water
  5               cups  granulated sugar
  2               cups  chopped lemon grass
     1/2           cup  julienned fresh ginger
  4                     lemons -- zested and juiced

Preheat a fryer to 360 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine pineapple, mango, papaya, honeydew, strawberries, peaches, blueberries, raspberries, bananas, ginger infusion, and lime juice.  Mix well and set aside.

Place a wonton wrapper inside a large ladle.  Press the wrapper down with a smaller ladle and immerse in the hot oil.  Fry until golden brown, releasing the second ladle once it will hold its shape.  Remove from the oil and drain on a paper towel lined plate.  Repeat with the other wrappers.  While the wrappers are still hot, sprinkle the inside with powdered sugar.

Combine the cream and the powdered sugar.  Whip until soft peaks form.  Add the rum and whip to medium peaks.  Right before serving, sprinkle the fruit with the toasted coconut and toss again.

Place the wrapper either in a decorative martini or margarita glass, or on a plate.  Fill with fruit salad and top with some whipped cream.

For the Citrus-Ginger Infusion:  Combine the water, sugar, lemon grass, ginger, and lemon juice and zest in large saucepan.  Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a clean container and reserve for the daiquiris.  (Infusion will keep for 2 weeks, refrigerated and also may be used to flavor dressings or drizzle over fresh fruit.)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

        Island Shrimp And Pineapple Skewers With Rum Butter Sauce

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4          teaspoons  minced fresh gingerroot -- divided
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  16            medium  shrimp -- shelled, deveined
     1/3         pound  sliced prosciutto
  1              small  pineapple -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
     1/2           cup  dark rum
  6             ounces  cold unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- cut into pieces
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
     1/2           cup  minced fresh cilantro

Preheat a grill to medium heat.

In a bowl, combine the lime juice, oil, 2 teaspoons of the ginger, garlic, and pepper flakes.  Add the shrimp and pineapple chunks, toss to combine, and let marinate while the grill heats, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the marinade.

Wrap the shrimp with the prosciutto.  Alternately, thread the pineapple chunks and the wrapped shrimp onto metal or bamboo skewers.  Grill until the shrimp are cooked through and the pineapple chunks are marked, 3 to 4 minutes per side.  Remove from the grill.  (Alternately, the skewers can be cooked under the broiler, turning as necessary to cook evenly and avoid burning.)

Make the sauce in a medium saucepan by combining the rum, shallots, and remaining 2 teaspoons of minced ginger.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until reduced to 3 tablespoons in volume, 3 to 4 minutes.  With the heat on medium-low, whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, adding each piece before the previous one has been completely incorporated.  Continue until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, removing the pan from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from getting too hot and breaking.  Season with the salt and cayenne, and stir.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a decorative bowl.

To serve, transfer the wrapped shrimp and pineapple chunks from the skewers to a platter.  Sprinkle with the cilantro and serve with the rum butter sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12              cups  finely shaved ice
                        === BLUEBERRY SYRUP ===
  2               cups  fresh blueberries
  2               cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
                        === ORANGEADE SYRUP ===
  2               cups  sugar
  1                cup  fresh orange juice
  1                cup  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  orange zest
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest
                        === STRAWBERRY-CHAMPAGNE SYRUP ===
  2               cups  sugar
  1                cup  fresh strawberries -- hulled
  1                cup  demi-sec or extra dry champagne

Blueberry Syrup:  In a medium saucepan, combine blueberries, sugar and water, being careful to crush the fruit.  Cook over low heat, stirring gently.  (The heat will make the berries split and their juices will run clear.)  Once the sugar dissolves, cook 2 more minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain into a clean bowl through a fine mesh strainer, without pressing the fruit.  Let cool completely before serving over shaved ice.

Orangeade Syrup:  In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, orange juice, lemon juice, orange zest and lemon zest.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves.  Remove from the heat and strain into a clean bowl through a fine mesh strainer.  Let cool completely before serving over shaved ice.

Strawberry-Champagne Syrup:  In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar and strawberries, being careful to crush the fruit.  Cook over low heat, stirring gently.  (The heat will make the berries split and their juices will run clear.)  Once the sugar dissolves, cook 2 more minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain into a clean bowl through a fine mesh strainer, without pressing the fruit.  Let cool completely.  Stir the Champagne into the strawberry syrup and serve over shaved ice.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  nutmeg
  1              pinch  salt
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  6              large  peaches -- peeled, pitted,
                        and sliced - (abt 6 cups)
  1         tablespoon  Amaretto liqueur
                        = (or Bourbon whiskey)
                        Basic Sweet Pie Crust -- (listed below)
  2        tablespoons  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  2             quarts  vanilla ice cream
                        === BASIC SWEET PIE CRUST ===
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1              stick  cold butter -- cut 1/4" pieces
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  2        tablespoons  ice water - (to 3)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.  In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the peaches and cook, stirring gently, for 1 minute.  Add the sugar-flour mixture, and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and begins to boil.  Remove from the heat and stir in the Amaretto.  Let cool.

Divide the pie dough in 2, one portion slightly larger then the other.  Roll out the larger portion on a lightly floured surface to about 11 inches in diameter.  Transfer to an 8-inch cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven, fitting the dough up the sides, leaving a slight overhang.  Roll out the remaining dough into a large rectangle and cut into 1-inch thick strips.

Pour the peach mixture into the bottom dough.  Working one strip at a time, create a lattice top crust by laying the strips across the top in 1 direction, then turn and lay across in the other, interweaving the strips, if desired.  Roll up the overhanging bottom crust over the edges and pinch to seal.  Crimp together around the pan.  Brush the top with the cream and lightly sprinkle with the sugar.  Bake until the crust is golden and the juices are bubbly, about 40 minutes.

Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.

Slice and serve with ice cream on top.

For the Basic Sweet Pie Crust:  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large bowl.  Using your fingers, work in the butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add 2 tablespoons of ice water and work with your fingers until the water is incorporated and the dough comes together.  Add more water as needed to make a smooth dough, being careful not to over-mix.  Form the dough into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

This recipe yields about 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  linguine
                        = (or spaghettini)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  3             ounces  chorizo -- diced
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
  3        tablespoons  thinly-sliced garlic
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2              pound  Little Neck clams -- scrubbed, and

  1               dash  vodka
                        === OPTIONAL ===
                        A few drops lemon juice -- to taste
                        === FRUIT MACEDOINE ===
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2               cups  water
  1              large  orange
  1              small  lemon
  1              piece  peeled fresh ginger - (abt 1")
  2                     blood oranges - (abt 8 oz)
  2                     navel oranges - (abt 10 oz)
  1              small  pineapple - (abt 14 oz)
     1/2        medium  papaya - (abt 8 oz)
  2              small  bananas
  4                     kumquats
  2                     passion fruit - (to 3)
  1                     kiwi fruit - (to 2)

To make the mango sherbet, peel the mangos and slice the flesh off the pit.  Puree in a food processor or blender.  You should have 1 1/4 cups puree.  Juice the orange and pass the juice through a strainer, forcing some of the pulp through as well.  You should have a little less than 1/2 cup.  Add to the mango puree.  Stir in the sugar and flavor, to taste, with vodka and a few drops of lemon juice, if necessary.  Pour into a container, cover and chill.  Freeze the sherbet according to the instructions for your ice cream maker.

To make the macedoine, measure the sugar and water into a non-reactive saucepan.  Peel all the zest from the orange and the lemon in very thin strips, being careful not to cut into the white part of the rind.  Add the zest to the syrup in the saucepan.  Slice the ginger and add it to the syrup.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Chill the syrup in the refrigerator.

Peel and section the blood and navel oranges into a bowl and squeeze the juice from the membranes over the segments.  Peel, core, and cut the pineapple into small wedges and add to the bowl.  Peel and seed the papaya and peel the bananas; cut into 1/2-inch cubes.  Slice the kumquats as thin as you can, removing the seeds as you go, and add to the bowl.  Cut the passion fruit in half, scoop out the flesh and seeds, and add to the fruit mixture.  Add the kiwi, peeled and cut into small dice.  You should have 4 cups or so of prepared fruit.  Pouring through a strainer, add enough of the chilled syrup to make the mixture soupy.  You may not need all of it.  Cover and chill thoroughly.

When you are ready to serve the dessert, put a scoop of the sherbet into 4 to 6 soup plates and arrange the fruit around it.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  1                     London Broil - (abt 2 1/2 lbs)
                        = (or flank steak or tri-tip)

     1/4           cup  dry red wine
  2         tablespoon  olive oil

  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1           teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  4                     garlic cloves -- smashed
                        === EMERIL'S HOMEMADE STEAK SAUCE ===
  2               cups  chicken stock
  2 1/4         pounds  plum tomatoes -- chopped
  1 1/4            cup  chopped mango
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
     1/2         pound  turnip -- peeled, diced
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, minced
     1/2           cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  raisins
  1                     cinnamon stick - (abt 2")
  2                     whole cloves
  3        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  apple cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  molasses -- plus
  1           teaspoon  molasses
  1 1/2      teaspoons  Worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  2          teaspoons  fresh orange juice
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice

Place the London Broil in a large, plastic resealable bag.

In a large, glass measuring cup, combine red wine vinegar, red wine, olive oil, Worcestershire, soy sauce, mustard, essence, salt, pepper, and garlic.  Pour the marinade into the bag with the steak, seal and place inside a large, glass baking dish to prevent possible spills.  Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours (or at least 6 hours).

Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to high heat.  (Alternately, preheat the broiler).  Remove the steak from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels.  Place the steak on the grill (or under the broiler) and cook to desired doneness, about 6 minutes per side for rare.  Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let stand for 5 minutes before carving.

Slice across the grain into thin diagonal slices.  Serve steak with sauce.

For the Emeril's Homemade Steak Sauce:  Combine chicken stock, tomatoes, mango, yellow onions, turnip, jalapeÒo, ketchup, raisins, cinnamon, cloves, light brown sugar, vinegars, molasses, Worcestershire, garlic, ginger, coriander, chili powder, and cayenne in a medium, heavy pot and bring to a boil.

Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 1 1/2 hours.  Remove the sauce from the heat and puree on high speed with an immersion blender or in batches in a food processor.  Add the orange and lemon juices and process to blend.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  baby artichokes
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2         pounds  red bliss potatoes -- quartered
  1              large  yellow onion -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" wedges
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1                cup  cherry tomatoes
     1/2           cup  roughly-chopped oil-cured black olives
  1         tablespoon  capers
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley leaves
  1         tablespoon  herbes de Provence

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Remove the tough outer leaves from the artichokes and cut the top quarter from each.  Trim the stem ends as necessary.  Cut in half lengthwise.  As they are trimmed, place in a large non-reactive baking dish and toss with the lemon juice.  Add the potatoes, onions, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper, and toss to evenly coat the vegetables.  Spread evenly and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally.  Add the tomatoes and stir well.  Cook until the potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool.  Add the olives and capers, and toss with the parsley and herbes de Provence.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, and add additional olive oil, if desired.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     mirlitons - (abt 2 1/4 lbs) -- peeled, cored,
                        and diced
  1                cup  water
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2                cinnamon stick
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  granulated sugar -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated sugar
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
                        Basic Sweet Piecrust -- (listed below)
  2          teaspoons  heavy cream
                        === BASIC SWEET PIE CRUST ===
  1              pound  flour
                        = (abt 4 cups plus 4 tbspns)
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  cold butter - (2 sticks) -- cut 1/4" pieces
  4        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  6        tablespoons  ice water

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

In a medium pot, combine the mirlitons, water, allspice, cinnamon stick, and salt, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, about 8 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain in a colander.  To the cooking liquid, add 1 cup of the sugar and lime juice and simmer until it thickens to a thick syrup.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

Divide the piecrust dough in half.  Place one piece of dough on a lightly floured surface and roll out to an 11-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick.  Transfer to a 9-inch pie pan.  Trim the crust with scissors or a sharp knife to within 1/2-inch of the outer rim.  Return the cooked mirlitons to the pot, and stir to combine with the syrup.  Pour into the piecrust.  Roll out the remaining crust on a lightly floured surface.  Place on top of the mirliton filling and tuck the overlapping crusts into the pan, forming a thick edge.  Crimp the edges to seal and cut 1/2-inch long vents along the top crust.

With a pastry brush, brush the top of the crust with the cream, and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of sugar.  Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 375 degrees.  Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before serving.

Serve warm or at room temperature.

For the Basic Sweet Pie Crust:  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large bowl.  Using your fingers, work in the butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add 4 tablespoons of ice water and work with your fingers until the water is incorporated and the dough comes together.  Add more water as needed to make a smooth dough, being careful not to over mix.  Form the dough into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  round Basic Sourdough Bread loaf -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  Creole Olive Salad -- (listed below)
  4             ounces  mortadella -- thinly sliced
  4             ounces  cappocolo, culatello, or
                        other cured Italian ham -- thinly sliced
  4             ounces  mozzarella -- thinly sliced
  4             ounces  provolone or Fontina -- thinly sliced
                        Pickled pepperoncini -- for garnish
                        === CREOLE OLIVE SALAD ===
     1/2           cup  pitted brine-cured black olives -- sliced
                        = (such as Nicoise)
     1/2           cup  large (queen) pimiento-stuffed olives -- sliced
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped celery
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
     3/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Slice the bread in half horizontally, and remove enough of the doughy insides to make room for the fillings.  Spread about 1/4 cup of the Creole Olive Salad and its oil on the bottom and top pieces of bread, spreading to saturate the bread with oil.  Alternately layer the bottom bread with the meat, cheese, and remaining olive salad to taste.

Cut into quarters and wrap tightly in butcher's paper or plastic wrap.  Let sit for 30 minutes for the flavors to marry and the oil to soak into the bread.  Unwrap and place on a large serving plate with the pepperoncini.  Serve.

For the Creole Olive Salad:  Combine all the ingredients in a medium mixing bowl and mix well.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Slice the bread in half horizontally, and remove enough of the doughy insides to make room for the fillings.  Spread about 1/4 cup of the Creole Olive Salad and its oil on the bottom and top pieces of bread, spreading to saturate the bread with oil.  Alternately layer the bottom bread with the meat, cheese, and remaining olive salad to taste.

<DirT>
Cut into quarters and wrap tightly in butcher&apos;s paper or plastic wrap.  Let sit for 30 minutes for the flavors to marry and the oil to soak into the bread.  Unwrap and place on a large serving plate with the pepperoncini.  Serve.

<DirT>
For the Creole Olive Salad:  Combine all the ingredients in a medium mixing bowl and mix well.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     boned quail - (3 1/2 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        Mushroom Stuffing -- (listed below)
  4        tablespoons  melted butter
                        === MUSHROOM STUFFING ===
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/4           cup  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2             pounds  assorted mushrooms* -- stems trimmed,
                        and roughly chopped
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan - (packed)
     1/4           cup  fine bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh basil
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano

* Such as button, shiitake, wood ear, and chanterelles.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Lay the quail skin side-down on a baking sheet and season lightly with 1 tablespoon of the Essence.  Insert 1 portion of the mushroom stuffing into the cavity of each quail and wrap the bird around it.  Replace each bird on the baking sheet, breast side-up.  Brush the butter over the quails and season with the remaining tablespoon of Essence.

Roast until the birds are tender and golden brown, 25 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve 2 quails per person.

For the Mushroom Stuffing:  Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the mushrooms, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are wilted and begin to caramelize.  Add the wine and cook, stirring to deglaze the pan and until the liquid has almost all evaporated, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer the mushrooms to the bowl of a food processor.  Add the cheese, bread crumbs, parsley, basil, and oregano, and process on high speed to a thick paste.

Transfer to a bowl and divide into 8 equal portions.  With your hands, pack each portion into a tight ball.  Set aside until ready to stuff the quail.  (Makes about 3 cups)

This recipe yields 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  mussels -- well scrubbed,
                        de-bearded, and rinsed in
                        several changes of water
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice

  1           teaspoon  crab boil
  3             slices  bacon -- chopped
  1                cup  chopped yellow onion
  1                cup  chopped leeks, whites only -- well rinsed
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne
  2                     bay leaves
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  1              pound  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, diced,
                        and blanched
  2               cups  milk
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1              small  loaf French bread -- cut 1/2" thk slices
  2              large  garlic cloves -- peeled, crushed
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a medium pot, combine the mussels, wine, water, lemon juice, bay leaf, and crab boil, and bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce the heat, and simmer until the mussels have opened, 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat and discard any unopened mussels.  Strain the cooking liquid through a strainer lined with cheesecloth into a clean container.  Remove the mussels from the shells and set aside.  Discard the shells.

In a large pot, cook the bacon over medium heat until just golden and starting to crisp, about 3 minutes.  Add the onions and leeks, and cook until soft, about 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, salt, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the bay leaves and thyme, and stir well.  Add the strained mussel cooking liquid, the potatoes, milk, and cream and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 12 minutes.  Discard the bay leaf and thyme sprigs.  Add the cooked mussels and simmer until warmed through.  Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Meanwhile, place the bread slices on a baking sheet and rub on both sides with the garlic cloves.  Bake until light golden brown, turning once, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.  Ladle into soup bowls, garnish with the parsley, and serve with the garlic croutons.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/2           cup  white cornmeal
  2        tablespoons  Essence -- plus
                        more for seasoning
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  salt
  6                     catfish fillets - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  2               cups  vegetable oil
                        === FRIED PICKLES ===
  1                jar  sliced dill pickles - (16 oz)
  1                cup  buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  hot red pepper sauce
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  yellow cornmeal
  2        tablespoons  Essence -- plus
                        more for dusting
  4               cups  vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Salt -- to taste

Combine the flour and 1 tablespoon of Essence in a shallow dish.  In a second dish, combine the 2 cornmeals with the remaining Essence.  In a third dish or bowl, beat the eggs with the milk and salt.  Dredge the catfish 1 at a time first in the flour, then the eggwash, then the cornmeal, shaking to remove any excess.

Heat about 1 cup of the oil in a large, deep cast-iron skillet.

Fry the fish in batches and cook until golden brown on 1 side, 4 to 5 minutes.  Turn and cook until golden on the second side and completely cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season lightly with Essence.  Add additional oil as needed and cook the remaining fish.

Serve hot with the Fried Pickles.

For the Fried Pickles:  Drain the pickles in a colander, then spread on paper towels to drain completely.  Combine the buttermilk and hot sauce in a bowl.  In a separate bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, and 2 tablespoons of Essence.

Heat the oil in a medium pot to 350 degrees.

Submerge the pickles in batches in the buttermilk, then dip into the flour mixture, tossing to evenly coat.  Shake in a strainer to remove any excess batter.  Add to the oil in batches, turning, until golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes.  Drain on paper towels, and season with Essence and salt, to taste.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     Basic Sweet Pie Crust -- (listed below)
     3/4           cup  light brown sugar - (packed)
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar -- plus
     1/2      teaspoon  granulated sugar
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  finely-ground white pepper
  4               cups  finely-chopped green tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces
  2          teaspoons  heavy cream
                        === BASIC SWEET PIE CRUST ===
  8             ounces  all-purpose flour
                        = (abt 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tbspns)
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              stick  cold unsalted butter -- cut 1/4" pieces
  2        tablespoons  solid vegetable shortening
  3        tablespoons  ice water

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Make the pie crust and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.  Divide the dough in half.  Place 1 piece of the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll out to an 11-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick.  Transfer to a 9-inch pie pan.  Trim the crust with scissors or a sharp knife to within 1/2-inch of the outer rim.

In a large bowl, mix together the brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt, and pepper.  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the flour mixture across the bottom of the prepared piecrust.

Add the tomatoes and lemon juice to the bowl with the remaining flour mixture and toss to coat.  Spoon the tomato mixture into the pie shell, and dot with the butter.

Roll out the remaining crust on a lightly floured surface.  Place on top of the tomato filling and tuck the overlapping crusts into the pan, forming a thick edge.  Crimp the edges to seal and cut small 1/2-inch long vents in a decorative pattern along the top crust.  With a pastry brush, brush the top of the crust with the cream, and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of sugar.

Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 375 degrees.  Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before serving.

Serve warm or at room temperature.

For the Basic Sweet Pie Crust:  Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into a large bowl.  Using your fingers, work in the butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add 2 tablespoons of ice water and work with your fingers until the water is incorporated and the dough comes together.  Add more water as needed to make a smooth dough, being careful not to over-mix.  Form the dough into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) pie.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     squab
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1                cup  fresh cherries -- pitted, halved
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
     1/2           cup  reduced dark chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  chopped sage
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        === FRIED SWEET POTATO AND BEET NESTS ===
     1/2         pound  beets -- peeled, and
                        cut into threads on a turning mandoline
     1/2         pound  sweet potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into threads on a turning mandoline
  2               cups  flour
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === HARICOTS VERTS ===
  12            ounces  haricots verts -- ends trimmed
                        = (or small thin green beans)
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.

Cut the backbone out of the squab and gently flatten with the palm of your hand.  Lightly season the squab on both sides with salt and ground black pepper.

Heat the oil in a large saute pan or skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the squab, skin-side down, and cook for 3 minutes.  Turn and place in the oven.  Roast until the birds are cooked through and tender, about 7 minutes.  Remove from the oven and transfer to a platter.  Cover with aluminum foil.

Drain all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan and place over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots to the pan and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add the cherries and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the balsamic vinegar and cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan.  When nearly all the vinegar has evaporated, add the chicken stock and sage.  Cook until reduced by 25 percent in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Remove the sauce from the heat, add the butter and stir.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.

For the Fried Nests:  Preheat a fryer to 360 degrees.

Dredge the beets and sweet potatoes in the flour, shaking off any excess.  Place the sweet potatoes and beets in the fryer and cook until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove the beets/sweet potatoes from the fryer with a spider to a paper towel lined plate and season with salt.

To serve, place the potato nest on a platter.  Place squab on top and top with sauce.  Arrange the haricots verts around the sides and serve immediately.

For the Haricots Verts:  Bring a small saucepan of salted water to a boil.  Add the haricots verts and cook until just tender, about 1 minute.  Transfer with a slotted spoon to an ice bath to refresh.  Drain.  In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the drained haricots verts, and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     flounder fillets - (4 oz ea)
  1         tablespoon  Essence -- plus
  2          teaspoons  Essence

  1                cup  instant flour
  1 1/2           cups  clarified butter - (to 2)
                        === DILLED TARTAR SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  sour cream
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
  1              pinch  sugar
  2        tablespoons  grated white onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh dill
  1         tablespoon  pickle relish

Lightly season the fillets on both sides with 2 teaspoons Essence.

In a shallow bowl, combine the instant flour and remaining tablespoon of Essence.  One at a time, dredge the fish in the flour to coat both sides, shaking to remove any excess.

Over medium-high heat, warm enough clarified butter to come 1/2-inch up the sides of a large, deep saute pan or skillet to 350 degrees.  Add the fish in batches and cook for 2 minutes on the first side.  Carefully turn with a spatula and cook until golden and cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Add additional clarified butter, as needed, for the remaining fish.

Arrange 2 fillets on each of 4 dinner plates and serve with the Dilled Tartar Sauce.

For the Dilled Tartar Sauce:  In a medium bowl, combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, salt, cayenne, and sugar, and mix well.  Fold in the onions, dill, and pickle relish.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.  (Makes about 1 cup)

Over medium-high heat, warm enough clarified butter to come 1/2-inch up the sides of a large, deep saute pan or skillet to 350 degrees.  Add the fish in batches and cook for 2 minutes on the first side.  Carefully turn with a spatula and cook until golden and cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Add additional clarified butter, as needed, for the remaining fish.

For the Dilled Tartar Sauce:  In a medium bowl, combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, salt, cayenne, and sugar, and mix well.  Fold in the onions, dill, and pickle relish.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.  (Makes about 1 cup)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  chopped fresh -- seeded papaya
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  pineapple juice
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     1/3           cup  cornstarch
     1/3           cup  water
  1           teaspoon  lime zest
  1           teaspoon  orange zest
  1         tablespoon  butter
                        Shortbread Crust -- (listed below)
     1/2           cup  lightly-toasted sweetened coconut flakes
  6             slices  lime
                        === SWEETENED RUM WHIPPED CREAM ===
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  4 1/2      teaspoons  confectioner's sugar
  4 1/2      teaspoons  coconut-flavored rum
                        === SHORTBREAD PIE CRUST ===
  7        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into pieces,
                        and at room temperature
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1              large  egg yolk
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour

In a bowl, combine the papaya and lime juice.  In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, pineapple juice, and orange juice and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring, until the sugar dissolves.  Add the marinated papaya and simmer until tender, about 7 minutes.  With a slotted spoon, transfer the papaya to a bowl and set aside.

In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and water, stirring to dissolve.  Add to the simmering juices and whisk.  Add the lime and orange zests, and cook over low heat whisking until the mixture thickens, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat and add the papaya.  Add the butter and stir until melted.  Let cool.  Pour into the prebaked shell.  Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours.

For the Sweetened Rum Whipped Cream:  In a medium bowl, whip the cream and sugar until soft peaks form.  Add the rum and whip until stiff peaks form, being careful not to overwhip.  Top with whipped cream and sprinkle with the toasted coconut.  Arrange the lime slices in a decorative pattern and serve.  Refrigerate any leftover pie.

For the Shortbread Pie Crust:  In a bowl, combine the butter and sugar and blend to make a paste.  Add the yolk and blend thoroughly.  Add the flour and using your fingers, blend to make a crumbly dough, being careful not to overwork.  Pat firmly into a 9-inch pie pan and let rest in the refrigerator at least 2 hours or overnight.

Remove from the refrigerator and prick the bottom of the crust with the tines of a fork.  Place a sheet of parchment or foil in the pie tin and fill with pie weights, dried beans or rice and blind bake the crust in a preheated 400 degree oven for 10 minutes.  Remove the pie weights and foil and bake for another 5 minutes or until light golden brown.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) pie.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Essence -- to taste
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1              bunch  fresh arugula -- tough stems
                        removed, washed and spun dry
     1/2           cup  fresh parsley leaves - (packed)
     1/2           cup  lightly-toasted walnuts
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  olive oil - (to 1/2)
  1              pound  penne pasta
  1               pint  red grape tomatoes -- halved
  1               pint  yellow grape tomatoes -- halved
  1 1/4           cups  crumbled feta

Preheat a grill.  Drizzle the chicken with oil and season with salt, pepper, and Essence.  Place on the grill and cook until cooked through, about 4 minutes on the first side, and 5 minutes on the second side.  Remove the chicken from the grill and cut into cubes.

In a food processor, combine the arugula, parsley, walnuts, garlic, cheese, lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and process on high speed until the greens are finely chopped.  With the machine running, add the extra-virgin olive oil and 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a steady stream and process until smooth.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the pasta and cook until al dente.  Drain the pasta and shock in an ice bath and place in a bowl.  Toss with some olive oil so it doesn't stick.

Toss the pasta with the arugula pesto, to taste.  Let cool, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until well chilled.  Toss the cubed chicken, red and yellow tomatoes, feta, and olives to the pasta, and toss to combine.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, and serve, garnished with baby arugula.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

                    Peruvian-Japanese Scallop Ceviche

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  rice wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  minced takanotsume chile -- plus
  1                     takanotsume chile -- julienned
                        = (or other hot red chile)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  mirin
  1              pound  fresh sushi-grade sea scallops -- sliced crosswise
                        into rounds as thinly as possible
  2          teaspoons  finely-chopped green onions
  1           teaspoon  toasted black sesame seeds
  1                cup  thinly-sliced peeled seeded cucumber
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce

Combine the rice vinegar, minced chiles, salt, and mirin in a glass bowl.  Add the sliced scallops and toss to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Add the green onion and sesame seeds, gently stirring to mix.

Arrange the cucumber slices on each of 4 plates.  Spoon the scallop mixture on top of the cucumbers and garnish with the julienned chiles.  Drizzle with soy sauce and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Ceviche has existed in Peru since the Incas.  However, many upper class Peruvians preferred meat to fish until the Japanese immigrants of the 20th century began opening seafood centered restaurants that inspired a resurgence love of fish and consequently the development of the ceviche we know today.  Here, Emeril pays homage to these traditions with a Japanese flavored ceviche.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Condiments

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  baking potatoes, like russets -- peeled, cubed
  1              quart  water
  2 1/2           cups  potato water
  1            package  active dry yeast
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 3/4            cup  all-purpose flour

In a medium saucepan, cover the potatoes with water.  Cook over medium heat until tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain the potatoes, reserving water and using potatoes for another use.  Cool the cooking liquid to lukewarm (110 degrees).

In a large bowl, combine the potato water, dry yeast, and sugar.  Let sit until the yeast blooms and becomes foamy, about 5 minutes.  (If the yeast does not bloom, discard the mixture and begin again with a new yeast.)  Add the flour and stir vigorously to work air into the mixture.  Cover with a towel let sit in a warm, draft-free place for 8 to 12 hours.  (The mixture should become very bubbly.)  Use immediately or cover loosely with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator.

Preserving the Starter:  Each time you remove a portion of the starter for a recipe, reserve at least 1/4 cup and replace the amount you have taken out with equal amounts of flour and water.

For example, if you remove 1 cup of starter, you must replace it with 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of warm water.  Whisk these ingredients into the starter until blended but not completely smooth, cover loosely, and return to the refrigerator.

Also, the starter must be maintained by feeding it every few days.  Refresh by removing 1 cup of the starter (give to a friend or discard it) and adding 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of warm water.  Whisk until blended but not smooth.  Cover loosely and return to the refrigerator.

If you plan to be away longer than a week, freeze the starter in a sterilized, airtight freezer container.  Thaw the starter 2 days before you plan to bake with it.  Refresh as indicated above with 1 cup each of flour and warm water.  Cover and leave at room temperature 12 hours or overnight before using.

This recipe yields about 3 cups.

CAUTION:  Never keep your starter tightly closed!  The gasses expelled by the yeast will build up pressure and may cause the container (such as a glass jar) to burst!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dried pinto beans -- soaked overnight,
                        and drained
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2           cup  bacon drippings or lard
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced seeded jalapeÒo
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped oregano
     1/2           cup  grated queso blanco
     1/4           cup  minced fresh cilantro -- garnish

In a medium, heavy pot, combine the beans, bay leaf, and enough water to cover by 1 to 2 inches.  Bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the beans are very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, adding more water as necessary to keep covered.  When the beans are soft, mash in the pot with a potato masher or the back of heavy wooden spoon.  Remove from the heat.

In a large, heavy skillet, heat the bacon fat over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, jalapeÒo, chili powder, cumin, salt, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 45 seconds to 1 minute.  Add the beans and any cooking liquid from the pot, and the oregano, and stir to combine.  Cook, stirring with a heavy wooden spoon, until the mixture forms a thick paste, 5 to 10 minutes, adding water 1 tablespoon at a time to keep from getting dry.

Remove from the heat and transfer to a decorative bowl.  Sprinkle with the cheese and cilantro, and serve.

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 cups (4 to 6 servings).

In a medium, heavy pot, combine the beans, bay leaf, and enough water to cover by 1 to 2 inches.  Bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the beans are very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, adding more water as necessary to keep covered.  When the beans are soft, mash in the pot with a potato masher or the back of heavy wooden spoon.  Remove from the heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large, heavy skillet, heat the bacon fat over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, jalapeÒo, chili powder, cumin, salt, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 45 seconds to 1 minute.  Add the beans and any cooking liquid from the pot, and the oregano, and stir to combine.  Cook, stirring with a heavy wooden spoon, until the mixture forms a thick paste, 5 to 10 minutes, adding water 1 tablespoon at a time to keep from getting dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove from the heat and transfer to a decorative bowl.  Sprinkle with the cheese and cilantro, and serve.

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 cups (4 to 6 servings).

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === BRIOCHE DOUGH ===
     1/2      teaspoon  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  whole milk -- warmed to 110
                        degrees
  1           teaspoon  active dry yeast
  1 1/4           cups  bread flour
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
                        === FILLING ===
     2/3           cup  dark rum
  3        tablespoons  honey
     2/3           cup  chopped dried dark figs
  1              pound  ricotta cheese
     1/4         pound  cream cheese -- room temperature
  3              whole  eggs
  1                     egg yolk
  6        tablespoons  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  2          teaspoons  lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cardamom
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar
  6                     mint sprigs

For the Brioche Dough:  Lightly grease a large bowl with the vegetable oil and set aside.  Combine the warm milk and the yeast in a large bowl and stir to combine.  Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.  Add 1/4 cup of the flour and stir to combine.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Using an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, beat the eggs, 1 at a time, into the yeast mixture.

Slowly add the remaining 1 cup of flour, the sugar, and salt, and beat until well incorporated, about 5 minutes.  Add the butter 2 tablespoons at a time, beating well between additions.  Blend until sticky dough forms.  Place in the oiled bowl, lightly turning to coat.  Cover with a kitchen cloth and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Turn out the brioche dough onto a lightly floured surface and punch down.  Roll out the dough to a circle about 14-inches in diameter.

Fit dough into a 9-inch pie pan, leaving about 1/2-inch overhang for shrinkage.  Line with parchment paper and fill with pie weights.  Bake until set, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven.  Remove the parchment and beans, return to the oven and bake until lightly colored, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

For the Filling:  In a medium bowl, combine the dark rum and honey, and stir.  Add the figs and marinate for 30 minutes.  Drain and discard the liquid.

Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Combine the ricotta and cream cheese until smooth in an electric mixer.  Add the whole eggs and egg yolk, 1 at a time.  Add sugar, lemon juice, zest, vanilla, and cardamom and mix until combined.  Drain the figs and fold into ricotta mixture.  Pour mixture into prepared shell.  Do not overfill the shell, as it will rise slightly when baking.

Bake until the filling is firm to the touch, about 1 hour.  Cool before serving.  Garnish with powdered sugar and mint.  Refrigerate any leftovers.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) pie.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Rosemary Focaccia Bread -- (listed below)
                        Roasted Red Bell Pepper Dressing -- (listed below)
  4               cups  arugula -- stems removed,
                        rinsed and patted dry
  1              pound  very thinly-sliced rare roast beef
     1/2                red onion -- very thinly sliced
  8             ounces  Maytag blue cheese
                        === ROSEMARY FOCACCIA BREAD ===
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  3          envelopes  active dry yeast - (3/4 oz)
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  2               cups  warm water -- (abt 110 degrees)
  5 1/2           cups  bread flour -- or more as needed
  3          teaspoons  fine salt
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
                        === ROASTED RED PEPPER DRESSING ===
  1              large  red bell pepper
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  minced shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced cilantro
  2        tablespoons  chiffonade fresh basil leaves
     1/4      teaspoon  balsamic vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper

Cut 4 large, equal pieces of focaccia bread from the loaf, and cut each open lengthwise.  Spread the cut sides of the bread with the red pepper dressing.

Lay the arugula on the bottom slices of bread and top with the roast beef.  Arrange the onions and cheese on top, and cover with the top slices of bread.  Press closed and wrap tightly in plastic wrap or waxed paper until ready to serve.

Rosemary Focaccia Bread:  Lightly oil a large bowl with 1 teaspoon of the oil and set aside.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the yeast, sugar, water, and 2 tablespoons of the oil, stir and let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.  Add the flour and the fine salt, and mix on low speed until the dough comes together and forms a ball, 2 to 3 minutes.  Increase the speed to medium and mix for 8 minutes.  If the dough is still sticky, continue mixing and gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup flour.

Form into a ball and place in the prepared bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel, and let rest in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Turn the dough out onto the baking sheet, pressing evenly across the bottom of the pan.  Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm, draft-free place until it rises until nearly doubled, 30 minutes to 1 hour.  With your fingertips, make dimples in the dough at 3-inch intervals.  Drizzle with the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil and sprinkle with the rosemary and kosher salt.  Bake on the lower oven rack until just golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

Remove from the oven and using a spatula, lift from the baking sheet and cool on a wire rack before cutting into squares or other desired shapes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.  (Makes one 9- by 13-inch bread)

Roasted Red Pepper Dressing:  Place the pepper on an open gas flame and roast, turning them frequently with tongs, until all sides are charred black, 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, the pepper can be roasted under a broiler, or on top of a gas or charcoal grill.)  Place the blackened pepper in a plastic or paper bag, and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.  Peel the pepper, remove the seeds and stems, and coarsely chop.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a small skillet over medium heat.  Add the shallots and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the peppers and cook for 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Combine the peppers, shallots, cilantro, basil, vinegar, salt, and pepper in the bowl of food processor or blender, and process for 20 seconds.  With the machine running, add the remaining oil through the feed tube in a steady stream and process until thick and smooth.  Transfer to a container until ready to serve.  (Makes about 1 cup)

This recipe yields 4 sandwiches.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === YORKSHIRE PUDDING ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour - (heaping)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  whole milk
  2              large  eggs
  3        tablespoons  beef drippings and fat
                        === ROAST ===
  1                     top round roast - (4 1/2 to 5 lbs) -- rinsed, patted dry
  16                    garlic cloves -- peeled
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme
  2                     teas pons salt
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  12                    small sprigs fresh thyme

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

To make the Yorkshire Pudding batter, in a bowl, combine the flour and salt.  In another bowl, beat the eggs.  Add the milk and gradually add to the flour, mixing to make a thin, smooth batter, being careful not to over mix.  Let rest for at least 1 hour at room temperature, or for several hours in the refrigerator (bringing to room temperature before cooking).

Put the roast in a small roasting pan, bone-side down.  With a small sharp knife, make sixteen 1/2-inch-deep slits in the meaty side of the roast.  Insert 1 garlic clove into each slit, pressing into the meat.  Pinch with your thumb and index finger to close the openings.

Combine the chopped thyme, salt, Essence, and pepper in a small bowl.  Slowly stir in the oil to make a paste.  Rub the paste on both sides of the roast, and place the thyme sprigs under the roast.  Roast for 1 hour.  Remove the pan from the oven and turn the roast for even browning.  Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the roast reads 125 to 130 degrees for medium-rare, about 45 minutes, or 140 degrees for medium, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let the roast stand for 15 minutes before carving.

While the roast is resting, make the Yorkshire Pudding in the same roasting pan.

Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees.  Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the hot pan drippings, adding hot melted butter as necessary to make the correct measure.  Place the pan in the oven to stay hot while the oven comes to temperature.

Pour the prepared batter into the dish and bake, without opening the oven door, until risen and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and serve immediately with the carved rib roast.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     chickens - (abt 3 lbs ea) -- giblets removed,
                        rinsed well and patted dry
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  8             sprigs  fresh thyme
                        === SAUTEED MUSHROOMS ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2                     sliced shallots
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2             pounds  assorted mushrooms
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh marjoram leaves
                        === LEMON HERB SAUCE ===
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  assorted chopped fresh herbs
                        = (such as basil, parsley, chives or
                        oregano)
                        Watercress -- for plating

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place the chickens on a flat work surface and using kitchen shears, cut away and remove the backbones.  With a sharp knife, cut each bird in half through the center of the breast.  Remove the breast and rib bones.  Cut away the outer 2/3 of the wing bone, leaving the last joint intact.  Cut into and remove the thighbone.  Repeat with the remaining chicken and reserve the bones for another use.

Plating 1:  Season the chickens on both sides with the Essence.  Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in each of 2 skillets over medium-high heat.  Place 2 chicken halves, skin-side up, in each hot pan and sear on 1 side for 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Add 2 tablespoons of the butter and 4 sprigs of thyme to each pan.  Place in the oven and roast for 16 minutes on the same side.  Remove from the oven and carefully turn the chicken halves with tongs.  Spoon pan juices over the skin side of each chicken and roast until the skin is crisp and the chickens are cooked through, about 10 minutes.

Remove from the oven and place the chicken halves on a cutting board.  Carefully cut away the breast from each half and carve into 5 slices.

Arrange the sliced breast along the top of a plate and place the leg to the side.  Spoon the sauce over the chickens and arrange the mushrooms to the side.  Garnish each plate with watercress and 4 sprigs of thyme and serve.

Plating 2:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Place the chickens on a flat work surface and using kitchen shears, cut away and remove the backbones.  With a sharp knife, cut each bird in half through the center of the breast.  Remove the breast and rib bones.  Cut away the outer 2/3 of the wing bone, leaving the last joint intact.  Cut into and remove the thighbone.  Repeat with the remaining chicken and reserve the bones for another use.  Lightly pound out the chicken halves between 2 sheets of plastic to flatten.  Season the inside of the chicken with salt and pepper.

Have the Sauteed mushrooms, cooled, in a bowl.  Place the mushrooms on the chicken and roll up, lengthwise, around the filling.  Tie the roll at 1-inch intervals.  Place the chicken roll in a hot pan and sear on all sides for 6 minutes.

Remove from the heat.  Add 2 tablespoons of the butter and 2 sprigs of thyme to each pan.  Place in the oven and roast for 16 minutes on the same side.  Remove from the oven and carefully turn the chicken halves with tongs.  Spoon pan juices over the skin side of each chicken and roast until the skin is crisp and the chickens are cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Remove and let rest on a cutting board for 5 minutes before slicing.

Slice the chicken roulade and put the slices on a platter.  Spoon the sauce around the roulade and plate with watercress.

For the Sauteed Mushrooms:  In a saute pan, add the butter and melt over medium heat.  Add the shallots and cook until translucent, about 4 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and saute until they have given up most of their liquid, about 8 minutes.  Add the herbs and season with salt and pepper.

For the Lemon Herb Sauce:  Put the chicken stock in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Remove from the heat.

Combine the stock and mustard in a blender or food processor, and process on high speed.  With the motor running, add the lemon juice, olive oil, and herbs, and process until smooth.  Transfer to a gravy boat or measuring cup and cover to keep warm until ready to serve.  (Makes about 1 1/4 cups)

This recipe yields 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     red bell peppers
     1/4           cup  Roasted Garlic -- (listed below)
     1/2         pound  feta cheese -- drained
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon juice
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes -- or to taste
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish
                        === ROASTED GARLIC ===
  2              heads  garlic -- upper quarter
                        removed
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === PITA CHIPS ===
  6                     pitas
  1 1/2      teaspoons  garlic powder
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1              pinch  cayenne
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cumin
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

For the peppers: Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, 7 to 10 minutes.  Place in a plastic or paper bag, and cool for about 15 minutes.  Peel the peppers, remove the seeds and stems, and discard.  Coarsely chop the peppers.

Transfer the peppers and garlic to a food processor and process until smooth.  Add the cheese and process until smooth.  With the machine running, add 1/4 cup of the extra-virgin olive oil and lemon juice in a steady stream through the feed tube.  Add the basil, oregano, red pepper flakes, and 1/4 teaspoon salt, and process until smooth.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Transfer to a decorative bowl and refrigerate for 1 hour.  Before serving, drizzle with the remaining 1 teaspoon of extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with the parsley.  Serve cool or at room temperature, with pita chips for dipping.

For the Roasted Garlic:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the garlic on a foil-lined baking sheet and rub 1 teaspoon of oil into the top of each head.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and place, cut-side down, on the baking sheet.  Bake until the cloves are soft and golden, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.  Squeeze each head of garlic to expel the cloves into a bowl.  Mash into a paste.  Set aside until needed.  (Makes 1/4 cup)  Note: Each head of garlic makes approximately 2 tablespoons of roasted garlic

For the Pita Chips:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Cut each of the pitas into 8 triangles.  Place the pitas in a bowl and toss with granulated garlic, kosher salt, cayenne, cumin, dried oregano, and olive oil.  Toss well and spread out on a sheet pan.  Bake until golden brown and crisp, about 10 to 15 minutes, shaking the pan once during cooking.  Cool and serve.  (Makes 48 chips)

This recipe yields about 2 cups.

For the peppers: Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, 7 to 10 minutes.  Place in a plastic or paper bag, and cool for about 15 minutes.  Peel the peppers, remove the seeds and stems, and discard.  Coarsely chop the peppers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the peppers and garlic to a food processor and process until smooth.  Add the cheese and process until smooth.  With the machine running, add 1/4 cup of the extra-virgin olive oil and lemon juice in a steady stream through the feed tube.  Add the basil, oregano, red pepper flakes, and 1/4 teaspoon salt, and process until smooth.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Transfer to a decorative bowl and refrigerate for 1 hour.  Before serving, drizzle with the remaining 1 teaspoon of extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with the parsley.  Serve cool or at room temperature, with pita chips for dipping.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Roasted Garlic:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the garlic on a foil-lined baking sheet and rub 1 teaspoon of oil into the top of each head.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and place, cut-side down, on the baking sheet.  Bake until the cloves are soft and golden, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.  Squeeze each head of garlic to expel the cloves into a bowl.  Mash into a paste.  Set aside until needed.  (Makes 1/4 cup)  Note: Each head of garlic makes approximately 2 tablespoons of roasted garlic
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Pita Chips:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Cut each of the pitas into 8 triangles.  Place the pitas in a bowl and toss with granulated garlic, kosher salt, cayenne, cumin, dried oregano, and olive oil.  Toss well and spread out on a sheet pan.  Bake until golden brown and crisp, about 10 to 15 minutes, shaking the pan once during cooking.  Cool and serve.  (Makes 48 chips)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened
  4          teaspoons  fine dry bread crumbs
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  2              large  eggs
  4                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  Roasted Garlic -- (listed below)
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  grated Parmesan
  24             large  shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        === ROASTED GARLIC ===
  2              heads  garlic -- upper quarter
                        removed
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GREEN ONION COULIS ===
  1              bunch  green onions -- green tops only
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pinch  salt

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Lightly butter 4 (3/4-cup/6-ounce) ramekins and dust the bottoms and sides of each with 1 teaspoon of bread crumbs and set inside a roasting pan large enough to hold the cups without touching.

In a small saucepan, gently heat the cream and thyme.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.  In a large bowl, beat the eggs and egg yolks.  Add the roasted garlic, salt, and pepper and whisk together.  Add the warm cream and whisk until smooth.  Add the Parmesan and whisk to combine.  Pour into the prepared custard cups and fill the roasting pan with warm water to come half way up the sides of the ramekins.  Bake until set and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.

When the custards are nearly ready, in a bowl toss the shrimp with the Essence to coat.  Heat a large, heavy, ungreased skillet over high heat.  When very hot, add the shrimp and sear until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Remove the cups from the water and wipe dry.  Run a thin, sharp knife around the edges to loosen the custards.  Invert onto plates and shake gently to release.  Spoon a small amount of the Green Onion Coulis on top, and surround with shrimp and serve.

For the Roasted Garlic:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the garlic on a foil-lined baking sheet and rub 1 teaspoon of oil into the top of each head.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and place, cut-side down, on the baking sheet.  Bake until the cloves are soft and golden, about 1 hour.  Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.  Squeeze each head of garlic to expel the cloves into a bowl.  Mash into a paste.  Set aside until needed.

For the Green Onion Coulis:  Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the green onions and blanch for 20 seconds.  Remove with a slotted spoon and shock in an ice bath.  Remove and dry on towels.  Thinly slice and puree in a blender with the olive oil and salt.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste, and serve with the Roast Garlic Custards.

This recipe yields 4 servings (depending on size).

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  dry sherry
  1         tablespoon  minced gingerroot
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  12            ounces  chicken livers -- rinsed, drained,
                        and cut into 24 pieces
  4               cups  vegetable oil
  1                can  water chestnuts - (4 oz) -- drained, and
                        cut into 24 pieces
  12            slices  bacon -- halved lengthwise
                        Skewers or toothpicks

In a shallow bowl, combine the soy sauce, sherry, ginger and garlic.  Add the chicken livers and toss to coat.  Let marinate refrigerated for 2 to 4 hours.

Place the oil in a deep pot or a fryer and heat to 350 degrees.  Place the bacon flat on a work surface and scrape with the back of a knife to prevent from shrinking while cooking.  Remove the livers from the marinade and pat dry.  Place 1 chicken liver piece on each bacon half and top with a water chestnut slice.  Roll up to enclose the livers and chestnuts in the bacon.  Secure with a toothpick or long skewer.

Carefully add to the hot oil in batches.  Fry until golden brown and the livers are cooked through, about 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Remove the skewers or toothpicks and place the rumaki on a platter.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 2 dozen.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  bacon grease
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1                cup  finely-chopped yellow onions
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped green bell peppers
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper -- or to taste
  2                     bay leaves
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  3               cups  finely-chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chopped fresh oregano
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh basil
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  hot pepper sauce
  2               cups  cold shrimp stock or fish stock
  6                     skinless puppy drum fillets - (6 oz ea)
                        = (small redfish)
  2             pounds  medium shrimp -- peeled, deveined
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  6               cups  steamed long-grain white rice -- as accompaniment
                        === GARNISH ===
     1/2           cup  chopped green onions -- green tops only

To make the Creole Sauce:  in a medium, heavy pot, heat the bacon grease over medium heat.  Add the flour and stirring constantly with a heavy wooden spoon, cook until a light brown roux forms, about 6 minutes.

Add the onions, celery, and bell pepper and cook over medium heat, until the vegetables are tender, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the garlic, salt, red pepper, and bay leaves, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until it starts to color, about 2 minutes.  Add the tomatoes, oregano, basil, thyme, lemon zest, Worcestershire, and hot sauce, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the stock and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the sauce thickens and reduces by 25 percent in volume, 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add the fish to the Creole sauce and cook until firm and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the shrimp and parsley, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are just cooked through and pink, about 3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and discard the bay leaves.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.

Mound the rice in the center of 6 large, shallow bowls.  Top with a fish fillet and spoon the Shrimp Creole over the fish.  Garnish with green onions and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1                     ham hock - (abt 8 oz) -- scored
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1 1/2         pounds  green beans -- trimmed and halved

Note:  The salt and pepper we used here were suitable for the ham hock we had.  However, depending upon the cure of your ham hock, you may require more or less salt.  That said, hold off on adding the salt until about halfway through the cooking process.

Add the oil in a medium, heavy saucepan.  Add the onion and saute until tender, about 3 minutes.  Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne.  Add the ham hocks, garlic, and beans.  Add enough water to almost completely cover the beans.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours.  Remove from the heat and serve with the cooking liquid.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  While the cooking time may seem extremely long, this is an old-fashioned southern means of cooking vegetables.  When cooked this way, the beans are served with their "pot liquor" and cornbread to sop it up.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     Anaheim chile peppers
  12            ounces  medium shrimp -- shelled, deveined,
                        and cut in half lengthwise
  2          teaspoons  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  6                     flour tortillas - (9" dia)
  1 1/2           cups  grated Monterey Jack
  1 1/2           cups  grated sharp Cheddar
                        === SMOKED MUSHROOMS ===
  8             ounces  button mushrooms -- wiped clean,
                        stemmed and thickly sliced
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
                        === ADOBO CHILE SALSA ===
  2               cups  chopped peeled seeded tomatoes
     1/3           cup  chopped white onions
  2                     chipotle chiles in adobo -- with
  1           teaspoon  adobo sauce
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1           teaspoon  minced jalapeÒo
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs until all the sides are charred black, 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler, or on top of a gas or charcoal grill.)  Put the peppers in a plastic or paper bag, and cool for about 15 minutes.

Peel the peppers, remove the seeds and stems, and discard.  Coarsely chop the peppers.

In a bowl, season the shrimp with the Essence, tossing to coat evenly.  Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large, non-stick skillet over medium-high.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 15 seconds.  Add the shrimp and cook until the shrimp are just pink, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a plate to cool.  Wipe the skillet clean.

In a bowl combine the 2 cheeses.

On a work surface, spread 3 of the tortillas.  Sprinkle about 1/2 cup of the cheese over the bottom of each tortilla.  Top each with 1/3 of the shrimp, mushrooms, and chiles.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of the remaining cheese and top with a tortilla, pressing to adhere.

Add 1 teaspoon of the remaining oil to the pan over high heat.  Add 1 assembled quesadilla and cook until the cheese starts to melt and the bottom starts to brown, about 3 minutes.  Turn with a large spatula and cook until the bottom is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove to a baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm.  Repeat with the remaining oil and quesadillas.

To serve, cut each quesadilla into 6 wedges and divide among plates.  Serve with the poblano salsa on the side for dipping.

For the Smoked Mushrooms:  Combine the mushrooms, oil, and Essence in a medium bowl and toss to coat evenly.

Prepare a stovetop smoker according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Place the mushrooms on the grill pan and cover the smoker, leaving the lid ajar by 1-inch.  Place over medium heat on top of the stove.  When it begins to smoke, close the lid completely.  Cook until the mushrooms are tender and completely smoked, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the smoker and set aside until ready to assemble the quesadillas.

For the Adobo Chile Salsa:  Combine all the ingredients in a blender and blend until just smooth but still slightly chunky.  Transfer to a bowl and serve with the quesadillas.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs until all the sides are charred black, 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler, or on top of a gas or charcoal grill.)  Put the peppers in a plastic or paper bag, and cool for about 15 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Peel the peppers, remove the seeds and stems, and discard.  Coarsely chop the peppers.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl, season the shrimp with the Essence, tossing to coat evenly.  Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large, non-stick skillet over medium-high.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 15 seconds.  Add the shrimp and cook until the shrimp are just pink, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a plate to cool.  Wipe the skillet clean.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl combine the 2 cheeses.
</DirT>
<DirT>
On a work surface, spread 3 of the tortillas.  Sprinkle about 1/2 cup of the cheese over the bottom of each tortilla.  Top each with 1/3 of the shrimp, mushrooms, and chiles.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of the remaining cheese and top with a tortilla, pressing to adhere.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Add 1 teaspoon of the remaining oil to the pan over high heat.  Add 1 assembled quesadilla and cook until the cheese starts to melt and the bottom starts to brown, about 3 minutes.  Turn with a large spatula and cook until the bottom is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove to a baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm.  Repeat with the remaining oil and quesadillas.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve, cut each quesadilla into 6 wedges and divide among plates.  Serve with the poblano salsa on the side for dipping.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Smoked Mushrooms:  Combine the mushrooms, oil, and Essence in a medium bowl and toss to coat evenly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare a stovetop smoker according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions.  Place the mushrooms on the grill pan and cover the smoker, leaving the lid ajar by 1-inch.  Place over medium heat on top of the stove.  When it begins to smoke, close the lid completely.  Cook until the mushrooms are tender and completely smoked, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the smoker and set aside until ready to assemble the quesadillas.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the Adobo Chile Salsa:  Combine all the ingredients in a blender and blend until just smooth but still slightly chunky.  Transfer to a bowl and serve with the quesadillas.
</DirT>

This recipe yields 4 servings.

          Spiked Watermelon Daiquiri With Citrus-Ginger Infusion

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 20    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2           cups  coarsely-chopped cored fresh pineapple
  16              cups  Spiked Watermelon -- (listed below)
  5               cups  Citrus-Ginger Infusion -- (listed below)
  30              cups  ice
                        Citrus-Flavored Vodka -- as desired
                        Fresh mint sprigs -- garnish
                        Straws -- garnish
                        === SPIKED WATERMELON ===
  1                     seedless yellow watermelon - (abt 10 lbs)
  3               cups  citrus-flavored vodka
                        === CITRUS-GINGER INFUSION ===
  2 1/2           cups  water
  5               cups  granulated sugar
  2               cups  chopped lemon grass
     1/2           cup  julienned fresh ginger
  4                     lemons -- zested and juiced

Place the pineapple in a plastic container in the freezer until completely frozen, at least 3 hours.

In a blender, combine 1 1/2 cups spiked watermelon, 6 tablespoons frozen pineapple, and 1/2 cup Citrus-Ginger Infusion.  (Amount of infusion may be increased or decreased according to individual taste.)  Blend on high speed until well combined.  Add enough ice to fill the blender, 3 cups, and additional vodka, as desired, and blend until smooth.  Pour into tall chilled glasses or a pitcher.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients, to make about 10 blenderfuls.  Garnish with mint sprigs and serve with a long straw.

For the Spiked Watermelon:  Cut a hole in the top of the watermelon, wide and deep enough to insert a funnel.  Pour in as much vodka through the funnel as can be absorbed (1/2 to 1 cup).  Remove the funnel and replace the watermelon plug.  Let sit for 4 hours.

Again, pour in as much vodka as can be absorbed.  Repeat the process until all the vodka has been absorbed.  (The watermelon flesh gradually will absorb all the vodka.)  Refrigerate until well chilled.  When ready to make the daiquiris, cut the watermelon in half and scoop out the flesh.

For the Citrus-Ginger Infusion:  Combine the water, sugar, lemon grass, ginger, and lemon juice and zest in large saucepan.  Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a clean container and reserve for the daiquiris.  (Infusion will keep for 2 weeks, refrigerated and also may be used to flavor dressings or drizzle over fresh fruit.)

This recipe yields about 20 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Poblano chile peppers - (abt 1 lb)
  4             pounds  fresh spinach -- stems removed,
                        and well rinsed
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- divided
  1                cup  chopped yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  cayenne
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour -- divided
  2               cups  half-and-half
  1                cup  cubed queso fresco or queso blanco
  1                cup  cubed Pepper Jack -- plus
  1                cup  grated Pepper Jack
  1                cup  grated cotija or Parmesan
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  12                    corn tortillas
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        Refried Beans -- (see recipe)
                        Mexican Rice -- (see recipe)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, about 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler, or on top of a gas or charcoal grill.)  Place the blackened peppers in a plastic or paper bag, and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.  Peel the peppers, split in half lengthwise, and discard the seeds and the stems.  Roughly chop and set aside.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  In 3 batches, add the spinach and blanch for 15 seconds.  Remove with a slotted spoon and shock in an ice bath.  Remove and squeeze out the excess.  Chop and set aside.

In a large saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until very soft, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, chili powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, for 45 seconds.  Add 1/4 cup of the flour and cook, stirring with a heavy wooden spoon, to make a light roux, 2 minutes.  Gradually add the half-and-half, and cook, stirring, until thick, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the spinach and stir to incorporate.  Remove from the heat and fold in half of the chopped chiles.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Fold in the cubed queso fresco and both Pepper Jacks, and set aside.

In a bowl, combine the grated Pepper Jack and cotija.  Set aside.

In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium temperature.  One at a time, add the tortillas to the hot oil and cook, turning, until soft and pliable, 15 seconds per side, adding more oil as needed.  Remove from the pan and place on a work surface.  Place about 1/2 cup of the spinach mixture into the center of each tortilla and roll up into a cylinder.  Place, seam-side down, in a single layer across the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch casserole dish.

In a saucepan, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup of flour and cook, stirring constantly with a heavy wooden spoon, to make a light roux.  Slowly add the chicken stock and cook, stirring, until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the cream and cook, stirring, until thick, about 2 minutes.  Add the remaining poblano peppers and cook for 1 minute.

Pour over the filled enchiladas and bake for 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cover evenly with the grated cheeses.  Return to the oven and bake until the cheeses are melted and bubbly and the enchiladas are completely warmed through, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.

Serve with Refried Beans and Mexican Rice.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Roast the peppers by placing them on an open gas flame, turning them frequently with tongs until all sides are charred black, about 7 to 10 minutes.  (Alternately, the peppers can be roasted under a broiler, or on top of a gas or charcoal grill.)  Place the blackened peppers in a plastic or paper bag, and let rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.  Peel the peppers, split in half lengthwise, and discard the seeds and the stems.  Roughly chop and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  In 3 batches, add the spinach and blanch for 15 seconds.  Remove with a slotted spoon and shock in an ice bath.  Remove and squeeze out the excess.  Chop and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, until very soft, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the garlic, chili powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne, and cook, stirring, for 45 seconds.  Add 1/4 cup of the flour and cook, stirring with a heavy wooden spoon, to make a light roux, 2 minutes.  Gradually add the half-and-half, and cook, stirring, until thick, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the spinach and stir to incorporate.  Remove from the heat and fold in half of the chopped chiles.  Adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Fold in the cubed queso fresco and both Pepper Jacks, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a bowl, combine the grated Pepper Jack and cotija.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium temperature.  One at a time, add the tortillas to the hot oil and cook, turning, until soft and pliable, 15 seconds per side, adding more oil as needed.  Remove from the pan and place on a work surface.  Place about 1/2 cup of the spinach mixture into the center of each tortilla and roll up into a cylinder.  Place, seam-side down, in a single layer across the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch casserole dish.

                        === HOISIN BUTTER SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  prepared hoisin sauce
  2        tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
  8             ounces  cold unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- cut into tbspns

Gently wash the squash blossoms in a sink of lightly salted water to remove any insects or dirt.  Remove and dry.

With a thin knife, cut the squash almost in half lengthwise, starting at the bottom end and working toward the blossom, to open for better cooking.

In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, pepper jack, green onions, bell pepper, cilantro, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and white pepper, and mix well.  Fold in the crabmeat.  Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag without a tip.  Pipe the crabmeat mixture into each squash blossom, about 1 1/2 tablespoons per blossom.

In a large, heavy pot, heat the oil to 350 degrees.

To make the tempura batter, in a medium bowl, combine the cornstarch and Essence.  Slowly add the cold soda water, whisking to make a thin batter.  Add the ice to make the batter cold.  Place the stuffed squash in the batter, 1 at a time, shaking to remove any excess.  In batches, carefully drop into the hot oil and fry until golden, about 3 minutes.  Remove and drain on paper towels.  Season lightly with Essence, to taste.

Transfer squash blossoms to a large platter and serve hot with the Hoisin Butter Sauce.

For the Hoisin Butter Sauce:  In a medium, heavy saucepan, gently heat the hoisin and vinegar over medium-low heat.  Whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, adding each piece before the previous one has been completely incorporated.  Continue until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, removing the pan from the heat periodically to prevent the sauce from getting too hot and breaking.  Keep warm while you prepare the squash blossoms.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  ground nutmeg
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground cloves
  1           teaspoon  ground mace
  1           teaspoon  ground cardamom
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground anise
  3             sticks  unsalted butter -- softened
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  12             large  eggs -- separated
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  confectioners' sugar

Preheat the broiler.  Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch round cake pan or springform pan.  Line with parchment paper and butter the paper.  Set aside.

In a small bowl, combine the nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, mace, cardamom, ginger and anise.  Set aside.  In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter, 1/2 cup of the sugar, vanilla, and salt.  Add the egg yolks and beat until smooth.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and fold the flour into the batter with a rubber spatula.

In a clean bowl, using clean beaters, beat the egg whites with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar until stiff.  Fold into egg yolk mixture, being careful not to overmix.  Divide the batter between 2 bowls.  Add combined spices to 1 bowl and stir well.

Pour about 1/2 cup of the spiced batter into the prepared pan, spreading to form a thin layer.  Place the pan under the preheated broiler for 2 minutes, or until the layer is firm and very lightly browned.  Remove from the oven and spread about 1/2 cup of the plain batter over the top and broil until firm.  Repeat layering spiced and plain batters in the pan and broiling until all the batter is used.  Note that the cake typically has between 12 and 15 layers.)

Let the cake cool on a wire rack then turn out from the pan.  Place on a cake plate and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.  Thinly slice and serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 1 (9-inch) round cake.

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  heavy cream
  1                cup  granulated sugar -- plus
  8          teaspoons  granulated sugar
  1                     vanilla bean -- split, seeds scraped
  8              large  egg yolks
  35                    wafer cookies

In medium, non-reactive saucepan, combine the cream, 1/2 cup of the sugar, and the vanilla bean and seeds over medium heat.  Bring to a gentle boil, whisking to dissolve the sugar.

In a small mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of sugar.  Whisk about 2 cups of the hot cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture until smooth.  Slowly pour this mixture into the hot cream mixture, whisk for 2 minutes, and remove from the heat.  Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean container. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Plating 1:  Fill 8 (6-ounce) custard cups with equal portions of the mixture.  Place the cups in a deep roasting pan or baking dish large enough to accommodate the cups without touching.  Fill the roasting pan with enough water to come halfway up the sides of the cups.

Bake in the lower third of the oven until just set, about 45 minutes.  Remove from the oven and remove the cups from the water.  Let cool.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

Sprinkle each cup with 1 teaspoon sugar.  One at a time, using a kitchen blowtorch, approach the sugar with the torch at a low angle until the inner blue flame is 1/4-inch above the surface and move the flame in a continuous motion over the surface until the sugar has caramelized.

Or, preheat the broiler, sprinkle the sugar over the custards, and slide the dishes under the broiler.  Broil until the sugar caramelizes, 1 to 2 minutes, watching carefully so the custard does not curdle or break.  Remove and serve.

Before serving, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the remaining sugar on the top of each custard.

Plating 2:  Fill a shallow baking dish with the mixture.  Place in a medium roasting pan and fill with enough water to come halfway up the sides of the dish.

Bake in the lower third of the oven until just set, about 45 minutes.  Remove from the oven and remove the cups from the water.  Let cool.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

To serve, arrange 25 to 35 wafer cookies on a baking sheet (the amount will depend upon the amount spread onto each cookie).  With a flat knife, scoop and smoothly spread the custard mixture onto each cookie.

Sprinkle the top of each lightly with sugar, and using a kitchen blowtorch, approach the sugar with the torch at a low angle until the inner blue flame is 1/4-inch above the surface and move the flame in a continuous motion over the surface until the sugar has caramelized.

Wait several minutes to cool before serving on a decorative platter as a passed dessert.

This recipe yields 8 to 25 servings.

     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        === SALAD ===
  1              pound  asparagus spears -- trimmed, and

Recipe By     :Emeril Lagasse
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  granulated sugar
  1 3/4           cups  shortening
  2              large  eggs
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  baking cocoa
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  buttermilk
  1         tablespoon  pure vanilla extract -- plus
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2              large  egg whites
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  whole milk
  3               cups  confectioners' sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease 2 baking sheets and set aside.

To make the cookies, in a large bowl using an electric mixer, cream together the sugar and 1/2 cup of the shortening.  Add eggs and mix well.

Onto a sheet of waxed paper, sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.  Add to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk.  Add 1 teaspoon of the vanilla and mix well.  Drop by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.  Bake until tester comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on wire racks.

To make the filling, in a large bowl using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until stiff.  Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups of shortening and 1 tablespoon of vanilla, and mix well.  Add the milk and sugar, and beat until smooth.

Lay half of the cookies flat on a work surface.  Divide the filling among the cookies, spreading out to the edges.  Top with the remaining cookies to form sandwich pies.  Serve immediately, or cover tightly and refrigerate before serving.

This recipe yields about 2 dozen.

Caution:  The American Egg Board states: "There have been warnings against consuming raw or lightly cooked eggs on the grounds that the egg may be contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria responsible for a type of foodborne illness.  Healthy people need to remember that there is a very small risk and treat eggs and other raw animal foods accordingly.  Use only properly refrigerated, clean, sound-shelled, fresh, grade AA or A eggs.  Avoid mixing yolks and whites with the shell."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              small  baked brioche rolls
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  minced shallots
  2          teaspoons  minced garlic
  2             pounds  assorted fresh wild mushrooms* -- wiped clean,
                        ends trimmed, and sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  Madeira
  1                cup  veal stock
                        = (or beef stock)
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  chives
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh parsley
  3             ounces  enoki mushrooms -- wiped clean

* Such as shiitake, oyster, woodear, chanterelle, or porcini.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Place the brioche on a baking sheet and bake in the oven until warmed through but not hard, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cut the top 1/3 from each brioche.  Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.

In a large skillet or saute pan, melt the butter and oil over medium-high heat.  Add the shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring, until soft, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the mushrooms, salt, and pepper, and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are wilted and start to give off their liquid, about 4 minutes.  Add the Madeira and cook, stirring, until the liquid is reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Add the veal stock and bring to a boil.  Simmer, stirring, until reduced by half and thickened, about 5 minutes.  Add the cream and lemon juice, and cook until reduced and thickened, about 3 minutes.  Add the chives, Essence, tarragon and parsley, stir well, and adjust the seasoning, to taste.  Remove from the heat.

Place 1 brioche on each of 6 plates.  Spoon the mushroom mixture into each brioche and top with the brioche lid.  Arrange the enoki mushrooms decoratively on the plates and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  shrimp -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  1           teaspoon  Essence
                        = (see Bayou Blast recipe)
     3/4         pound  chorizo -- halved lengthwise,
                        and sliced into half-moon discs
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  chopped yellow onions
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  Italian seasoning
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4               cups  grated zucchini - (abt 2 lbs)
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  grated Fontina
  1                cup  fine dry bread crumbs
  4          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  Parmesan

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9-inch glass baking dish and set aside.

In a bowl, toss the diced shrimp with the Essence to coat, and set aside.

In a large skillet or saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the chorizo and cook until the fat is rendered.  Drain excess fat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the zucchini and oregano, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the zucchini is wilted and about half of the liquid has evaporated, about 7 minutes.  Add the seasoned shrimp and cook, stirring, until the shrimp are pink and most of the zucchini liquid has evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool for 15 minutes.

In a large skillet or saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the chorizo and cook until the fat is rendered.  Drain excess fat.  Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.  Add the garlic, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.  Add the zucchini and oregano, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the zucchini is wilted and about half of the liquid has evaporated, about 7 minutes.  Add the seasoned shrimp and cook, stirring, until the shrimp are pink and most of the zucchini liquid has evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let cool for 15 minutes.
