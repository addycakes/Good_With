                        === SHALLOT VINAIGRETTE ===
     2/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  shallot -- minced
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CROSTINI ===
  12            slices  baguette, 1/2" thick
                        = (day old bread works too)
     1/3           cup  shallot oil
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh herbs
                        = (such as thyme, rosemary, parsley;

     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

For the vinaigrette:  Pour olive oil into a microwave safe dish.  Add shallots to oil and place oil in microwave.  Heat oil and shallots for 30 seconds on high.  Remove from microwave and let stand 5 minutes.  (Oil and shallots may be heated over low heat on the stovetop in a small pan for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and let stand until cool.)  Reserve 1/3 of a cup of the shallot oil for the crostini.  Pour oil and shallots in a bowl and whisk in 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar.

For crostini:  Cut day old or frozen bread into rounds 1/4-inch thick.  Char grill or broil toasts on each side.  Dot toasts with your infused shallot oil.  Top toasts with chopped herbs, black pepper and grated cheese.  Broil toasts until cheese is golden brown, 45 seconds to 1 minute.

Assembly:  Drizzle vinaigrette over salad and toss to coat.  Season with salt and pepper, to your taste.  Serve with crostini.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2         pounds  pork tenderloins
                        = (2 packages with 2 tenderloins in each)
  4        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  4        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  8                     garlic cloves -- cracked
                        Steak seasoning blend -- to taste
                        = (or coarse salt and black pepper)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         quarts  Caponata -- (see recipe)
                        === POLENTA ===
  3               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  quick-cook polenta
                        = (found in Italian foods or
                        specialty foods aisles)
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme -- leaves removed
                        and chopped
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary -- leaves removed,
                        and finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  grated Romano or Parmigiano
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === OPTIONAL SALAD ===
  6               cups  mixed greens
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Reheat caponata in the microwave or on the stovetop.

Polenta:  Bring 3 cups chicken broth to a boil.  Add polenta and stir constantly until the cornmeal masses together.  Stir in herbs, butter, cheese, salt, and pepper.

Spread polenta out over a serving platter.  Make a shallow well from the center out and fill the prepared caponata.  This stands as a complete dinner on its own, so rich with vitamins and fresh vegetables.

If you prepare a salad, keep it simple.  Dress mixed greens with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper.  Caponata can also be used as a bruschetta topping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  4             pieces  boneless skinless chicken - -- (6 to 8 oz ea)
                        = (or 4 [6-oz] thin-cut chicken cutlets)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives  - (abt 10 blades)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill -- finely chopped
  1                     garlic clove -- finely chopped
  6        tablespoons  chilled butter
  1                cup  flour
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  plain bread crumbs
  1                     lemon wedge
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Plain round toothpicks -- as needed
                        === SERVING SUGGESTION ===
                        Potatoes And Onions -- (see recipe)
                        Red Radish Salad -- (see recipe)

In a large, deep skillet, heat 1 1/2 inches vegetable oil over medium-high heat.  The oil needs to be 360 degrees for frying.  If you do not have a frying thermometer, add a cube of white bread to hot oil.  If the bread browns in a 40 count, the oil is ready.

Cover work surface with waxed paper.  Arrange breasts on paper.  Butterfly small chicken breasts, cut into flesh and across, but not through the breast, and open them up.  The 6-ounce thin cut breasts may just be removed from package and arranged on waxed paper.  Cover breast meat with a second sheet of waxed paper.  Pound out cutlets to 1/4-inch thick with a small heavy skillet or a rubber mallet.  Be careful not to tear meat.  Roll up waxed paper and breasts and set aside.

Combine chopped herbs on cutting board with chopped garlic.  Cut 4 (1 1/2 tablespoons) pieces of cold butter and coat each piece liberally with the herb garlic mixture.

In 3 disposable pie tins, set out flour, eggs beaten with a splash of cold water and bread crumbs.  Uncover chicken and squeeze a wedge of lemon over breasts.  Season chicken with salt and pepper.  Place an herb-covered piece of butter on each piece of chicken.  Wrap and roll cutlets tightly up and over the butter cubes.  Secure stuffed chicken with toothpicks.  Roll stuffed breasts in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs.  Discard pie tins used for breading.

Fry the Kiev bundles 7 to 8 minutes on each side until deep golden brown all over.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

In a large, deep skillet, heat 1 1/2 inches vegetable oil over medium-high heat.  The oil needs to be 360 degrees for frying.  If you do not have a frying thermometer, add a cube of white bread to hot oil.  If the bread browns in a 40 count, the oil is ready.

Cover work surface with waxed paper.  Arrange breasts on paper.  Butterfly small chicken breasts, cut into flesh and across, but not through the breast, and open them up.  The 6-ounce thin cut breasts may just be removed from package and arranged on waxed paper.  Cover breast meat with a second sheet of waxed paper.  Pound out cutlets to 1/4-inch thick with a small heavy skillet or a rubber mallet.  Be careful not to tear meat.  Roll up waxed paper and breasts and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine chopped herbs on cutting board with chopped garlic.  Cut 4 (1 1/2 tablespoons) pieces of cold butter and coat each piece liberally with the herb garlic mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In 3 disposable pie tins, set out flour, eggs beaten with a splash of cold water and bread crumbs.  Uncover chicken and squeeze a wedge of lemon over breasts.  Season chicken with salt and pepper.  Place an herb-covered piece of butter on each piece of chicken.  Wrap and roll cutlets tightly up and over the butter cubes.  Secure stuffed chicken with toothpicks.  Roll stuffed breasts in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs.  Discard pie tins used for breading.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (3 turns around pan in a slow stream)
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2                     flat fillets of anchovies - (to 3) -- drained
  6                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  1                     fresh or dried bay leaf
  2                     celery ribs -- chopped
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1                cup  good-quality dry white wine
  1                     container chicken stock - (14 oz)
  1                can  chunky-style crushed tomatoes - (32 oz)
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme -- leaves removed
  1                     handful flat-leaf parsley -- chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  cod -- cut 2" chunks
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  8              large  shrimp -- peeled, deveined
                        = (or ask for deveined easy-peel)
  8                     sea scallops
  16                    raw mussels - (to 20) -- scrubbed
                        A loaf of fresh crusty bread -- for mopping

In a large pot over moderate heat combine oil, crushed pepper, anchovies, garlic, and bay.  Let anchovies melt into oil.  The anchovies act as a natural salt, the pepper flakes will infuse the oil, providing heat.

Chop celery and onion near stove and add to the pot as you work.  Saute vegetables for a few minutes to begin to soften and add wine to the pot.  Reduce wine a minute, then add chicken stock, tomatoes, thyme, and parsley.  Bring sauce to a bubble and reduce heat to medium low.

Season fish chunks with salt and pepper.  Add fish and simmer 5 minutes, giving the pot a shake now and then.  Do not stir your soup with a spoon after the addition of fish or you will break it up.  Add shrimp, scallops, and mussels and cover pot.  Cook 10 minutes, giving the pot a good shake now and again.

Remove the lid and discard any mussels that do not open.  Carefully ladle stew into shallow bowls and pass bread at the table.

This recipe yields 4 healthy servings.

Categories    : Breads/Rolls                    Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  butter - (1/2 stick)
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1                cup  cornmeal
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  slivered fresh sage -- (from 4 sprigs)
  2             ounces  walnut halves or pieces
                        = (a couple of handfuls from the bulk
                        bins in market will due)
                        Butter -- for topping cakes
                        Honey -- for topping cakes

Heat a nonstick griddle or nonstick skillet over moderate heat.

In a small saucepan, melt butter and transfer to a small mixing bowl.  Wipe out pan and return to heat with 1 1/2 cups water.  Bring water to a boil over high heat.  Add cornmeal to a large mixing bowl add the hot water, stir to combine.

Beat eggs, milk, and sugar with melted butter and stir this mixture into cornmeal.  Sprinkle a little salt into bowl.  Add 1 cup all-purpose flour into a strainer or a sifter.  Knock strainer to add flour into corn cake mix.  Add sage to batter and stir to combine.

Wipe a pat of butter, nestled in paper toweling, across the griddle pan to grease it.  Place small ladles of corn cake batter onto griddle or skillet: make cakes 3-inches wide and allow a bit of space between them in the pan.  Nest a few walnut bits into wet batter as the cakes begin to cook.  Cook cakes 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown.

Serve cakes with softened butter and honey for drizzling.  YUMMY!

This recipe yields 10 to 12 small corn cakes.

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beverages

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  whole milk
  1                     egg
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  semi-sweet chocolate chips
  2        tablespoons  hazelnut liqueur or dark rum
  4                     demitasse cups
  1                cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        Mint sprigs -- (optional garnish)

Heat milk in a small pan over moderate heat until it comes to a boil.

In blender or food processor combine egg, sugar, a pinch of salt, semisweet chips, and liqueur.  Run processor or turn on blender to low setting.  Pour in boiling milk in a slow stream.  The hot milk will cook egg and melt chocolate.  Process or blend 1 minute, until smooth.

Spoon chocolate into 4 demitasse cups and chill.  After dinner, beat cream until soft peaks form.  Add a little sugar and beat to combine.  Top the chocolate cups with a dollop of cream and garnish each cup with mint sprigs.

Place cups on saucers and serve with demitasse spoons.

This recipe yields 4 servings in demitasse cups.  If you use teacups, this recipe will yield 2 cups, rather than 4.

                   Eggplant Curry With Toasted Almonds

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  jasmine rice -- cooked to
                        directions on package
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (2 turns around pan in a slow stream)
  1              large  firm eggplant -- cut into 1" cubes
  1              large  yellow-skinned onion -- peeled, chopped
  1              large  red bell pepper -- seeded, diced
  4                     garlic cloves -- cracked away
                        from skin
  1                can  diced tomatoes - (14 oz) -- drained
     1/4           cup  mango chutney
                        = (a couple of heaping tablespoons)
  1         tablespoon  mild curry paste - (rounded)
                        = (or 2 tbspns curry powder)
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
  1                cup  vegetable broth or stock
  2        tablespoons  finely-chopped cilantro leaves -- (optional)
                        === GARNISHES ===
                        Toasted sliced or slivered almonds
                        Thinly-sliced scallions or
                        chopped fresh chives

Prepare rice.  While rice is simmering, start curry.

Heat a deep, heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium to medium-high heat.  When the pan is hot, add oil, eggplant, onion, and bell pepper.  Cover pan and cook 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Uncover and add garlic; cook 1 minute more.  Add tomatoes, chutney, curry, salt, and broth.  Stir to combine and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes over low heat for flavors to combine.  Remove curry from heat and stir in cilantro.

Ladle eggplant curry into shallow bowls.  Using an ice cream scoop, scoop rice balls into the center of bowls.  Garnish your curry and rice with lots of toasted sliced almonds and scallions or chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Tidbits:  Curry paste is available on the International Foods aisle of markets.  The paste is deep red in color and will keep several months in the refrigerator.

Vegetable stocks and broths are available in the soup aisle of market and are now widely available in paper containers with re-sealable spouts.  If you use broths often in cooking, these paper containers are terrific to keep on-hand in your refrigerator.

If you want to purchase just enough almonds to top this one recipe, check out the baking aisle of your market and look for either slivered or sliced almonds in a small 3-ounce pouch.  Major Grey's mango chutney is available under many different brand names and can be found on both Condiment and International Foods aisles of market.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  cellantani (corkscrew shaped pasta)
                        = (or other lined pasta)
  3                     garlic cloves - (to 4) -- chopped
     1/2                onion -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (twice around pan in a slow stream)
  1                can  diced tomatoes in juice - (28 oz)
  1                can  tomato sauce or tomato puree - (8 oz)
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced deli prosciutto di Parma -- cut thin strips
  1                cup  frozen green peas
  20                    fresh basil leaves -- shredded or torn,
                        plus a few leaves to garnish
                        Grated peccorino Romano -- for passing

Put a large pot of water on the stove over high heat for pasta.  When water comes to a boil, add salt to water and cook pasta to al dente, with a bite to it.

In a large, deep skillet, preheated over moderate heat, cook garlic, onion, and crushed pepper in extra-virgin olive oil for 3 to 4 minutes.  Add tomatoes and sauce or puree to the pan.  When tomatoes come to a bubble, reduce heat to simmer.  Season sauce with salt and pepper.

When pasta is cooked to al dente, drain well and set near stove.  Sprinkle ribbons of sliced prosciutto and the green peas into the sauce.  Stir to combine and heat peas through.  Toss pasta with sauce and shredded basil.  Keep turning pasta in sauce until basil wilts and pasta begins to absorb sauce, about 1 minute.  Transfer pasta to a serving platter and garnish with a few whole basil leaves.

Serve with salad and grated cheese, for passing.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

             French Toast-Wiches With Quick-Cook Warm Chutney

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Sandwiches

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHUTNEY ===
     1/2           cup  dried apricots -- diced
  3              small  ripe peaches -- pitted, diced
  1                cup  apple juice concentrate
  1              piece  fresh ginger root - (1" long) -- peeled
  1                     lemon -- zested
     1/8      teaspoon  grated fresh nutmeg
                        = (or a few pinches of ground)
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        === TOAST-WICHES ===
  8             slices  white toasting bread
  3                     eggs -- beaten
     1/2           cup  milk or half-and-half
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  ground or freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Butter -- for greasing
                        skillet
  1                     Gala or Golden Delicious apple -- quartered, cored,
                        and thinly sliced
  1                     brick Vermont sharp cheddar - (6 to 8 oz) -- thinly sliced
     3/4         pound  deli sliced smoked turkey breast

Put all of the ingredients for your chutney in a medium pot and bring liquid to a boil.  Reduce heat a bit and let the chutney cook down for 10 minutes.  Remove gingerroot before serving.

Begin to assemble an assembly line leading to your pan.  Place a pile of bread next to a shallow dish or disposable pie tin containing the eggs, beaten with milk, sugar, and nutmeg.  Nestle a piece of cold butter in a folded paper towel and keep on hand to wipe and grease your skillet.  Pile apples, cheese, and turkey on the cutting board to finish your assembly line.

Preheat nonstick griddle or large skillet over moderate heat.

To make sandwiches, coat pan with butter, dip 4 pieces of bread on both sides in the egg, and place in the pan.  Cook 2 minutes and turn 2 slices over.  Top the 2 slices you turned with thin layers of cheese, apple, turkey and another slice of cheese.  Top sandwich filling with the other 2 slices of bread, keeping the uncooked side up; you are just sliding these pieces over from pan to top of sandwich.  Now flip the entire sandwich over to cook the opposite side of the sandwich.  Gently press down on the sandwich as it grills the last minute or two.  Repeat the process with the remaining ingredients.

Cut sandwiches on a diagonal and serve with small buttercups or ramekins of warm fruit chutney for topping.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                         Ham And Fontina Frittata

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Omelets

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ham steak
                        = (from packaged meats case of market)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        = (1 turn around the pan)
  2        tablespoons  butter
  12                    extra large eggs
     1/2           cup  milk or half-and-half
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  shredded Danish Fontina - (8 to 10 oz)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Trim any connective tissue and all fat off ham steak.  Mince the meat into very small bits and set aside.

Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet with oven safe handle over moderate heat.  Add oil and 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet and coat sides and bottom of pan evenly with melted butter and oil mixture.  Add ham bits to the pan and saute 3 minutes to brown them a bit and render some of the moisture in the meat.

Whisk together eggs and milk or half-and-half.  Break off tiny pieces of remaining 1 tablespoon butter and drop them into beaten eggs.  Season eggs with a little salt and pepper and whisk again to combine.  Pour eggs into skillet over ham.  Stir eggs gently to evenly distribute bits of ham throughout the eggs.

As eggs set, lift up bottom skin that has formed and allow uncooked eggs to settle.  Keep doing this as eggs brown until the eggs begin to set.

Transfer the pan to the oven, and allow the frittata to cook 10 minutes, or until golden on top.  Add a generous layer of shredded fontina to the frittata and leave in oven another 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted and begins to bubble and brown.

Serve frittata wedges directly from the skillet with a pie server.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Trim any connective tissue and all fat off ham steak.  Mince the meat into very small bits and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet with oven safe handle over moderate heat.  Add oil and 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet and coat sides and bottom of pan evenly with melted butter and oil mixture.  Add ham bits to the pan and saute 3 minutes to brown them a bit and render some of the moisture in the meat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Whisk together eggs and milk or half-and-half.  Break off tiny pieces of remaining 1 tablespoon butter and drop them into beaten eggs.  Season eggs with a little salt and pepper and whisk again to combine.  Pour eggs into skillet over ham.  Stir eggs gently to evenly distribute bits of ham throughout the eggs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
As eggs set, lift up bottom skin that has formed and allow uncooked eggs to settle.  Keep doing this as eggs brown until the eggs begin to set.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Transfer the pan to the oven, and allow the frittata to cook 10 minutes, or until golden on top.  Add a generous layer of shredded fontina to the frittata and leave in oven another 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted and begins to bubble and brown.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve frittata wedges directly from the skillet with a pie server.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === ISRAELI SPICE RUB ===
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sweet paprika
  1 1/2    tablespoons  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes - (to 1 tspn)
                        = (medium to hot in spice level)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarse kosher salt
                        === CHICKEN ===
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breasts -- split, 8 pieces
                        = (1 1/2 to 2 lbs total)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
                        Warm pita or flat bread -- for passing
                        === SERVING SUGGESTIONS ===
                        Orange And Yellow Tomato Relish -- (see recipe)
                        Zucchini With Mint And Parsley -- (see recipe)

For the spice rub combine the paprika, cumin, oregano, coriander, crushed red pepper flakes, and kosher salt in a bowl.  Place in a sealable jar, keep in a cool dry place for up to 6 months.

Place chicken in a shallow dish.  Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil to barely coat the meat.  Rub chicken liberally with 4 tablespoons of the spice blend.  Let stand 10 minutes.

Grill chicken 6 or 7 minutes on each side or until juices run clear.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Piling the relish and the chicken in a warm pita is a fun way to combine the flavors and textures of the 2 recipes.

  1                cup  grated Romano
  12            ounces  mixed greens
                        = (from bulk bin or packages found in
                        produce department)
     1/4           cup  fresh herbs
                        = (whatever you have on hand: parsley,
                        basil, chives, sage, etc.)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for drizzling
                        Balsamic vinegar -- for drizzling
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat a nonstick skillet or griddle pan over medium-high heat.

Pile 1 tablespoonful of grated cheese in several spots on the hot pan, allowing about 1/2 inch between each pile.  Cheese will melt, bubble, and form a cheesy lace.  When the crisps turn light golden in color, remove them from pan carefully with a thin spatula.  The cheese crisps will harden as they cool.

Combine lettuces and fresh herbs, drizzle mixed greens with extra-virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar, just enough to coat.  Season with salt and pepper.

Top dressed salad with crisps.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  white thin-skin potatoes -- peeled, diced
  2        tablespoons  white vinegar or cider vinegar
  1                jar  sliced pimento - (6 oz) -- drained, chopped
  1                cup  frozen sweet peas
  1              small  white onion -- peeled, left whole
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise or reduced fat mayonnaise
                        = (just enough to bind salad)

       My Sister Ria's Favorite Fajitas, With Black Beans And Rice

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MARINADE ===
     2/3           cup  Mexican beer
     1/2           cup  chopped chipotle in adobo sauce
                        = (smoky chipotle prepared salsa may be
                        substituted)
  1                     lime -- juiced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chili powder
                        A generous drizzle vegetable, corn, or
                        olive oil
                        === FAJITAS ===
                        Flank steak
  8                     flour tortillas - (8" dia)
  1         tablespoon  vegetable, corn, or olive oil
  1              large  red bell pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into strips
  1                     poblano pepper
                        = (substitute 1 Cubanelle long Italian
                        pepper)
  1             medium  yellow-skinned Spanish onion -- cut thin strips
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1            package  Spanish style rice, any brand -- prepared to
                        directions on the package
                        === BLACK BEANS ===
  1         tablespoon  vegetable, olive, or corn oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  1                     jalapeÒo -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
  1              small  white onion
  1                     large can black beans -- drained, rinsed
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
                        Chopped cilantro -- (optional)
                        Sliced scallions -- (optional)

Combine marinade ingredients in a shallow dish.  Turn flank steak in marinade and let stand 15 minutes.  The meat can be placed in marinade in the morning and allowed to marinate until suppertime if you enjoy very strong, spicy flavors.  The short marinade will result in a milder tasting meat which is more palatable to many not-too-hot taste buds.

Follow directions on packaged rice and get it simmering, it will take 18 to 20 minutes.

Heat a grill pan to high heat and sear the flank steak 4 minutes on each side.  Reduce heat and cook meat 6 to 8 minutes longer, turning occasionally.

Heat a medium nonstick skillet over high heat.  Blister tortillas 30 seconds on each side and stack them on a plate.  Loosely wrap tortillas with foil and place them on the dinner table.

Add oil to hot pan and sear sliced peppers and onions for fajitas.  Season peppers and onions with salt and pepper.  Char edges and stir-fry the peppers and onions until just tender, 2 or 3 minutes.  Transfer to a platter and cover with loose foil to keep hot.

Add another tablespoon oil, garlic, jalapeÒo and chopped onion; saute for 2 minutes.  Add black beans and spices to the pan and heat through for another 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer beans to a serving dish.  Top beans with cilantro and scallions.

Remove meat from grill pan and let it rest 5 minutes for juices to distribute.  Transfer peppers and onions to grill to get the sizzle effect going.  Slice meat very thin on an angle against the grain.  Pile meat on top of cooked peppers and onions and take the hot grill to the table, letting rest on trivets or a cool wire rack.  Stack meat and veggies in warm tortillas and enjoy with a side of spicy black beans.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  white granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  water

Place sugars, water and cream in a heavy, medium saucepan over moderate heat.  Stir often and cook to a soft ball stage, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Use a candy thermometer; the soft-ball stage is between 234 and 240 degrees.

Remove from heat and beat mixture with an electric mixer in the pot on low setting until creamy, 2 or 3 minutes.  Stir in all the pecans to coat evenly.  Using a soup spoon or tablespoon, drop big spoonfuls of praline mixture onto a buttered sheet pan to cool.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
  4                     Red or Golden Delicious apples
                        = (or 2 of each)
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice
  2               cups  complete pancake mix -- any brand
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        = (or equivalent of freshly grated)
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar

Heat 1-inch vegetable oil on moderate to medium-high heat.  If you wish to test the oil, add a 1-inch cube of bread to hot oil.  If it turns deep golden brown in color in a count of 40, the oil is ready.

Core apples with an apple corer.  Cut into 1/4-inch thick slices across, forming apple rings.  Sprinkle sliced apples with the juice of a wedge of lemon to prevent browning.

Mix together pancake mix and water, season with nutmeg.  Place confectioners' sugar in a sifter or a tea strainer.  Place a piece of cardboard or brown paper sack on a work surface for draining fritters.

Working in small batches of 5 to 6 slices, coat rings of apple in batter, and fry for 2 to 3 minutes, until evenly golden brown.  Transfer to paper bag or towels to drain.  When all the fritters are cooked, let oil cool before discarding.

Top fritters with confectioners' sugar and transfer to a serving platter.

This recipe yields 20 apple fritter rings.

  2        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2                inch ginger -- peeled, grated
     1/4                ripe pineapple -- peeled, cored,

                    Poor Man's Caviar: Eggplant Spread

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     medium -- firm eggplant
  1                     garlic clove -- cracked away
                        from the skin
  2            pinches  ground allspice
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     handful flat-leaf parsley tops
                        A drizzle extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     whole-grain baguette or
                        other long crusty bread -- sliced at
                        the bread counter

Preheat oven to highest setting, at least 500 degrees.

Cut 2 or 3 slits into whole eggplant.  Place eggplant directly on the oven rack in the middle of the oven and roast the eggplant until it is tender, about 20 minutes.  Keep the slits facing up so that the eggplant does not loose liquids as it roasts.

The roasted eggplant will look like a flat tire when you remove it from the oven.  Using a sharp utility knife, carefully peel skin away from eggplant flesh.  Add cooked eggplant flesh and juice to food processor and combine with garlic, allspice, salt, and pepper and parsley.  Pulse grind the eggplant into a paste, add a drizzle of olive oil.  Transfer to a serving dish.  The seeds of the eggplant will make the spread resemble caviar eggs, and so the name: poor man's caviar.

To serve, surround a bowlful of spread with crusty bread rounds.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Tidbit:  Mixed olives and selections of Italian sheep's milk cheeses are suggested accompaniments to this menu to round out your buffet.  They require no recipe or preparation and add something to the offering overall.  Place them on the buffet near the eggplant caviar and bread.

  6               cups  good quality chicken stock
  1              pound  chicken breast tenders -- diced

Place a large pot over moderate heat and add extra-virgin olive oil.  Work close to the stove and add vegetables to the pot as you chop, in the order they are listed.

Add bay leaves and season vegetables with salt and pepper, to taste.  Add stock to the pot and raise flame to bring liquid to a boil.

       Sliced Sirloin Smothered In Onions With Roquefort Potato Pie

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     sirloin 1 1/2"-thk New York strip steaks -- - (12 oz ea)
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2              large  yellow onions -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  black peppercorns
                        Worcestershire sauce -- for brushing
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
  4               cups  mashed potatoes - (to 6)
                        = (use leftover mashed or
                        prepared packaged instant)
  8             ounces  Roquefort -- crumbled
  2                     scallions, greens and whites -- chopped
  4             slices  center-cut bacon -- chopped
     1/2           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1                     bag triple washed baby spinach leaves - -- (16 oz)
  6              large  white mushroom caps -- sliced
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat grill pan to high heat.  Remove meat from the refrigerator and unwrap.  Let beef stand a few minutes, to take the chill off.

Heat a medium skillet over moderate heat.  Add butter and sliced onions to a hot pan and season with salt.  Saute onions for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions are caramel in color, tender, and sweet.

Meanwhile, place peppercorns in a heavy-duty food storage bag.  Hit peppercorns with a small, heavy frying pan to crack them.  Baste meat with a little Worcestershire sauce on each side using a pastry brush.  Coat steaks on 1 side with cracked black peppercorns.  Grill steaks 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare.

Meanwhile, heat leftover mashed potatoes on high in microwave oven for 5 minutes.  If you are using instant potatoes, prepare to package directions and transfer warm potatoes to a mixing bowl.  Stir cheese and scallions into the mashed potatoes.  Heat a nonstick skillet over moderate heat.  Coat the inside of pan with butter to aid in crusting.  Spread cheesy potatoes in an even layer in the skillet and allow them to crust and brown on the bottom, 5 to 7 minutes.  Cut the potato layer in half gently with a butter knife, careful not to scratch your nonstick surface.  Fold one half over top of the opposite making a half moon shaped potato pie with a crusty outside and a cheesy, soft center.

While steaks and potatoes cook, brown chopped bacon in the small frying pan you used to crack the peppercorns over high heat.  Transfer browned bacon bits to a paper towel lined plate to drain.  Wipe out skillet and return to heat.  Add 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar to the pan and bring to a bubble.  Reduce heat to low and simmer 1 to 2 minutes, until vinegar is reduced by half and thick.  Turn off heat.  Pour spinach into salad bowl.  Top with bacon and mushrooms.  Whisk extra-virgin olive oil into warm vinegar and pour over salad.  Toss salad and serve.

Season the cooked steaks with a little salt and remove to a carving board.  Let the steaks rest for 5 minutes for the juices to redistribute through the meat evenly.  If you slice into a hot steak, the juices will run out and the first bite will be the only tasty one.

Slice steaks thin against the grain of the meat.  Smother steak slices in onions.  Cut potato pie into 4 wedges and serve along side steaks with spinach salad.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Every time you make mashed potatoes, make a double batch, with Roquefort Potato Pie in mind for a supper later in the week.  It's a very addictive recipe!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  red Swiss chard
                        = (the average weight of 2 bundles)
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/8         pound  pancetta or bacon -- chopped
  1              small  yellow-skinned onion -- chopped
     1/4           cup  golden raisins
  14            ounces  chicken stock or broth
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Coarsely chop the greens of clean red chard.  Add oil, pancetta, and chopped onion to the pan and cook 2 or 3 minutes until onions begin to soften and pancetta is lightly browned.

           Trout Amandine, Steamed Asparagus, And New Potatoes

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Fresh Water)              Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  small red potatoes -- quartered
  1 1/4         pounds  thin asparagus spears
  10                    fresh chives blades -- snipped or chopped
  8                     lake or rainbow trout fillets - (4 oz ea)
  1                     egg
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  flour
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus a drizzle
                        for potatoes
  4        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  whole blanched almonds - (abt 6 oz)
                        A handful fresh parsley leaves -- finely chopped
  1                     lemon -- wedged

Place oven on low and rest a platter on an oven rack.

Add potatoes to a deep pot of boiling water; just enough to cover potatoes.  Salt water and add potato halves.  The potatoes will cook for about 12 minutes for fork tender.

Hold asparagus spears at each end.  Snap asparagus tips from tough ends by bending spears.  Place spears in a colander.  Rest colander on top of the potato pot and place a cover over the colander.  The asparagus will steam while the potatoes cook.  Do this the last 5 or 6 minutes that the potatoes are cooking.

Potatoes will be just about done when the last of your trout is going into the skillet (method follows.)  When the potatoes are tender, take a minute to drain them and return them to warm pot.  Leave asparagus covered and set aside.  Dress potatoes with chives, a drizzle of olive oil and a little salt.  Leave in warm pot until trout is on the table, then transfer to a serving bowl.

Heat a large skillet over moderate heat.  Combine egg and milk in a tin pie plate, beat with a fork.  Place a cup of flour in a second pie tin and season well with salt and sparingly with pepper.  Coat trout fillets in egg and milk, then in seasoned flour.  Collect fillets on a plate until all of them are dredged and ready to be cooked.

Add 1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil to your skillet, half a turn of the pan in a slow stream.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons butter to the pan.  When the butter foams, add trout and gently saute 4 fillets for 2 or 3 minutes on each side, until golden.  Transfer trout fillets to warm platter in oven.

Return pan to the stove and add 1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin oil and 1 1/2 tablespoons butter.  When butter foams, repeat cooking process.  When all of the trout is cooked, add last tablespoon of butter to the pan.  When the butter melts, add almonds and brown until lightly golden, 1 to 2 minutes.

Remove trout from oven and pour almonds over the platter.  Garnish platter with chopped parsley, lemon wedges, steamed asparagus spears, and potatoes.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  boneless skinless chicken thighs
  1 1/2         pounds  chicken breast tenderloins
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  6                     garlic cloves -- crushed
  3        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2                     shallots -- chopped
  6             sprigs  fresh rosemary -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1                cup  dry white wine
  2               cups  beef broth (yes, beef broth)

Heat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Season chicken with salt and pepper.  Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, half the chicken pieces, and a couple of crushed cloves of garlic.

Brown chicken 2 minutes on each side and remove from pan.  Add remaining oil, another single turn of the pan, remaining chicken pieces and garlic.  Brown chicken 2 minutes on each side and remove.  Add vinegar to the pan.  Let it cook off.

Add butter, shallots, and rosemary to the pan and cook 2 minutes, add flour and cook 1 minute more.  Whisk in wine, reduce 1 minute.  Whisk in broth and bring liquids up to a bubble.  Return chicken to the pan and simmer over moderate heat 7 to 8 minutes to finish cooking chicken through.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  This is a very rich meal.  My suggestion for dessert is to set out a small cookie tray and offer coffee or tea.

                          Wild Mushroom Risotto

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             ounces  dried porcinis
                        = (look for these in produce department)
  1              quart  mushroom broth or vegetable stock
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                     shallot -- finely chopped
  1                cup  arborio rice
     1/2           cup  dry Sherry
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme - (abt 4 sprigs)
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place dried porcinis and stock or broth in a saucepan and bring stock to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer.

In a large skillet, heat oil and butter over medium to medium-high heat.  Add shallots and saute 2 minutes.  Add arborio rice and saute, 2 or 3 minutes more.  Add Sherry and cook the liquid completely absorbed.  Add several ladles of hot stock or broth and reduce heat slightly.  Simmer, stirring frequently until liquid is absorbed.

Remove mushrooms from water and reserve cooking liquid.  Coarsely chop the porcinis and add them to the rice.  Continue to ladle broth into arborio, half the remaining amount at a time.  Stir mixture each time you add broth and remove from heat when the rice is cooked to al dente.  Cool and store any remaining liquids if there are any.

The ideal total cooking time for perfect risotto is 22 minutes.  The consistency should be creamy.

Stir in thyme and a few handfuls of grated cheese.  Season your risotto with salt and pepper to your taste.  Serve creamy mushroom risotto from the hot pan with warm, crusty whole grain breads.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Place dried porcinis and stock or broth in a saucepan and bring stock to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large skillet, heat oil and butter over medium to medium-high heat.  Add shallots and saute 2 minutes.  Add arborio rice and saute, 2 or 3 minutes more.  Add Sherry and cook the liquid completely absorbed.  Add several ladles of hot stock or broth and reduce heat slightly.  Simmer, stirring frequently until liquid is absorbed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove mushrooms from water and reserve cooking liquid.  Coarsely chop the porcinis and add them to the rice.  Continue to ladle broth into arborio, half the remaining amount at a time.  Stir mixture each time you add broth and remove from heat when the rice is cooked to al dente.  Cool and store any remaining liquids if there are any.

<DirT>
The ideal total cooking time for perfect risotto is 22 minutes.  The consistency should be creamy.

<DirT>
Stir in thyme and a few handfuls of grated cheese.  Season your risotto with salt and pepper to your taste.  Serve creamy mushroom risotto from the hot pan with warm, crusty whole grain breads.

              You Won't Be Single For Long Vodka Cream Pasta

Recipe By     :Rachael Ray
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  2                     garlic cloces -- minced
  2                     shallots -- minced
  1                cup  vodka
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1                can  crushed tomatoes - (32 oz)
                        Coarse salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  16            ounces  pasta, such as penne rigate
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  20                    fresh basil leaves -- shredded or torn
                        Crusty bread -- for passing

Heat a large skillet over moderate heat.  Add oil, butter, garlic, and shallots.  Gently saute shallots for 3 to 5 minutes to develop their sweetness.  Add vodka to the pan, 3 turns around the pan in a steady stream will equal about 1 cup.  Reduce vodka by half, this will take 2 or 3 minutes.  Add chicken stock and tomatoes.  Bring sauce to a bubble and reduce heat to simmer.  Season with salt and pepper.

While sauce simmers, cook pasta in salted boiling water until cooked to al dente (with a bite to it).  While pasta cooks, prepare your salad or other side dishes.

Stir cream into sauce.  When sauce returns to a bubble, remove it from heat.  Drain pasta.  Toss hot pasta with sauce and basil leaves. Pass pasta with crusty bread.

This recipe yields 4 servings.
