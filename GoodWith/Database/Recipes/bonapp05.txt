  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2                red bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
     1/2                green bell pepper -- seeded, chopped
  1         tablespoon  minced jalapeÒo chili
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2           cups  drained canned diced tomatoes
     1/2           cup  bottled clam juice
     1/3           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  water
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed dried red pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
  4                     tuna steaks - (6 to 8 oz ea)
  12            ounces  angel hair pasta
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
                        Additional chopped fresh cilantro

Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add both bell peppers, jalapeÒo and minced garlic; sautÈ until peppers are almost tender, about 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes, clam juice, 1/3 cup cilantro, wine, water, lemon juice and dried red pepper.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat; simmer until flavors blend, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Mix flour and garlic powder in shallow bowl.  Season tuna with salt and pepper.  Coat with flour mixture, shaking off excess.  Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in another heavy large skillet over high heat.  Add tuna to skillet and sautÈ until just opaque on the outside, about 2 minutes per side.

Bring sauce to simmer over medium heat.  Add tuna; cook until opaque in center, about 2 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain pasta.  Divide among 4 plates.  Place tuna atop pasta.  Spoon sauce over.  Sprinkle with Parmesan and cilantro and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "Cafe Vesuvio in St. Charles offers an absolutely delicious dish of angel hair pasta topped with tuna.  We'd like to know how to make it," asks Nancy and John Noble of St. Charles, Illinois.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  grated Romano cheese - (packed, abt 1 oz)
  3        tablespoons  light mayonnaise
  3        tablespoons  light sour cream
     1/2      teaspoon  dried marjoram
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  onion salt
     1/8      teaspoon  garlic powder
  1                can  artichoke hearts packed in water - (14 oz) -- well drained,
                        chopped into 1/4" pieces
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
                        French-bread baguette slices -- toasted

Whisk 4 tablespoons grated Romano cheese, light mayonnaise, light sour cream, dried marjoram, black pepper, onion salt, and garlic powder in medium bowl to blend.  Stir in chopped artichoke hearts.  Transfer mixture to 1 1/2-cup ramekin.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover mixture and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake dip until heated through, about 20 minutes (about 30 minutes if chilled).

Preheat broiler.  Sprinkle dip with remaining 1 tablespoon grated Romano cheese and paprika.  Broil until cheese melts, about 2 minutes.  Serve warm with toasted baguette slices.

This recipe yields about 1 1/3 cups.

Comments:  "Last summer we spent a long weekend in Traverse City, Michigan, at the cherry festival," write Jane and Joseph Runza of Kalamazoo, Michigan.  "While exploring the surrounding area, we discovered CafÈ Bliss in nearby Suttons Bay.  The restaurantís artichoke dip would make a great appetizer to serve at a party."

The classic artichoke dip is loaded with sour cream and mayonnaise, but this contemporary recipe uses smaller quantities (and lighter versions) of those ingredients.

  3 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  grated mozzarella cheese
  1                cup  crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
  1                cup  grated Parmesan cheese
  4          teaspoons  minced garlic
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  4        tablespoons  chopped green onions

Place 1 1/4 cups warm water in large bowl.  Sprinkle yeast and sugar over; stir to blend.  Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 10 minutes.  Mix in cornmeal, oil and salt.

Add 3 cups flour to yeast mixture; stir until dough forms.  Turn dough out onto floured work surface.  Add remaining 1/4 cup flour; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes.

Lightly oil clean large bowl.  Add dough; turn to coat.  Cover with plastic wrap, then kitchen towel.  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.

Punch dough down.  Turn out onto floured surface; knead briefly until smooth.  Return to oiled bowl; turn to coat.  Cover with plastic, then kitchen towel.  Let dough rise 40 minutes.  Punch dough down.  Turn out onto floured surface.  Divide into 4 pieces.  Cover with plastic; chill at least 1 hour or overnight.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Oil 11- by 15-inch baking sheet.

Roll out 1 dough piece to 1/8-inch-thick rectangle.  Transfer to prepared baking sheet.  Using fingers, gently stretch dough to edges of baking sheet.  Bake until golden, puffed and crisp, about 8 minutes.

Remove from oven.  Top with 1/2 cup mozzarella, 1/4 cup Gorgonzola, 1/4 cup Parmesan and 1 teaspoon garlic.  Return cracker to oven; bake until cheese melts and bubbles, about 4 minutes.

Remove from oven.  Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon each of parsley and green onions.  Remove cracker from baking sheet.  Cool baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining dough, cheeses, garlic, parsley and onions.  Break warm crackers into pieces.

This recipe yields 12 to 16 servings.

               Beer-Marinated Steaks With Peppercorn Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     top loin (New York strip) steaks -- (12 oz ea)
  1             bottle  dark beer - (12 oz)
     1/2           cup  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  5        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  3        tablespoons  minced red onion
  6                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  whole grain mustard
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced peeled fresh ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1                     shallot -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  coarsely-crushed four-peppercorn mix -- see * Note
  3 1/4           cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1 3/4           cups  beef stock or canned beef broth
     1/2           cup  whipping cream

* Note:  A blend of black, white, pink and green peppercorns found in the spice section of many supermarkets.

Place steaks in single layer in glass baking dish.  Whisk beer, sugar, lime juice, onion, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, oil, ginger and hot pepper sauce in large bowl to blend.  Pour marinade over steaks in baking dish.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Bring white wine, chopped shallot and crushed peppercorns to boil in heavy medium saucepan; simmer until mixture is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.  Add chicken stock and beef stock and boil until reduced to 2 cups, about 25 minutes.  Add whipping cream and cook until sauce coats spoon, about 6 minutes.  (Peppercorn sauce can be made up to 2 hours ahead.  Set aside at room temperature.)

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Remove steaks from marinade and grill to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare.  Transfer steaks to plates.  Meanwhile, bring peppercorn sauce to simmer.  Drizzle sauce over steaks.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "While visiting friends on Cape Cod, I had dinner at the Aqua Grille in Sandwich," says Corolyn Hampton of Saratoga Springs, New York.  "The beer-marinated steak, served with a peppercorn sauce and mashed potatoes, was the centerpiece of a fabulous meal."

                      Bittersweet Chocolate Cupcakes

Serving Size  : 18    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cupcakes                        Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24            ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  5              large  eggs
  3              large  egg yolks
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- cut into pieces

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly butter eighteen 1/3-cup muffin cups.

Stir 16 ounces chopped bittersweet chocolate in top of double boiler set over simmering water until melted and smooth.  Cool slightly.  Using electric mixer, beat eggs, egg yolks and sugar in large bowl until pale yellow and tripled in volume, about 5 minutes.  Add melted chocolate and beat until blended.  Divide cupcake batter equally among prepared muffin cups, filling cups about 3/4 full.

Bake cupcakes until puffed and cracked on top, about 12 minutes.  Cool to room temperature.  Run knife around sides of muffin cups to loosen cupcakes, then carefully lift out with small metal spatula.  Place chocolate cupcakes upside down on work surface.

Bring whipping cream to simmer in small saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add remaining 8 ounces chopped chocolate and unsalted butter; whisk until melted and smooth.  Cool until slightly thickened and spreadable.  Spread glaze over cakes.  (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)  Serve cupcakes glaze-side up.

This recipe yields 18 cupcakes.

Comments:  "I recently went to the Good News CafÈ in Woodbury, Connecticut, with my husband and some of our friends," says Phyllis Hertzberg of Englewood, New Jersey.  "For dessert, I ordered a chocolate cupcake, and it was absolutely divine -- rich and gorgeous.  Everybody had a bite, and we all thought it would be a nice addition to your magazine."

More like individual flourless chocolate cakes, these "cupcakes" would make a sophisticated dessert for a dinner party.  They are delicate and may crumble on top, but donít worry, since they're served upside-down with a glaze spread over them.

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- finely chopped
  1              large  carrot -- peeled, and
                        finely chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- finely chopped
  5              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  1              large  fresh rosemary sprig
  1                     bay leaf
  1 3/4           cups  chicken stock

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place all-purpose flour in shallow bowl.  Sprinkle both sides of veal shank pieces with salt and pepper.  Dredge each veal piece in flour, shaking off excess.

Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in heavy large ovenproof pot over medium-high heat.  Add veal pieces to pot, arranging in single layer, and sautÈuntil brown, about 6 minutes per side.  Using tongs, transfer veal pieces to plate.

Add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to pot.  Add onion, carrot, celery, thyme sprigs, rosemary sprig and bay leaf and sautÈ until vegetables brown, about 12 minutes.  Season vegetables to taste with salt and pepper.

Place veal atop cooked vegetables in pot and pour chicken stock over.  Bring to simmer; cover and place in oven.  Cook until veal is very tender, about 1 hour 10 minutes.  Discard bay leaf.

Transfer 1 veal piece to each of 6 plates.  Spoon excess fat off sauce, if desired.  Spoon sauce and vegetables over veal and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "At a recent lunch at the Stage House Inn in Scotch Plains, I was served a braised veal shank," writes Max J. Kalm of Westfield, New Jersey.  "This version was so much better than the ones Iíve prepared.  Would chef David Drake be willing to share his recipe?"

The restaurant serves this entrÈe with a vegetable risotto.  Mashed potatoes would also be a good side dish for the veal shanks.

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick) -- room temperature
  2             pounds  fresh broccoli -- stems and florets
                        separated and chopped bite-size pieces
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh tarragon
                        = (or 1/2 tspn dried tarragon)
  6 1/2           cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1                cup  whipping cream
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  grated extra-sharp cheddar cheese -- (packed, abt 8 oz)

Melt 3 tablespoons butter in heavy medium pot over medium-high heat.  Add broccoli stems and onion; sautÈ until onion is translucent, about 6 minutes.  Add garlic and tarragon; sautÈ 1 minute.  Add stock; bring to boil.  Simmer uncovered until broccoli is tender, about 15 minutes.  Stir in cream.

Mix remaining 3 tablespoons butter with flour in small bowl to make paste.  Whisk paste into soup.  Add broccoli florets.  Simmer until soup thickens and florets are tender, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly, then refrigerate uncovered until cold.  Cover and keep refrigerated.  Bring to simmer before continuing.)

Preheat broiler.  Place 6 ovenproof soup bowls on baking sheet.  Divide soup among bowls.  Sprinkle 1/3 cup cheese over each.  Broil until cheese melts and bubbles around edges, about 4 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "As a student at Bloomsburg University, I spent many Sunday afternoons at Russellís restaurant in downtown Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania," writes Marganne Hoffman of Lebanon, Pennsylvania.  "A decade after graduating, I still crave their cheddar-crusted broccoli soup.  I would be thrilled if the owners would share the recipe-and so would my family."

The stems and florets are added to the soup separately so that the stems will cook until tender and the florets wonít overcook.

Serving Size  : 36    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cookies                         Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  raisins

Using electric mixer, beat butter, sugar and salt in large bowl until creamy.  Mix in vanilla.  Add flour and raisins; mix until smooth dough forms.  Divide dough in half.  Shape each dough half into 1 1/2-inch-diameter log.  Wrap each log in plastic; refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Keep chilled.)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter 2 large baking sheets.  Cut each dough log into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Place slices on prepared baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart.  Bake until cookies are golden, about 10 minutes.  Cool slightly on baking sheets.  Transfer to racks; cool completely.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 3 dozen.

Comments:  In England, these crisp raisin-flecked treats are called Madeira biscuits -- biscuit being the British word for cookie, and a glass of Madeira being a favorite accompaniment for this particular type.

My personal favorite is the carrot cake: It's moist and tender, and it's drizzled with a tart lemony icing," says John K. Wildemore IV of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  "I hope you can persuade the owner to share this recipe."

Olive oil is the surprise ingredient in this recipe.  The result is a rich cake that doesn't have even a hint of olive oil taste.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken - (4 1/2 lbs) -- quartered, and
                        backbone removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  2              large  russet potatoes - (abt 14 oz ea) -- peeled, each
                        cut into 6 pieces
  6              large  garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper -- or more to taste
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1                cup  frozen green peas -- thawed
                        Chopped fresh parsley -- (optional)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Sprinkle chicken pieces generously with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle oregano and garlic powder over chicken; set aside.

Heat oil in large ovenproof pot over high heat.  Add potatoes and sautÈ until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Transfer potatoes to bowl.

Add chicken to same pot and sautÈ until golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic cloves and dried crushed red pepper and sautÈ 2 minutes.  Return potatoes to pot.  Remove pot from heat.  Add stock.  Return to medium-high heat and bring to boil.

Cover pot tightly; transfer to oven and bake until chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes.  Add peas to pot; cover and bake 5 minutes longer.

Transfer chicken to platter.  Arrange potatoes and peas around chicken.  Pour sauce from pot over chicken.  Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired, and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Jerry Goldberg of Chicago says, "After a Cubs game at Wrigley Field, I drove over to Harry Carayís restaurant to celebrate the victory-and the teamís late announcer.  The hearty chicken with potatoes was almost as memorable as Carayís singing of 'Take Me Out to the Ballgame,' which was his seventh-inning tradition."

Note: Make this as fiery as you like by adjusting the amount of crushed red pepper.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  20                    chocolate-covered graham cracker cookies
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
                        === FILLING ===
  3           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
     2/3           cup  sugar -- plus
  3        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  5          teaspoons  cornstarch
  3              large  eggs
  1              large  egg yolk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  Frangelico, hazelnut liqueur
     1/3           cup  almonds -- toasted, chopped
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
  4          teaspoons  unsweetened cocoa powder

Make Crust:  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 425 degrees.  Wrap foil tightly around outside of 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Finely grind graham cracker cookies in processor.  Add butter and process until blended.  Press mixture onto bottom (not sides) of prepared pan.  Set aside.

For Filling:  Blend cream cheese, 2/3 cup sugar, sour cream and cornstarch in processor.  Add eggs, yolk and vanilla; process until well blended, scraping down sides of processor occasionally.  Transfer 3/4 cup cream cheese mixture to small bowl; set aside.  Add Frangelico, almonds and almond extract to remaining cream cheese mixture in processor.  Blend well, using on/off turns.  Spoon 2 1/2 cups Frangelico mixture over crust.

Mix cocoa powder and 3 tablespoons sugar into reserved 3/4 cup cream cheese mixture.  Spoon 2/3 cup cocoa mixture over Frangelico mixture in pan.  Spoon remaining Frangelico mixture over cocoa mixture.  Drop remaining cocoa mixture over by spoonfuls.  Run tip of small knife through batter several times to marbleize.

Bake cheesecake 10 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees and bake cake until sides are puffed and center is set, about 45 minutes.  Transfer cake to rack.  Using small knife, cut around sides of pan to loosen cake.  Cool cake completely in pan.  Cover; chill overnight.  Remove pan sides from cake.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  At the inn, the cake is decorated with Frangelico-flavored whipped cream and garnished with chocolate-covered almonds.  Begin preparing the dessert a day ahead.

  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  almond extract
  1                cup  semisweet chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line heavy large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Grind 1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts in processor.  Set aside.

Whisk flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt in large bowl.  Beat butter and sugar in another large bowl to blend.  Add eggs and vanilla and almond extracts and beat until well blended.  Beat in flour mixture.  Mix in 1 cup whole toasted hazelnuts, chocolate chips and 1/2 cup ground hazelnuts.

Divide dough into 2 equal pieces.  Shape each piece on baking sheet into 2 1/2-inch-wide by 14-inch-long log.  Place logs on prepared baking sheet, spacing 2 1/2 inches apart (logs will spread during baking).  Bake until logs feel firm when tops are gently pressed, about 35 minutes.  Cool logs on baking sheet 15 minutes.  Maintain oven temperature.

Using long wide spatula, transfer baked logs to cutting board.  Using serrated knife, cut warm logs crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Arrange slices, cut-side down, on 2 baking sheets.  Bake biscotti until firm, about 15 minutes.  Transfer to racks and cool completely.  (Chocolate-Hazelnut Biscotti can be prepared ahead.  Store in airtight container up to 4 days, or wrap in foil and freeze in resealable plastic bags up to 3 weeks.)

This recipe yields about 4 dozen biscotti.

Comments:  Sue Shadley of Indianapolis, Indiana, says that the biscotti from The Bakehouse in Bloomington are addictive.

These can be baked three weeks ahead and frozen, making them an ideal Christmas gift.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE BROWNIES ===
  9             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick)
  4              large  eggs -- separated
     3/4           cup  sugar
                        === CHOCOLATE GANACHE ===
     1/4           cup  whipping cream
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4 1/2         ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- chopped
                        === FOR THE PURSES ===
     1/4           cup  creamy peanut butter
  4          teaspoons  sugar
  6                     sheets frozen phyllo pastry, 17" by 13" ea -- thawed
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
                        Vanilla ice cream

For Brownies:  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan.  Line bottom of pan with parchment paper.

Melt chocolate and butter in heavy medium saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat.  Using electric mixer, beat egg yolks and 1/4 cup sugar in large bowl until thick and pale.  Stir chocolate mixture into yolk mixture.  Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in another large bowl until soft peaks form.  Gradually add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and beat until stiff but not dry.  Carefully fold egg whites into chocolate mixture.

Transfer batter to prepared pan.  Bake until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.  Press down edges until even with middle of brownies.  Cool completely.  Using 2 1/4-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out 12 rounds.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Store in single layer in airtight container at room temperature.)

For Ganache:  Bring 1/4 cup whipping cream and vanilla extract to boil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Remove from heat.  Add chopped chocolate and whisk until completely melted.  Refrigerate ganache until firm, about 1 hour.  (Ganache can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.  Cover and keep refrigerated.)

For the Purses:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly butter rimmed baking sheet.  Stir peanut butter and 4 teaspoons sugar in small bowl to blend.  Cut each phyllo sheet in half crosswise to form twelve 13- by 8 1/2-inch strips.

Place 1 phyllo strip vertically on work surface.  Brush with melted butter.  Place second phyllo strip horizontally across first, forming cross; brush with butter.  Stack 2 brownies in center of pastry.  Top brownies with 1 tablespoon ganache and 1 tablespoon peanut butter mixture.  Gather ends of phyllo strips together over brownies to form purse.  Twist ends closed.  Brush purse with melted butter and place on prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining ingredients to form total of 6 purses.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.)

Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Serve with ice cream.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "My parents and I recently celebrated my momís birthday at a local restaurant called The Farmhouse," writes Karen Eschenbach of Emmaus, Pennsylvania.  "We ended a wonderful meal with an even better dessert -- chocolate-peanut butter 'beggars' purses.'"

Each elegant phyllo "purse" contains a flourless brownie topped with peanut butter and chocolate ganache.

  4               cups  sweetened shredded coconut

* Note:  Canned sweetened cream of coconut, such as Coco LÈpe, is available in the liquor section of most supermarkets nationwide.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter and flour two 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 2-inch-high sides.

Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon salt in medium bowl to blend.  Using electric mixer, beat sugar, butter and sweetened cream of coconut in large bowl until fluffy.  Beat in egg yolks and vanilla extract.  On low speed, beat in dry ingredients and then buttermilk, each just until blended.

Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites with pinch of salt in another large bowl until stiff but not dry.  Fold beaten egg whites into batter.

Divide cake batter between prepared pans.  Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.  Cool cakes in pans on rack 10 minutes.  Run small sharp knife around pan sides to loosen cakes.  Turn cakes out onto racks and cool completely.

Place 1 cake layer on cake plate.  Spread 1 cup Cream Cheese Frosting over cake layer.  Sprinkle 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut over.  Top with second cake layer.  Spread remaining frosting over top and sides of cake.  Sprinkle remaining coconut over cake, gently pressing into sides to adhere.  (Coconut Layer Cake can be prepared up to 1 day ahead.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.  Let stand at room temperature 2 hours before serving.)

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  "My fiancÈ and I just love the coconut cake at the Shubox Cafe in nearby Cedar Grove," Tammy L. Drukker of North Caldwell, New Jersey.  "The cake is tender and moist, and the cream cheese frosting is tangy and rich.  I have yet to find a comparable recipe, so I hope the restaurant will share theirs."

At Shubox Cafe, this dessert is known as Awesome Coconut Cake, aptly named by one of the cafeís best customers.  To make this recipe, youíll need to buy one 15-ounce can of sweetened cream of coconut.  Some of it is used in the cake; be sure to save the rest for the Cream Cheese Frosting.

Mix crabmeat, 1/2 cup crushed potato chips, breadcrumbs and next 7 ingredients in large bowl until well blended.  Using 1/4 cupful crab mixture for each cake, form mixture into sixteen 2 1/2-inch-diameter cakes.  (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.  Cover sauce and crab cakes separately and refrigerate.  Rewarm sauce over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, before serving.)  Place remaining potato chips in shallow dish.  Press each cake into chips, turning to coat evenly.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, add crab cakes to skillet and cook until golden brown and heated through, adding more oil as necessary, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer crab cakes to paper-towel-lined plate to drain.

Place 2 crab cakes on each plate; spoon sauce around crab cakes and then serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings as a first-course.

Comments:  The secret to the crisp coating in this recipe?  Crushed potato chips.

                         Cranberry-Meringue Tart

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts                        Tarts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR CRUST ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  cake flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- chilled, and
                        cut into pieces
  2        tablespoons  ice water -- or more if needed
                        === FOR FILLING ===
  3              large  egg whites
  1              pinch  salt
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
  2               cups  fresh cranberries or frozen -- thawed
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped almonds
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        Powdered sugar

Make Crust:  Combine both flours and salt in processor.  Add butter; cut in, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add 2 tablespoons water; process until moist clumps form, using on/off turns.  If dough is dry, add more water by teaspoonfuls to moisten.  Gather dough into ball.  Flatten into disk.  Wrap in plastic; chill 1 hour.  (Can be made 3 days ahead.  Keep chilled.  Let stand at room temperature to soften slightly before rolling.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Roll out dough on floured surface to 14-inch round.  Transfer to 10-inch tart pan with removable bottom.  Trim to fit.  Line crust with foil.  Fill with dried beans or pie weights.  Bake 15 minutes.  Remove foil and beans; bake until golden, about 10 minutes.  Cool completely on rack.  Maintain oven temperature.

Make Filling:  Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and salt in large bowl until frothy.  Gradually beat in 3/4 cup sugar and lemon.  Beat until stiff but not dry.  Mix cranberries, almonds, cornstarch and cinnamon in medium bowl; gently fold into whites in 3 additions.  Transfer filling to crust.  Smooth top.

Bake tart until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Cool on rack.  (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Cover; store at room temperature.)

Sift powdered sugar over tart.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  The tartness of the cranberries is accented by the sweet, crunch meringue filling served at Le Bec-Fin in Philadelphia.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  butter - (1 stick) -- room temperature
  2               cups  powdered sugar
     1/2           cup  canned sweetened cream of coconut -- see * Note
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

* Note:  Canned sweetened cream of coconut, such as Coco LÈpe, is available in the liquor section of most supermarkets nationwide.

Beat cream cheese in medium bowl until fluffy.  Add butter and beat to blend.  Add sugar, sweetened cream of coconut and vanilla extract and beat until well blended.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter
  4             ounces  button mushrooms -- sliced
  1                cup  sliced celery
  1                cup  shredded carrots - (abt 2 med)
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  6               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1 1/2           cups  half-and-half
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1 1/2         pounds  chicken tenders -- cut 1/2" pieces
  1                cup  penne pasta
     1/4         pound  sugar snap peas -- halved diagonally
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add mushrooms, celery, carrots and onion.  Cook until celery and onion are tender, about 5 minutes.  Add flour and cook 3 minutes, stirring frequently.

Gradually mix in chicken stock.  Bring soup to simmer, stirring frequently.  Add half-and-half and chopped parsley and simmer 5 minutes.

Add chicken tenders and simmer until cooked through, about 5 minutes.  (Chicken soup can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Cook penne pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite.  Drain pasta.

Bring chicken soup to simmer.  Mix in cooked pasta and sugar snap peas and simmer 2 minutes.  Mix in lemon juice; season to taste with salt and pepper.

This recipe yields 12 first-course or 6 main-course servings.

Comments:  "Dinner at J. Alexanderís in nearby Troy is a treat my family enjoys regularly, and thereís one thing we always order: the chicken soup.  says Katie Randlett of Wixom, Michigan.  "Although it sounds ordinary, this version definitely isnít -- it has a rich, creamy texture, and itís full of goodies like pasta, sugar snap peas and carrots."

Sugar snap peas add crunch to this comforting soup.  The restaurant uses penne pasta, but macaroni would also work well.

     3/4           cup  rice vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1 1/2         pounds  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut into 1" pieces (abt 4 cups)
  1                cup  golden raisins
  1                cup  diced seeded plum tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh mint
  1                     French-bread baguette -- cut 1/3"-thk slices
                        Olive oil -- for brushing
  12            ounces  soft fresh goat cheese, such as Montrachet -- room temperature
                        === ROASTED GARLIC ===
  4              large  garlic heads
     1/4           cup  olive oil

For Roasted Garlic:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut top 1/4 inch off heads of garlic to expose cloves.  Place garlic in small baking dish.  Add oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss to coat.  Turn garlic cut-side up.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil.  Bake until garlic skins are golden brown and cloves are tender, about 55 minutes.  Cool.  Squeeze garlic cloves from skins.  (Makes about 1 1/3 cups.  Also great mixed into mashed potatoes.)

Stir sugar and vinegar in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Add next 4 ingredients and simmer until mixture is syrupy and reduced to 1/2 cup, about 8 minutes.  Mix in apples and raisins.  Increase heat to high and boil until apples are tender, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes.  Cool to room temperature.  (Chutney can be made 3 days ahead; cover and refrigerate.)  Mix in tomatoes and mint.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Arrange baguette slices on baking sheet and brush with olive oil.  Bake until golden and crisp, about 8 minutes.  Spread each toast with roasted garlic; top with goat cheese and chutney.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Kari and Brian Chase of St. Paul, Minnesota say that their neighborhood has a great restaurant: 128 Cafe.  The last time they were there they tried a delicious appetizer of crisp bread with roasted garlic, goat cheese and apple chutney.

At the restaurant, the bread is grilled, but itís just as good when itís baked.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1                     box chocolate wafer cookies - (9 oz)
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick) -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  1 1/2            cup  whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  instant coffee powder
  12            ounces  semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1                cup  sour cream
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  3              large  eggs
                        === GLAZE ===
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
  4             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped

Make Crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Wrap outside of 9-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides with double thickness of foil.  Spray bottom of pan with vegetable oil spray.  Finely grind cookies in processor.  Add butter and process until blended.  Press mixture onto bottom (not sides) of prepared pan.  Refrigerate while preparing filling.

Make Filling:  Combine cream and coffee powder in medium saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until coffee powder dissolves.  Reduce heat to low.  Add chocolate; whisk until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth.  Cool 10 minutes.

Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar in large bowl until well blended.  Beat in cornstarch.  Add sour cream and vanilla; beat well.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating just until blended after each addition.  Whisk 1 cup cheese mixture into chocolate mixture.  Return chocolate mixture to remaining cheese mixture; whisk until smooth.

Pour batter into crust.  Place springform pan in large baking pan.  Add enough hot water to baking pan to cone halfway up sides of springform pan.  Bake cheesecake until softly set and slightly puffed around edges, about 1 hour.  Turn off oven.  Let cake stand in oven 45 minutes.  Transfer springform pan to rack and cool.  Cover; chill cake overnight.

Make Glaze:  Bring cream to boil in heavy small saucepan.  Remove from heat.  Add 4 ounces chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth.  Pour glaze over top of cake.  Using spatula, smooth glaze evenly over top.  Refrigerate until glaze is set, at least 2 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)

Using knife, cut around sides of pan to loosen cake.  Remove pan sides.  Cut into wedges and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  soy sauce
  1                cup  Sherry
  4                     duck breast halves - (6 oz ea)
  12                    frozen dark sweet cherries -- thawed, halved
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1                cup  beef stock or canned beef broth
     1/2           cup  ruby Port
  1                     fresh thyme sprig
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch -- dissolved in
  2          teaspoons  water
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature,
                        cut into 1/2" pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Whisk soy sauce and Sherry in medium bowl to blend.  Using sharp knife, make diagonal cuts at 1/2-inch intervals in duck skin (not through meat).  Place duck, skin-side up, in glass baking dish.  Pour marinade over.  Cover duck with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours.

Bring cherries, chicken stock, beef stock, Port and thyme sprig to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat.  Simmer until mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Remove duck from marinade.  Add duck breasts, skin-side down, to skillet.  Cook until skin is crispy, about 10 minutes.  Turn duck over and continue cooking to desired doneness, about 5 minutes for medium.  Transfer duck to work surface.

Add cornstarch mixture to Port-cherry sauce.  Bring to simmer, whisking constantly.  Add butter 1 piece at a time, whisking until butter is melted before adding next piece.  Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Slice duck breasts thinly on diagonal and fan out on plates.  Spoon Port-cherry sauce over duck and serve.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  "My husband and I discovered a restaurant called Abbie Lane when we were on vacation in Newport, Vermont," writes Beth D. Fisher of Middleton, Wisconsin.  "He ordered the special -- a duck breast with cherry sauce -- and really enjoyed it.  I would love to make this dish for him at home."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     sheet frozen puff pastry -- thawed
                        = (half of 17 1/4-oz package)
  1                     egg -- beaten to blend
  9                     smoked bacon slices -- chopped
     1/3           cup  minced shallots
  1                cup  ruby Port
     1/2           cup  dried cranberries
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  6        tablespoons  crumbled blue cheese
  9               cups  bite-size curly endive

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Unfold pastry onto work service.  Using 2-inch diameter scalloped cookie cutter, cut out 12 rounds.  Using 1-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out centers of 6 pastry rounds.  Discard centers.

Pierce 2-inch rounds all over with fork.  Brush edges with egg glaze.  Top with pastry rings, pressing gently.  Transfer to large baking sheet.  Bake until puffed and golden, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to rack; cool.  Pull out uncooked portion from centers of pastries and discard.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Cook bacon in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat until crisp.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels.  Pour 3 tablespoons bacon drippings into small bowl.  Discard all but 1 teaspoon of remaining drippings from skillet.

Add shallots to drippings in skillet; sautÈ over medium-high heat until tender, about 3 minutes.  Add Port and cranberries and bring to boil, scraping any browned bits.  Boil until cranberries are soft and liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes.  Add reserved 3 tablespoons bacon drippings and stir just until warm.  Pour vinegar into small bowl.  Gradually whisk in Port mixture.

Meanwhile, place pastries on baking sheet.  Spoon 1 heaping tablespoon cheese into center of each.  Bake until cheese is soft, about 6 minutes.

Place endive in large bowl.  Pour warm dressing over and toss.  Divide greens among 6 plates.  Sprinkle with bacon.  Top each with 1 pastry and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  dried crushed red pepper
  1 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  1                cup  chicken stock

  7              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  sugar
                        Chocolate Glaze -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter 8-inch-diameter springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Line bottom of pan with parchment paper.  Butter parchment.  Wrap outside of pan with foil.

Finely grind hazelnuts in processor.  Stir chocolate and butter in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until smooth.  Cool chocolate mixture to room temperature.

Using electric mixer, beat yolks and sugar in large bowl until thick and pale yellow, about 5 minutes.  Fold in cooled chocolate mixture, then hazelnuts.  Transfer batter to prepared pan.  Smooth top.

Bake until cake is set and appears dry but tester comes out with very moist crumbs attached, about 45 minutes.  Transfer to rack.  Lightly press down any raised edges of cake.  Cool completely.  Run small knife around sides of pan to loosen cake.  Remove pan sides.  Invert cake onto platter.  Remove pan bottom.  Peel off parchment.

Slide waxed paper strips under cake to protect platter.  Using icing spatula, spread thin coating of Chocolate Glaze over top and sides of cake.  Rewarm remaining glaze over low heat if necessary.  Pour glaze in pool over center of cake; spread over top and sides.  Remove waxed paper strips.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover with cake dome and refrigerate.  Let stand 1 hour at room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields 12 servings.

Comments:  The Italian combination of chocolate and hazelnuts, called gianduia, is used here in a sumptuous, dense cake.  The torte's lustrous chocolate glaze makes this a perfect dessert for holiday entertaining.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === LOBSTER SAUCE ===
  2                     live lobsters - (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lbs)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/3           cups  finely-chopped shallots
  1                cup  chopped fennel bulb
  3              large  garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/4           cup  Madeira
  4          teaspoons  tomato paste
  3               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1         tablespoon  butter -- room temperature
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
                        === FILLING ===
     1/3           cup  lentils
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  2             medium  leeks, white and pale green parts only -- thinly sliced
  6             ounces  crabmeat
                        === RAVIOLI ===
  6                     lasagne noodles
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro

For Sauce:  Boil lobsters in pot of boiling water 8 minutes.  Transfer to bowl of ice water; cool.  Drain.  Working over large bowl to collect juices, remove claws and tails.  Using knife, cut tails into 2-inch-wide pieces.  Remove meat.  Crack claws; remove meat.  Cut bodies in half.  Transfer shells and bodies to bowl with juices.  Slice meat; place in small bowl.  Chill.

Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add shallots, fennel and garlic; sautÈ 8 minutes.  Add Madeira and tomato paste; bring to boil.  Add stock, lobster shells and any juices; bring to boil.  Reduce heat; simmer until reduced to 2 1/2 cups, about 30 minutes.

Strain liquid into saucepan, pressing on shells.  Mix butter and flour in bowl.  Add to liquid.  Bring to boil, whisking often.  Add cream; simmer until reduced to sauce consistency, about 8 minutes.

For Filling:  Cook lentils in medium saucepan of simmering water until tender, about 20 minutes.  Drain.  Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat.  Add leeks; sautÈ until tender, about 15 minutes.  Add lentils, lobster meat, crabmeat and 1/2 cup lobster sauce.

For Ravioli:  Cook pasta in pot of boiling salted water until just tender.  Drain.  Cut each noodle crosswise into 4 pieces.  Divide half of pasta among 6 shallow bowls.  Rewarm filling, mix in cilantro and spoon over pasta.  Top with remaining pasta.  Bring sauce to simmer.  Spoon over pasta.

This recipe yields 6 appetizer servings.

Comments:  This is made with homemade pasta at the inn.  Our easy alternative uses cooked lasagne noodles cut into squares.

                  Mushroom-Leek Soup With Brie Croutons

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  butter - (1/2 stick)
  3              large  leeks, white and pale green parts only -- thinly sliced
  8             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- stemmed, sliced
  8             ounces  crimini mushrooms -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  4               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1                cup  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  dry Sherry
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4                     green onions -- sliced
  12            slices  French-bread baguette, 1/4" thick
     1/2         pound  Brie -- frozen, rind
                        removed, cheese cut into 1/4"-thick slices
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh chives

Melt butter in large pot over medium-high heat.  Add leeks and all mushrooms; sautÈ 8 minutes.  Add flour and stir 1 minute.  Gradually mix in stock.  Bring to boil, stirring frequently.  Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.

Add cream and Sherry and simmer 5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Stir in green onions.  (Soup can be made 1 day ahead.  Cool slightly.  Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place bread slices on baking sheet.  Bake until light golden, about 10 minutes.  Cool.  Top croutons with cheese slices.

Preheat broiler.  Place 6 ovenproof bowls or soufflÈ dishes on baking sheet.  Bring soup to simmer; ladle into bowls.  Top each with 2 croutons.  Broil until cheese is completely melted, about 2 minutes.  Sprinkle with chives and serve.

This recipe yields 6 (first-course) servings.

Comments:  "I love going to Peter Schottís here in Boise for special occasions," writes Tracie Merrell of Boise, Idaho.  "The restaurant is elegant but relaxed, and the food is memorable, especially the mushroom soup with Brie croutons."

Freezing the Brie firms it, so removing the rind and slicing the cheese are much easier.

Comments:  &quot;I love going to Peter Schottís here in Boise for special occasions,&quot; writes Tracie Merrell of Boise, Idaho.  &quot;The restaurant is elegant but relaxed, and the food is memorable, especially the mushroom soup with Brie croutons.&quot;
</DirT>
<DirT>
Freezing the Brie firms it, so removing the rind and slicing the cheese are much easier.

Categories    : Breakfast                       Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  old-fashioned oats or quick-cooking oats
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick) -- melted
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Additional melted butter -- for brushing skillet
                        Lingonberry preserves
                        Fresh blueberries -- (optional)
                        Whipped cream -- (optional)

Combine first 6 ingredients in large bowl.  Whisk buttermilk, eggs, 1/4 cup melted butter and vanilla in medium bowl.  Add to dry ingredients; whisk until blended but some small lumps still remain.  Let batter stand to thicken, about 2 hours.  (Can be prepared up to 1 day ahead.  Cover batter and refrigerate.)

Preheat oven to 250 degrees.  Heat heavy large skillet over medium heat.  Brush skillet with melted butter.  Working in batches, ladle batter by 1/4 cupfuls into skillet.  Cook pancakes until bottoms are golden brown and bubbles form on top, about 2 minutes.

Turn pancakes over; cook until bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to baking sheet.  Keep warm in oven.  Repeat with remaining batter, brushing skillet with more butter as necessary.

Serve with lingonberry preserves and fresh blueberries and whipped cream, if desired.

This recipe yields about 16 pancakes.

Comments:  Swedish cooks use lots of buttermilk, and the lingonberry jam suggested as an accompaniment to these incredibly light pancakes is a typical Swedish condiment.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR SALSA ===

     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
                        === FOR FISH ===
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  6                     orange roughy fillets, 3/4" thk -- (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        === FOR HARICOTS VERTS ===
  1              pound  haricots verts -- trimmed
                        = (or other slender green beans)
                        Fresh lemon juice
                        Additional olive oil

* Note:  Chipotle chilies canned in a spicy tomato sauce, sometimes called adobo, are available at Latin American markets, specialty foods stores and some supermarkets.

For Salsa:  Toss all ingredients in large bowl to combine.  Cover and refrigerate.  (Can be made 4 hours ahead.  Keep chilled.)

For Fish:  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper.  Place flour in shallow baking dish.  Coat fish with flour.  Working in batches, sautÈ fish until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.  Using spatula, transfer fish to baking sheet.  Bake fish until opaque in center, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook haricots verts in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.  Drain.  Transfer to ice water to cool; drain.  Season to taste with lemon juice and olive oil.

Divide haricots verts equally among plates.  Top with fish fillet and salsa.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "Whenever I visit my family in the Chicago area, my sister and I make a point of having lunch at Fresh Starts Restaurant in Flossmoor," says Carol De Biase-Ruffe of Arvada, Colorado.  "They serve delicious, healthful food -- and we're never disappointed.  The last time we went there, I ordered a fish entrÈe topped with tomato salsa."

The restaurant uses tilapia for this dish; we substituted the easier-to-find orange roughy.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CRUST ===
  1            package  chocolate wafer cookies - (9 oz)
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/4 sticks) -- melted
                        === FILLING ===
  1                jar  creamy peanut butter- (18 oz)
  2           packages  cream cheese - (8 oz ea) -- room temperature
  2               cups  powdered sugar
  2        tablespoons  vanilla extract
  2               cups  chilled whipping cream
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  instant espresso powder
  6             ounces  bittersweet (not unsweetened) or
                        semisweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

For Crust:  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Blend cookies, sugar and cinnamon in processor to fine crumbs.  Add melted butter and blend well using on/off turns.  Press crumb mixture onto bottom and up sides of 10-inch-diameter springform pan.  Bake until crust starts to puff and darkens slightly, about 15 minutes.  Cool.

For Filling:  Using electric mixer, beat peanut butter and cream cheese in large bowl to blend.  Add powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons vanilla extract and beat until well blended.  Using clean dry beaters, beat 2 cups whipping cream in medium bowl until stiff peaks form; fold into peanut butter mixture in 4 additions.  Spoon filling into prepared crust.

For Topping:  Combine 1/2 cup cream, 1/4 cup sugar and espresso powder in heavy medium saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until espresso powder and sugar dissolve and mixture comes to simmer.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth.  Whisk in 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Cool topping 5 minutes.  Spread topping evenly over filling.  Refrigerate cake until cold, about 4 hours.  (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.  Cover cake and keep refrigerated.)  Serve cake chilled.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  "My sister, who lives near Chicago, takes me into the city for dinner at Erwin restaurant whenever I visit her," says Marion J. Matczynski of Parma Heights, Ohio.  "One time I tried the peanut mousse cake; it was to die for."

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Custards                        Desserts


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  9              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  bourbon
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  2 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  6        tablespoons  golden brown sugar
     1/2           cup  coarsely-chopped toasted pecans

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place six 3/4-cup soufflÈ dishes or custard cups in large roasting pan.  Whisk egg yolks, sugar, bourbon and vanilla extract in large bowl to blend.  Bring whipping cream to boil in heavy medium saucepan.  Gradually whisk hot whipping cream into egg yolk mixture.  Pour custard into soufflÈ dishes, dividing equally.

Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of soufflÈ dishes.  Bake custards until just set in center, about 30 minutes.  Remove from water and cool completely.  Cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours.  (Custards can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.  Keep covered and refrigerated.)

Preheat broiler.  Arrange soufflÈ dishes on baking sheet.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon golden brown sugar evenly over each.  Broil until sugar melts and turns dark brown, rotating baking sheet for even browning and watching closely, about 2 minutes.  Sprinkle crËme br˚lÈes with chopped toasted pecans, dividing equally.  Cool slightly and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "The last time I was in Texas, where I'm from originally, I had dinner at Zuni Grill on the San Antonio Riverwalk.  I felt right at home when I took a bite of the pecans in the clever, southern-style crËme br˚lÈe," says Linda M. Dunn of Sparks, Nevada.  "I'd like to try making it at home."

Toasted pecans are sprinkled over the crËme br˚lÈe after the sugar is caramelized so that the nuts don't burn.  Note that the custards can be prepared two days ahead of time.  Caramelize the sugar on top of the custards up to two hours before serving, if you like.

"The dish is so popular that the management counts the orders.  Every time they hit ten thousand, the guest who requested it gets a free trip to Italy.  Iíd be happy just to 'win' the recipe."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            slices  crusty whole wheat bread
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  4              large  portobello mushrooms - (abt 1 1/4 lbs) -- stemmed, and
                        cut into 1/3"-thick slices
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  Creole or Cajun seasoning -- see * Note
  2          teaspoons  lemon pepper seasoning
     2/3           cup  purchased ranch dressing
     1/4           cup  tahini (sesame seed paste) -- see * Note
     1/4           cup  milk
  12                    thin tomato slices
  6                     thin slices Swiss cheese
                        Red leaf lettuce

* Note:  Creole or Cajun seasoning is available in the spice section of most supermarkets.  Tahini is available at Middle Eastern and natural foods stores and some supermarkets.

Preheat broiler.  Place bread in single layer on baking sheet.  Broil until toasted.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms and onion; sautÈ until tender, about 10 minutes.  Add Creole seasoning and lemon pepper seasoning; sautÈ 2 minutes.

Whisk ranch dressing, tahini and milk in medium bowl to blend.  Divide mushroom-onion mixture among 6 toasted bread slices.  Top each with 1 tablespoon tahini sauce, 2 tomato slices, 1 slice Swiss cheese and lettuce.  Top with second toasted bread slice and serve.

This recipe yields 6 sandwiches.

Comments:  "We dine at the Meridian CafÈ whenever we're in Louisville.  The portobello mushroom sandwich is our favorite," say Libby and Roys Ellinas of La Grange, Kentucky.  "It has a tangy, creamy sauce that we would love to know how to make."

Prepare this sandwich with any favorite bread -- crusty country bread or artisan-style rolls would be especially good.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 1/2 sticks) -- chilled, diced
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
     1/2           cup  raisins
  1                cup  whipping cream
  3              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1         tablespoon  grated lemon peel
  2          teaspoons  water

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with foil.

Sift flour, sugar, baking powder and salt into large bowl.  Add butter and rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Stir in raisins.

Whisk cream, 2 eggs, vanilla and lemon peel in medium bowl to blend.  Add egg mixture to flour mixture; stir just until combined.  Gather dough into ball and knead lightly.

Roll out dough on floured surface to 3/4-inch thickness.  Using 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out scones.  Gather scraps; reroll and cut out additional scones.  Place scones on prepared baking sheets, spacing apart.

Whisk remaining egg and 2 teaspoons water in small bowl to blend.  Brush egg mixture over tops of scones.  Bake scones until golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Transfer scones to rack and cool slightly.  (Can be made 8 hours ahead.  Cool completely.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.)

Serve warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields about 22 scones.

Comments:  "The scones from Bon Bonerie in Cincinnati are moist, light and sweet," says John Van Eeckhout of Norfolk, Virginia.  "When I lived in the area, one of my favorite ways to spend a Saturday morning was to read the newspaper in the bakery's adjacent tearoom while enjoying a raisin scone with clotted cream, preserves and a cup of coffee."

Raisin Scones are also delicious served with butter and jam.

  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  5                     bacon slices -- chopped
  1              whole  chicken - (3 1/2 lbs) -- cut into 8 pieces
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2               cups  chopped onions - (abt 2 med)
  4                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2               cups  long-grain white rice
  1                jar  roasted sliced pimientos - (7 oz) -- with juice
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed saffron threads
  2               cups  bottled clam juice
  1 1/2           cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1              pound  large uncooked shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  1              pound  cleaned squid bodies -- cut 1/2" rings
  1              dozen  clams -- scrubbed
  1              dozen  mussels -- scrubbed, debearded
  1                cup  frozen green peas -- thawed
                        Lemon wedges

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat.  Add chopped bacon and cook until fat is rendered, about 6 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels and drain.  Set aside.

Sprinkle chicken pieces with salt and pepper.  Add chicken to bacon drippings in pot and cook over medium heat until brown, about 7 minutes per side.  Using tongs, remove chicken from pot.

Add chopped onions and garlic to pot and sautÈ until beginning to brown, scraping up any browned bits, about 10 minutes.  Stir in rice, roasted pimientos with juices and saffron.  Add clam juice and chicken stock to pot and bring mixture to simmer.  Remove from heat.

Pour rice mixture into 15- by 10- by 2-inch glass baking dish.  Arrange chicken, shrimp, squid, clams and mussels in rice mixture.  Sprinkle with chopped bacon and peas.  Cover with foil.

Bake paella until chicken is cooked through, clams and mussels open and rice is tender, about 45 minutes (discard any clams and mussels that do not open).  Remove foil from baking dish.  Let paella stand 10 minutes.  Serve with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  "I go to Spain frequently, and I've tried many kinds of paella there," says Bruce Cummings of Baltimore, Maryland.  "Recently, though, I discovered an outstanding one right here in Baltimore, at Tio Pepe Restaurante."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  cream cheese -- room temperature
  6             ounces  thinly-sliced smoked salmon -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
     1/4      teaspoon  white pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
  1              large  egg -- beaten to blend
  2               cups  fresh white breadcrumbs
                        Peanut oil -- for deep-frying
                        Lemon wedges

Blend cream cheese and smoked salmon in processor until almost smooth, with small salmon bits remaining.  Mix in dill, white pepper and hot pepper sauce.  Drop salmon mixture by generous tablespoonfuls onto large baking sheet.  Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.

Place flour in small bowl.  Dip 1 mound of salmon mixture into flour, coating completely (shake off excess).  Using hands, roll mixture into ball.  Dip ball into beaten egg, then breadcrumbs, coating completely.  Return to baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining salmon mixture, flour, egg and breadcrumbs.  Cover and refrigerate croquettes until cold, about 20 minutes.

Add enough peanut oil to heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 3 inches.  Heat to 350 degrees.  Working in batches, fry croquettes until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Using tongs, transfer croquettes to paper towels; drain.  Serve warm with lemon wedges.

This recipe yields about 2 dozen.

Comments:  At the restaurant, these are called truffles and are served on mixed greens with a watercress vinaigrette, but they are also excellent presented on their own as hors d'oeuvres.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1                cup  whipping cream
  1                can  pure pumpkin - (15 oz)
  3        tablespoons  dark brown sugar - (packed)
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/8      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  grated sharp cheddar cheese - (packed)
                        Chopped fresh cilantro

Bring chicken stock and whipping cream to boil in heavy medium pot.  Whisk in canned pumpkin, brown sugar, cumin, chili powder, coriander and nutmeg.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until soup thickens slightly and flavors blend, about 15 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  (Soup can be prepared up to 1 day ahead.  Cool.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm over medium-low heat, whisking occasionally.)

Ladle soup into bowls.  Garnish each serving with cheddar cheese and cilantro and serve.

This recipe yields 4 (first-course) servings.

Comments:  "The Watermark restaurant here in Cleveland is my favorite place to take out-of-town guests -- and I find other excuses to go, too," writes Bob Charleton of Cleveland, Ohio.  " Last time I went there, I had lunch in the Garden Room, a glassed-in space overlooking the Cuyahoga River.  The highlight of the meal was an unusual pumpkin soup topped with cheddar cheese."

Surprisingly easy to make, this soup is flavored with cumin and chili powder.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              pound  Maui onions -- diced
  3                     garlic cloves -- chopped
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and garlic; sautÈ until onions just begin to brown, about 10 minutes.  Add vinegar and sugar and cook 5 minutes, stirring often.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
  1                cup  pecan halves - (generous)
                        Vegetable oil -- for deep-frying

Combine 2 cups water, sugar, allspice, cayenne and paprika in heavy small saucepan.  Bring to boil; boil until mixture registers 220 degrees on candy thermometer, about 3 minutes.  Add pecans and cook until syrup clings to pecans, about 5 minutes.  Drain pecans well.

Pour enough oil into heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 1 inch.  Heat oil to 350 degrees.  Add pecans and fry until brown and crisp, about 2 minutes.  Working quickly so that pecans donít burn, use slotted spoon to transfer pecans to paper towels.  Cool.  (Can be made 1 week ahead.  Store airtight at room temperature.)

This recipe yields about 1 cup.

Comments:  Delicious in romaine salad or on their own, these pecans are boiled in a spicy sauce, then deep-fried.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR CIDER VINEGAR SAUCE ===
  1         tablespoon  butter
     3/4           cup  sliced shallots
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
  2 1/2           cups  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1 1/2           cups  beef stock or canned broth
                        === FOR CHICKEN ===
     1/2           cup  dried apricots -- sliced
     1/4           cup  raisins
  6        tablespoons  butter - (3/4 stick)
  5                     mushrooms -- chopped
  1                cup  chopped seeded peeled tomatoes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1            package  ready-to-use spinach - (10 oz) -- stemmed
  6                     boneless chicken breast halves with skin
                        Kitchen string

Make Sauce:  Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add shallots; sautÈ until beginning to brown, about 10 minutes.  Add sugar.  SautÈ until shallots are golden brown, about 10 minutes.  Increase heat to medium-high.  Add vinegar; boil 2 minutes.  Add both stocks; boil until liquid is reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 25 minutes.  Strain.

Make Chicken:  Soak dried fruit in hot water to cover for 15 minutes.  Drain.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Add mushrooms and sautÈ until tender, about 4 minutes.  Add tomatoes and sautÈ until almost all liquid evaporates, about 4 minutes.  Stir in fruit and sautÈ 2 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

Steam spinach until just wilted, about 2 minutes.  Cool.

Using sharp knife, cut horizontal slit 3/4 of the way through each chicken breast.  Open as for book.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Place thin layer of spinach over half of each breast.  Top spinach with 2 tablespoons fruit mixture.  Close breasts over filling.  Tie with kitchen string.  (Sauce and chicken can be made 1 day ahead; chill.)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper; brown in skillet, about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer to baking sheet.  Bake until chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes.

Bring sauce to simmer.  Remove from heat.  Gradually add 4 tablespoons butter, whisking just until melted.  Remove string from chicken.  Cut each breast crosswise into 5 slices.  Serve with sauce.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  In this beautiful main course, served at Le Bec-Fin in Philadelphia, a mixture of dried apricots, raisins, mushrooms, tomatoes and spinach is the surprise filling.

  1 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  20            slices  firm white bread, 1/4" thick
     3/4           cup  chilled whipping cream
     1/4           cup  sour cream

Combine berries, water, sugar and lemon juice in heavy large saucepan.  Bring to simmer, stirring occasionally.  Strain berry mixture, reserving juices.

Line six 3/4-cup soufflË dishes with plastic, overlapping sides.  Using 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out round from center of 12 bread slices.  Trim crusts from 8 bread slices.  Cut each slice into 4 equal squares.  Dip 1 round into fruit juices.  Place in bottom of dish.  Dip 5 bread squares, 1 at a time, into juices; place around sides of dish.  Spoon 1/2 cup berries into dish.  Dip 1 more bread round into juices.  Place atop berries.  Cover.  Repeat with bread rounds and squares, juices and berries.

Combine remaining berries and juices in bowl; cover and chill.  Place puddings on baking sheet.  Top with another baking sheet.  Place heavy object on sheet.  Chill overnight.

Beat whipping cream and sour cream to soft peaks.  Unwrap puddings.  Turn out onto plates; remove plastic.  Serve with cream and berry mixture.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  At the inn, this classic English dessert comes with clotted cream.  A blend of whipped cream and sour cream is a nice substitute.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  chicken stock
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1                cup  beef stock or canned beef broth
  6        tablespoons  olive oil - (about)
  2 1/2         pounds  veal cutlets, 1/4" thick
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  whipping cream
  6             ounces  Gorgonzola cheese -- crumbled
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Sweet-and-Sour Red Cabbage -- (see recipe)

Boil both stocks in medium saucepan until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 15 minutes.  Set aside.

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, dredge veal in flour, shaking off excess.  SautÈ veal until brown and cooked through, adding more oil to skillet as needed, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer to baking sheet; keep warm in oven.

Add wine to same skillet and boil over medium-high heat until liquid is reduced by half, scraping up any browned bits, about 2 minutes.  Add stock mixture and boil until liquid is reduced to 1/3 cup, about 2 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium.  Add cream and Gorgonzola; simmer until cheese melts.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Transfer veal to platter and spoon sauce over.  Serve with Sweet-and-Sour Red Cabbage.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Having relatives who live near Lansing, Illinois, gives Janice and Paul Abrinko a reason to visit that part of the country -- and after trying the veal with Gorgonzola sauce and red cabbage at Cafe Borgia, they have one more reason to go.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     garlic cloves
  8             ounces  skinless sea bass or halibut fillets -- cut 1/2" pieces
  5        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1                     egg white
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce (nam pla) -- see * Note
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  2          teaspoons  minced peeled fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  chili-garlic sauce -- see * Note
  1           teaspoon  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  oriental sesame oil
  8             ounces  crabmeat -- drained
  8             ounces  cooked shrimp -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped red bell pepper
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Butter lettuce leaves
                        Chili-Lime Sauce -- (see recipe)

* Note:  Available at Asian markets and in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.

With machine running, drop garlic cloves through feed tube of processor and chop finely.  Add sea bass and next 8 ingredients and process just until blended.  Transfer to large bowl; stir in crabmeat, shrimp, cilantro and red bell pepper.

Pour enough oil into heavy large skillet to reach depth of 1 inch; heat oil over medium-high heat to 350 degrees.  Working in batches, drop rounded tablespoonfuls of fritter mixture into hot oil.  Fry fritters until golden brown and cooked through, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, transfer cooked fritters to paper-towel-lined plate; drain.

Arrange fritters on platter with lettuce leaves.  Serve with Chili-Lime Sauce.

This recipe yields about 20 fritters.

Comments:  "I'm hoping to get the recipe for a terrific appetizer I tried at Hamiltons' at First & Main in Charlottesville, Virginia," says Sue Carter of Murieta, California.  "The seafood fritters came with lettuce leaves (to wrap around the fritters) and a spicy sauce."

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             ounces  thinly-sliced prosciutto
  1 1/4         pounds  asparagus -- trimmed
  3        tablespoons  olive oil -- plus
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2                     anchovy fillets -- chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1            package  mixed baby greens - (5 oz) -- about 10 cups
                        Farinata Wedges -- (see recipe)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line baking sheet with parchment paper.  Place prosciutto slices in single layer on parchment.  Bake until crisp, about 18 minutes.  Cool.  Break prosciutto into bite-size pieces.

Meanwhile, cook asparagus in heavy large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.  Drain.  Transfer asparagus to bowl filled with ice water to cool.  Drain thoroughly.

Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add chopped anchovies and garlic and sautÈ until garlic is golden, about 1 minute.  Add asparagus and prosciutto and sautÈ until heated through, about 3 minutes.  Add fresh lemon juice and remaining 1/2 cup olive oil and simmer 1 minute.  Remove from heat.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Divide greens among 6 plates.  Top with asparagus mixture, dividing equally.  Pour dressing from skillet over each serving.  Serve warm with Farinata Wedges.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  "The warm asparagus salad I had at Figs restaurant in Boston was as original as it was delicious," says Lena Madore of Los Altos, California.  "They served it with a chickpea pancake.  Iíd love to try both recipes."  This salad is great with or without the wedge of farinata, a flat savory cake of Italian origin made from chickpea flour.

Categories    : Mushrooms                       Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  warm water
     3/4         ounce  dried porcini mushrooms -- see * Note
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick)
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1                cup  chopped peeled carrots
     1/2           cup  chopped leek/ white and pale green part
  22            ounces  fresh wild mushrooms -- sliced
                        = (such as crimini or stemmed shiitake)
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  4               cups  chicken stock -- or more if needed
                        = (or canned low-salt chicken broth)
  1                cup  chopped peeled russet potato
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme
                        = (or 1 tspn dried thyme)
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chopped fresh parsley or chives

* Note:  Dried porcini mushrooms are available at Italian markets, specialty foods stores and many supermarkets.

Combine 2 cups warm water and dried porcini mushrooms in small bowl.  Let mushrooms soak until soft, about 30 minutes.  Using slotted spoon, remove mushrooms from liquid.  Squeeze excess liquid from mushrooms back into bowl.  Strain 1 cup soaking liquid into another small bowl, leaving any sediment behind.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large pot over medium heat.  Add onion, carrots and leek.  SautÈ until vegetables are tender and pale golden, about 10 minutes.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter and fresh mushrooms; sautÈ until mushrooms are tender and brown, about 10 minutes.  Stir in porcini and wine.  Cook until liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes.

Add 4 cups stock, potato, thyme, bay leaf and 1 cup reserved porcini soaking liquid.  Bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until potato is very soft, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Discard bay leaf.  Cool slightly.  Working in batches, puree soup in blender.  Return soup to pot.  Mix in cream.  Bring to simmer.  Season with salt and pepper.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.  Rewarm before serving, thinning with more stock, if desired.)

Ladle soup into bowls.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley or chives.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Adding potatoes to the puree reduces the amount of cream needed to give this soup its thick, creamy texture.
