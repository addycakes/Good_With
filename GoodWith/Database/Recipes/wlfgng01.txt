                      Barbecued Butterflied Chicken

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  shallots -- minced (1/3 cup)
  2                     large cloves garlic -- minced
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh rosemary
  1                     chicken - (3 1/2 to 4 lbs)
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
     1/4           cup  orange marmalade
  3        tablespoons  sherry wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a small bowl, combine shallots, garlic and rosemary.

Butterfly chicken or have butcher do it for you.  Using your fingertips, gently loosen skin from chicken breast and thighs.  Spread about 1 tablespoon shallot mixture on each chicken breast and thigh underneath the skin.

In large re-sealable food storage bag or in a glass baking dish combine remaining shallot mixture, orange juice, marmalade, vinegar and oil.  Add chicken to marinade, turning to coat.  Reseal food storage bag or cover chicken in dish with plastic wrap.  Marinate in refrigerator at least 8 hours, turning chicken occasionally.

Prepare grill for indirect cooking method.  When coals are medium-hot (when you can hold your hand above coals for just 3 seconds), remove chicken from marinade, reserving marinade.  Season chicken with salt and pepper.

Place chicken, skin-side up on grill rack directly over drip pan.  Brush chicken with some reserved marinade.  Cover with grill lid and grill chicken 40 minutes, checking every 10 minutes to make sure it is not burning.  Turn chicken, skin-side down on grill rack over drip pan.  Brush with marinade.  Cover and grill chicken 20 to 30 minutes longer or until juice run clear (or instant read thermometer registers 170 degrees.  Discard remaining marinade.

Cut the chicken into six or eight pieces and serve on a bed of lettuce greens.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Butterflying a chicken enables you to spread it out and grill it in one piece so it gets cooked evenly.  This recipe lets you create a wonderful crunchy-skinned chicken dish with very little effort and is perfect for a summer barbecue.  Make sure you place a drip pan immediately beneath the chicken when you grill it.  (This reduces flare-ups and keeps the meat moist.)

Wine Recommendation:  I love to serve rosÈ at a summer barbecue.  It's light, fresh and goes wonderfully with chicken dishes, especially grilled chicken.  Try Bonny Doon's Vin Gris from Santa Cruz, or look for a Provencal rosÈ from France or one of the delicious rosÈs that are being imported from Spain.

                     Barbecued Shrimp "BLT" Sandwich

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Sandwiches                      Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  peeled shrimp - (abt 20 medium)
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  12                    thin sourdough bread slices
  2               cups  baby lettuce
     1/2         pound  tomato -- cut 12 thin slices
  6             ounces  bacon - (12 thk slices) -- cooked, drained
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        === LEMON-BUTTER SAUCE ===
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  3             ounces  shallots - (abt 5 large) -- peeled, sliced
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  champagne
     1/2           cup  cream
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
                        Juice of 1/2 lemon
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Preheat the barbecue or grill.

Sprinkle the vegetable oil over the shrimp.  Grill the shrimp, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side.  Do not overcook.  Drain and cut each shrimp in half lengthwise.

In a medium saucepan, heat the oil.  Sweat the shallots for about 2 minutes.  Do not brown.  Deglaze the pan with the wine and vinegar and reduce slightly.  Pour in the cream and reduce by half.  Whisk in the butter and strain into a clean pan.  Season with lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.  Keep warm.

For each sandwich, spread a little mayonnaise on one slice of bread and arrange a little lettuce on top of the mayonnaise.  Top with three slices of tomato and season with a little salt and pepper, and arrange the bacon on top of the tomatoes.  Top with the second slice of bread, a thin layer of mayonnaise and a little lettuce.  Heat the shrimp (10 halves) in the lemon butter and arrange on the lettuce.  Top with the third slice of bread and cut in half.  Serve immediately.

Serve along with a light salad or fresh French fries.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I like to grill outside all year long and I have friends who live in Chicago and New York who feel the same way.  There's nothing quite like the smell of barbecue smoke in the middle of a Northern winter!

Wine Recommendation:  If you're feeling adventurous try a full and oakey Chardonnay from Australia like Rosemount, Petaluma or Lindemans.  This dish goes great with a number of the micro brews, such as Anchor Steam, Sierra Nevada or the most popular Samuel Adams.

                  Barbecued Shrimp With Ginger And Lime

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  large shrimp - (16 to 20 count)
  2                     limes -- each cut 4 wedges
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
                        === MARINADE ===
  3        tablespoons  freshly-squeezed lime juice
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  grated lime zest
  1           teaspoon  Asian sesame oil

In a large bowl, whisk together lime juice, olive oil, ginger, brown sugar, garlic, lime zest and sesame oil.  Set aside.

Peel and de-vein the shrimp leaving the tails intact.  Add shrimp to marinade and toss to coat thoroughly.  Cover bowl or place contents of bowl in a large re-sealable plastic food storage bag and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Pre-heat grill or broiler.  Thread shrimp and lime wedges onto 8 skewers, dividing evenly.

Cook shrimp skewers directly over medium-hot fire for about 5 minutes or until shrimp are bright pink, turning once during cooking or cook directly under the broiler, 3 to 4 inches from the heat source.

For each serving place two skewers on top of a finely chopped salad mix like radicchio and endive, or romaine and arugola.  Sprinkle with chopped cilantro leaves.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Fresh limes give this very fast and easy dish a real hit of citrus flavor.  The smoky shrimp with an Asian edge are perfect for outdoor summer cooking, although they're equally as good when broiled.

Wine Recommendation:  This is a perfect Sauvignon Blanc dish.  Look for a French Sancerre or one of the fresh and grassy versions from California or New Zealand.  Robert Mondavi's Fume Blanc is a Californian classic and you can't do better than New Zealand's Cloudy Bay.

<DirT>
In a large bowl, whisk together lime juice, olive oil, ginger, brown sugar, garlic, lime zest and sesame oil.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Peel and de-vein the shrimp leaving the tails intact.  Add shrimp to marinade and toss to coat thoroughly.  Cover bowl or place contents of bowl in a large re-sealable plastic food storage bag and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pre-heat grill or broiler.  Thread shrimp and lime wedges onto 8 skewers, dividing evenly.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook shrimp skewers directly over medium-hot fire for about 5 minutes or until shrimp are bright pink, turning once during cooking or cook directly under the broiler, 3 to 4 inches from the heat source.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For each serving place two skewers on top of a finely chopped salad mix like radicchio and endive, or romaine and arugola.  Sprinkle with chopped cilantro leaves.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Fresh limes give this very fast and easy dish a real hit of citrus flavor.  The smoky shrimp with an Asian edge are perfect for outdoor summer cooking, although they&apos;re equally as good when broiled.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  This is a perfect Sauvignon Blanc dish.  Look for a French Sancerre or one of the fresh and grassy versions from California or New Zealand.  Robert Mondavi&apos;s Fume Blanc is a Californian classic and you can&apos;t do better than New Zealand&apos;s Cloudy Bay.

                         Basil-Garlic Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
     1/4           cup  champagne vinegar
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste

In a blender, combine the basil, vinegar, and Parmesan cheese until the basil is pureed.  With the motor running, pour the oil through the opening and blend until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper to taste, pour into a small bowl, and set aside.  Whisk before using.

This recipe yields about 1 cup.

Comments:  This simple dressing is great over fresh tomatoes, and makes a wonderful marinade for chicken and shrimp.  But see my recipe for "Grilled Italian Chicken" and you'll discover just how versatile it can be.

                     Beef Stew With Winter Vegetables

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  beef chuck
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  Kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              large  onion -- cut 1/2"-thk wedges
  2              large  garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  homemade beef stock or canned beef broth
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1                     bay leaf
  6              large  fresh sage leaves - (to 8) -- washed, dried
  1              pound  butternut squash -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
     1/2         pound  parsnips -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" pieces
  2             medium  carrots -- peeled, and cut
                        into 1" chunks
     1/2         pound  Roma tomatoes -- cored, blanched,
                        peeled, seeded, and diced.

Cut the beef into 1-inch cubes.

On a piece of waxed paper or in a plastic food storage bag combine flour, salt and pepper.  Toss beef cubes in flour mixture to coat or place beef cubes in food storage bag and shake until beef cubes are coated with flour mixture.

In a wide, heavy saucepan, heat the oil.  Brown beef cubes on all sides, removing from pan as browned.

In the same saucepan, melt the butter.  SautÈ the onion and garlic until translucent.

Deglaze with red wine and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of saucepan.  Return the meat to the pan.  Add stock, vinegar and bay leaf.  Cover and let simmer 1 hour.

Cut the sage leaves into a chiffonade and stir into sauce with the butternut, squash, parsnips, carrots and tomatoes.  Cover and let simmer 20 minutes or until meat and vegetables are tender.  Remove bay leaf and correct seasonings.

Serve in large bowls with chopped parsley for garnish.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  There's nothing more comforting and delicious on a cold winter day than a big, steaming bowl of beef stew.  This is a simple recipe, easy to prepare, and creates a delicious combination of beef and winter vegetables.  I like to serve mine with a large plate of "Garlic Mashed Potatoes" (see recipe).

Wine Recommendation:  Hearty wines go best with hearty dishes.  I love a young Syrah or Shiraz, as they call it in Australia, with my beef stew.  Look for Clos du Bois and Benzinger from California, Rosemount and Penfolds from Australia.  They're all inexpensive, and offer wonderful depth and flavor for young wines.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE TAPENADE ===
  1                cup  NiÁoise olives -- pitted
  1                cup  small green French olives (Picholine) -- pitted
     1/4           cup  Oven-Dried Tomatoes -- (see recipe),
                        drained
  1         tablespoon  capers
  1                     garlic clove
  1                     anchovy fillet
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped fresh basil leaves
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
     1/4    tablespoon  chopped fresh oregano leaves
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === FOR THE CROSTINI ===
  1                     loaf crusty French bread -- sliced on a bias
                        Goat cheese

In a food processor, combine all the ingredients except the olive oil.  Using the pulse button, process until coarsely chopped and well blended.  Continue to process, slowly adding the olive oil.  Refrigerate in a covered container.  Use as needed for up to 1 month.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place bread slices on a cookie sheet and bake for 5 minutes, or until lightly toasted.

Spread crostini toast with a thin layer of goat cheese, then add tapenade.  Serve  immediately.

This recipe yields 1 heaping cup.

Comments:  Crostini are thin versions of the classic Italian Bruschetta.  Tapenade is the great olive spread of Provence.  It's a perfect combination.

                           California Guacamole

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             medium  fully-ripe avocados
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed lime juice
     1/3           cup  freshly-chopped cilantro
  1             medium  shallot -- minced
  1         tablespoon  Roasted Whole Garlic -- (see recipe)
  1              small  jalapeÒo -- seeded, minced
  1           teaspoon  salt

Halve one avocado, remove pit and scoop flesh into medium bowl.  Repeat with remaining avocados.  Pour lime juice over avocado flesh.

Using a fork or potato masher, mash lightly until mixture is still a little chunky.  Stir  in cilantro, shallot, Roasted Garlic, jalapeÒo and salt.

Serve with tortilla chips.  (Guacamole can be made ahead and covered with plastic wrap and kept refrigerated for up to 8 hours.  Return to room temperature before serving.)

This recipe yields about 2 cups, serves 4 to 6.

Comments:  There are as many different guacamole recipes as there are cantinas in Tijuana.  Mine is a simple version, subtly flavored with roasted garlic and shallots.  I try and keep the processing of the fresh ingredients to a minimum to let the flavors each play their role and always use fully-ripened, pebble-skinned Haas avocados.

Wine Recommendation:  Here in California, guacamole is inseparable from beer.  There are many great Mexican beers but if you can find Pacifica or Tecate youíll enjoy their fresh, crisp bite with this classic Mexican appetizer.

Categories    : Main Dish                       Pizza


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2        recipe  Pizza Dough -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  Pesto -- (see recipe)
  2        tablespoons  Oven-Dried Tomatoes -- (see recipe),
                        cut into thin slices
  1                cup  grated mozzerella cheese
     3/4           cup  grated Fontina cheese - (3 oz)
  2                     Roma tomatoes -- ends trimmed,
                        and cut into 12 slices
  2             ounces  goat cheese -- crumbled
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano leaves
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh thyme leaves
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  6              large  fresh basil leaves - (to 8) -- cut into chiffonade

Place a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out the dough into one 10-inch round or two 8-inch rounds.  Transfer dough to wooden pizza paddle or lightly-floured cookie sheet.  Brush lightly with Pesto and scatter the Oven-Dried Tomatoes evenly around the inner circle of the pizza.

Sprinkle with the mozzarella and Fontina cheeses, arrange the slices of the Roma tomatoes, and then sprinkle with the goat cheese, oregano, thyme, and finally the Parmesan cheese.  Slide pizza off paddle or cookie sheet onto hot pizza stone.  Bake until the pizza crust is nicely browned, 10 to 12 minutes.

When the pizza is removed from the oven, transfer to a cutting board and garnish with the chiffonade of basil leaves, cut into slices, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields one 10-inch or two 8-inch pizzas for 3 to 4 servings.

Comments:  When my son Cameron was younger, this was the only pizza he would eat.  He told me just what he wanted on his pizza, and heís eaten it the same way ever since.

Wine Recommendation:  Although itís hard to see pizza with anything other than beer, there are some great wine pairings that you might like to try.  Bonny Doon's Ca' del Solo and Edmunds St. John's Port 'o Call reds are perfect, and inexpensive, partners for this really cheesy pizza.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     shallots -- sliced
  8                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  1                     dry ancho chile -- roasted, crushed
  2                     scallions -- thinly sliced
                        into rounds
  1                     small handfu cilantro leaves
                        Juice of 2 to 3 limes
  1         tablespoon  honey
  3                     lamb racks -- chine bone removed
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ROMESCO SAUCE ===
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     dry ancho chilies -- roasted, crushed
  1                     fresh Serrano or jalepeÒo chile -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped
  1                     red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and diced
  3                     shallots -- sliced
  10                    garlic cloves -- chopped
  4                     whole tomatoes -- cut in half
  1                cup  tomato sauce
  1              large  pinch saffron threads
  1         tablespoon  cumin -- toasted, crushed
  1         tablespoon  coriander seeds -- toasted, crushed
                        A few basil and parsley leaves
     3/4           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted
                        Juice of 1 or 2 limes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Prepare the marinade.  Heat the olive oil in a heavy skillet and add the shallots, garlic and ancho chile.  Cook until barely golden.  Remove from heat and add scallions, cilantro leaves, lime juice and honey.

Remove the whole 'eye' from the rack, reserving the rib bones, and place in a non-reactive roasting pan with the marinade.  Refrigerate, covered, for up to 2 hours.  Slice the rib bones into 7 or 8 evenly, dividing meat at the bones.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Prepare the Romesco Sauce:  In a shallow roasting pan, combine olive oil, ancho and serano chilies, red bell pepper, shallots, garlic, tomato, tomato sauce, saffron, cumin, coriander, basil, and parsley.  Roast for 40 minutes or until the tomatoes start to brown.  Remove from the oven and transfer to a food processor.  Add the toasted almonds and lime juice.  Process until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Return half of the sauce to the roasting pan and toss in the rib bones.  Loosely cover with foil.  Cook for 1 hour or until meat is cooked.  Remove the foil cover and cook for another 10 minutes or until meat is brown.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Scrape the marinade off the 'eye'.  Season with salt and pepper.  Sear over high heat, in a large skillet, until all sides are well browned.  Transfer to a shallow roasting pan and coat with the remaining sauce.  Cook for about 10 minutes until medium-rare.  Allow to rest before slicing into 6 equal rounds.

Place three overlapping rounds from the eye on each serving plate and arrange 3 rib bones next to the them.  Serve immediately with "SautÈed Baby Vegetables" (see recipe).

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a truly exciting dish and if you have an afternoon to devote to preparing a memorable dinner then this is the perfect dish.  It combines two contrasting flavors, the first derived from the marinade and the second the Romanesco sauce.  The presentation is dramatic and people can't help but be impressed with the complex tastes they'll discover.

Wine Recommendation:  Strong flavors call for big wines.  Look for big clarets (the wines from Bordeaux), the Bordeaux-style wines now coming from California, or some of the wonderful Australian reds that represent real bargains to accompany this lamb.  I especially enjoy Niebaum-Coppola's "Rubicon" and Metisse's "Melka" from the Napa Valley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This is a truly exciting dish and if you have an afternoon to devote to preparing a memorable dinner then this is the perfect dish.  It combines two contrasting flavors, the first derived from the marinade and the second the Romanesco sauce.  The presentation is dramatic and people can&apos;t help but be impressed with the complex tastes they&apos;ll discover.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  Strong flavors call for big wines.  Look for big clarets (the wines from Bordeaux), the Bordeaux-style wines now coming from California, or some of the wonderful Australian reds that represent real bargains to accompany this lamb.  I especially enjoy Niebaum-Coppola&apos;s &quot;Rubicon&quot; and Metisse&apos;s &quot;Melka&quot; from the Napa Valley.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     celery root - (abt 1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled, trimmed,
                        and cut into 1" cubes
  1                     baking potato - (abt 8 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1" cubes
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Place the celery root and potato in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water.  Season with salt and cook until soft, 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain the water and return the celery and potato to the pan.  Pour in the cream and simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until thickened and most of the cream is absorbed, about 10 minutes.

Remove from the heat, stir in the butter, and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Puree in a food mill, return to the pan, and serve immediately.

Serve in a heated serving bowl or arrange attractively in a mound on each plate as an accompaniment to an entrÈe.  This is an essential partner for "Pork Chops With Caramelized Maple Onions" (see recipe).

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 cups.

Comments:  Celery root is a wonderful fall and winter vegetable.  Cut the skin from the celery root with a sharp knife.  Place the skinned celery root in water and quickly add fresh lemon juice to prevent discoloration.  To purÈe the vegetables, use a food mill or sieve.  Do not use a food processor or blender, which will turn the celery root stringy and gluey.

                    Chicken And Vegetable Quesadillas

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- grilled or broiled
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  lime juice
  1         tablespoon  chopped jalapeÒo pepper
  1         tablespoon  fresh chopped cilantro
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === ROASTED TOMATO AND PEPPER SALSA ===
  4                     Roma tomatoes
  1              large  red bell pepper
  1                     poblano chile
  2        tablespoons  fresh chopped cilantro
  2        tablespoons  chopped scallion
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  8              large  flour tortillas - (abt 8" to 9" dia)
  2               cups  grated Monterey jack cheese
                        Extra olive oil -- for oiling skillet
                        Sour cream -- for garnish
                        Cilantro sprigs -- for garnish

Slice cooked, grilled chicken breasts into thin strips.

In a glass bowl combine olive oil, lime juice, jalapeÒo, cilantro and salt.  Add chicken strips, toss to coat thoroughly and cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for about 1 hour to marinate.

To make salsa:  Working with one Roma tomato at a time, hold over open gas flame with a long handled carving fork, turning constantly for about 1 to 2 minutes until skin blackens and peels away from tomato.  Repeat with red bell pepper and poblano chile.  If you havenít got a gas cooktop, place Roma tomatoes on broiler tray directly under pre-heated broiler.  Turn several times until skins are blackened and peeling.  Repeat with red bell pepper and poblano chile.

Peel, core, seed and dice tomatoes, red bell pepper and chile and stir together in a medium bowl with cilantro, scallions and 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

To assemble quesadillas:  With a slotted spoon remove chicken mixture from marinade and place in a clean bowl.  Discard excess marinating liquid.  Place one tortilla in base of lightly oiled, large, heavy skillet set over medium heat.

Sprinkle about 1/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese over surface of tortilla.  Top with about one fourth of salsa mixture and marinated chicken mixture.  Top with another 1/4 cup cheese and another tortilla.

With a flat metal spatula press down firmly on quesadilla in pan to help the cheese to melt and the filling to stick together.  Cook for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.  Carefully flip over entire quesadilla and cook other side, pressing down with spatula for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.

The tortillas should be golden brown and cheese should be melted.  Adjust heat under pan if tortilla is getting too brown.  Remove from skillet; keep warm on baking sheet in a low oven.  Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling to make 4 quesadillas.

Cut each quesadilla into 4 wedges; arrange on a hot plate (4 wedges for an entree, 1 or 2 wedges for an appetizer).  Top each serving with a small dollop of sour cream and a sprig of cilantro.

This recipe yields 4 quesadillas (4 entree servings or 8 appetizer servings).

Comments:  Southwestern flavors abound in this quesadilla recipe.  The chunky salsa gets a rich, smoky flavor by roasting the tomatoes and peppers.  These quesadillas are perfect for an entree or sliced into smaller portions, make great appetizers.

Wine Recommendation:   Believe it or not I like to drink slightly chilled red wine with a spicy, smoky dish like these quesadillas.  I love Bonny Doonís Caí del Solo, Woodbridge reds from California, or some of the inexpensive Australian Cabernet Sauvignon/Shiraz blends from growers like Rosemount Estate and Penfolds.  Place them in the refrigerator for half an hour  before you serve them.

                   Chicken Kabobs With Lemon And Thyme

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1              small  shallot -- minced
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme leaves
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  finely-grated lemon zest
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4              large  boneless skinless chicken breast halves
  2                     lemons -- each cut 4 wedges

In medium bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, shallot, thyme, garlic, lemon zest, salt and pepper.  Place in large re-sealable plastic food storage bag.

Using a fork, pierce each chicken breast several times to help the marinade penetrate.  Cut each chicken breast into about 8 large chunks.  Place marinade in plastic bag; toss to coat thoroughly.  Refrigerate for about 1 hour.

Preheat grill.  Thread chicken chunks onto 8 skewers with lemon wedges.

Cook kabobs over medium hot fire for about 8 to 10 minutes or until chicken is cooked through, turning once.

Serve over salad greens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I like to grill outside all year long and I have friends who live in Chicago and New York who feel the same way.  There's nothing quite like the smell of herb-scented smoke in the middle of a Northern winter!  These kebabs are fast and easy to make, and the lemon/thyme flavor combination tastes delicious all year round.

Wine Recommendation:  With any kind of barbecue I like wine with big flavors and a lot of body.  You might like to try one of the many inexpensive Australian Chardonnays, or if you prefer a red wine, be bold and try Geyser Peak's Malbec or Firestone's Cabernet Franc for something a little different.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Bones from 2 chickens -- chopped into pieces
  1              small  carrot -- peeled, sliced
  1              small  onion -- quartered
  1              small  celery stalk -- sliced
                        Stems from 1 bunch parsley
  3                     green leek leaves - (to 4) -- (optional), sliced
  1              sprig  fresh thyme
                        = (or 1 pinch dried thyme)
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  white peppercorns
                        Mushroom scraps -- (optional)
                        Tomato scraps -- (optional)
  4             quarts  water -- more or less

In a stockpot, place the chicken bones, then add all the remaining ingredients, except the water.  Add water to cover by 2 inches, bring it to a boil and reduce the heat.  Simmer the mixture for 2 or 3 hours, skimming the surface scum from the stock as it collects.

Strain the stock into a clean pot and degrease it thoroughly.  Bring the stock to a boil and reduce it over moderate heat to 2 quarts.

Use the stock immediately or let it cool to room temperature and refrigerate or freeze it until needed.

This recipe yields 2 quarts.  Serving size = 1 cup.

                 Chicken With Chardonnay And Fresh Herbs

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  boneless skin-on chicken breast halves
  4             ounces  fresh goat cheese
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh tarragon
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh Italian parsley
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh chervil
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Salt -- to taste
  4          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil -- more or less
  1                     shallot -- minced
  1                cup  good California Chardonnay
  1                cup  Chicken Stock (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (2 oz)

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees or heat a grill until hot.

In a bowl, mix the goat cheese, half the herbs and white pepper to taste.

Loosen the skin of the chicken breasts.  Divide the cheese mixture, place some of it under the skin of each breast and pat gently to distribute evenly.

Season the chicken lightly with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle with olive oil.  Roast in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes or cook on the hot grill for 10 to 12 minutes per side, until chicken is cooked right through.

Note:  Make sure to get the charcoal very hot and let it get coated with grey ash before grilling the chicken.  If you are using a gas or electric grill get it very hot, too, then turn the heat down to medium to cook the chicken.

Combine the shallot and chardonnay in a saucepan, bring to a boil and reduce to a glaze, about 1/4 cup.  Add the stock and reduce by half.  Add the cream and continue to reduce until the sauce lightly coats the back of a spoon.  Whisk in the butter in small pieces, making sure each piece is incorporated before adding the next.  Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper.  Strain into a clean saucepan and add the remaining chopped herbs.

Pool the sauce onto 4 warm dinner plates.  Slice each chicken breast on the bias into 5 pieces and place on top of the sauce.  Serve immediately with the rest of the chardonnay.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Stuffing goat cheese under the skin of the chicken gives this dish a creamy and striking taste.  The fresh herbs and Chardonnay combine to make a delicious and complementary sauce.

Wine Recommendation:  Obviously a Californian Chardonnay will complement this dish.  But you may want to consider a contrast, perhaps a sparkling wine in the Champagne style like Brut Carneros or Jepsonπs Blanc de Blanc from Mendocino.

                     Chicken With Garlic And Parsley

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     boneless skin-on chicken breast halves
  12                    garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/4           cup  Italian parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 oz)
                        Juice of 1 large lemon
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped parsley

In a small saucepan, blanch the garlic cloves in boiling water for 1 minute.  Drain and slice the garlic thinly.  Toss them in a small bowl with the parsley and a little salt and pepper.

Stuff a little of the garlic mixture into the pockets under the skin of the chicken breasts (about 2 teaspoons per chicken).  Transfer the chicken to a plate, cover with plastic wrap and chill until ready to use.

Heat a charcoal or gas grill until moderately hot.  Grill the chicken 8 to 10 minutes per side until cooked through.  Do not overcook.

Note:  Make sure to get the charcoal very hot and let it get coated with gray ash before grilling the chicken.  If you are using a gas or electric grill, get it very hot, too, then turn the heat down to medium to cook the chicken.

Heat the butter in a sautÈ pan and gently sautÈ the remaining garlic mixture.  Add the lemon juice and chopped parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Place the chicken breasts on 4 large heated dinner plates.  Top with the sautÈed garlic and parsley.  Serve with fresh vegetables cooked al dente.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This entrÈe has been on the menu at Spago since we opened.  It continues to be one of the favorites, probably because it is so simple.  Best of all, it's fast and easy to make.

Wine Recommendation:  I love RosÈ with barbecued chicken.  RosÈ wine are fresh and fun and ideal for summer.  Look for a Provencal wine or perhaps a white Zinfandel from California.  Domaine Ott's classic RosÈ is one of the best from the South of France.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHINESE DUCKS ===
  3                     Chinese ducks - (abt 4 lbs ea) -- preferably air-dried
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  honey
  1                cup  plum wine
  2             sprigs  fresh mint
  2                     strips orange peel - (abt 1" by 2")
  1                cup  rice wine vinegar
  1                cup  plum puree -- (see below)
     1/2           cup  duck or veal demi-glace
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (2 oz)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Chinois pancakes -- (see below)
                        === PLUM PUREE ===
     1/2         pound  Elephant Heart plums -- halved, pitted
     1/2           cup  plum wine
     1/4           cup  raspberries, blueberries or
                        fresh black currants
                        === CHINOIS PANCAKE ===
     1/4           cup  flour
  1              pinch  salt
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
     1/2           cup  milk
  2          teaspoons  minced fresh ginger
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1                     scallion -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter
  6              small  scallions -- cut in half

For the Chinese Ducks:  Prepare the ducks.  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Mix 1/4 cup of the rice vinegar with the honey and brush the ducks all over with this mixture.

Place the ducks in a roasting pan and roast them about 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and pour off the accumulated fat.  Give the ducks a quarter turn and return to the oven.  Repeat this process for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the ducks are dark golden brown on all sides.  Remember to pour off the rendered fat each time you turn them.  When completely cooked, transfer the ducks to another pan and let them rest so that the fat continues to drain from the insides.

Meanwhile, in a saucepan, reduce the plum wine with the mint sprigs and orange peel to a glaze.  Add the vinegar and reduce it by two thirds.  Add the plum puree and reduce it by half, until the flavor is quite intense.  Add the demi-glace and continue to reduce the mixture by half, or until it is thickened slightly and tastes delicious.  Over very low heat whisk in the butter, a little at a time.  Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Strain the sauce and keep it warm.

Remove the breasts and legs from the duck.  Place them on a grill or under a broiler or salamander until the skin is crispy.

For the Plum Puree:  Place the plums, wine and berries in a small saucepan, bring to a boil and simmer until the plums are soft, about 15 minutes.  Puree the mixture in a blender or food processor and strain it through a fine sieve into a clean saucepan.  Bring to a boil and reduce to 1 cup.  Set aside.

For the Chinois Pancake:  In a small bowl, combine the flour, salt, egg and sesame oil.  Whisk in the milk, then unless your batter is completely lump free, strain into another bowl.  (The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream).  If the batter is too thick, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you get the desired consistency.  Stir in the ginger, garlic and scallion.

Heat the butter in a non-stick crepe pan over moderate heat.  Add 2 tablespoons batter, then swirl the pan to coat the bottom with batter.  Cook the pancake over high heat until golden brown.  Turn it over and brown the other side.  Remove from the pan and keep warm.  Repeat the process until all the batter is used.

Slice the duck breasts into medallions.  Separate the legs and thighs; arrange half a duck attractively on each plate.  Sauce the duck with the plum sauce.  Decorate each plate with a scallion-filled Chinois Pancake.  Cut each pancake in half, place a scallion on each and roll into a cone shape.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This recipe is a fantastic dish to mix with a fine wine.  It will provide you with a perfect balance.  The tartness of the sauce contrasts nicely with the richness of the duck.

For the Chinese Ducks:  Prepare the ducks.  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Mix 1/4 cup of the rice vinegar with the honey and brush the ducks all over with this mixture.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Place the ducks in a roasting pan and roast them about 30 minutes.  Remove from the oven and pour off the accumulated fat.  Give the ducks a quarter turn and return to the oven.  Repeat this process for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the ducks are dark golden brown on all sides.  Remember to pour off the rendered fat each time you turn them.  When completely cooked, transfer the ducks to another pan and let them rest so that the fat continues to drain from the insides.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, in a saucepan, reduce the plum wine with the mint sprigs and orange peel to a glaze.  Add the vinegar and reduce it by two thirds.  Add the plum puree and reduce it by half, until the flavor is quite intense.  Add the demi-glace and continue to reduce the mixture by half, or until it is thickened slightly and tastes delicious.  Over very low heat whisk in the butter, a little at a time.  Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Strain the sauce and keep it warm.

        Chinois Grilled Lamb Chops With Cilantro Mint Vinaigrette

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Lamb                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     racks lamb racks - (abt 2 lbs ea) -- trimmed, and
                        cut into individual chops
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                cup  soy sauce
  1                cup  mirin (sweet sake)
  1         tablespoon  Asian sesame oil
  2               cups  chopped scallions
  1         tablespoon  dried red chile flakes
  2                     garlic cloves - (to 3) -- finely chopped
                        === CILANTRO MINT VINAIGRETTE ===
  1                cup  peanut oil
     1/2           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  coarsely chopped mint
     1/4           cup  coarsely chopped cilantro
     1/4           cup  coarsely chopped parsley
  1         tablespoon  honey
     1/2    tablespoon  chopped ginger
  1               dash  chili oil

Prepare the marinade:  In a bowl, mix together all the marinade ingredients.  In a large shallow dish, pour marinade over the lamb chops and refrigerate, covered, for 1 hour.

While the lamb chops are marinating, prepare the vinaigrette.  To make the vinaigrette, in a blender combine all the ingredients, except the oil, and blend until smooth.  Slowly add peanut oil.  Season with salt and pepper.

Preheat grill.

Remove lamb chops from marinade and place them on a hot grill.  Grill medium-rare, about 3 minutes each side; or sautÈ them in a skillet over high heat for about 2 minutes on each side.  (Cook the chops in several batches if necessary, but don't crowd the pan.)

Make an island of sauce on each plate.  Place 3 or 4 lamb chops on center.  Decorate with cilantro or mint sprigs on top and serve with "Stir-Fried Vegetables" or "Vegetable-Fried Rice" (see recipes).

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This is one of the all-time favorites at Chinois.  The marriage of lamb with mint is a classic, but serving it with cilantro in a vinaigrette makes a really fresh and exciting dish.  Look for young Sonoma or Colorado lamb to get the kind of sweetness and tenderness that is best cooked medium-rare.

Wine Recommendation:  Lamb is always exciting for wine lovers because it invites big, strong flavors.  I like to experiment with new wines and I've discovered some wonderful Californian Zinfandels that are perfect partners for the powerful flavors in this dish.  Look for Ridge and Howell Mountain Vineyards and see if you can find one of the luscious Turley Zins.  They'll surprise you, I promise.

          Corn Chowder With Littleneck Clams And JalapeÒo Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CORN CHOWDER ===
  3               cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  dry white wine
  1                     garlic clove
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2             pounds  littleneck clams in shell - (abt 4 doz) -- scrubbed clean
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (2 oz)
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  1                     leek, white part only -- diced
  1              large  carrot -- diced
  1                     celery stalk -- diced
  8               ears  fresh sweet corn -- shucked, kernels
                        removed, reserving cobs
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Juice of 1/2 small lemon
                        === JALAPE—O CREAM ===
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- whipped
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  1                     jalapeÒo pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste

Prepare the chowder:  In a large saucepan, bring the chicken stock and white wine to a boil with the garlic and thyme.  Add the clams, bring back to a boil, cover, and steam until the clams are just opened, 3 to 4 minutes.  Strain the liquid into a bowl and discard any unopened clams.  Remove the clams from their shells and set aside.

In a 3-quart saucepan, melt the butter.  SautÈ the onion, leek, carrot, and celery over medium heat, until al dente, about 10 minutes.  Pour in the clam liquid and bring to a boil.  Add the corncobs and the corn kernels, reserving 1 cup kernels for garnish.  Simmer for 30 minutes.

Remove the cobs and strain the soup into a clean saucepan.  Transfer the strained vegetables to a blender or food processor, pour in the cream, and process until pureed, still retaining a little texture.  Stir back into the soup and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Bring the soup to a boil, add the reserved clams, and simmer for 1 minute.  Season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice.

Meanwhile, prepare the jalapeÒo cream:  In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper.

Ladle the soup into heated bowls, making sure that there are clams in each bowl.  Spoon a little of the jalapeÒo cream in the center, passing the remaining cream in a small bowl.  Garnish with the reserved 1 cup corn kernels and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This recipe demands fresh corn, preferably corn picked the same day that you make the soup.  If the corn is too old, it turns starchy and the soup will not have the same sweetness.  But if itís just a few hours old, the soup will be sweet and have a delicate flavor youíll never forget.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  soft shell crabs
  1              large  jalapeÒo pepper -- seeded, minced
                        Leaves of 4 or 5 sprigs cilantro -- chopped
                        Juice of 2 medium limes
                        === TEMPURA BATTER ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1 1/4           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper - (to 1 1/2)
     1/4           cup  cilantro leaves -- chopped fine
                        === ACCOMPANIMENT ===
                        Fried Spinach Leaves -- (see recipe)

To prepare the crab:  Remove the lungs and tail and arrange the crab on a large platter.  Sprinkle with the minced jalapeÒo and the chopped cilantro.  Pour the lime juice over and let marinate for at least 30 minutes, refrigerated.  When ready to cook, season lightly with salt.

To prepare the batter:  In a small bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder.  Whisk in the water until the batter is smooth, then add the remaining ingredients, seasoning with cayenne and salt to taste.  If made earlier in the day, set the bowl into an ice bath.

At serving time, in a deep wok, or deep-fat fryer, heat 3 inches of oil to 350 degrees.

Dip each crab into the batter and coat well.  Carefully place one or two in the hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon or flat strainer and drain on paper or clean toweling.  Keep warm while preparing the remaining crab and the spinach.

In the same oil, cook the spinach.  Drain on clean towels and season lightly with salt.

For presentation:  Arrange a few fried spinach leaves on half of each of 4 plates.  Place 1 crab on the other half and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Soft shell crabs are in season from late spring through August.  They should be alive when you buy them, and used the same day.  Shrimp can be substituted for the crab.  If using shrimp, peel, leaving the tail intact.

              Creamy Mashed Potatoes With Caramelized Onions

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 5     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  baking potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
                        Salt -- as needed
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (4 oz) -- cut small pieces,
                        at room temperature
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- brought to a boil
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-grated nutmeg -- to taste
     3/4           cup  Caramelized Onions -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley

In a saucepan, cook the potatoes in lightly salted water to cover, until tender.  Drain well.

Mash the potatoes through a food mill, or with a potato masher, into a stainless steel bowl.  Stir in the butter and warm cream and combine thoroughly.  Season to taste with salt, pepper and nutmeg.

Spoon some of the mashed potatoes onto 5 or 6 warmed plates and top with a few of the caramelized onions and chopped parsley.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings.

Comments:  If I were to choose my favorite topping for mashed potatoes it would be shaved white truffles.  But the fried onions, or if you prefer, leeks, are delicious, adding flavor and texture to the potatoes.

                           Crisp Potato Galette

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  baking potatoes -- peeled
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/2           cup  olive oil

With a sharp chef's knife, slice the potatoes thinly, then cut into julienne.  In a medium bowl, combine the potatoes, thyme, salt, and pepper.

In a non-stick 10-inch skillet, heat the oil over high heat.  Carefully spread the potatoes into the pan.  Reduce to medium heat, cook until you can see them browning around the edges and the galette pulls away from the sides of the skillet.  (If the heat is too high, the potatoes won't cook in the middle; if too low, the potatoes will stick to the pan.)

When the underside is golden brown and the potatoes hold together, it's time to flip the galette.  Using a wide spatula, turn the galette.  (If you find this difficult, slide out onto a large plate, browned-side down.  Place the skillet over the top and flip back into the skillet, browned-side up.)  Cook until golden brown on the second side.

Place the potato galette on a heated plate a little larger than the galette.  Cut into 4 or  6 wedges and serve immediately.  Placing a dollop of crËme fraiche on top of the galette and adding a thin slice of smoked salmon makes a delicious appetiser or breakfast dish.  Or you can serve a wedge with eggs, sausages, chicken, or meat.  It's a very versatile dish.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  The potato galette is served for breakfast at Postrio in San Francisco, but there's no reason why it can't be served at any meal since it goes well with many dishes -- grilled chicken, steak, even smoked salmon.

                        Duck Breast With Port Wine

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Duck                            Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  Duck Stock -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1                cup  port
  3              whole  duck breasts
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  3                     pears or peaches -- peeled, halved,
                        and seeded
  1                cup  dry white wine
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  2             slices  lemon
  1         tablespoon  green peppercorns

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Reduce the Duck Stock until only half remains.  Dissolve the cornstarch in 1/4 cup port, add it to the stock, and stir thoroughly.  Reserve.

Season duck breasts with salt and pepper, place in a roasting pan with 1/2 cup water, and bake for 30 to 35 minutes.  The meat should remain pink.  Remove from the pan and keep warm.

Discard all fat in a roasting pan and deglaze with the remaining port.  Reduce to a glaze and add to the duck stock.

While the ducks are roasting, poach the pears in a mixture of the white wine, sugar, and lemon slices until tender.  (This will take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes, depending on the ripeness of the fruit.)

Bring the sauce to a boil and add 5 to 6 tablespoons of the poaching liquid.  Continue to reduce until only 1 1/2 cups remain.  Taste and correct seasonings.

Remove the duck breast from the bone.  Peel off the skin and fat, and slice the breasts thinly lengthwise slices.

Presentation:  Arrange slices of duck and slices of pear alternately on each warm plate, nap with sauce, and sprinkle with green peppercorns.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  The natural sweetness of port and the spiciness of the green peppercorns combine to make a perfect sauce for the duck breast.

Wine Recommendation:  A Cabernet Sauvignon

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Reduce the Duck Stock until only half remains.  Dissolve the cornstarch in 1/4 cup port, add it to the stock, and stir thoroughly.  Reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Season duck breasts with salt and pepper, place in a roasting pan with 1/2 cup water, and bake for 30 to 35 minutes.  The meat should remain pink.  Remove from the pan and keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Discard all fat in a roasting pan and deglaze with the remaining port.  Reduce to a glaze and add to the duck stock.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the ducks are roasting, poach the pears in a mixture of the white wine, sugar, and lemon slices until tender.  (This will take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes, depending on the ripeness of the fruit.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring the sauce to a boil and add 5 to 6 tablespoons of the poaching liquid.  Continue to reduce until only 1 1/2 cups remain.  Taste and correct seasonings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the duck breast from the bone.  Peel off the skin and fat, and slice the breasts thinly lengthwise slices.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Presentation:  Arrange slices of duck and slices of pear alternately on each warm plate, nap with sauce, and sprinkle with green peppercorns.

            Fillet Of Beef In Puff Pastry With Sauce BÈarnaise

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     tournedos - (6 oz ea)
                        = (fillet steaks, 1 1/2" thick)
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     shallots -- minced
  1              pound  mushrooms -- finely chopped
  4        tablespoons  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             pounds  Puff Pastry -- (see recipe)
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for egg wash
  1             recipe  Sauce BÈarnaise -- (see recipe)

In a large skillet, over high heat, sautÈ tournedos in 3 tablespoons butter for 30 seconds on each side.  Set aside to cool completely.

In the same skillet, with the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, cook shallots and mushrooms until all liquid evaporates.  Add cream, salt, and pepper.  Reduce over moderate heat to a thick purÈe.  Cool.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Divide Puff Pastry into six portions.  On a lightly floured board, roll out each portion to a rectangle approximately 6 by 12 inches and 1/4-inch thick.  Place each tournedos on one side of a pastry rectangle, leaving enough room to fold over.

Top each tournedos with mushroom purÈe.  Brush edges of the pastry with egg wash and then fold it over and shape it to the contours of the meat.  Cut away excess pastry and decorate as desired.  The recipe can be prepared ahead to this point.

Glaze the tops of the pastry with egg wash.  Bake the tournedos 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.

Arrange each tournedo on a heated plate and garnish with watercress.  Nap the Sauce  BÈarnaise around the tournedo.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  A classic, elegant entrÈe for a formal dinner party, this is a variation on Beef Wellington.  There's something very adventurous about giving each guest their own package which remains a mystery until they open it right on their plate.  Because most of the preparation can be done early in the day, you will be able to spend more time with your guests and less in the kitchen.

Wine Recommendation:  A Gevrey-Chambertin, Chambolle-Musigny, or Vosne Romanee all offer the great depth and flavor of Burgundy, essential qualities to partner a classic dish like this beef.  If you would like a less expensive wine, then a Californian Pinot Noir, like Chalone or Etude would be a good choice.

                           Fried Spinach Leaves

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
     1/2         pound  baby spinach leaves -- leaves only

In a wok or a deep, heavy saucepan, heat about 3 inches of peanut oil to 375 degrees.  Clean the spinach leaves well, trim and dry thoroughly.  Fry until crisp and translucent, about 2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on clean toweling.  Season with salt to taste and serve immediately.

Comments:  This is an old Chinese traditional dish which captures the delicate taste of baby spinach perfectly.  It can be used as a garnish or accompaniment to many different dishes.  The procedure is the same for small or large quantities.  However, if cooking a large amount of spinach, fry in batches and keep warm in a low temperature oven.  Deep fried herbs also make a great garnish.  Basil, Sage and Italian Flat Leaf Parsley are especially good.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2         pounds  baking potatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into same size chunks
                        Salt -- as needed
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces,
                        at room temperature
     1/2           cup  heavy cream -- brought to a boil
     1/2           cup  raw garlic -- chopped
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        Freshly-grated nutmeg -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

In a saucepan, cook the potatoes and raw garlic in lightly salted water to cover, until tender.  Drain well.

Mash the potatoes through a food mill, or with a potato masher, into a stainless steel bowl.

In a small saucepan, heat butter and cream until butter has melted.  Add salt, pepper and nutmeg.

Spoon mashed potatoes into warmed serving bowl and sprinkle with chopped parsley.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings.

Comments:  If you love fluffy mashed potatoes and you love garlic then you'll love this dish.  The difference between this recipe and common or garden garlic mashed potatoes lies in the roasted garlic.  It makes a world of difference to the final flavor, adding sweetness and depth that you can't get from fresh garlic.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  fresh goat cheese
     1/2         bunch  thyme leaves
  1              bunch  chives
     1/2         bunch  chervil or Italian parsley
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2              whole  chicken breasts -- boned
                        = (use free range chickens if possible)
                        === FOR VINAIGRETTE ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 oz)
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  12            ounces  fresh chanterelles
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             medium  Maui onion
  1              bunch  fresh chervil or Italian parsley
     1/2         bunch  thyme leaves
     1/2         bunch  fresh basil
     1/3           cup  walnut oil
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Crumble the goat cheese into a mixing bowl.  Chop the fresh herbs, add to the cheese and season with pepper to taste.  Place the cheese mixture under the skin of the chicken breasts.  Pat gently to distribute it evenly.

Place the chicken in a roasting pan and roast for 15 to 20 minutes, or until just barely done.  Keep warm.  While the chicken is roasting, prepare the vinaigrette.

To prepare vinaigrette:  Heat a large skillet over high heat and add the butter and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  Add the chanterelles and saute them until al dente.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Turn into a large bowl to cool.

Cut the onion into 1/4-inch cubes.  Add to the mushrooms.  Chop the chervils, thyme and basil into 1/4-inch pieces and add to the mushrooms.

Toss the mushroom mixture with the remaining olive oil, the walnut oil and the rice wine vinegar.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Presentation:  Make a pool of vinaigrette in the center of each of 4 dinner plates.  Halve the chicken breasts and put a half over each serving of vinaigrette.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

                           Greek Salad Dressing

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh dill leaves
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley leaves
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh thyme leaves
  1                cup  plain yogurt
  2        tablespoons  minced garlic
     1/4           cup  Dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  red wine vinegar
     1/3           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1 1/2           cups  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Sugar -- to taste

In a medium bowl, whisk together the dill, parsley, thyme, yogurt, garlic, mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.  Slowly whisk in the oil, and when emulsified, season with sugar to taste.  Refrigerate in a covered container.  When ready to use, whisk again.

This recipe yields about 2 1/2 cups.

Comments:  This is the dressing for my "Greek Shrimp Salad" (see recipe).  But don't restrict it to just one dish.  It's a wonderful herb-flavored dressing that also makes a great marinade.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SHRIMP DRESSING ===
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  cucumber -- peeled, seeded,
                        and finely diced
  1         tablespoon  minced red onion
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1              pinch  Cayenne pepper
                        Kosher Salt -- to taste

     1/2           cup  cored red bell peppers in 1" cubes
     1/2           cup  cored yellow bell peppers in 1" cubes
     1/2           cup  Caramelized Onions -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  Kalamata olives -- pitted
  1              small  cucumber -- peeled, seeded,
                        quartered, cut into 1/2" slices
  1                cup  yellow pear and sweet cherry tomatoes -- cut in halves
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated parmesan cheese
  1                cup  crumbled feta cheese
  1                cup  Greek Salad Dressing -- (see recipe)
                        Kosher Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

                        cut in half horizontally, and blanched
     1/4           cup  toasted pine nuts -- see * Note
  1             Sprigs  fresh dill

* Note:  To toast pine nuts, place the nuts in a small skillet in a  single layer.  Over low heat, toast until lightly golden, stirring often to prevent burning.  This takes 3 or 4 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.

Make the Shrimp Dressing:  In a medium bowl, whisk together the first six ingredients until well blended.  Season with cayenne, salt, and pepper to taste.  Refrigerate in a covered container.  When ready to use, whisk again.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the romaine, baby lettuces, bell peppers, onions, olives cucumbers, tomatoes, cheeses, and Greek Salad Dressing.  Toss until blended.  Season with salt and pepper.  Divide and mound on 4 chilled salad plates.

In a medium bowl, toss together the shrimp and Shrimp Dressing.  Arrange 8 shrimp halves over and around salad mound.  Top with pine nuts and garnish with dill sprigs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  With the addition of shrimp this salad goes from the ordinary Greek salad to the extraordinary Greek salad.  Now it has all the elements of the Mediterranean from both sea and land.  Add some love and it's even better!

                         Grilled Italian Chicken

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  boneless skinless chicken breasts
  2             medium  zucchini -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/4" slices
  2             medium  yellow squash -- cut lengthwise
                        into 1/4" slices
  1                cup  Basil-Garlic Vinaigrette -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place chicken breasts in a re-sealable plastic food storage bag.  Pour 1/2 cup of Basil-Garlic Vinaigrette over top.  In separate bag place zucchini and yellow squash slices.  Pour remaining 1/2 cup of the basil-garlic vinaigrette over the vegetables.  Refrigerate chicken and vegetables until ready to cook.

To cook:  Season chicken breast and vegetables with salt and pepper.  Place chicken and vegetables on grill and cook until chicken is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes per side, or place meat and vegetables on broiler pan and broil in oven.

Fan grilled vegetable slices around chicken.  Garnish with fresh herbs.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is probably the simplest recipe I know for making grilled chicken.  Sometimes I think it just looks too easy to make such a delicious dish.  If you haven't much time, make the vinaigrette beforehand and keep it in the refrigerator.

Wine Recommendation:  I have always liked the marriage of chicken and Chardonnay.  Nowadays there are so many great Chardonnays, from California, from Australia, from New Zealand and Chile and, of course, from France.  The wines from Pays d'Oc in the South West of France offer some remarkable bargains.  Just look for the varietal on the label.  Or come home to California.  One of my favorites has always been Robert Mondavi and his wonderful Chardonnays.  They're easy to find and, given the price of good White Burgundies, are relatively inexpensive.

Place chicken breasts in a re-sealable plastic food storage bag.  Pour 1/2 cup of Basil-Garlic Vinaigrette over top.  In separate bag place zucchini and yellow squash slices.  Pour remaining 1/2 cup of the basil-garlic vinaigrette over the vegetables.  Refrigerate chicken and vegetables until ready to cook.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To cook:  Season chicken breast and vegetables with salt and pepper.  Place chicken and vegetables on grill and cook until chicken is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes per side, or place meat and vegetables on broiler pan and broil in oven.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fan grilled vegetable slices around chicken.  Garnish with fresh herbs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This is probably the simplest recipe I know for making grilled chicken.  Sometimes I think it just looks too easy to make such a delicious dish.  If you haven&apos;t much time, make the vinaigrette beforehand and keep it in the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  I have always liked the marriage of chicken and Chardonnay.  Nowadays there are so many great Chardonnays, from California, from Australia, from New Zealand and Chile and, of course, from France.  The wines from Pays d&apos;Oc in the South West of France offer some remarkable bargains.  Just look for the varietal on the label.  Or come home to California.  One of my favorites has always been Robert Mondavi and his wonderful Chardonnays.  They&apos;re easy to find and, given the price of good White Burgundies, are relatively inexpensive.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     leeks -- trimmed, chopped
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2                     celery stalks -- diced
  1                     large clove garlic -- minced
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  8               cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe),
                        divided
  2             medium  carrots -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
  1              pound  small white button mushrooms -- quartered
  1                     bag frozen pearl onions - (10 oz)
  2              large  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut thin strips
  1           teaspoon  salt - (to 2)
     1/2      teaspoon  dried tarragon
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1                cup  heavy cream
                        === DUMPLINGS ===
     3/4           cup  flour
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  butter -- chilled
  1              large  egg
  3        tablespoons  milk
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley

In large stockpot, heat oil over medium heat.  Add leeks, onion, celery and garlic.  Cook for about 7 minutes or until just soft.  Stir in flour; cook for about 2 minutes stirring constantly taking care not to brown the flour.

Remove from heat and gradually stir in 6 cups chicken broth.  Add carrots, mushrooms, pearl onions, chicken, salt, tarragon and white pepper.  Return stockpot to medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer for about 30 minutes or until vegetables and chicken are tender.

Meanwhile, in separate shallow saucepan, over medium-high heat, bring remaining 2 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water to a boil.

To make dumplings:  In a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder, salt and pepper.  With a pastry blender or fork cut butter into flour until it resembles coarse meal.  In small bowl whisk together egg, milk and parsley; stir into flour mixture until a dough forms.

Using a greased teaspoon gently place rounded teaspoons of dough into simmering broth.  Cook for about 7 minutes or until well-risen and cooked through.  Reserve in a small amount of broth until ready to serve.

Stir heavy cream into chicken soup mixture and adjust thickness of soup by adding remaining cooking liquid from dumplings.  Adjust seasonings if necessary.  Add cooked dumplings to soup and over medium heat return to almost boiling.  Serve immediately.

Carefully ladle into warmed soup bowls and arrange dumplings on top.  Sprinkle generously with freshly chopped parsley.

This recipe yields about 12 cups.

Comments:  This is a creamy, chunky soup with the traditional flavorings of classic chicken pot pie, topped with light-as-air dumplings.  Be warned.  This is a hearty soup that makes a satisfying main meal.

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Pancakes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PANCAKE BATTER ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  3                     eggs -- separated
  1 1/2           cups  buttermilk
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3 oz) -- melted
  5        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  diced onions
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  white pepper
                        === TOPPINGS ===
  1                cup  sour cream -- more or less
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh dill
  4             ounces  smoked salmon, whitefish, or
                        sturgeon in paper-thin slices - (to 5)
                        Fresh lemon juice
  8                     dill sprigs - (to 10) -- for garnish
                        Caviar -- for garnish

To prepare the pancake batter:  In a small bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder.  Reserve.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, buttermilk, and 3 tablespoons melted butter.  Reserve.

In a medium skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Over medium-high heat, saute the onions until golden, 6 to 8 minutes.  Transfer to a large bowl, cool slightly, and stir in the dill.  Stir in the flour mixture, salt, white pepper and then the egg yolk mixture.

Using a wire whisk or an electric mixer, whisk the egg whites until shiny and firm but not dry.  Stir a little into the batter, then fold in the remaining whites.

To cook the pancakes:  In a small bowl, combine the remaining 3 tablespoons melted butter with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil.  Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet or griddle and brush with the some of the butter mixture.  For each pancake, pour 1/2 cup of the batter onto the griddle and, over a medium flame, cook until brown on one side.

Turn and brown the other side, brushing the skillet or griddle with the butter mixture as necessary.  (This makes a pancake approximately 6 inches in diameter.)  As the pancakes are cooked, transfer to a tray lined with a clean towel and keep warm in a low oven while preparing the remaining pancakes.

For toppings:  In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and dill.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Refrigerate sour cream mixture and remaining toppings until needed.

For presentation:  Place one pancake on each of 8 or 10 heated plates Spread some of the sour cream mixture over the pancake and arrange a slice of smoked fish on the cream.  Squeeze a little lemon juice over the fish and garnish with a sprig of dill and caviar.  Serve immediately.

Note:  You can also make smaller pancakes, using 2 tablespoons of batter, making 2 1/2-inch pancakes.  You can cut the smoked fish into smaller pieces or chop and stir into the cream as above.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

                        Lobster With Sweet Ginger

Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (abt 1")
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     3/4           cup  plum wine
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1                     lobster - (2 lbs) -- split lengthwise
  2         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  4                     scallions -- cut 3/8" slices
  1           teaspoon  curry powder - (to 2)
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/2      teaspoon  chili flakes
     1/2           cup  Fish Stock -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  cream
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Fried Baby Spinach Leaves -- (see recipe)

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

Peel the ginger, reserving the peels, and cut into fine julienne strips.  Cut the peels into coarse strips and set aside.

In a small saucepan, cook the ginger and garlic with a 1/2 cup of the plum wine and the rice vinegar until 1 tablespoon of liquid remains.  Remove from the heat and set aside.

Place a heavy heatproof 12-inch skillet over high heat until it is very hot.  Add the oil almost to the smoking point.  Carefully add the lobster halves, meat-side down.  Cook for 3 minutes.  Turn the lobster over and add 1 tablespoon of butter.  Continue to sautÈ the lobster shells until they are red and the butter is a nutty red.

Transfer the lobsters to the oven for about 10 minutes, or until the lobster is just cooked.  Remove from the oven, remove the lobster from the skillet and keep warm.

Add the scallions, ginger peels and curry powder to the skillet.  Saute the mixture lightly for 15 seconds, then whisk in the remaining plum wine, white wine, Fish Stock, chili flakes and the vinegar.  Reduce the liquid to about a 1/2 cup.  Add the cream and reduce by half, then whisk in the 1 tablespoon of butter.  Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Crack the lobster claws with the back of a large chefs knive.

Arrange the lobster half on a warm oval platter, meat-side up.  Strain the sauce over the lobster, and then sprinkle the sweet ginger on top.  Garnish with Fried Baby Spinach Leaves.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  This dish will dazzle your guests and make you look like a superstar in the kitchen.  The flavors are strong and complex.  When you present the lobster you can either place it on individual plates or on a large platter for family style?  It's the type of dish that you reserve for a really important night.

                      Marinated And Glazed Swordfish

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  swordfish, abt 1" thick - (6 oz ea)
                        Extra-virgin olive oil -- for brushing the
                        fish and grill
                        Freshly-ground black pepper
                        === MARINADE ===
  2        tablespoons  orange or mandarin marmalade
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh ginger
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic - (1 clove)
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil or hazelnut oil

Brush the swordfish with a little extra virgin olive oil and grind a little pepper over the slices.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

Prepare the marinade:  Combine all of the marinade ingredients, except the oil, in a non-reactive saucepan.  Bring to a boil and reduce to 1/2 cup.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  Whisk in the oil.  Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.

Before you are ready to cook the fish, heat a grill, then brush it with extra virgin olive oil to prevent the fish from sticking.

Note:  Make sure to get the charcoal very hot and let it get coated with grey ash before grilling the fish.  If you are using a gas or electric grill get it very hot, too, then turn the heat down to medium to cook the fish.

Warm the marinade slightly.

Brush the swordfish with a little of the marinade, then grill about 4 minutes on each side, until it feels springy to the touch.

Place the swordfish on warm plates and serve with a nice assortment of mixed greens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Swordfish, when cut into thick steaks, is a hearty dish and a great alternative to steak.  Here, we combine the sweetness of orange marmalade and orange juice with freshly ground black pepper and fresh ginger to make an unusual and delicious dish.

Wine Recommendation:  Swordfish needs a big wine with lots of character to match its flavor.  The citrus notes you find in New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs make it the perfect partner.  Look for Cloudy Bay, Mortons Estate and Babich.

Wine Recommendation:  Swordfish needs a big wine with lots of character to match its flavor.  The citrus notes you find in New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs make it the perfect partner.  Look for Cloudy Bay, Mortons Estate and Babich.

                              Mushroom Soup

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm white mushrooms -- cleaned
                        Juice from 1 medium lemon
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2         tablespoon  minced shallots
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2                bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1 1/2           cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  minced parsley

Sprinkle the mushrooms with lemon juice.  In a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, coarsely chop the mushrooms.

Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat, and lightly sautÈ the shallots.  Add the mushrooms, thyme, and bay leaf and sautÈ for 10 minutes, or until the liquid disappears.

Add cream and stock and bring to a boil.  Quickly reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.

In a small bowl, combine cornstarch with 1 tablespoon cold water and add to the soup.  Continue to simmer 5 minutes longer, stirring constantly.

Correct seasoning to taste.  Serve in warm bowls.  Sprinkle with minced parsley.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  As with so many of my recipes, this soup must not be overcooked.  You will be delighted at how simple it is to prepare and with the intensity of the mushroom flavor it releases.

Wine Recommendation:  I love dry sherry with mushroom soup, just a small measure of one of Emilio Lustauís dry Olorosoís or Dry Sack, lightly chilled.

           New York Steak With Madagascar Pepper And Port Wine

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  peppercorn mix
                        = (black, green, and pink)
  6                     entrecÙtes - (8 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  mild flavored oil, such as
                        almond or safflower
  1                cup  port or dry sherry
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  beef stock or broth
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
     1/4           cup  mixed peppercorns -- soaked overnight in
                        Port wine -- for garnish

Using a rolling pin, crush 1/4 cup peppercorn mix between a folded napkin.

Remove excess fat from the entrecÙtes.  Season with salt and crushed peppercorns.

Heat a large heavy skillet.  Pour in oil and, over high heat, cook the entrecÙtes, about 4 minutes each side for medium-rare.

Pour out fat from pan, deglaze with port, and reduce.  Add cream and beef stock and continue to reduce until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.

Whisk in butter, one small piece at a time.  Season to taste with salt.

Place one entrecÙte on each warmed serving plate.  Ladle sauce over steaks and divide soaked peppercorns equally over each portion.  I serve it with "SautÈed Baby Vegetables" (see recipe).

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Wine Recommendation:  A big, bold red wine such as a Beaune from Burgundy or one of the great RhÙnes from either Hermitage or Chateauneuf du Pape makes a great partner for these steaks.  Look for shippers like Louis Latour for Burgundy, Jaboulet or Chapoutier for the RhÙne.  Of course, any good Californian red also teams well with steak, so bring out the best from your cellar.

             New York Steak With Mushrooms And Grilled Onions

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    scallions or new onions
  4                     New York Strip steaks - (8 to 10 oz ea) -- cut 1" thick
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (2 oz)
  1              pound  fresh shiitake or oyster mushrooms -- sliced 1/4" thick
     1/3           cup  Cognac or brandy
  2               cups  beef stock -- reduced to 1 cup
  1            package  enoki mushrooms -- stemmed
                        = (available at many supermarkets)

Heat a grill.  When hot, grill the onions for about 2 minutes on each side, or until they are tender but crunchy.  If you don't have a grill, blanch the onions in boiling salted water.  Drain and keep warm.

Season the steaks on both sides with salt and pepper.  Reserve.

In a heavy skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of butter until bubbling slightly.  Cook the shiitakes over high heat until they begin to brown slightly.  Season lightly with salt and pepper.  Remove from the pan and keep warm.

Carefully pour the Cognac or brandy into the hot skillet and ignite.  Let the flame die out naturally.  Reduce the Cognac to 2 tablespoons, scraping any loose bits that cling to the bottom of the pan.  Stir in the reduced beef stock.  Reduce the sauce until slightly thickened, but still very light.  Return the mushrooms and their juice to the sauce and reduce more if necessary.  Correct the seasonings.

Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, a little at a time.  Stir in the enoki mushrooms.  Set the sauce aside and keep warm.

Grill the steaks on the preheated grill for 3 minutes on each side, or sautÈ them in a very hot skillet with a little oil for 3 minutes on each side, or until the meat is medium-rare.  Remove from the heat.

If necessary, reheat the sauce very gently.

Divide the scallions or new onions equally among 4 warm dinner plates.  Spoon the mushroom sauce over the onions.  Place a steak in the middle of each plate.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe calls for scallions or new onions.  New onions are similar to scallions or green onions, but slightly larger and the bulb end is rounder.  If you can find new onions (try your local farmer's market) you'll appreciate the more assertive flavor and your guests will wonder how you managed to create such a distinctive taste.

Wine Recommendation:  I love all the great Cabernet Sauvignons of the Napa Valley with steak.  Especially the wines of Heitz Cellars, Grgich Hills, Silver Oak and Caymus.  If you can find a Robert Mondavi Reserve at your wine shop you'll discover one of my favorites and the perfect partner for this dish.

Deglaze the pan with port.  Add the stock, salt, pepper, and bouquet garni and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes.

Dry the slices of French bread in a warm oven.  Place 1 slice in each of 6 oven-proof bowls.  Pour the soup over the bread.  Top each bowl with 1 slice of bread and sprinkle with 1/3 cup of cheese.  Brown under the broiler.

Serve immediately with French bread.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Did you know that Les Halles in Paris was as famous for its onion soup as it was for the huge food market?  Carrying fresh produce is hard work and obviously required hearty replenishment!  Here is the perfect example of how the simplest ingredients can be used to create a very special soup.  The addition of port turns hearty fare into a chef's delight.

Wine Recommendation:  Soup and wine?  Why not?  Do what the French do and choose a simple red, a vin du table like a Cote du Rhone or one of the many new varietals from the Pay díOc.  They seldom cost more than $15 and provide a note of authenticity with this classic soup.

                           Oven-Dried Tomatoes

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            medium  Roma tomatoes (abt 2 lbs)
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus additional
                        as needed
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme leaves
  6                     garlic cloves -- crushed
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.

In pot of boiling water, blanch tomatoes.  Drain and refresh in ice water.  Drain, peel,  core, cut into quarters and remove seeds.

Line a baking tray with parchment paper and arrange the tomato quarters on the tray, cut-side down.  Drizzle with 1/4 cup of olive oil.  Sprinkle with thyme and garlic.  In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper and sugar and sprinkle evenly over the tomatoes.

Bake until tomatoes begin to shrivel, about 1 hour.  When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, transfer to a container.  Pour remaining 1/2 cup of olive oil over and cover the container.  Refrigerate and use as needed.

This recipe yields 1 1/4 cups.

Comments:  Unlike sun-dried tomatoes, these have a much sweeter and natural tomato flavor.  Use them with pasta, fish, meats or poultry.  For the best and tastiest results these should be prepared when tomatoes are in their prime.  The recipe can be doubled or tripled if you desire.  The tomatoes will keep 2 to 3 days, refrigerated, in a covered container.

Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  dry cannellini beans -- soaked overnight
     1/2           cup  pancetta -- cut large chunks
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  carrots -- cut 1/4" dice
  2                     celery stalks -- cut 1/4" dice
  1              large  red onion -- cut 1/4" dice
     1/4           cup  chopped garlic
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2            bunches  spinach -- washed, and
                        stems removed
  2               cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === CHERRY TOMATO VINAIGRETTE ===
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1               pint  ripe cherry tomatoes -- quartered
     1/4           cup  sun-dried tomatoes -- chopped
  6              large  basil leaves -- cut chiffonade
                        === SEA BASS ===
  6                     sea bass fillets - (8 oz ea) -- scaled, and
                        skin left on
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Finely-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === ESCAROLE ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              heads  escarole -- outer leaves
                        trimmed, each head cut 6 wedges

Prepare the white bean ragout:  Discard the soaking water from the cannellini beans.

In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the pancetta.  Add the drained cannellini beans and 5 cups of water.  Bring to a boil and then simmer for about 45 minutes.  Strain the beans reserving cooking liquid; discard the pancetta.  Set aside.

In a large saucepan, over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil.  SautÈ the carrots, celery, red onion and garlic about 8 minutes or until onion is transparent.

In a small bowl, blend the tomato paste with 1/2 cup of cold water.  Add to the sautÈed vegetables along with the reserved cannellini beans, bean cooking liquid and Chicken Stock.  Season with salt and black pepper.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, for about 20 minutes or until beans are tender and mixture has reduced by about one fourth.  Stir in spinach and cook for about 3 minutes more or until spinach is wilted.

Prepare the cherry tomato vinaigrette:  In a large bowl whisk together the extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, salt and black pepper.  Stir in the cherry tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes and basil chiffonade.  Set aside until ready to assemble dish.

Prepare the sea bass:  Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees.  Brush the sea bass fillets with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and score a cross on the skin side of the fish with a sharp knife to help keep it from curling.  Season with salt and white pepper.

In a large, heavy skillet, over high heat, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and sautÈ sea bass, skin-side down for 2 minutes.  Transfer to a large, shallow baking dish and bake for about 5 to 6 minutes or until fish flakes when tested with a fork.  To ensure a crispy skin, do not turn the fish.

Prepare the escarole:  In a clean, large skillet over medium heat, heat olive oil.  SautÈ the escarole for about 5 minutes or until wilted.

Lay out 6 large, heated soup plates and ladle white bean ragout into each plate.  Lay two wedges of escarole cross-wise on top of beans.  With a metal spatula, carefully place one fillet of sea bass, skin-side up on top of the escarole in each plate.  Spoon tomato vinaigrette across each fish fillet.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  If you want to spend an afternoon preparing a dish that will impress just about anyone, then this is a good place to start.  Make sure you get the freshest sea bass, and handle it with great care.  The recipe might seem complicated at first, but the procedures are actually very simple and you'll find yourself enjoying making such a delicious and exciting dish.

Wine Recommendation:  You've made a wonderful dish with the sea bass.  Now you need a wonderful wine.  If you're feeling adventurous try a Viognier, like the Andrew Murray from Santa Barbara County, Pride Mountain -- if you can find it, or Callera's amazing Viognier, with this dish.  You'll be amazed how much fruit and depth can exist in such a secret grape.  Or if you'd like something more familiar grab a Kistler or Robert Mondavi Chardonnay or one of the big, oaky Chardonnays from Australia like Rosemount, Petaluma or Lindemans.

                               Pear Souffle

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     pears -- peeled, cored,
                        and quartered
  1                     vanilla bean
     1/2           cup  fructose -- or less
                        = (adjust according to ripeness of pears)
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  pear liqueur
  2                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  7                     egg whites

In a heavy saucepan, place the pears, vanilla bean, and half the fructose.  Add the water and cook the pears almost to a puree, adding more water if necessary to keep the mixture from burning.

Remove the vanilla bean and drain off any excess liquid.  Transfer the pears to a food processor and process until smooth.  Transfer the puree to a bowl and stir in the pear liqueur and additional fructose, if necessary.  Add the egg yolks and combine well.  Set aside and reserve.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Butter individual souffle dishes lightly and set aside.

Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Add 1 tablespoon fructose and continue to beat until stiff but not dry.

Gently stir one fourth of the beaten egg whites into the pear puree, and fold in the remaining egg whites.

Fill the souffle dishes and smooth the tops with a spatula.  Run your thumb around the inside edge of each dish.  This will form the "hat" on the souffle, and it will also eliminate the need for a collar.

Bake 7 to 8 minutes and serve immediately.

Presentation:  Serve one souffle per person.  If calories are not a consideration, the souffle is delicious served with creme anglaise.

In a heavy saucepan, place the pears, vanilla bean, and half the fructose.  Add the water and cook the pears almost to a puree, adding more water if necessary to keep the mixture from burning.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the vanilla bean and drain off any excess liquid.  Transfer the pears to a food processor and process until smooth.  Transfer the puree to a bowl and stir in the pear liqueur and additional fructose, if necessary.  Add the egg yolks and combine well.  Set aside and reserve.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Butter individual souffle dishes lightly and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Add 1 tablespoon fructose and continue to beat until stiff but not dry.

Gently stir one fourth of the beaten egg whites into the pear puree, and fold in the remaining egg whites.

Fill the souffle dishes and smooth the tops with a spatula.  Run your thumb around the inside edge of each dish.  This will form the &quot;hat&quot; on the souffle, and it will also eliminate the need for a collar.

                                  Pesto

Categories    : Accompaniment                   Condiments
                Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            medium  fresh basil leaves -- washed, dried,
                        and coarsely chopped
  3             medium  garlic cloves -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  pine nuts -- lightly toasted
  1              pinch  salt
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

In a mortar and pestle, pound the basil, garlic, nuts, and salt until thoroughly mashed.

Pesto can also be made in a blender.  Blend the garlic, nuts, and basil leaves, then slowly add the oil.  Blend on low to a smooth paste.  Season with the kosher salt.

This recipe yields about 1/4 cup.

Comments:  This recipe can be doubled very easily.  At Spago we use a sweet olive oil, not too sharp and overwhelming, from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.  This can be brushed over pizzas and fish, and it turns a simple pasta into something special.  In Italy, pesto is generally made with mortar and pestle, which probably accounts for the name, but it can also be done in a blender, so you will find both methods here.

                               Pizza Dough

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1            package  active dry or fresh yeast
  1           teaspoon  honey
  1                cup  warm water -- (105 to 115 degrees)
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  Chili and Garlic Oil -- (see recipe),
                        = (or use extra-virgin olive oil) -- plus more for
                        brushing
                        Topping of your choice

In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4 cup of the warm water.

In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt.  Add the oil, your mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes.  (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor.  Dissolve the yeast as above.  Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade.  Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball.)

Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 mintes longer.  The dough should be smooth and firm.  Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes.  (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled.)

Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each.  Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball.  Repeat 4 or 5 times.  Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute.  Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes.  At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days.

Pace a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees.

To prepare each pizza, dip the ball of dough into flour, shake off the excess flour, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface, and start to stretch the dough.  Press down on the center, spreading the dough into an 8-inch circle, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle.  If you find this difficult to do, use a small rolling pin to roll out the dough.  Lightly brush the inner circle of the dough with oil and arrange the topping of your choice over the inner circle.

Using a lightly floured baker's peel or a rimless flat baking tray, slide the pizza onto the baking stone and bake until the pizza crust is nicely browned, 10 to 12 minutes.  Remember that the oven is very hot and be careful as you place the pizza into and out of the oven.  Transfer the pizza to a firm surface and cut into slices with a pizza cutter or very sharp knife.  Serve immediately.

To Prepare Ahead:  Through step 4.  When ready to serve, remove the balls of dough from the refrigerator and let them rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes, then continue with the recipe.  Through step 7, bake 5 or 6 minutes, until the cheese melts and the pizza dough is lightly golden brown.  (At this point, the pizza can be cooled, wrapped well, and frozen for up to 1 month.)  When needed, remove from the freezer, unwrap, and bake in a preheated oven until the crust has browned and the topping is heated through.

This recipe yields four 8-inch pizzas (about 24 ounces of dough).  Serving size = 1/2 pizza

Nutrition per 1/2 pizza serving without toppings:  Calories 191;  Fat 2g;  Carbohydrates 37g;  Cholesterol 0mg;  Sodium 295mg;  Protein 5g;  Fiber 1g;  Calories from Fat 9%; Calories from Carbs 77%.

Comments:  You can make four pizzas, as described here, or you can divide the dough in half and make two large 12-inch pizzas.  The baking time will be the same.

Chopped fresh basil, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, or a sprinkling of crushed red pepper flakes can be added to the dough with the flour if desired, for additional flavor.  Be creative with your pizzas!  For the best results, see "Pizza Tips".

                 Pork Chop With Caramelized Maple Onions

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  pork rack with 4 bones attached
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2              large  yellow onions -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  fresh ginger -- finely chopped
     1/2         stick  cinnamon
  1                     star anise
     1/4           cup  maple syrup
  2               cups  apple cider

Season both sides of rack with salt and pepper 20 minutes before cooking.

In a large heavy skillet over high heat, heat olive oil.  Sear pork rack on all sides until browned.  Set aside.

In same skillet melt butter over medium heat, add sliced onions, ginger, cinnamon and star anise.  Cook slowly for about 10 minutes until onions are golden brown.

Add maple syrup, and cook for 2 minutes until onions are caramelized.

Deglaze with cider, adjust salt and pepper and cook for about 5 minutes, until liquid is reduced by half.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Transfer pork to shallow roasting pan, completely cover with onion mixture and place in oven.  Cook for 20 minutes per pound or until internal temp is 160 degrees.  After 20 minutes, add remaining onion mixture on top of pork rack.  When cooked, remove from oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.

These chops are delicious served with "Celery Root PurÈe" (see recipe).  Place three heaped tablespoons of the celery root onto the center of each plate.  Slice the pork chops and lay one on top of the purÈe.  Arrange "SautÈed Baby Vegetables" (see recipe) around the edge of the plate to complete the presentation.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The humble pork chop rises to great heights in this recipe created by one of my favorite young chefs from Spago, Karl Matz.  The maple syrup gives the onion compote a wonderful flavor which infuses the pork chops as they cook.

Wine Recommendation:  A white burgundy like Puligny Montrachet has the fruit and depth to complement this dish.  Or you might consider a good Californian Chardonnay from Kistler or Patz & Hall.  Both these winemakers craft full wines with lots of fruit and body.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  baking potatoes
     1/4           cup  clarified butter
  2             ounces  shredded mozzarella cheese
  2             ounces  fresh goat cheese

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Place the potatoes in a double layer in a medium bowl, pour the clarified butter over, and toss to coat the slices.

Season lightly with salt.  Arrange half the potatoes, flower fashion, in a 9-inch ovenproof skillet.  Cook over medium heat until the ends begin to brown and the potatoes stick together.  (This will keep the cheese from running through.)  Sprinkle with the cheese and cover with remaining potatoes, arranged the same way as the bottom layer.  Set in the oven for 10 minutes, carefully flip the potatoes with a wide spatula, and brown on a medium-high flame.  Return to the oven for 5 minutes longer.

Cut into 4 quarters and keep warm.  Place each of the quarters along side of the tenderloin and garnish with mixed greens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is a perfect accompaniment dish for the "Roasted Beef Tenderloin With Roasted Tomato Salsa" (see recipe).  You're combining potatoes and cheese that goes great with the spiciness of the dish.  It's easy to make and allows you to have a complete meal by matching your meat with potatoes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY BASE ===
  1 3/4            cup  pastry flour
  1 3/4            cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/3           cups  chilled unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  1                cup  ice water - (to 1 1/4)
                        === BUTTER BLOCK ===
  14            ounces  unsalted butter - (3 1/2 sticks) -- chilled
                        = (it helps to keep the butter in sticks
                        for making the block)

To make the pastry base:  In a food processor fitted with steel blade, combine pastry flour, all-purpose flour and salt.  Add butter pieces and with a few on/off turns process until mixture resembles coarse meal.

With machine running, pour just enough iced water through the feed tube to make a stiff but pliable dough.  (This amount of water can vary quite a lot, so start out with 1 cup and add up to the extra 1/4 cup.)  Turn dough out on to a very lightly floured board.  Shape into a flattened ball and wrap tightly in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate overnight.

Prepare the butter block:  Arrange the sticks of butter into as much of a square as possible.  Wrap in a clean cotton kitchen towel or napkin to absorb excess moisture.  With a heavy rolling pin, pound the butter to form a 6-inch square about 1-inch thick.  Even out the sides as necessary with the rolling pin.  Refrigerate overnight.

Remove the pastry base and the butter block from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before using.  Both should be at the same temperature and consistency before rolling.

Lightly flour the pastry board and rolling pin.  Roll out the pastry base to an 18-inch square.  Remove the butter from the towel and set in the middle of the pastry base.  Fold 2 opposite sides over to meet in the center of the butter.  If the overlapping ends are too thick, level them off by lightly moving the rolling pin over the ends.  Even the 2 remaining opposite ends and fold to meet in the center, stretching as necessary until the seams come together.

Roll out the pastry to a rectangle about 18- by 12-inches.  Starting with the 12-inch side, fold the dough into thirds.  Turn the dough so that the seam is on your right and again roll out to the same size rectangle, sprinkling the pastry board and dough very lightly with flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking.  Using a large dry pastry brush, brush away excess flour before and after folding.  Using the rolling pin, even out the pastry as it is being rolled.  Press two indentations in the dough with your knuckles, to remind you of the number of turns you have made and wrap dough securely in plastic wrap.  (You have just completed two turns.)  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

Remove the pastry from the refrigerator and let soften slightly before rolling.  With the seam on your right, again complete two turns.  Press four indentations in the dough.  Re-wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  Again, let the dough soften slightly and roll one more time to complete five turns.  At this point the pastry can be cut, wrapped and frozen for future use.  When cutting, cut the dough lengthways.  When ready to use the pastry, remove from the freezer and refrigerate overnight.  Use as needed.

This recipe yields approximately 2 1/2 pounds.

Comments:  This is an extremely versatile pastry.  I recommend preparing a large amount at one time and cutting it into desired quantities and shapes for freezing.  (It freezes very successfully.  Remove it from the freezer and place in the refrigerator the day before you plan to use it.)  Cut into squares, called feuilletÈes, it can also be used to make many different desserts -- with various fruits, ice cream and sweet sauces.

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (4 oz)
  1              pound  fresh pumpkin -- peeled, and
                        cut in 1" cubes
  2               cups  heavy cream
     1/2                bay leaf
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh sage -- plus
  6              small  sage leaves -- for garnish
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme leaves
  2                     eggs -- beaten
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
     1/2        recipe  Spinach Pasta Dough or
                        Regular Pasta Dough -- (see recipes)
  1                     egg -- beaten lightly,
                        for egg wash
                        Semolina -- as needed
  2               cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
                        = (or light duck stock)
  2                     shallots -- chopped

Heat a saute pan over low heat and add 4 tablespoons of the butter.  When the butter is foamy, add the cubed pumpkin and cook, stirring often to stop it from sticking and burning, until it softens and falls into a puree.

Turn the pumpkin into a saucepan, add half the cream and half the herbs and cook over low heat for approximately 1 hour, or until puree is thick and the liquid has evaporated.  Stir occasionally to prevent scorching.  Remove from the heat and beat in an additional 2 tablespoons butter.

Whisk in the beaten eggs.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside to cool.

On a floured surface, roll out the pasta as thin as possible.  Cut it into 2 sheets and brush 1 of them with egg wash.  Using a teaspoon, place 24 equal mounds of the pumpkin puree on the egg-washed dough, 2 inches apart.  Cover the mounded dough with the second sheet of pasta and press around the mounds of pumpkin to seal the dough.

Using a ravioli cutter or a sharp knife, cut the ravioli.  Dust a tray with semolina and place the ravioli on it.  Bring a large pot of water to a boil while you make the sauce

To prepare the sauce:  In a saucepan, reduce the stock with the shallots to 1/2 cup.  Add the remaining cream and reduce by half.  Over low heat, whisk in the remaining 4 tablespoons butter, a little at a time, over low heat Strain the sauce into a clean saucepan and add the remaining sage and thyme.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Add the ravioli to the rapidly boiling water and cook for 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon and drain.  Add the ravioli to the sauce and bring just to the boil.  Correct the seasonings.

Presentation:  Divide the ravioli among preheated soup dishes and spoon the sauce over them, Garnish each with serving with a fresh sage leaf.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  semolina flour -- finest grind
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
  4                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Place the flours in a food processor fitted with a metal blade.  Add the salt, eggs and olive oil.  Process until the dough begins to mass on the blade (about 1 to 2 minutes).

Remove the dough from the processor and press it into a ball.  Wrap in plastic and let rest at least 2 hours in the refrigerator before rolling and cutting.  (Rolling the dough by hand is extremely tedious; with a small pasta machine and cutting attachment, you will save time and produce a much more uniform product.)

The pasta can also be made by hand or in an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook.  For each of these methods.  Mix the dry ingredients together first, make a well in the center, add the wet ingredients and mix them together slowly until everything is combined well.  Wrap the dough in plastic.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 pounds (3 servings).

Comments:  It is best to have the pasta dough as dry as possible because the noodles have a better texture.  If the dough is too soft, knead in more semolina or all-purpose flour until the dough becomes quite firm.  Since it is hard for small machines to roll pasta that is very firm, the pasta may have to be dried after rolling on rack made for that purpose or over a broomstick that hangs between 2 chairs.

Place the flours in a food processor fitted with a metal blade.  Add the salt, eggs and olive oil.  Process until the dough begins to mass on the blade (about 1 to 2 minutes).
</DirT>
<DirT>
Remove the dough from the processor and press it into a ball.  Wrap in plastic and let rest at least 2 hours in the refrigerator before rolling and cutting.  (Rolling the dough by hand is extremely tedious; with a small pasta machine and cutting attachment, you will save time and produce a much more uniform product.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
The pasta can also be made by hand or in an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook.  For each of these methods.  Mix the dry ingredients together first, make a well in the center, add the wet ingredients and mix them together slowly until everything is combined well.  Wrap the dough in plastic.

Comments:  It is best to have the pasta dough as dry as possible because the noodles have a better texture.  If the dough is too soft, knead in more semolina or all-purpose flour until the dough becomes quite firm.  Since it is hard for small machines to roll pasta that is very firm, the pasta may have to be dried after rolling on rack made for that purpose or over a broomstick that hangs between 2 chairs.

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5                     Roma tomatoes
  2                     chipotle chilies
     1/2                chopped basil
     1/4                minced garlic
     1/2           cup  fresh lime juice
     1/4           cup  balsamic vinegar
  2           teaspoon  sugar
  2           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-cracked black pepper
  1                cup  olive oil
  2 1/2         pounds  beef tenderloin -- trimmed
  1         tablespoon  coriander -- toasted, crushed
                        Mixed salad greens
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Potato Galette With Goat Cheese -- (see recipe)

Prepare the tomato salsa:  Over a hot grill, roast the tomatoes until blackened.  Transfer the bowl and add the chipotles.  Cover and allow to cool for 15 minutes.  Add the basil, garlic and lemon juice and marinate for 10 minutes.  Transfer to a blender or food processor and pulse until chunky.  Transfer to a bowl and add the vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper.  Slowly whisk in 1 cup of olive oil.  Reserve.

Season the beef with salt, pepper and coriander.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

In a sautÈ pan, heat some of the olive oil until smoking and sear the beef until browned all over.  Transfer to oven and cook until medium-rare, (120 degrees internal temperature) about 12 to 15 minutes.  Set aside and allow to rest for 10 minutes.

Cut into 1/4-inch thick slices and divide onto 4 plates.  Spoon salsa on top.  Season mixed greens with two tablespoons of olive oil and salt and pepper.  Place each of the galette quarters along side of the tenderloin and garnish with the mixed greens.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe is a wonderful dish for the summer.  It has strong and delicate flavors, when combined, it'll provide you with a perfect balance of spiciness in the chili and a coolness of the tomato salsa.

         Roasted Bell Pepper-Stuffed Chicken Breasts, Sweet Sauce

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  boneless skin-on chicken breast halves
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                     yellow bell pepper
  1                     red bell pepper
  2            bunches  scallions -- ends trimmed
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
  4        tablespoons  plum wine or sherry
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (2 oz) -- room temperature

Flatten the chicken breasts with a meat hammer or rolling pin and season them with salt and pepper.

Char the red and yellow pepper over a gas flame or under a hot broiler until the skin is completely burned.  Wipe off the skin.  Cut each pepper in half and remove the seeds, then cut into quarters.

In a saucepan, blanch the green part of 4 of the scallions.

Place 1 blanched scallion on the inside of chicken breast, then add a piece of the yellow pepper and a piece of the red pepper.  Roll up the breast to enclose the peppers and secure with string.  Season the outside with salt and pepper.  Repeat with the remaining breasts.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Heat a large, heavy ovenproof skillet.  Add the chicken breasts and brown them on all sides.  Place the skillet in the hot oven and cook the breasts for 15 minutes, until cooked through.  Remove from oven and keep the chicken warm on a plate.

Halve the remaining scallions lengthwise, then cut them into 1-inch pieces.

Heat a sautÈ pan.  Add the olive oil and heat until hot.  SautÈ the scallion pieces for 1 minute.  Add the vinegar and plum wine or sherry and reduce by two thirds.  Add the cream and reduce it until the sauce lightly coats the back of a spoon.  Whisk in the butter, a little at a time over very low heat.  Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

Cut each chicken piece on a bias into 6 slices and arrange the slices attractively in the center of 4 warm dinner plates or one large platter.  A fanshape always looks good.  Nap the sauce over the chicken and on one edge of the plate.  Garnish with finely chopped chives.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  At first glance this dish looks very elaborate.  But it's surprisingly easy to prepare as you'll discover.  And the result not just looks wonderful but tastes exciting too.

Wine Recommendation:  One of my favorite white wines is the rather unusual white Chateauneuf de Pape.  But you may want to look at other whites from the Rhone Valley including Hermitage, St. Joseph or an inexpensive white Cote du Rhone.  The sharp edge of the wine partners well with the rich taste of the chicken.

            Roasted Black Bass On Jasmine Rice With Miso Glaze

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  white miso
     1/2           cup  mirin
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  mushroom soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  minced ginger
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  4                     black bass fillets - (3 oz ea)
  1                cup  jasmine rice
  1 1/4           cups  water
  4                     iceberg lettuce cups

In a small bowl, combine the miso, mirin, sugar, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger.  Slowly stir in the sesame oil to make the miso glaze.  Marinate the bass in the miso glaze for 5 to 6 hours, refrigerated.

In a pot, combine rice and water and cook in rice cooker until done, around 20 minutes.  Reserve and keep warm.

Arrange the fish fillets on a roasting pan.  Generously coat with the miso glaze, and discard the rest of the glaze.  Bake in a preheated 500 degree oven for about 10 minutes or until medium done.

Place an iceberg lettuce cup on a dinner plate.  Spoon about 1/2 cup of the jasmine rice in center, place a fillet on top and drizzle miso glaze from roasting pan over the rice.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  When I think of fresh flavors and fluffy rice this is the dish that springs to mind.  A great mixture of all of my favorite Asian flavors, served on cups of iceburg lettuce to make a great meal.  Feel free to use other fish if black bass is not in season.  Freshness is the only thing that matters.

Wine Recommendation:  I like a dry riesling with this fish.  Riesling is the world's great wine bargain -- people have this idea that riesling is sweet and cloying when in fact it makes some of the world's finest crisp, dry and elegant wine.  Try one of the wonderful rieslings from Alsace.  Or for a great bargain, Bonny Doon's Pacific Rim Dry Riesling from California.

  6             ounces  tamarind paste
  4             ounces  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  coriander -- toasted, crushed
  2             ounces  soy sauce

Prepare the Pomegranate Marinade:  In a sautÈ pan, heat the oil.  Add the chilies and cook for 15 seconds.  Transfer to a deep casserole, and add the rest of the ingredients.

Place the pork rack in the marinade and let it marinade for 3 hours, refrigerated.  Remove the pork from the marinade.  Season with the salt and pepper.  Divide the marinade into 2 portions.  Reserve.

In sautÈ pan, over high heat, add the olive oil and 1 ounce of butter.  Sear pork until golden.  Transfer to a preheated 350 degree oven and roast for 20 minutes, basting with half of the reserved marinade every 5 minutes.  Cook until the thermometer inserted into the rack reads 150 to 160 degrees.  Allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing into chops.

Meanwhile, in a sauce pan, bring the remaning half marinade to a boil and reduce until thickned.  Strain.  Whisk in 4 ounces of butter.  Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.  Reserve.

In a sautÈ pan, heat the remaining 1-ounce of olive oil.  Saute the smoked bacon and garlic until golden.  Add 4 ounces of butter and when melted, add the mustard greens.  Season with salt and pepper.  Deglaze with 6 ounces Chicken Stock.  Cover and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Reserve.

In another sautÈ pan, heat the remaining 3 ounces of butter and melt.  Add turnips and sautÈ to golden brown.  Add 6 ounces of chicken stock and 1 tablespoon of sugar.  Braise until al dentÈ.  Reserve.

In the center of 4 plates, make a small mound with the mustard greens.  Place pork chops against the greens.  Place turnips around the greens and pork chops, and lightly ladle over the reserved pomegranate sauce.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This recipe has a wonderful complex flavor.  Hidden in the marinade you combine fruit, garlic and chili that go great with bacon from the braised greens.  I also like the Asian influence from the soy and ginger.  This is a knockout of a dish.

         Roasted Veal Oscar With Sweet Main Lobster And Asparagus

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  veal cutlet
  1                     lobster - (abt 1 lb)
  4             ounces  Artichoke Puree -- (see below)
  5                     asparagus spears
  3             ounces  Choron Sauce -- (see below)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Tarragon sprig -- for garnish
                        === ARTICHOKE PUREE ===
  4              large  artichokes
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  heavy cream
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Thyme -- to taste
  2        tablespoons  sweet butter
     1/2           cup  mascapone
     1/4           cup  goat cheese
                        ===CHORON SAUCE ===
  2             medium  shallots -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  white wine vinegar
  3                     egg yolks
  4        tablespoons  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  sweet butter -- clarified
  1         tablespoon  tarragon minced
  1           teaspoon  tomato paste
                        = (or 1 tbspn finely-chopped peeled
                        seeded tomato)

Season the veal with the salt and pepper and sear in a sautÈ pan over high heat.

Transfer to 350 degree oven and cook until medium rare (5 to 6 minutes).  Remove from oven and keep warm.

Steam the lobster for 5 to 7 minutes, remove from water and let rest for 4 minutes.

Remove the meat from the shell, slice the tail in half and keep in a little warm butter until ready to serve.

Steam the cleaned asparagus until slightly underdone.

Place a 4 ounce scoop of the artichoke puree in the center of the plate.  On the puree place the veal and lobster so that they cover the puree.  Place the warm asparagus on top of the two items.

Drizzle the choron sauce on top of the lobster and around the plate.  Garnish with the tarragon sprig.

For the Artichoke Puree:  Cut the artichoke into medium-size pieces and place in a pot.  Cover the artichokes with milk and cream.  Bring to a boil and reduce to a low simmer.  Cook the artichokes until very tender.

Strain the artichokes (reserving the liquid).  Transfer to a food processor.  Add a little of the reserved cream if needed.

Add the mascapone and goat cheese and blend for 10 more second or until well mixed together.   Season with salt and pepper if needed.  Transfer to a container and keep warm.

For the Choron Sauce:  In a small saucepan, combine the shallots, pepper, white wine, and vinegar.  Reduce over medium heat until 2 tablespoon liquid remains.

In a heat-resistant mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, water, salt, and shallot mixture.  Whip over hot, but not boiling, water until thick and creamy.

Slowly whisk in the melted butter, a few drops at a time, until the sauce begins to emulsify.  In a slow stream, whisk in the remaining butter until it is completely incorporated.

Whisk in the tarragon.  Whisk the chopped tomato or tomato paste.  Correct seasoning to taste.  Keep warm until needed.  Serve with fish en cro˚te or grilled or roasted red meat.

This recipe yields 1 serving.

Comments:  This wonderful dish represents how important this day is for us at Spago.  We wanted to combine two great dishes into one.  The lobster and veal share a wonderful artichoke puree and the classic choron sauce complement both dishes.  You will feel like an Oscar winner after eating this blockbuster of a dish.

                           Roasted Whole Garlic

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              whole  garlic heads
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- more or less

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Arrange the garlic heads in a small roasting pan and toss with the olive oil, coating them well.

Roast garlic until very tender, 50 to 60 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool.  When cool, cut the heads in half, crosswise, with a serrated knife and remove the softened garlic pulp.  This can be done by squeezing each half or by scooping the garlic out with a tiny teaspoon or small knife.

Transfer to a container, cover, and refrigerate.  Use as needed.

This recipe yields about 1/2 cup.

Comments:  Roasting garlic develops a sweeter, more flavorful taste, without the pungency of raw garlic.  This is a great ingredient to have on hand, so you may want to make a double or triple batch and keep it in the refrigerator.

                    Santa Barbara Shrimp With Mustard

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  shrimp to 8 per person
  4        tablespoons  safflower oil
  2             medium  shallots -- minced
  1              bunch  fresh tarragon leaves -- minced
     1/2           cup  dry sherry
     1/2           cup  cream
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces
  2        tablespoons  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  minced chives
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly ground black pepper -- to taste

Season the shrimp with the salt and pepper.  Using 2 large sautÈ pans, heat the oil until it begins to smoke.  Over very high heat, sautÈ the shrimp for 6 to 7 minutes.  Transfer to a warm plate, set aside and keep warm.

To each sautÈ pan, add 1 minced shallot and 1 tablespoon minced tarragon.  Saute the shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes.  Deglaze each pan with the sherry and then combine the sauce in one pan.  Add the cream and reduce the sauce until it coats the back of the spoon.  Whisk in the butter, 1 small piece at a time.  Whisk in the mustard, just at the last minute.  Do not let the sauce boil, or the mustard will be grainy.  Correct seasoning to taste.

Arrange the shrimp decoratively on serving plates, nap with sauce, and sprinkle with chives.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This was one of the most requested appetizers at Ma Maison.  The shrimp will be crisp and succulent when sautÈed over very high heat.

Wine Recommendation:  A fume blanc is a great choice for this dish.

Season the shrimp with the salt and pepper.  Using 2 large sautÈ pans, heat the oil until it begins to smoke.  Over very high heat, sautÈ the shrimp for 6 to 7 minutes.  Transfer to a warm plate, set aside and keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To each sautÈ pan, add 1 minced shallot and 1 tablespoon minced tarragon.  Saute the shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes.  Deglaze each pan with the sherry and then combine the sauce in one pan.  Add the cream and reduce the sauce until it coats the back of the spoon.  Whisk in the butter, 1 small piece at a time.  Whisk in the mustard, just at the last minute.  Do not let the sauce boil, or the mustard will be grainy.  Correct seasoning to taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Arrange the shrimp decoratively on serving plates, nap with sauce, and sprinkle with chives.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  This was one of the most requested appetizers at Ma Maison.  The shrimp will be crisp and succulent when sautÈed over very high heat.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendation:  A fume blanc is a great choice for this dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             medium  shallots -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  white wine vinegar
  3                     egg yolks
  4        tablespoons  water
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter -- melted
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh tarragon
                        === FOR SAUCE CHORON ===
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped peeled seeded fresh tomato
                        = (or 1 teaspoon tomato paste)
  1             recipe  Sauce BÈarnaise -- (from above)

In a small saucepan, combine the shallots, pepper, white wine, and vinegar.  Reduce over medium heat until 2 tablespoon liquid remains.

In a heat-resistant mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, water, salt, and shallot mixture.  Whip over hot, but not boiling, water until thick and creamy.

Slowly whisk in the melted butter, a few drops at a time, until the sauce begins to emulsify.  In a slow stream, whisk in the remaining butter until it is completely incorporated.

Whisk in the tarragon.  Correct seasoning to taste. Keep warm until needed.  Sauce bÈarnaise is served mostly with grilled red meat or fish.

For the Sauce Choron:  Whisk the chopped tomato or tomato paste into the Sauce BÈarnaise.  Correct seasoning to taste.  Keep warm until needed.  Serve with fish en cro˚te or grilled or roasted red meat.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 to 2 cups.

Comments:  This sauce is an emulsion of egg yolks and butter.  For best results, always whisk the sauce over hot water until it reaches a consistency that coats the back of a spoon.

Categories    : Condiments                      Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  artichokes - (abt 1 lb ea)
  1                     lemon -- cut in half
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     3/4           cup  chicken stock

Cut or break off each of the stems, leaving a flat base.  Turn the artichokes with a paring knife, discarding all the leaves, stopping when you get to the indentation near the bottom of the artichoke.  Cut across the indentation and scoop out the hairy choke with a small teaspoon.  Trim around the bottom, smoothing out the rough edges, and rub with the lemon halves to prevent discoloration.  Cut each bottom into 6 or 8 wedges and reserve with the lemon halves in cold water to cover.

When ready to cook, remove the sliced artichokes from the water and drain well.  Heat the oil in a small skillet or saute pan, add the artichokes, season lightly with salt and pepper and saute over medium heat until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes.  Pour in the stock and simmer until the artichokes are tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.  Adjust the seasoning and use as needed.

This recipe yields enough for 2 small pizzas.

Comments:  Artichoke bottoms are a real delicacy, the "prize" after all the outer leaves are peeled away.  Not only can you scatter the sliced bottoms over pizza but they are especially good tossed with your favorite pasta.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  12                    sugar snap peas - (to 15)
  8                     baby carrots -- peeled, trimmed
  8                     baby yellow squash -- trimmed
  1                     red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/4" strips
  3        tablespoons  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe), heated
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a 10-inch skillet over medium heat, heat the butter until foamy.  SautÈ the vegetables for about 2 minutes, to coat with the butter.  Pour in the stock and season lightly with salt and pepper.  Cook for about 4 minutes longer, just until the vegetables are tender but still crispy.  Correct seasoning to taste.

Remove the vegetables with a slotted spoon and serve with entrÈe of your choice.  Serve in a heated serving bowl or arrange attractively on each plate as an accompaniment to an entrÈe.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Most vegetables are at their best when they are young.  Baby vegetables have the most intense flavor.  You can use any combination of vegetables as long as they are fresh and provide a variety of color.  Cooking time will vary with size, but cooking them quickly will keep the flavor intact and most of the vitamins will be retained.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2        medium  red bell pepper - (abt 4 oz) -- cored, seeded,
                        and finely diced
     1/2        medium  yellow bell pepper - (abt 4 oz) -- cored, seeded,
                        and finely diced
     1/2        medium  red onion - (abt 4 oz) -- finely diced
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  finely-chopped jalapeÒo pepper
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh chives
  2          teaspoons  chopped fresh dill
  2          teaspoons  chopped Italian parsley
                        Leaves from 2 sprigs fresh thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1                cup  fresh breadcrumbs
  1                     extra-large egg -- lightly beaten
  1                cup  finely-ground almonds
  1 1/4         pounds  fresh crabmeat -- any shells removed
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 oz)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3               cups  mixed greens of your choice -- cut or torn
                        into bite-size pieces
                        Sweet Red Bell Pepper Sauce -- (see recipe)

In a 10-inch skillet, heat the olive oil.  SautÈ the diced red and yellow peppers and onion until the onion is translucent and the peppers are tender, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove the peppers and onions with a slotted spoon and transfer to a large bowl and let cool.

To the skillet add the heavy cream and jalapeÒo and reduce until 1/2 cup remains.  Cool and add to the pepper and onion mixture.  Stir in the chives, dill, Italian parsley, thyme, salt and cayenne pepper.

Stir in the egg and 1/2 cup each of breadcrumbs, and finely ground almonds.  Gently fold in the crabmeat.  Mixture will be lumpy.  Divide the mixture into 12 and shape into small crabcakes.

Combine the remaining 1/2 cup each breadcrumbs and ground almonds on a flat plate.  Dip both sides of each crabcake into the mixture and coat well.  Place on a tray and refrigerate, covered, for 1 to 3 hours.

When ready to serve melt the butter and vegetable oil in a large skillet.  Over medium-high heat sautÈ half the crabcakes until golden brown, about 4 minutes on each side.  Transfer to drain on paper towels.  Keep warm in oven at 200 degrees.  If necessary use additional oil and cook remaining crabcakes.

Divide the salad greens among six large plates.  Arrange 2 crabcakes on the greens, drizzle Sweet Red Bell Pepper Sauce around the greens and on top of crabcakes.

This recipe yields 12 crabcakes.

Comments:  I ate crabcakes for the first time in Chesapeake Bay.  To my dismay, I tasted more potato than crab.  I took home a few pounds of fresh lump crabmeat, experimented with it, and finally came up with this recipe.  If you canít find fresh crabmeat, you can make this with uncooked shrimp.

Wine Recommendadtion:  These crab cakes make a perfect start to a dinner and you need a wine that not just complements them, but also asserts itself quickly.  Look for a grassy Sauvignon Blanc from Sancerre or the Loire or one of the new world whites from Australia or New Zealand.

In a 10-inch skillet, heat the olive oil.  SautÈ the diced red and yellow peppers and onion until the onion is translucent and the peppers are tender, 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove the peppers and onions with a slotted spoon and transfer to a large bowl and let cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To the skillet add the heavy cream and jalapeÒo and reduce until 1/2 cup remains.  Cool and add to the pepper and onion mixture.  Stir in the chives, dill, Italian parsley, thyme, salt and cayenne pepper.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Stir in the egg and 1/2 cup each of breadcrumbs, and finely ground almonds.  Gently fold in the crabmeat.  Mixture will be lumpy.  Divide the mixture into 12 and shape into small crabcakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the remaining 1/2 cup each breadcrumbs and ground almonds on a flat plate.  Dip both sides of each crabcake into the mixture and coat well.  Place on a tray and refrigerate, covered, for 1 to 3 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
When ready to serve melt the butter and vegetable oil in a large skillet.  Over medium-high heat sautÈ half the crabcakes until golden brown, about 4 minutes on each side.  Transfer to drain on paper towels.  Keep warm in oven at 200 degrees.  If necessary use additional oil and cook remaining crabcakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the salad greens among six large plates.  Arrange 2 crabcakes on the greens, drizzle Sweet Red Bell Pepper Sauce around the greens and on top of crabcakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 12 crabcakes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  I ate crabcakes for the first time in Chesapeake Bay.  To my dismay, I tasted more potato than crab.  I took home a few pounds of fresh lump crabmeat, experimented with it, and finally came up with this recipe.  If you canít find fresh crabmeat, you can make this with uncooked shrimp.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Wine Recommendadtion:  These crab cakes make a perfect start to a dinner and you need a wine that not just complements them, but also asserts itself quickly.  Look for a grassy Sauvignon Blanc from Sancerre or the Loire or one of the new world whites from Australia or New Zealand.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16             large  shrimp, such as Santa Barbara Shrimp
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === TOMATO-BASIL VINAIGRETTE ===
  6                     ripe plum tomatoes - (abt 1 lb) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and diced
  2             medium  shallots -- finely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- blanched, and
                        cut into julienne (or minced)
  3        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil -- plus
  4              whole  sprigs for garnish
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh parsley
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  good wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Remove the heads of the shrimp, peel and devein, leaving the tail intact.  Season lightly with salt and pepper and set aside.

Prepare the vinaigrette:  In a small bowl, combine the tomatoes, shallots, garlic, basil and parsley.  Season with salt and pepper.  Stir in the vinegar, lime juice and 1/2 cup olive oil, and mix well.

Heat a 10-inch skillet and pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Over medium-high heat cook the shrimp, in batches if necessary, about 1 1/2 minutes per  side.  Do not crowd in the pan.  Do not overcook -- well-done shrimp will become dry.

Spoon some vinaigrette in the center of each of 4 plates.  Arrange 4 shrimp on the  vinaigrette and garnish with basil sprigs.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Santa Barbara shrimp, found in the Pacific Ocean, are most prized for their taste and their size.  They are usually sold with head and tail intact.  However, Gulf shrimp make a good substitute in this fresh-tasting appetizer.

Wine Recommendation:  If youíre feeling adventurous try a Viognier, like the Andrew Murray from Santa Barbara County, with this dish.  Or if youíd like something more familiar grab an  Estancia Chardonnay or one of the big, oaky Chardonnays from Australia like Rosemount, Petaluma or Lindemans.

                            Savory Squash Soup

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     butternut squash - (abt 3 3/4 lbs)
  1                     acorn squash - (abt 1 3/4 lbs)
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (3/4 stick)
  1                     white onion - (abt 4 oz) -- peeled, trimmed,
                        and finely diced
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/4      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cardamom
  4               cups  homemade Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
                        = (or vegetable stock) -- heated
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary
                        === GARNISH ===
  1             recipe  Cranberry Relish -- (see recipe)
  1             recipe  Cardamom Cream -- (see recipe)
     1/2        recipe  Spiced Caramelized Pecans -- (see recipe)
  4        tablespoons  pumpkin seed oil

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cut each squash in half and discard the seeds.  Brush cut sides with 2 tablespoons of melted butter.  Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.  Arrange the squash cut-side down in a roasting pan and bake until tender, about 1 hour.  Cool, scoop out the insides of the squash, and purÈe the flesh in a food processor.  Reserve.  (You should have about 4 cups of purÈed squash.)

In a medium stockpot, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter.  Over low heat, sautÈ the onion.  Do not allow it to brown.  Add the purÈed squash and cook over very low heat until heated through, stirring occasionally.  Do not allow it to bubble up.  Season with the salt, pepper, ginger, and cardamom.

Pour in the stock and bring to a boil, still over low heat, stirring often.  Cook about 20 minutes.

In a small saucepan, heat the cream with the rosemary sprig.  Remove the rosemary and pour the cream into the soup.  Transfer to a blender or food processor and process, in batches, for 2 or 3 minutes.  Adjust the seasoning to taste.

To serve, ladle the soup into heated bowls.  Place a tablespoon of Cranberry Relish in the center, top with a dollop of Cardamom Cream, then sprinkle with chopped pecans.  Drizzle pumpkin seed oil over soup.

This recipe yields 2 quarts.

Comments:  Fall and winter squash have a long season and are easily stored for months on end.  Because our customers love it so much, we have this soup on the menu at Spago six months out of the year.  The soup can be served warm or cold.  For the vegetarian, the soup can be made with a vegetable stock.  If desired, bake small squash until tender, scoop out, and use as individual serving bowls.

                        Seared Tuna Steak A Poivre

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     tuna steaks - (6 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  cracked black peppercorns
     1/3           cup  port
     1/4           cup  cognac
     1/2           cup  reduced brown chicken or brown veal stock
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  green peppercorns -- drained

Season tuna lightly with salt.  Pour the peppercorns on a sheet of wax paper or a large plate and press each slice of tuna into the pepper to evenly coat both sides.  Refrigerate until needed.

In a small skillet or saucepan, reduce the port and cognac until 2 tablespoons remain.  Add the stock and reduce until the sauce thickens.  Strain into a clean pan, whisk in the butter, and season to taste.  Keep warm.

Heat a skillet large enough to hold the 4 tuna steaks in one layer or preheat a grill.  Over high heat, sear the tuna on both sides, 35 to 45 seconds per side.  Cut each steak into 1/2-inch thick slices.

Spoon a little sauce in the center of each of four plates.  Arrange one sliced tuna steak on the sauce and garnish with the green peppercorns.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The first rule for making a great fish dish is always buy the freshest fish.  I use sushi grade Ahi tuna.  When I cook tuna steaks I always cut away the blood line in the fish and then sear the steaks for less than a minute on each side.  In this recipe you're treating the tuna like the best steak.  Try serving it with "Creamy Mashed Potatoes With Caramelized Onions" (see recipe).

Wine Recommendation:  I like something big and flavorful to accompany tuna and I'd look for a Californian Cabernet Sauvignon from Beringer, Bealieu Vineyards or Robert Mondavi.  For something a little more unusual think about a Pinot Noir from Chalone or Au Bon Climat.  All these wines are affordable and represent good value.

For something a little more unusual think about a Pinot Noir from Chalone or Au Bon Climat.  All these wines are affordable and represent good value.

                       Shrimp Tempura With Cilantro

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Seafood                         Shellfish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    jumbo shrimp
  1              large  jalapeÒo pepper - (or 2 small) -- seeded, and
                        finely chopped
                        Leaves of 4 or 5 cilantro sprigs -- chopped
                        Juice of 2 medium limes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        === TEMPURA BATTER ===
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  baking powder
  1 1/4           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  sesame seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        Salt -- to taste
     1/4           cup  cilantro leaves -- finely chopped
                        === TO FINISH ===
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
  1              bunch  spinach -- leaves only

Butterfly the shrimp:  Peel and devein the shrimp with a small sharp knife.  Butterfly the shrimp by cutting along the back, halfway through.  Arrange the shrimp on a large platter.  Sprinkle with the minced jalapeÒo and the chopped cilantro.  Pour the lime juice over and let marinate for at least 30 minutes, refrigerated.  When ready to cook, season lightly with salt.

Prepare the batter:  In a small bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder.  Whisk in the water until the batter is smooth, then add the remaining ingredients, seasoning with cayenne and salt to taste.  Place small bowl in slightly larger bowl full of ice to keep batter ice cold.  This ensures crisp tempura.

At serving time, in a deep, heavy saucepan, wok, or deep-fat fryer, heat 3 inches of oil to 350 degrees.

Dip each shrimp into the batter and coat well.  Carefully place three or four in the hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon or flat strainer and drain on paper towels.  Keep warm while preparing the remaining shrimp and the spinach.

In the same oil, cook the spinach.  Drain on paper towels and season lightly with salt.

Arrange a few fried spinach leaves on each of 4 plates.  Place 3 shrimp on top and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Tempura is the extremely delicate Japanese art of deep-frying.  Done properly with the right batter and hot oil, it quickly seals delicate flavors, especially something as fragile as shrimp.  The batter should be dry and crisp after the deep frying.

Wine Recommendation:  Fresh, young, aromatic wines are the partners I prefer for Asian appetizers.  I look for Sauvignon Blancs (or FumÈ Blancs as they're often called in California) like Geyser Peak or Kendall Jackson, or the inexpensive Semillon-Chardonnay blends from Australian producers like Rosemount, Seppelts and Penfolds.

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Accompaniment                   Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     egg yolks
  1                     egg
  1 3/4           cups  milk
  1              pound  all-purpose flour - (abt 3 cups)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  4             ounces  unsalted butter -- melted
     1/2           cup  peanut oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  2             ounces  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh parsley

In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks, egg, and milk together.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, nutmeg, salt and pepper.  Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and mix with hand until well blended.  Do not over mix at this stage.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate.  Allow the batter to rest for at least 1 hour.

Bring salted water to a boil.  Place a perforated hotel pan (or a large-holed colander) on top of the pot.  Place the batter on the pan and force through the holes to form spaetzle.  Cook for 4 to 5 minutes.

Transfer cooked spaetzle to a bowl of ice water to shock.  When cool to the touch, drain well.  Stir in half the oil.  (At this point you can cover and refrigerate up to 2 days.)

When ready to serve, over high heat place a large sautÈ pan until it gets very hot.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup of oil and the boiled spaetzle.  Let cook for 2 minutes without moving the pan to achieve a good brown color.  Add the butter and start to sautÈ the spaetzle.  SautÈ until golden brown.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Finish with a sprinkle of parsley.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  I grew up eating more spaetzle than noodles.  Once you've tasted a really good spaetzle you'll be hooked.  This recipe makes a really light and delicious spaetzle and is the only dish to accompany my "Hungarian Goulash" (see recipe).

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Pork


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     sides baby pork ribs - (abt 3 lbs)
  4                     scallions -- cut chiffonade
                        === MARINADE ===
  1                cup  soy sauce
  1                cup  sake (Japanese rice wine)
     1/3           cup  sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  ground dried chili flakes
     1/4           cup  honey
  2        tablespoons  grated fresh ginger
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh garlic

In a bowl, mix together all the ingredients for the marinade.

Place the ribs in a container just large enough to hold them one on top of the other, or use a large re-sealable food storage bag.  Pour the marinade over the ribs, cover with plastic wrap or tin foil, or pour into the re-sealable bag with the ribs.  Let marinate in the refrigerator overnight.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Place half the marinade in a baking pan with the ribs and bake, turning the ribs frequently, for about 2 hours, or until the meat is tender.

Under a pre-heated broiler or on a wood-fired grill glaze the ribs for 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Watch carefully so they do not burn.

Remove the ribs and cut each side into individual pieces.  Arrange the ribs in an overlapping fashion on each plate or on a large serving platter.  Garnish with scallion chiffonade.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Baby pork ribs can be found in supermarkets or Chinese meat markets.  Young ribs are more tender and juicy.  Generally they come in entire sides; 2 sides should be enough for this recipe.  Serve with "Twice Fried Rice" or "Vegetable Fried Rice" (see recipes).

Wine Recommendation:  An Austrian Chardonnay like Weininger or a Riesling like Freie Weingartner offers wonderful fruitiness, the perfect partner for these pork ribs.  If you'd prefer a red look to a Californian Merlot like Robert Mondavi.

                         Spicy Caramelized Pecans

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Snacks


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  peanut oil
  1                cup  pecan halves
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar

In a medium saucepan, heat the oil to 350 degrees.  (A deep-frying thermometer can tell when the proper temperature has been reached.  Or use a 1-inch bread cube -- it should sizzle and turn golden brown in about 60 seconds when the temperature is correct.)

Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan bring 1 quart of water to a boil.  Add the pecans in 2 separate batches, and boil for 2 minutes.  Drain in a strainer, shaking off all excess water.  Sprinkle the salt and cayenne pepper over the nuts and coat with confectionersí sugar, a little at a time, allowing the sugar to melt into the pecans.  Toss the nuts by shaking the strainer, adding a little more sugar each time, until all the sugar is used and the nuts are coated.  Do not use hands or a spoon to toss.  The nuts should have a glaze of sugar.

Carefully add the nuts to the heated oil, keeping the oil at 350 degrees.  Cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove with a slotted spoon to a baking tray to cool.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  The nuts have a sweet and spicy taste, a delicious combination.  We toss them over green salads, and especially Spinach and Blue Cheese Salad for flavor and texture, but the nuts are almost too good to save just for salads.

Comments:  The nuts have a sweet and spicy taste, a delicious combination.  We toss them over green salads, and especially Spinach and Blue Cheese Salad for flavor and texture, but the nuts are almost too good to save just for salads.

                           Spicy Chicken Pizza

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pizza

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Pizza Dough -- (see recipe)
  1 1/4         pounds  skinned boned uncooked chicken -- cut small cubes
                        to make 4 cups
                        === MARINADE ===
     1/2           cup  plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
  3 1/2    tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2              large  jalapeÒo peppers -- trimmed, minced
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled, minced
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh cilantro leaves
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        === TOPPINGS ===
  2               cups  grated mozzarella cheese - (8 oz)
  2               cups  grated Fontina cheese - (8 oz)
  6                     Roma tomatoes - (abt 1 lb) -- ends trimmed,
                        cut into thin slices
  1                cup  cubed Asian eggplant -- sautÈed or grilled
  1             recipe  Caramelized Onions -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  sliced red and yellow bell peppers -- sautÈed or grilled

Marinate the chicken:  Arrange the cubed chicken in a shallow medium bowl and toss with the marinade ingredients, using 1/4 cup of olive oil.  Season lightly with salt and let marinate for about 1 hour, refrigerated.

In a skillet or sautÈ pan large enough to hold the chicken in one layer, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil.  Remove the chicken from the marinade with a slotted spoon.  SautÈ the chicken just to brown on all sides.  Do not overcook.  Remove from the skillet with a slotted spoon and set aside.

Place a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out the Pizza Dough to make two 10-inch rounds, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle.  Transfer dough to wooden pizza paddles or cookie sheets.

Layer the pizza:  Start with the mozzarella, then the Fontina, tomato, eggplant, Caramelized Onions, cooked chicken, and peppers.  Slide the pizza onto the baking stone.  Bake until the pizza is nicely browned, 10 to 12 minutes.

Transfer the pizza to a firm surface and cut into slices with a pizza cutter or very sharp knife.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields two 10-inch or four 8-inch pizzas for 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  This has always been one of the most popular recipes at my CafÈs.  It's a wonderful, hearty pizza, spicy and delicious, perfect for dinner for a family.

Wine Recommendation:  Although itís hard to see pizza with anything other than beer, there are some great wine pairings that you might like to try.  Bonny Doon's Ca' del Solo and Edmunds St. John's Port 'o Call reds are perfect, and inexpensive, partners for this Spicy Chicken Pizza.

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === TOPPING ===
  4                     ripe tomatoes -- cored, and
                        cut into 1/2" dice
     1/2           cup  Oven-Dried Tomatoes -- (see recipe),
                        coarsely chopped
     1/3           cup  julienned basil leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed dried red pepper flakes
                        === BASE ===
  12            slices  country-style Italian bread, 1" thick
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  Roasted Whole Garlic -- (see recipe)
  3         tablespoon  julienned basil -- for garnish

Pre-heat broiler or grill.

In medium bowl combine fresh and oven-dried tomatoes, basil, salt and black and red peppers.  Set aside.

Broil or grill bread until golden brown on both sides.  In small bowl combine extra-virgin olive oil and roasted garlic.  Brush over toasted bread slices.

Using a slotted spoon to drain off excess liquid, divide tomato mixture among bread slices.  Garnish with extra julienned basil leaves, if desired, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 12 slices.

Comments:  In Tuscany, when the first olives are picked to make oil, they take a slice of fresh toast, rub it with garlic and splash on the brand new, pungent, peppery oil.  I add tomato and basil, as they do in Rome, but make it sweeter by using oven-dried tomatoes and roasted garlic.

Wine Recommendation:  I like to start a dinner, especially in the summer, with a chilled red wine, cooled just enough to take the edge off it.  Lighter-bodied wines like a good Cotes du Rhone from Guigal or Chapoutierís Belleruche, or perhaps a young Valpolicella, respond to a  cooler temperature.  Or you might want to try cooling a Californian Gamay or Beaujolais style wine too.  Theyíre the perfect match for fresh, fragrant Bruschetta made with fresh, ripe tomatoes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3            bunches  spinach -- washed, and
                        stems removed
  1            package  frozen artichoke hearts - (10 oz) -- thawed
  1                cup  mayonnaise
     1/3           cup  mascarpone cheese
     1/3           cup  creme fraiche
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  goat cheese
  2        tablespoons  Roasted Whole Garlic -- (see recipe)
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  2        tablespoons  breadcrumbs
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika

In large metal sieve, blanch one bunch of spinach for about 1 minute in large pot of  boiling water.  Transfer in sieve to bowl of iced water and leave for 30 seconds.  Remove  sieve from water and with the back of a large metal spoon drain out excess water.  Set aside.  Repeat with remaining bunches of spinach.

Place artichokes in bowl of food processor fitted with a steel blade.  Process for about 5 to 7 seconds or until very coarsely chopped.  Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.

Add mayonnaise, mascarpone cheese, creme fraiche, Parmesan, goat cheese, roasted garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Process for another 5 seconds or until combined.

Add blanched spinach and process with on/off motion a few times or until well blended.  The dip should still have some texture and not be completely smooth.  Spoon into a shallow ovenproof dish.

In small bowl combine all ingredients for topping and sprinkle over spinach dip.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for about 15 to 20 minutes or until heated through and top is golden brown.

Serve hot surrounded by slices of crispy French bread or crackers.

This recipe yields about 2 cups, 4 to 6 servings

Comments;  Who said dip has to be a trip back to the fifties and a bunch of canned ingredients blended with cream cheese?  Creamy mascarpone, goat cheese and Parmesan                                              combine with artichokes and spinach to make this fabulous party dip.  All it needs is hot, crusty French bread as an accompaniment to make a great summer appetizer or hors díoeuvre.

                           Spinach Pasta Dough

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  fresh spinach - (abt 1 bunch)
  1 1/2           cups  semolina flour -- finest grind
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3                     eggs
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil

Wash the spinach carefully in 2 or 3 changes of water.  Cut off 1 inch of the stems.  Chop the leaves and puree them in a food processor.  Put the puree in the center of a linen towel or napkin and squeeze the juice into a measuring cup.  (Use a towel or napkin that you won't mind using because spinach juice stains.)  There should be about 1/4 cup juice.  Stir 2 tablespoons of the spinach puree into the spinach juice and reserve.  Discard the remaining puree.

Combine the flours in the food processor with the salt.  With the motor running, add the eggs, olive oil and enough of the spinach mixture through the feed tube so that the dough forms a ball when pressed together.  Wrap the dough in plastic and let it rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours.

Divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll and cut 1 at a time as desired.  Keep the unrolled dough covered to prevent it from drying.  Place any cut pasta on baking sheets that have been liberally dusted with semolina.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 pounds (3 servings).

Nutrition per serving:  Calories 703;  Fat 16g;  Carbohydrates 112g;  Cholesterol 212mg;  Sodium 900mg;  Protein 25g;  Fiber 7g;  Calories from Fat 20%;  Calories from Carbs 64%.

Comments:  The unrolled dough should be refrigerated after it has relaxed for 2 hours.  Plan to use it within 24 hours for best results.  Cut pasta may be refrigerated up to 24 hours before using or it may be left to air-dry.  For longer storage, freeze the cut pasta, then wrap it tightly in plastic and return to the freezer.  It will keep 3 to 4 weeks if carefully wrapped.

<DirT>
Wash the spinach carefully in 2 or 3 changes of water.  Cut off 1 inch of the stems.  Chop the leaves and puree them in a food processor.  Put the puree in the center of a linen towel or napkin and squeeze the juice into a measuring cup.  (Use a towel or napkin that you won&apos;t mind using because spinach juice stains.)  There should be about 1/4 cup juice.  Stir 2 tablespoons of the spinach puree into the spinach juice and reserve.  Discard the remaining puree.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the flours in the food processor with the salt.  With the motor running, add the eggs, olive oil and enough of the spinach mixture through the feed tube so that the dough forms a ball when pressed together.  Wrap the dough in plastic and let it rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll and cut 1 at a time as desired.  Keep the unrolled dough covered to prevent it from drying.  Place any cut pasta on baking sheets that have been liberally dusted with semolina.

Comments:  The unrolled dough should be refrigerated after it has relaxed for 2 hours.  Plan to use it within 24 hours for best results.  Cut pasta may be refrigerated up to 24 hours before using or it may be left to air-dry.  For longer storage, freeze the cut pasta, then wrap it tightly in plastic and return to the freezer.  It will keep 3 to 4 weeks if carefully wrapped.

        Steak Quesadilla With Sour Cream Cilantro Sauce And Salsa

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     New York Strip steak - (8 oz)
                        === ANCHO CHILE PASTE ===
  2             ounces  dried ancho chilies
     1/2           cup  garlic cloves
     1/2           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  cilantro leaves
  3              large  green onions - (3 oz) -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  honey
                        Juice of 1 lime
                        === SALSA ===
  1             medium  tomato -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
     1/2                jalapeÒo pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and chopped
  2        tablespoons  chopped onion
  2        tablespoons  chopped cilantro leaves
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === SOUR CREAM CILANTRO SAUCE ===
     1/4           cup  sour cream
     1/2           cup  cilantro leaves
                        Juice of 1/2 lime
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
                        === QUESADILLA ===
  1              large  baking potato -- peeled, and
                        cut into very thin rounds
     1/4           cup  clarified butter
                        Salt -- to taste
  2             ounces  shredded mozzarella cheese
  1              ounce  fresh goat cheese
  1                cup  mixed salad greens
  1             Sprigs  cilantro -- for garnish

Prepare the ancho chili paste:  Wash the ancho chilies and soften in warm water.  Cut in half, stem, and seed.  In a blender, combine the chilies with the remaining ingredients and puree.

Spread some of the paste over both sides of the steak and let marinate, refrigerated, at least six hours.  Season with salt and pepper.  Refrigerate, covered, until needed.

Prepare the Sour Cream Cilantro Sauce:  In a blender, combine sour cream, the cilantro, and lime juice, and blend until smooth.  Pour into a small bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate, covered, until needed.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Prepare the Quesadilla:  Place the potato slices in a medium bowl, pour the clarified butter over, and toss to coat the slices.  Season lightly with salt.  Arrange half the potatoes, flower fashion, in an 8-inch ovenproof skillet.  Cook over medium heat until the ends begin to brown and the potatoes stick together.  (This will keep the cheese from running through.)  Sprinkle with the two cheeses and cover with the remaining potatoes, arranged the same way as the bottom layer.  Set in the oven for 10 minutes, carefully flip the potatoes with a wide spatula and brown on a medium-high flame.  Return to the oven for 5 minutes longer.  Cut into 4 quarters and keep warm.

Prepare the Salsa:  In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients.

Grill or pan fry the steak to desired degree of doneness.  Cut into 6 or 8 slices.

Spread a layer of greens down the center of each of two plates and top with the salsa.  Arrange 3 or 4 slices of steak on the Salsa and spoon some of the Sour Cream Cilantro Sauce over the steak.  Place 2 quarters of the quesadilla on either side and garnish the plate with sprigs of cilantro.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 2 servings.

Comments:  I love homemade tortillas, but find the commercial ones sometimes unreliable.  So I decided to replace the tortillas with potato slices in this quesadilla and I think the end result is even tastier.  Don't be frightened!  This looks like a complicated dish but is really quite easy if you follow the recipe.

Wine Recommendation:  I don't know if you've tried any of the red wines from Chile or Argentina that are to be found in most wine shops nowadays, but some of the Merlots and Cabernet Sauvignons coming from South America are incredible bargains.  Look for Bodega Weinert and Catena from Argentina, and Concho y Toro and Casa Laspostolle from Chile.

              Stir-Fried Chicken With Cashews And Pine Nuts

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Main Dish
                Poultry

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut 1 1/2" cubes
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  plum wine or sherry
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  2          teaspoons  chopped peeled ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed chili pepper flakes
  1 1/4           cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  2          teaspoons  Wolfgang's Asian Rib Sauce -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  sliced shiitake mushrooms
     1/2           cup  yellow bell pepper in 1" cubes
     1/2           cup  red bell pepper in 1" cubes
  2                     scallions -- cut 1" slices
     1/4           cup  cashews
     1/4           cup  pine nuts
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (2 oz)

In a 10-inch skillet or wok, heat the peanut oil until smoking.

Season the chicken lightly with salt and pepper and sear, about 1 minute on each side.  Deglaze the pan with the plum wine or sherry and stir in the garlic, ginger and chili flakes.  Pour in the stock and reduce by half (sauce will begin to thicken).  Add the Asian Rib Sauce, mushrooms, peppers, scallion and nuts, and cook 1 or 2 minutes longer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is done.  Stir in the butter and correct seasoning to taste.

Spoon the stir-fried chicken onto a large heated serving platter, arranging all the ingredients evenly throughout.  Or divide among 4 heated plates and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  I don't usually use corn starches to thicken my sauces.  Instead, I prefer stock reductions and the addition of a little butter, which gives the sauces a much more delicate and richer consistency.

Wine Recommendation:  Look for a big, rich California Chardonnay to accompany this dish.  For less expensive wines you might want to consider Estancia, Beringer or Sonoma Cutrer.  Or look for one of the new varietals from Pay d'Oc in France.

Categories    : Side Dish                       Vegetables


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil
     1/4         pound  Chinese snow peas -- cut 1" chunks
  1                cup  oyster mushrooms -- whole or halved,
                        depending upon size
  1                cup  shiitake mushrooms -- whole or halved,
                        stems removed (stems can be added to
                        stocks for flavor)
  1                cup  red bell pepper strips in 1" chunks
  1                cup  yellow bell pepper strips in 1" chunks
     1/2         large  Japanese eggplant -- cut 6 or 7 slices
     1/4        medium  bok choy -- cut 1" chunks
  5                     broccoli florets - (to 6)
  5                     young asparagus spears -- cut 1 1/2" to 2"
                        lengths
     1/3           cup  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe), heated
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

In a wok or large skillet over high heat, heat the oil.  Add vegetables and stir fry, coating them with the oil.  Pour in the stock and the soy sauce and stir until al dente, about 2 minutes longer.  Season with salt and pepper to taste, keeping in mind that the soy sauce is salty.  Serve immediately.

Serve in a heated serving bowl or arrange attractively on each plate as an accompaniment to an entrÈe.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Comments:  The combination of the oil, stock, and soy sauce produces a glaze for the vegetables.  When cooked, the vegetables should be shiny and crispy with no stock remaining in the pan.

                       Sweet Italian Fennel Sausage

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pork                            Sausage


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5             pounds  pork butt -- cut into 1" cubes
  1 3/4         ounces  curing salt (salt peter)
  2          teaspoons  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  fennel seeds -- toasted
     1/4           cup  chopped garlic
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cayenne pepper
     3/4           cup  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe), iced
                        Court bouillon -- for poaching
                        Olive oil -- for sautÈing
                        Honey mustard -- to taste
     1/2           cup  minced onion

In a bowl combine the pork, curing salt, black pepper, fennel seeds, garlic, sugar and cayenne pepper.  Mix to make sure seasonings are well distributed throughout the pork.  Freeze for 30 minutes.

To prepare the forcemeat, pass the mixture through a meat grinder using the large hole plate.  Transfer to an electric mixer, using the paddle on the lowest speed, and mix for 1 minute.  Increase the speed to medium and slowly add the stock and mix for 2 minutes.  Switch to high speed and mix for 30 seconds.

To form the sausages, place about a cup of forcemeat in a 12- by 16-inch piece of plastic wrap.  Shape into a 1 1/2- by 8-inch sausage and wrap with the plastic to a tight roll.  Tie both ends by forming a knot.  Wrap again in aluminum foil.  Repeat the process until all forcemeat is used.

In a large sautÈ pan bring court bouillon to a simmer.  Poach the prepared sausages for 10 minutes or until firm to the touch.  Allow to cool and unwrap sausages.  In a cast-iron pan, over high heat, sautÈ the sausages in olive oil until nicely browned.  Slice and serve with honey mustard and minced onion.

This recipe yields about 5 pounds sausages.

            Thai Coconut Soup With Sugarcane Chicken Dumplings

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SOUP BASE ===
  2 1/2           cups  lobster stock
  1         tablespoon  chili paste
  1                     lemon grass stalk -- cut into 2" sticks
  10                    fresh Thai basil leaves
  1                     fresh small Thai chile
                        === SUGARCANE CHICKEN DUMPLINGS ===
  4             ounces  ground lean chicken
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
     1/2      teaspoon  minced ginger
  1           teaspoon  mushroom soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  fish sauce
  2          teaspoons  potato starch
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  8                     sugarcane sticks - (4" ea)
                        === THAI COCONUT SOUP ===
  2               cups  Soup Base -- (see above)
  1                cup  coconut milk
  6                     Kaffir lime leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Lime juice -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  palm sugar -- or to taste
                        Sugarcane Chicken Dumplings -- (see above)
                        === GARNISH ===
  1              ounce  glass noodles -- soaked in water
                        until softened
     1/4           cup  julienned carrots
     1/4           cup  julienned leeks
  4                     Thai chiles -- stems removed,
                        split in half lengthwise, seeded
  4                     Kaffir lime leaves -- cut thin chiffonade

Make the soup base.  In a saucepan, combine the lobster stock, chili paste, lemon grass, Thai basil leaves and small Thai chile and bring to a boil.  Reduce until only 2 cups remain.  Set aside.

Make the dumplings.  In a mixing bowl, combine the ground chicken, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, fish sauce, potato starch and black pepper.  Mix until well blended.  Divide into 8 portions.  Wrap each portion around the end of each sugarcane stick.  Reserve.

Make the soup.  To the soup base, add the coconut milk and lime leaves.  Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, lime juice and sugar.  Add the dumplings and simmer until done, about 3 minutes.

Divide the softened glass noodles on four soup bowls.  Place two dumplings crisscross on top of the noodles, leaning to the side of the bowl.  Divide the soup onto the four bowls.  Garnish each bowl with julienne of carrots, leeks, Thai chiles and lime leaf.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  There's an incredible combination of flavors in this soup, and it's one of my all time favorites.  It's a mixture of spicy, sweet, sour, and cool.  Like all good things it takes time.  So, take it easy when preparing all the ingredients, so when it's time to cook you'll be in total control -- and most importantly you'll have fun.

Wine Recommendation:  Don't be frightened of experimenting with wines to accompany a strong Asian-flavored dish like this.  Try a good Californian Chardonnay to start with.  Or, if you're feeling brave, try cooling a young red like a Syrah or one of Niebaum-Coppola's light and fruity Italian varietals.  Of course, you can always do what the Thais do -- take the cap off a cold bottle of Singha beer!

Or, if you&apos;re feeling brave, try cooling a young red like a Syrah or one of Niebaum-Coppola&apos;s light and fruity Italian varietals.  Of course, you can always do what the Thais do -- take the cap off a cold bottle of Singha beer!

                              Tortilla Soup

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Soups/Stews

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               ears  fresh corn -- husks removed
  4              large  garlic cloves - (to 5) -- peeled
  1              small  onion - (abt 2 oz) -- peeled, trimmed,
                        and quartered
  1              small  jalapeÒo pepper -- trimmed, seeded
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
  2                     corn tortillas -- cut 1" squares
  2              large  ripe tomatoes - (1 lb) -- peeled, seeded,
                        and coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  2             quarts  homemade Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
                        = (or use store-bought) -- heated
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Feshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  2                     corn tortillas
  1                     ripe avocado
  1              large  chicken breast -- cooked, boned,
                        and skinned
     1/2           cup  grated Cheddar cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh cilantro leaves

Using a large knife, carefully scrape the kernels off the corn cobs and set aside, reserving the cobs.

Using a food processor fitted with the steel blade, coarsely chop the garlic, onion,  jalapeÒo pepper, and the corn kernels.  Reserve.

Make the soup:  In a large stockpot, heat the oil.  Add the squares of tortillas and cook over low heat until they are slightly crisp.  Stir in the chopped vegetables and simmer just until the vegetables are coated with the oil.  Do not brown.

Add the tomatoes, the tomato paste, and 2 teaspoons of the cumin and continue to simmer for about 10 minutes to maximize the flavor.  Slowly pour in the stock, add the corn cobs, and cook over low heat until the soup is reduced by one third.

Discard the corn cobs and purÈe the soup in batches, in a blender or food processor until smooth.  At this point, the soup can be passed through a fine strainer if desired.  Return to a clean pot and season with salt and pepper.

Prepare the garnish:  Preheat the oven or toaster oven to 350 degrees.  Cut the tortillas into thin strips and arrange on a small baking tray.  Bake until the strips are crisp, 10 to 15  minutes.  Peel and dice the avocado.  Cut the chicken into thin strips.

To serve, add the chicken and avocado to the soup and reheat over low heat.  Ladle the soup into 6 to 8 warm soup bowls and garnish with the baked tortilla strips, Cheddar cheese, and chopped cilantro.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  I fell in love with this soup many years ago when I worked at the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas.  Though the flavors are full and robust, its tomato-broth base keeps it light and delicate.  This soup exemplifies the subtle complexities of Southwestern cuisine.  It has become a standard soup in all of the Wolfgang Puck CafÈs.

                             Twice Fried Rice

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Rice/Grains                     Side Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  long grain rice
     3/4           cup  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                     red or yellow bell pepper -- seeded, cored,
                        and cut small dice
  1                     green bell pepper -- seeded, cored,
                        and cut into small dice
  1                cup  sliced Napa cabbage
     1/2           cup  mushrooms -- sliced
     1/4           cup  snow peas -- strings removed
  1         tablespoon  peanut oil - (to 2)
  1                     egg -- beaten
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2                     scallions -- trimmed, and
                        cut into chiffonade

Place the rice in a saucepan and add the stock, water and salt.  Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce the heat, cover and cook slowly for 15 to 18 minutes.  It is important to cook the rice until dry.  Turn the rice out onto a large platter or baking sheet and let it air dry for up to an hour.  (Or place the rice on a baking sheet and dry it in the oven at 200 degrees for 30 minutes, stirring two or three times with a fork.)

Take a fork and thoroughly fluff the rice.

Heat a wok or large skillet until it is very hot, pour the oil in around the edges, and then stir fry all the vegetables for 30 seconds.  Add the rice and continue to stir fry for another 30 seconds.  Pour the egg in around the edges of the wok or skillet and quickly stir it into the rice and vegetables.

Stir in the soy sauce.

Prepare the scallion chiffonade immediately before serving.  Slice the scallions very thinly on the bias.

Turn the rice out onto a heated platter.  Sprinkle the scallion chiffonade over the rice.  Serve with chopsticks.

This recipe yields 2 to 4 servings.

Comments:  This is a very versatile dish.  It's a great accompaniment for meat, fish or poultry dishes.  Don't confine yourself to the vegetables listed here.  Use any fresh vegetables in season.  As a variation you can add leftover duck, lamb, pork or chicken to the vegetables and make an entrÈe.

Wine Recommendation:  Bonny Doonís Pacific Rim Dry Riesling is a wonderful dry but fruity, inexpensive wine that is perfect for this rice dish.  You might also like to try a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc like Babich or the amazing Cloudy Bay.

                Veal Loin With Sicilian Blood Orange Sauce

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     veal loin with flank - (abt 6 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  mild-flavored oil, -- such as
                        almond or safflower
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  6                     blood oranges
  2                     lemons
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  port
  2               cups  brown veal stock
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter -- cut small pieces

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Bone the loin, removing all the fat and sinew, and reserve them.  Season the loin with salt and pepper.

Place fat and trimmings in the bottom of a roasting pan and set the loin on top.  Roast for 45 minutes.  The roast should still be pink inside, not well done.  Transfer it to a warm platter.

While the meat is roasting, peel the skins of the oranges and lemons, and cut into julienne.  Place in a small saucepan with the sugar and enough water to cover.  Boil until the sugar begins to caramelize.  Pour the julienne into a strainer and rinse briefly under water.  Set aside.

Squeeze the juice from the oranges.  Remove fat and trimmings from the roasting pan and pour off any fat that has accumulated.  Deglaze with the port and add the veal stock and orange juice.  Simmer 15 minutes, strain, and reduce until only 1 cup remains.  Whisk in the butter, one piece at a time, to slightly thicken the sauce.  Reserve and keep warm.

Place a slice of the roast on a warm plate.  Nap with sauce and sprinkle with the julienne of orange and lemon peels.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This dish has a wonderful fruity flavor.  The blood oranges are tart yet still sweet, the port and veal stock have deep rich flavors, a perfect balance.  Freshly toasted and cracked black pepper is a must.  The julienne of fruit offers a fresh flavor that your guests will surely note.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This simple Asian dish makes a great accompaniment for any meat, poultry or fish dish.  Add cooked chicken, duck or lobster for a delicious main course.

              Watercress Salad With Barbecued Chicken Breast

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MUSTARD VINAIGRETTE ===
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh tarragon
  1         tablespoon  sherry wine vinegar
                        = (or red wine vinegar)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  1                cup  almond or extra-virgin olive oil
                        = (or a mixture of both)
                        === SALAD ===
  6              small  boneless skin-on chicken breast halves
  15                    garlic cloves
     1/4           cup  fresh Italian parsley leaves
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground white pepper -- to taste
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3            bunches  watercress -- stems trimmed
     1/2         pound  mushrooms, such as cremini,
                        shiitake, or oyster

Prepare the vinaigrette:  Combine the mustard, tarragon, vinegar, salt and pepper in a small bowl.  Slowly whisk in the oil.  Correct the seasonings, including the mustard and vinegar, and set aside.

Preheat grill or a barbecue.

Blanch garlic cloves in boiling water for 1 minute.  Drain, and slice the garlic thinly.  Combine the garlic with the parsley and spread it underneath the skin of the chicken.  Season the chicken with freshly ground pepper and salt, then brush it with olive oil.

Place the chicken, skin-side down, on the grill and cook it for about 8 to 10 minutes on each side.

Wash and dry the watercress and remove the tough stems.  In a big bowl toss the watercress with enough vinaigrette to coat it lightly.

Heat a large skillet and add 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Add the mushrooms and sautÈ over high heat about 4 minutes and season with salt and pepper.

Divide the watercress among 6 salad plates.  Arrange the mushrooms around it.  Cut each chicken breast on the diagonal into 6 slices and arrange the slices over each plate of watercress.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  This is an ideal luncheon dish for spring or summer.  The flavors are fresh.  The sweet whisper of garlic and parsley in the cooked chicken.  The peppery watercress and the earthy flavor of the mushrooms.  It's perfect for sunny days.

Wine Recommendation:  Look at the rosÈ selection in your local wine merchant and see if there's anything from Provence.  Or turn to Bonny Doon and their Vin Gris, or perhaps a Californian White Zinfindel.  There are many good ones and they provide a surprising counterpoint to this salad.

                  Wienerschnitzel With Warm Potato Salad

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Veal


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === POTATO MARINADE ===
  1                cup  Champagne vinegar
     1/4           cup  peanut oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1              small  yellow onion -- cut 1/4" dice
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh thyme leaves
                        === FINGERLING POTATOES ===
  1              pound  fingerling potatoes -- washed
  3                     garlic cloves
  3             sprigs  fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
                        === VEAL WIENERSCHNITZEL ===
  4                     veal scaloppini - (8 oz ea)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Flour -- for dusting
  2                     eggs -- beaten with
  2        tablespoons  water -- for egg wash
                        Panko -- processed into fine
                        crumbs
                        = (or fresh dried white breadcrumbs)
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
                        Deep-fried parsley leaves -- for garnish
                        Lemon sections -- for garnish
                        Fresh minced parsley -- for garnish

Prepare the marinade.  In a bowl, combine all the ingredients.  Whisk until well blended.  Set aside.

In a large saucepan, combine the potatoes, garlic, thyme and salt.  Cover with enough water and bring to a boil.  Lower to a simmer and cook about 8 minutes, or until just done.  (Do not overcook).  Strain and allow to cool at room temperature.  Slice into 1/4-inch-thick round slices.  Add to the reserved marinade for at least 20 minutes before serving.

Preheat oil to 375 degrees in a heavy, deep saucepan.

To prepare Wienerschnitzel:  Season the veal scaloppini with salt and pepper.  Dredge in flour.  Dip in egg wash.  Coat with panko or breadcrumbs.  Score the coated scaloppini with four shallow knife cuts in a cross-hatch pattern to help prevent curling while cooking.  Deep fry about 3 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.  Transfer to paper towels to drain.

Place one Wienerschnitzel on each of four dinner plates.  Garnish with fried parsley leaves and lemon sections.  In a sautÈ pan over high heat, warm the marinated potatoes for about 30 seconds.  Divide onto the four prepared plates.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  This is a recipe from my childhood, an Austrian classic.  It's one of the most popular dishes at Spago where we serve it with mache, frisÈe, balsamic vinegar and pumpkinseed oil.  But for me, it's perfect with just a fingerling potato salad.

Wine recommendation:  If you've never tried an Austrian wine then this dish gives you a good place to start.  I like Austrian white wines with my Wienerschnitzel so you may want to look for names like Knoll, Prager and Tement.  The Rieslings are fruity with good body and surprisingly dry.  The Chardonnays and Sauvignon Blancs are also very good.  None are expensive so it's an affordable experiment and who knows what you might find!

                       Wolfgang Puck's Grilled Tuna

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish (Ocean)                    Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  1              small  eggplant -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  1                     tomato -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  plus 1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil
                        = (or 1 1/4 tspns dried, crushed)
  1                cup  cooked corn kernels
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1 1/2    tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  2             pieces  fresh tuna, 1" thick -- abt 1 1/4 lbs
                        Fresh mint leaves -- for garnish

Brush both sides of the onion and eggplant slices with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.  SautÈ in a large non-stick sautÈ pan or grill for 3 minutes on each side.  If using a sautÈ pan, you may have to do this in several batches.

Chop the onion and eggplant and toss together with the tomato in a medium mixing bowl.  Add the garlic, one tablespoon of fresh basil, corn, and salt and pepper to taste.  Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil and the vinegar and toss to combine.  Set aside.

Brush the tuna with the remaining olive oil and season with freshly ground pepper and the remaining basil.  SautÈ in a large sautÈ pan over high heat for 2 to 4 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fish and the degree of doneness you prefer.  Slice the tuna in 1/2-inch-thick slices.

Arrange the vegetables in the center of each plate and top with the tuna slices fanned out.  Garnish with fresh mint.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Sauces


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  rice wine vinegar -- see * Note
  1                cup  honey
     3/4           cup  soy sauce
     3/4           cup  mirin -- see * Note
  2                     scallions -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  minced garlic
  1           teaspoon  finely-chopped fresh ginger
     3/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes

* Note:  Rice wine vinegar and mirin can be purchased in markets that carry Asian products.

In a 4-cup enamel or stainless steel saucepan, combine all the ingredients and cook, over medium-high heat until syrupy, 50 to 60 minutes.  Strain into a clean container and cool.

Refrigerate, covered, and use as needed.

This recipe yields about 1 1/3 cups.

Comments:  Not only do we use this sauce with our spareribs at Chinois, but we stir a little into many of our dishes for additional flavor and color.  It's particularly good with "Stir-Fried Chicken With Cashews And Pine Nuts" (see recipe).

                    Wolfgang's Bacon-Wrapped Meat Loaf

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Main Dish                       Meatloaf


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- diced
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- finely chopped
  3              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh oregano
  1 1/2      teaspoons  minced fresh thyme
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pound  lean ground pork
  1              pound  lean ground beef
  1              pound  ground veal
  1                     egg -- lightly beaten
     3/4         pound  sliced bacon - (13 slices)

In a large skillet over medium high heat, heat the olive oil.  SautÈ the onions until translucent, about 8 minutes.  Add the mushrooms and garlic and cook over medium high heat for 3 or 5 minutes.  Add the cream, oregano, thyme, salt and pepper.  Bring mixture to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes or until vegetables are tender.  Cool vegetable mixture.

In large bowl, combine the beef, pork, veal and vegetable mixture.  Stir in the egg.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Place a 9- by 5- by 2 1/2-inch loaf pan with the short side facing you.  Take bacon slices and place them across the pan, slightly overlapping, to line the bottom and sides.  Continue with the meat mixture, patting down to level.  Fold the ends of the bacon strips up and over the ground meat mixture.

Place the loaf pan in a larger baking or roasting pan and fill the larger pan with boiling water halfway up the sides of the loaf pan.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 1 hour.  Remove the foil and continue to bake 30 minutes or until an instant read thermometer registers 165 degrees.

Remove the meatloaf from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes.  Carefully pour the juices out of the pan.  Cut into 8 slices.

Serve with pan juices and "Garlic Mashed Potatoes" or Creamy "Mashed Potatoes With Caramelized Onions" (see recipes).

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  This is one of the most popular dishes in my CafÈs, probably because it reminds people of home cooking and their grandmothers!  The bacon helps keep the meatloaf moist, a key concern and one of the reasons that I always cook this dish in a water bath.

Wine Recommendation:  I like to drink one of my favorite reds with this dish, a wine that's as straight-forward and satisfying as the dish itself.  Clos du Bois or Geyser Peak's Cabernet Sauvignon would be my choices, but you might have your own favorite.

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Main Dish


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4               cups  thinly-sliced onion
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1         tablespoon  caraway seeds -- toasted, ground
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sweet paprika
  1           teaspoon  spicy paprika
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh marjoram leaves
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme leaves
  1                     bay leaf
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  4               cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
  2 1/2         pounds  beef shank -- cut into 2" cubes
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

In a large sautÈ pan, heat the olive oil and sautÈ the onions and sugar until caramelized.  Add the garlic and caraway seed.  Cook another minute.

Add the sweet and sharp paprika, marjoram, thyme and bay leaf.  SautÈ another minute, until fragrant.

Add the tomato paste.  Deglaze with the vinegar and the stock and add the pieces of beef shank, salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer and cook until very tender, about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Serve with "Spaetzle" (see recipe) on the side.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Goulash, of course, comes from Hungary and is probably the Hungarians' most famous dish.  The most important ingredient is the paprika, which gives it an almost roasted taste, and of course a little spiciness.  And the key to success is cooking it slowly, at a gentle simmer.  But it's really easy, so enjoy!  We always serve it with spaetzle, those wonderful little dumplings from Austria.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTRY ===
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  snipped chives
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter -- chilled, and
                        cut into small pieces
  1                cup  shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
  2                     egg yolks
  5        tablespoons  heavy cream - (to 6)
                        === CHICKEN AND VEGETABLES ===
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cut 1" pieces
  2             medium  carrots -- cut 1/2" slices
  1                     celery stalk -- cut 1/2" slices
     1/2         pound  crimini or shiitake mushrooms -- sliced
  1            package  frozen pearl onions - (10 oz) -- thawed
     3/4           cup  frozen petite peas -- thawed
                        === SAUCE ===
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  Chicken Stock -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  minced fresh thyme
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === EGG WASH ===
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water

Prepare the pastry:  Place the flour and chives in a bowl.  Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, work in the butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add the cheese and work in until just blend.  In a small bowl, whisk together the yolks and 5 tablespoons of the cream.  Sprinkle the yolk mixture over the pastry dough, a little at a time, stirring with a fork until pastry comes together.  Add remaining cream if necessary.  Knead lightly until just combined.  Press pastry into a circle.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.

Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add the butter and vegetable oil.  SautÈ the chicken for 2 to 3 minutes, until lightly browned but not cooked through.  With slotted spoon, remove chicken to bowl.

In the same pan over medium-high heat sautÈ the carrots, celery and mushrooms 5 minutes.  With slotted spoon, remove vegetables to another bowl.  Stir thawed pearl onions and peas into vegetables.

Prepare the sauce:  In the same pan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the flour and whisk until the mixture is bubbling and smooth, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and gradually whisk in stock, cream, and thyme.  Return skillet to heat, bring to a simmer, stirring constantly.  Cook for 2 minutes until sauce has thickened and is smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  Stir in reserved chicken and vegetables.  Set aside to cool for about 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Spoon cooled chicken and vegetable mixture into a 10-inch deep-dish pie plate.  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry into a circle 11-inches in diameter.  Place pastry on top of chicken mixture.  Trim pastry edge, fold overhang under and press gently all around baking dish to make a decorative edge.  Reroll any trimmings and cut out to make a decorative design for top of pie.  Brush pastry with beaten eggwash.  Using a knife, cut 3 slits in center of pie.

Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until pastry is golden brown, chicken and vegetables are tender and filling is heated through.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  One of the oldest truly American dishes, I'm a great fan of Chicken Pot Pies, especially in the winter when even Californian nights get cold.  This is a simple and relatively easy to prepare recipe.  You can always make the filling and the pastry the day before you need it, to save a little time.  But remember to heat the filling before topping it with the pastry crust.

Wine Recommendation:  If you're eating Chicken Pot Pie on a winter's evening then try serving a slightly chilled red wine, a Syrah, Zinfandel or Californian Rhone-style wine like the wonderfully affordable wines of Zaca Mesa in Santa Barbara.  If you're a stickler for tradition then by all means serve a white wine, but try and select something with enough body to stand up to the pie like a big Chardonnay.

                  Wolfgang's Famous Asian Chicken Salad

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Poultry
                Salads/Dressings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHINESE MUSTARD VINAIGRETTE ===
  2          teaspoons  dry Chinese or English (Coleman's) mustard
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  light sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil - (to 3)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === CHICKEN SALAD ===
  1                     chicken - (abt 3 lbs) -- cavity filled with
                        finely-diced celery, carrot, onion,
                        garlic, bay leaf, thyme, salt and pepper
  2             ounces  unsalted butter -- melted
  2              small  Napa cabbage heads - (or 1 medium)
  1                cup  romaine lettuce in 1/4" julienne strips
  10                    snow peas -- cut 1/4" julienne
                        strips
  1         tablespoon  sesame seeds -- toasted

Prepare the vinaigrette.  Place all the vinaigrette ingredients, except peanut oil, in a blender and blend until smooth.  Add peanut oil slowly and correct the seasonings.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Place the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan and baste it with some of the butter.  Roast for about 1 1/2 hours, or until just done.  (The juices should run clear.)  Baste every 15 or 20 minutes with the butter and the drippings.

Select 4 to 8 nice looking leaves from the Napa cabbage and reserve them.  Slice the remaining cabbage into 1/4-inch julienne strips.

Shred the meat from the breasts and thighs of the chicken. (Use the remaining meat and the carcass for Chicken Stock.  See separate recipe.)

Combine the chicken, cabbage, romaine and snow peas in a bowl and toss with enough vinaigrette to coat the salad nicely.

Arrange the reserved Napa cabbage leaves around the edge of a large serving plate.  Mound the salad in the center and sprinkle it with the sesame seeds.

This recipe yields 4 appetizer or 2 entrÈe salads.

Comments: This salad has been one of our most popular dishes at Chinois since we opened.  It makes a perfect lunch salad or an appetizer with dinner.  The dressing is one of my favorites and you'll find it useful with any Asian-inspired dish.

Wine Recommendation:  If you haven't tried Japanese rice wine or sake then this is the perfect time to ask your wine merchant for a recommendation.  Serve it either hot or cold in tiny Japanese sake cups.

                        pear tomatoes
  1                     ripe avocado -- peeled, seeded,
                        and cut into 1/2" dice
     1/2           cup  minced fresh cilantro leaves
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === GARNISH ===
  12             large  shrimp -- peeled, deveined,
                        butterflied, poached, and chilled

  6                     lime wedges - (to 8)

Prepare Gazpacho:  In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Transfer to a food processor, pulse until almost purÈed, leaving a little texture.  Season with salt and pepper.  Return to bowl, cover, and refrigerate another hour before serving.

Prepare topping mixture:  In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients until well blended.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate until needed.

Ladle 1 1/2 cups of gazpacho into chilled soup plates.  Spoon 1/4 cup of the topping mixture onto center of soup, top with 2 shrimp, and garnish with a sprig of cilantro.  Place a wedge of lime on the rim of the plate.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  If you don't want to serve a salad, this is the perfect first course on a warm summer evening, when tomatoes are bursting with flavor.  It requires no cooking and can be made the day before it is needed.  If the texture is too thick for your taste, stir in a little tomato juice.

Prepare topping mixture:  In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients until well blended.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover and refrigerate until needed.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Ladle 1 1/2 cups of gazpacho into chilled soup plates.  Spoon 1/4 cup of the topping mixture onto center of soup, top with 2 shrimp, and garnish with a sprig of cilantro.  Place a wedge of lime on the rim of the plate.

Comments:  If you don&apos;t want to serve a salad, this is the perfect first course on a warm summer evening, when tomatoes are bursting with flavor.  It requires no cooking and can be made the day before it is needed.  If the texture is too thick for your taste, stir in a little tomato juice.

Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Salads/Dressings                Seafood


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  green beans -- blanched
     3/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- divided
                        Kosher salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Fresh thyme leaves -- minced
  1              large  onion -- peeled, and
                        cut into 1/4" rings
  2               cups  roasted bell peppers in 1/4" strips
  1                cup  NiÁoise Salad Dressing -- (see recipe)
     3/4         pound  small new potatoes -- boiled
  2               cups  mixed red and yellow cherry tomatoes -- halved
  4             slices  French bread, preferably sourdough
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled
  4        tablespoons  herbed goat cheese
  4          teaspoons  Black And Green Olive Tapenade -- (see recipe)
  2                     twelve-ounce tuna steaks abt 1" thick -- seasoned with
                        freshly-cracked coriander seeds, cracked
                        black pepper, and kosher salt to taste
  8               cups  mixed baby lettuces -- washed, dried
     1/2           cup  pitted NiÁoise olives
  2                     hard-boiled eggs -- peeled, quartered
  8                     anchovy fillets

Season the blanched beans with 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, pepper and thyme to taste.  Reserve in a bowl.

In a small saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Saute the onions until caramelized, about 10 minutes, stirring constantly.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Reserve in a bowl.

In a small bowl, toss together the roasted pepper strips and 1/4 cup NiÁoise Salad Dressing.  Reserve.

Cut the potatoes into 1/4-inch round slices.  Place in a small bowl, add 1/4 cup NiÁoise Salad Dressing and toss until well blended.  Reserve.

In a small bowl, toss together the tomatoes and 1/4 cup NiÁoise Salad Dressing.  Reserve.

To make Crostini:  Arrange the bread slices in a baking tray.  Brush with olive oil and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for six to eight minutes.  Allow to cool, then rub with garlic clove.  For each of the crostini, spread 1 tablespoon herbed goat cheese and top with 1 teaspoon Black And Green Olive Tapenade.

Heat a charcoal or gas grill until very hot.  Brush the tuna fillets with olive oil and grill for 2 to 3 minutes each side searing the outside but keeping the centers rare.  Remove from heat and allow to rest before slicing each tuna fillet into 6 slices.

In a large mixing bowl, toss together the mixed baby lettuces with 1/4 cup NiÁoise Salad Dressing.

Divide the green beans, onion, bell peppers, potatoes, tomatoes and olives into 4 portions and arrange in a dramatic fan around the rim of each plate.  Then arrange the eggs and finally the anchovies.  Mound a quarter of the lettuce in the center of each plate.  Arrange tuna slices around the sides of the salad and finish the salad by placing a crostini on top.  Be as creative as you can!

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  There are as many recipes for Nicoise salad as there are restaurants in the South of France.  I always use the best tuna, so it can be grilled rare, and I put both herbed goat cheese and tapenade on the crostini to remind me of my days in Provence.

Wine Recommendation:  In France they'd drink a cold Provencal red, a Bandol or Cote de Provence with a Salad Nicoise.  But if you haven't got these wines in your cellar look to a Californian Zinfandel or Niebaum-Coppola's Sangenovese.

Recipe By     :Wolfgang Puck
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
     1/4           cup  garlic cloves
  1              piece  fresh ginger - (1" long)
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1 1/2         pounds  lean ground pork
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped cilantro leaves
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped green onions
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped dried fruits
                        = (apricots, cherries or raisins)
     1/4           cup  oyster sauce
  1         tablespoon  chili paste
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pinch  sugar
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
                        Round wonton wrappers
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- for eggwash
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
                        === DIPPING SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  rice wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  minced scallions or green onions
  1              large  pinch sugar

In a blender, combine garlic and ginger. Turn on machine and slowly pour the peanut oil and process to a puree.  Transfer to a bowl.  Add the remaining ingredients.  Mix together thoroughly and refrigerate, covered, for 1 hour.

To make the potstickers, separate the wonton wrappers.  Brush edges with eggwash.  Place a generous spoonful of the filling and fold the edges, making folds in the front side, starting from the center, going down to each end to create a half moon shape.  Continue until you have used up the filling.  Refrigerate until ready to cook.

To cook the potstickers, cook in small batches in boiling, salted water.  Drain.  Heat a non stick skillet, add peanut oil and sear until golden-brown on the bottom.  Remove and serve with dipping sauce.

To make the Dipping Sauce, combine all ingredients for the dipping sauce and whisk together.

Serve on a bed of lettuce, with the dipping sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 100 to 120 pot stickers.

Comments:  I love the hustle and bustle of dim sum in a big Chinese restaurant.  So many choices, all just a few bites, all promising a different taste.  These small dumplings are favorites of mine and can either be steamed or prepared as pot stickers, a combination of boiling and sautÈeing.  Be sure to keep the meat over a bowl of ice at all times until you cook the potstickers.

Wine recommendation: Fresh, young, aromatic wines are the partners I prefer for Asian appetizers.  I look for Sauvignon Blancs (or FumÈ Blancs as theyíre often called in California) like Robert Mondaviís or Chateau St. Jean, or Goldwater or Villa Maria from New Zealand.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Egg/Spring Rolls


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === AROMATICS ===
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  chopped green onions
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
     1/2           cup  peanut oil
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  freshly-ground black pepper
  1              pinch  sugar
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  onions -- julienned
  1             medium  carrot -- julienned
  4             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- stems discarded,
                        sliced into julienne
  1 1/2           cups  julienned red bell pepper
  2               cups  julienned green cabbage
  3        tablespoons  peanut oil -- for stir-frying
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4             ounces  glass noodles -- soaked in water
                        for 10 minutes, chopped smaller strands
     1/4           cup  mushroom soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  chili paste
  1         tablespoon  Asian sesame oil
     1/2           cup  chopped cilantro
                        === SPRING ROLLS ===
  1            package  wonton wrappers
  1                     egg -- beaten with
  1         tablespoon  water -- and also
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch -- for eggwash
                        Peanut oil -- for deep-frying
                        Hot Chinese Mustard Sauce -- (see recipe)

Prepare the aromatic mixture:  In a food processor, combine the ginger, garlic, green onions and red pepper flakes.  Turn on machine, slowly add oil and process mixture to a puree.  Cook mixture in a small saucepan over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes.  Season with salt, pepper and sugar.  Set aside.

Prepare the filling:  In a wok or heavy skillet, stir fry mushrooms in peanut oil for 30  seconds, then add remaining vegetables and cook for 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper.  Drain and transfer to a mixing bowl.  Stir in noodle, mushroom soy sauce, chili paste, sesame oil, and cilantro.  Add aromatics mixture.  Season with salt and pepper.  Set aside to cool completely.  When ready to form the spring rolls, squeeze out all the excess liquid.

To make the spring rolls, place about 1/4 cup of prepared filling per wonton wrapper.  Place filling as per directions alongside.  Roll the wrapper, tuck ends in, and complete as if wrapping a parcel.  Seal edges with the eggwash.  Repeat the process until all filling is used.

In a heavy deep saucepan, heat oil to 350 degrees and deep fry spring rolls, 3 or 4 at a time until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.

Trim off the ends and slice diagonally.  Drizzle top with Hot Chinese Mustard Sauce. (Very easy to make -- see separate recipe).  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 20 to 24 rolls.

Comments:  Forget about the greasy, tasteless spring rolls you once tasted from the take out restaurant.  These are wonderful, crisp, fresh-tasting morsels that look a lot more complicated to make than they really are.  I find them a lot of fun to put together and people are often amazed that you are able to master an alien cuisine!

Wine Recommendation:  Fresh, young, aromatic wines are the partners I prefer for Asian appetizers.  I look for Sauvignon Blancs (or FumÈ Blancs as theyíre often called in California) like Robert Mondaviís or Goldwater from New Zealand.

Prepare the aromatic mixture:  In a food processor, combine the ginger, garlic, green onions and red pepper flakes.  Turn on machine, slowly add oil and process mixture to a puree.  Cook mixture in a small saucepan over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes.  Season with salt, pepper and sugar.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Prepare the filling:  In a wok or heavy skillet, stir fry mushrooms in peanut oil for 30  seconds, then add remaining vegetables and cook for 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper.  Drain and transfer to a mixing bowl.  Stir in noodle, mushroom soy sauce, chili paste, sesame oil, and cilantro.  Add aromatics mixture.  Season with salt and pepper.  Set aside to cool completely.  When ready to form the spring rolls, squeeze out all the excess liquid.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the spring rolls, place about 1/4 cup of prepared filling per wonton wrapper.  Place filling as per directions alongside.  Roll the wrapper, tuck ends in, and complete as if wrapping a parcel.  Seal edges with the eggwash.  Repeat the process until all filling is used.

<DirT>
In a heavy deep saucepan, heat oil to 350 degrees and deep fry spring rolls, 3 or 4 at a time until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Trim off the ends and slice diagonally.  Drizzle top with Hot Chinese Mustard Sauce. (Very easy to make -- see separate recipe).  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 20 to 24 rolls.

Comments:  Forget about the greasy, tasteless spring rolls you once tasted from the take out restaurant.  These are wonderful, crisp, fresh-tasting morsels that look a lot more complicated to make than they really are.  I find them a lot of fun to put together and people are often amazed that you are able to master an alien cuisine!

Wine Recommendation:  Fresh, young, aromatic wines are the partners I prefer for Asian appetizers.  I look for Sauvignon Blancs (or FumÈ Blancs as theyíre often called in California) like Robert Mondaviís or Goldwater from New Zealand.
